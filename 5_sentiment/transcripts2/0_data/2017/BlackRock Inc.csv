It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
The differentiation and strength of BlackRock's diverse global investment in technology platform allowed us continue to invest for growth during 2016, despite market volatility and macro-political uncertainty during the year. We saw strong results in our iShares' institutional and technology businesses that remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. 
Against a challenging backdrop for the asset management industry, BlackRock, once again, executed on each components of our framework for shareholder value creation. BlackRock generated $202 billion of total net inflows in 2016, the strongest close in our history, including nearly $100 billion in the fourth quarter. We expanded our full year operating margin by 80 basis points to 43.7%. 
Finally, after investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders during the year. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $5.14, both up 8% from a year ago. 
Full year operating income of $4.7 billion was flat versus a year ago, while earnings per share of $19.29 was down 2%, reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate in 2016. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $6 billion of net investment gains. Recall that nonoperating results in last year's fourth quarter included a $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.6%, reflecting the impact of several nonrecurring items compared to a rate of 30% a year ago. We continue to estimate the 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and potential tax reform. 
In an environment where growth in the asset management industry has been elusive, BlackRock's diverse global platform is thriving, delivering outcomes for our clients and differentiated organic growth for our shareholders. BlackRock's fourth quarter total net inflows of $98 billion included $88 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%; $18 billion of flows into our cash management business; and $7 billion of advisory outflows related to crisis Europe portfolio liquidation assignments. 
For the full year 2016, BlackRock generated record total net inflows of $202 billion, including long-term net inflows of $181 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic growth rate. 
Fourth quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher-average AUM, but offset by the impact of divergent beta, FX and mixed shift. 
For the full year, base fees were effectively flat. On a constant currency basis, base fees were up 3% versus last year's fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2016. 
Sequentially, base fees were down 2% as the negative impact of fixed income beta, divergent equity beta and continued dollar appreciation more than offset organic fee growth in the period. 
While we delivered robust organic asset growth during the year, our blended fee rate has been impacted by a number of factors that we have repeatedly discussed with you, including divergent equity beta and dollar appreciation as well as recent client preferences for lower risk asset classes and index over active strategies. However, while these headwinds are pervasive in our industry, our broad-based, solutions-focused investment platform is built to meet client preferences in any environment, whether risk on or risk off. And we remain confident that BlackRock can consistently grow client assets and base fees, both of which ended 2016 at record highs. 
Fourth quarter performance fees of $129 million were driven by our single-strategy hedge fund and loan-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $295 million decreased 52% from 2015, reflecting a challenging year for the hedge fund industry. 
BlackRock Solutions' fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was up 15% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Full year Aladdin revenue of $594 million, which represented 83% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by a number of sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2016. 
Aladdin is coming off a record year in terms of new client revenue and continues to benefit from strong market demand for both institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries. We have seen particularly high levels of demand for our newest product, Aladdin Risk for wealth management, in the current regulatory environment and are actively implementing for clients in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
Total expense declined 3% in 2016, reflecting lower compensation expense and continued G&A expense discipline. For the full year, compensation expense decreased $122 million or 3%, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees. 
Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full-year basis. 
Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $55 million year-over-year or 13%, reflecting lower marketing and promotional spend in the current quarter and $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the year-ago quarter. 
Sequentially, fourth quarter G&A expense increased $43 million, primarily reflected a planned uptick in the year-end marketing and promotional spend and higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense. 
Full year G&A expense of $1.3 billion was 6% below 2015 levels despite the impact of acquisitions on our run rate, reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment. Assuming stable markets, we would expect a modestly higher level of G&A spend in 2017. 
Despite an overall decline in 2016 revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we delivered 4% organic asset growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin to 43.7% for the year. 
While we remain committed to realizing the benefits of our scale for clients and shareholders alike, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We do remain keenly focused on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
During 2016, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we enter 2017, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. 
Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.50 per share, representing an increase of 9% over the prior level. Since instituting our dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its annual dividend per share at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 21%. 
We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of shares in 2016 and now have repurchased over 13 million shares during the last 4 years, resulting in a 13% unlevered compounded annual return for our shareholders. We remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders and anticipate a similar annual level of share repurchases in 2017. However, such amounts could vary based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price. 
In connection with this ongoing commitment, our board has authorized an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9 million shares, including 3 million shares which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2015. 
Our 2016 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Record full year total net inflows of $202 billion, including nearly $100 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter, were diversified across asset classes and benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. Globalized shares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. 
Fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $51 billion were driven by demand for U.S. market exposures, as equity markets rallied following the U.S. elections. Notwithstanding flat fourth quarter fixed income iShares flows, which were impacted by the significant move in long-term yields during the quarter, we continue to see an acceleration in the adoption of fixed income ETFs. 
Full year 2016 fixed income iShares inflows of $60 billion represented on organic growth rate of 24%. 
BlackRock's institutional franchise saw a record long term net inflows of $41 billion for the quarter and $51 billion for the year, positive across active and index strategies for both periods. Quarterly institutional active inflows of $6 billion were led by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives, as clients utilize BlackRock's broad range of investment strategies and customized solutions to achieve their investment goals. Institutional index inflows of $35 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by fixed income inflows of $26 billion, which reflected solutions-based LDI activity, primarily in Europe. 
We also ended 2016 with another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last 4 years, we've raised more than $22 billion of commitments for our fund of funds, real estate, infrastructure, opportunistic credit and all solution businesses and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw fourth quarter outflows of $2 billion and full year outflows of $11 billion, reflecting continued performance challenges in the active mutual fund industry as well as macro, political and regulatory uncertainty. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash business generated $18 billion and $29 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Investments we've made to expand the scale of our cash management offerings drove strong flows in 2016, and we are well positioned for additional demand and market share gains in the coming year. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of market volatility, divergent beta and significant currency movements, our diversified business model, once again, delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results that allowed us to continue investing for the future. We are committed to continuously evolving our platform as our clients' needs change, and believe our platform is well positioned, as it's ever been, to meet those needs and to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining our call. In a year dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our client's trust by delivering strong results",2212,"Thanks, Gary. Happy New Year to everyone. And good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining our call. 
In a year dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our client's trust by delivering strong results. BlackRock's fourth quarter and 2016 results reflect the benefits of continuously investing in our business to better serve our clients. We're building out our investment teams and resources. We're expanding our technology footprint. And we're evolving our risk management capabilities as we continue to anticipate change in the world, in our economies and, most importantly, in our industry. 
As a result, more and more investors are turning to BlackRock to design, to deliver investment solutions to help them achieve their long-term financial goals. 
2016 was a turbulent year for investors, whether institutions or individual investors, one that no one fully predicted. Global political events like Brexit, the U.S. political -- U.S. presidential election and the Italian referendum has forced many of our clients and also ourselves to rethink our assumptions and our perceptions of the world. Even with some political surprises, the global economy began to show signs of optimism throughout 2016. 
The U.S. equity markets surged to all-time highs, as expectations for fiscal stimulus, reflation and tax and regulatory reform has sparked investor optimism and enthusiasm. The Fed's decision to raise REITs in December and the signal of additional hikes in 2017 suggest that the long period of accommodative monetary policy in the U.S. may finally subside at a faster rate that many have had anticipated. However, uncertainty in the wave of populism, upending the political status quo, persists. And despite the rally in the U.S. for domestic equities since we've had our U.S. election, many of our investors have seen a very different performance in their other markets. As Gary suggested, we see negative fixed income markets. We see underperforming international equities and a very strong dollar, which means for the dollar-based investors with broad global asset allocation, such as pension funds, the fourth quarter was more challenging than the market perception. 
We don't know exactly how the next few years will unfold, but we do know that in a challenging and changing environment, investors will look to BlackRock more than ever before. And our responsibility that we feel for our clients has never been greater. 
Throughout our history, BlackRock has always been focused on thinking ahead of our clients and repositioning our firm in advance of those perceived changes. 
Our results this year in a difficult environment for asset managers reflect the benefits of our deeper relationships that we built with our clients worldwide in areas where we've invested in our business over time. As Gary said, BlackRock saw total net inflows of $202 billion for the full year 2016, including nearly $100 billion in our fourth quarter. 
We generated record annual institutional and iShares flow of $51 billion institutionally and $140 billion in iShares. We actually grew net assets in 15 countries greater than $1 billion. We added more than 53 products in retail and iShares that generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. I think those 2 statistics alone identify the breadth of our platform. 
In 2016, the BlackRock Investment Institute reached more clients, regulators and policymakers than ever before, providing a forum for deep, timely and relevant dialogue on all macro issues. The Institute hosted calls after Brexit and the U.S. election, each time reaching nearly 5,000 external participants. This type of engagement has created tremendous value for our clients and filled a deeper and more direct relationship with our clients. 
We acquired BGI and iShares franchise more than 6 years ago, when iShares had $385 billion in AUM. Since then, we invested in the future of ETFs, building the market, expanding its presence, building a fixed income presence, a global presence, building products in anticipation of change of demand, whether it's factors or smart beta, and launched innovative new products. We've grown our iShares' AUM now to $1.3 trillion as more clients than ever before are using ETFs for transparent, liquid and efficient exposures, and we will continue to invest very aggressively in the growth and evolution of this market. 
iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion in inflows for the full year, earning the #1 market share of global U.S.-European equities and fixed income ETF flows for 2016. ETFs are being used by a diversified, growing set of institutional and retail clients. We are experienced, as I've said in many of these conferences, that we're seeing more and more investors using ETFs actively, not just for a task of exposure, but using them actively to try to get exposures where those exposures will outperform. We believe that will continue to be a great, great growth area for these products. And importantly, the expansion, the diversification of the ETF ecosystem is creating a deeper, more dynamic market for ETF trading. It is also enhancing liquidity for all investors worldwide. 
In 2016, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. core franchise to deliver the highest quality product at the best value to our clients at a time when they needed it most. We received very positive feedback from our clients on this move, and iShares gathered $29 billion of flows in our global core products in this quarter alone. 
We also continue to invest in fixed income ETFs. BlackRock has long seen the value in fixed income ETFs and has invested for years in building this market, even as many of our industry questions this opportunity. 2016, the fixed income ETF industry reached the milestone, crossing $600 billion in assets, with BlackRock managing a large component of that. 
During heightened market movements after the U.S. election, trading volumes in the U.S. fixed income ETFs surged to the highest level of the year. Fixed income ETFs or iShares, once again, performed under stress, in line with what our clients expected when they bought iShares, offering investors substantial on exchange liquidity. 
Fixed income ETFs remain a strategic priority and a significant growth opportunity for BlackRock and our clients. 
Smart beta ETFs are another area of strategic investment for BlackRock, where we are the #1 player in AUM, growing at a 37% organic growth rate in 2016. 
We all know that in 2016, we saw retail investor shifting away from traditional active funds, with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry experiencing $280 billion of outflows, representing the industry's worst year on record. And we, at BlackRock, experienced some of the same headwinds across our traditional active mutual funds. But because the way we are positioned, because how we are trying to help our clients by having both passive and active, we're working with the clients as they navigate the need between active and passive. 
I believe investors are going to continue to rethink their approach to active management. They may now move more towards factor-based strategies. They may have asset allocation or portfolio construction, but I do believe we're going to continue to see a drive using ETFs for active returns. 
We have been purposefully investing in our platforms to provide our clients with a full spectrum of offerings and to enhance global -- to enhance alpha-generating active strategies. We ended the quarter with 88% of our taxable fixed income, 91% of our scientific active equity and 65% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. We are confident that our top-performing franchise like Asian equities and our unconstrained fixed income, which have proven to thrive in a rising rate environment, are well positioned for 2017. 
Factor-based investing helps bridge the gap between active and index, and has been an area of significant focus for BlackRock and our clients in 2016. BlackRock manages over $150 billion in factor-based strategies, including smart beta ETFs, and our factor-based AUM grew at an organic growth rate in 2016 of 17%. 
We have a responsibility to provide our clients with the ability to focus on environmental and social issues, while simultaneously generating strong financial returns. We launched BlackRock's sustainable investing platform a year ago and has since built a range of equity and fixed income strategies that target positive environmental and social impact. 
We have frequently advocated for the benefits of an infrastructure investing. And within the U.S. alone, markets are anticipating up to $1 trillion of domestic infrastructure investments over the next few years. And we all know we desperately need those investments. BlackRock has built our infrastructure and brought our real estate platforms, both organically and inorganically over time. And we currently manage $29 billion of real asset AUM. We invested in our global cash management business in anticipation of regulatory reform in a rising rate environment. BlackRock is now positioned as a scale player with the broadest range of solutions. At a time when we anticipated an uptick in demand, we saw $18 billion of inflows in their fourth quarter alone. And now we have a cash management business that's over $400 billion. 
Over the past year, we have spoken to the increasing depth and quality of the solution orientation and solution-oriented conversations that BlackRock is having or other institutional clients in face of this global uncertainty. Even as these clients pause to assess the changing investment landscape, growth in 2016 was driven in particularly by our financial institution business, as insurance clients look to BlackRock for a highly customized portfolio. Our institutional business saw record fourth quarter and full year net inflows across both active and passive. We have the right pieces on our platform, but the key to designing and delivering a robust solution that targets specific outcomes for our clients is technology, which has always been at BlackRock's core. We see strong and growing demand for BlackRock's technology offerings. More and more asset managers, asset owners, banks, wealth managers, insurance companies are valuing the differentiating ability of our Aladdin platform and other technology offerings at BlackRock to help them achieve their goals. We are constantly enhancing our existing technology as well as coming up with new ways to use Aladdin to serve our clients. 
In 2016, we launched our Aladdin Risk for wealth platform, which empowers wealth managers' home offices to better understand the risk. We also introduced the Aladdin portfolio builder, which provides financial advisers with highly intuitive portfolio construction tools. We continue to see robust client interest in future adviser and iRetire offerings. We also recently announced a minority investment in partnership with iCapital, the leading technology-enabled illiquid alternative distribution platform for retail investors. 
In addition to technology, our people enable us to differentiate ourselves for our clients. Every year, together with our Board of Directors, we take a fresh look at our organization, which includes developing talent and positioning our leaders in a role that can broaden their experiences and maximize their potential for BlackRock and our clients. 
2016, we unified our Active Equity platform. We unified our beta platform, and we globalized our fixed income platform, all of which will help us benefit from the potential -- full potential of our global investment scale. At the same time, to create a more tailored client experience in each geography where we operate, we strengthened our regional management of our clients and marketing activities in line with our commitment to be global with a local identity and a local footprint. It is a quality and dedication of our teams across the globe that position us well for 2017. 
There are reasons that we afford such trusting and trusted relationships with our clients and why our clients turn to BlackRock to solve the biggest financial challenges. I am really proud of the depth of the talent of the firm and the leadership we have today. We have never had a more talented group of men and women than we have today, and we have the finest leadership in the history of the firm today. BlackRock has been adapted, repositioning our investment platform and technology capabilities and advance some change. I promise you we will continue to be in front of those needs, and we'll continue to change with the needs of our clients. 
And as paradigms shift, we will have an even greater responsibility to help our clients navigate the markets and plans for their retirement. We have a responsibility to continue to invest in broadening and deepening our investment platform. We have a responsibility to be a thought and opinion leader worldwide, globally and locally to every one of our clients. And throughout BlackRock's history, we have demonstrated the ability to invest in a business for growth like no other firm, while expanding our margins, raising our dividend rates and prudently returning capital to our shareholders. 
As we enter 2017, we will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future, to grow our technology footprint, to expand our investment capabilities and to further enhance our talent level, all to meet our daily responsibility to every client. Whether that client has awarded us $1,000 or if that client awarded us $10 billion, we have a responsibility to every client, and we are building a firm to meet those responsibilities every day. 
With that, let me open up for questions."

We saw dollar appreciation, primarily versus the euro and the pound roughly 4% on the euro, 16% against the pound during the year, and that obviously relative to the stock of our business increases the relative weighting of our dollar denominated assets, which tend to have lower fees than our non-U.S. dollar denominated product. In many cases, you're seeing a little bit of same phenomenon in terms of equity beta. We talked about divergent equity beta, but this year in particular, you saw various higher fee international markets, whether it be Europe, Asia X or Japan underperforming domestic U.S. markets. And as with FX, that also increases the relative weighting of our lower fee dollar denominated assets under management. We saw mixed shift. When we talk about mixed shift, we really talk about that as a client preference issue. So during 2016, we saw clients favoring index overactive. We saw clients favoring fixed income over equity and multi-asset and even within our cash business, we saw huge preference for government over prime funds. And in each of those instances, you're seeing changes in fee rates from what was traditionally higher fee product to at least in this year lower fee product. And then finally, we actually took some of our own action in terms of price reductions with certain iShares, core and fixed income that was later in the year. But again, with that what I would call investment, we've been very clear that we think that would be accretive to shareholder value over time. And I think as you've heard, we've had strong progress to date in terms of our core performance so far. So in each of these cases, all of these items are going to impact the rates over time. But I think the key issue is, those set of circumstances, whether they're market-driven or client-driven will also change over time. And I think the key issue for BlackRock is that we have a broad-based enough platform to be able to meet client preferences in any market than to basically deliver solutions-based and outcomes to them that basically makes sense. So that's the fee rate piece of it. In terms of margins, I think what I would say as we think about margins, I'll give the standard statement that we don't manage to a margin target, I think you've all heard that long enough. But I think that in a year where we obviously saw a difference, i.e. 4% asset growth versus less organic base fee growth, I think we were able to demonstrate that we can basically manage the business in that environment and in fact, notwithstanding an overall decline in our revenues, which was fundamentally driven by performance fees, we were still able to deliver not only 80 basis points of margin improvement, but record flows during the year. So again, that interplay between revenue growth and margin. I think we're pretty well-established in terms of our ability to operate in most environments."

And without lowering the fees, we might not be included in some of the models that a lot of the clients are now using and distribution centers are using. But what's important to us is not only performance as one of the levers that we look to go out and use to get clients to buy our products, but also our competitive position and where we stand in price. And most of our mutual funds have boards that we also have to respond to as well. So since we made the changes, 4 of our plans have been upgraded by Morningstar, 3 of the government funds and 1 of the high yield funds, and they've all now become middle rated. And so that's important to us so that they are included in a lot of what our distribution forces can tell and how their evaluated. So beyond performance, we also want to strive to be in at least the top quartile of expenses and of course, in a very low rate environment, that also helps to drive performance. So the response has been very good by those that evaluate us, the response has been good by the distribution centers and the response has been shown in creating and getting more assets. So over time, we're going to continue to be responsive to the competitive environment to make sure that we're included in the sales. We expect that sales will continue."

And I think that one is one that we tried to manage appropriately in a year where we're seeing lots of clients delay their investment allocation decisions with a lot of volatility. We'll be obviously looking at that pretty carefully in the context of the current environment as we enter this year. We also, as you probably noticed, just also hired a new Chief Marketing Officer, Frank Cooper, who will be taking his own look at our marketing and our spending strategy that will clearly be taking a careful look at. There's also some other items that I think you have to be wary of where FX gets in the way and also G&A impacts training, recruiting, it has a bunch of things that are obviously tied to broader growth objectives as we grow the company. We kept our headcount pretty flat last year even after our first quarter reduction that we talked about and Larry communicated that we need to be in growth mode during the year, and we were. So I think frankly, the big drivers of G&A spend going forward will clearly be our ability to right size our marketing budget in the context of the current environment, and we'll be tied obviously to our desire to grow headcount as we see opportunities for growth going forward. The final item is obviously leveraging our scale, so there's technology, there is real estate, some of that is more step function as opposed to overall growth. And I think that will be important to keep in mind. I think those are really the big issues. I think that this year was clearly in the context of the environment. It lower year for us and we would expect the numbers to be modestly higher for the next year."

I think we remain first committed to investing in our business. We then try to target a dividend payout ratio of around 40% to 50% on a full year basis, that's a target, that's not and policy. And then we effectively return any additional cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. The total payout ratio is really an output of how we see opportunities for the next year, it's not an input to our budgeting or financial planning process. And over the last few years, I think you probably seen that our share repurchases broadly have been fairly constant in terms of dollar amounts. Obviously as the share price has gone up, the number of shares that we're repurchasing is going down slightly, and we've been fairly consistent in trying to increase our dividend. So this year, the dividend is obviously up 9% to $2.50 a share. We obviously reloaded our share repurchase authorization, and we expect that next year's share repurchases from a dollar perspective would be broadly consistent with what we did in 2015. And we think frankly, that combination has been very effective for shareholders. The dividends is now gone up at a compounded annual rate of about 11% over the last 5 years. We've got 13 million shares repurchased. I think we mentioned about a 13% unlevered return, and I think that's obviously [indiscernible]. And our share count is down roughly about 4% since we began this, and that's after issuing shares for deferred compensation while at the same time reinvesting in the business and effectively delevering as EBITDA has grown relative to our constant amount of long-term debt. As I think it's a balance. I think we felt as we -- given the stability and diversification of our model in our ability to deliver more consistent and predictable results that we can support that dividend going into this year."

And I think this is one of the key characteristic as the market is not taking into the full context. In terms of institutions, I think into the fourth -- we said in the third quarter institutions are pausing. They put some money to work in the fourth quarter, they put a lot of money to work at BlackRock in the fourth quarter. We're having deeper dialogue with more institutions than we've we had. I mean, the dialogues we're having with some very large insurance companies, pension funds worldwide are very encouraging, whether they act in the first quarter, the second quarter of 2017, we'll see. But I do believe clients are reassessing their liabilities in the form of pension funds, clients are really looking at what their liability rates in the terms of insurance companies, they're looking at their asset allocations accordingly now and how they're going to do it insurance companies, the rise of interest rates, the steepening of the yield curves is very positive. And many insurance companies as I talked about early last year will short their liability. They were anticipating higher rates and now and with higher rates today, some of them for putting some money to work. So I don't want to -- I think it would be unfair to say that we're going to expect these type of flows institutionally at BlackRock quarter by quarter by quarter. But we do feel very good about our positioning and working with our global institutions. In terms of asset allocation, we have dialogue with some clients right now, we're talking about more buy out alternatives [indiscernible] that 2 conversations which 2 large states in the last week about a bigger allocation and alternatives. So I don't want to suggest there's one macro trend and one way of looking at asset allocation, but I can't say we're involved in a lot of very deep conversations. And I do believe the market is still miss understanding how people are using passive strategies. They're just not using them because they want to be indexed, they are you saying passive strategies that are very liquid, that they can navigate around markets to take active exposures."

We're going to have more and more people angry that their close to retirement with an adequate flows of money to retire. That anger then does that go away. So we believe the deal will have quite a bit of merit, but I know as much as you do in terms of how that would change if it's going to change, does it get totally eliminated, we'll see. What we see in terms of behaviors, and this is the important thing, and Rob said it very well. We have not seen much change in behaviors from the large distribution platforms. As Rob suggested, they're moving from a brokerage relationship to advisory relationship. They're moving ahead with doing more model-based structuring. In fact, we want to biggest -- we were a part of the bigger award in terms of how are models are going to be created in terms of, are they going to be using our products or not. So in terms of behaviors, most firms are moving forward that some component if not all of the components of DoL will be moving forward. We are very active in helping whether the DoL will happen or not, more and more the distribution houses are saying, we need better technology to help us navigate our clients relationships and their portfolios. And that is why Aladdin for Wealth is growing very rapidly and thus, the potential for even more substantial growth in the future. So in terms of our relationships with most of our advisers, we are seeing very little in terms of behavior changes. Now I am not here to tell you on April 1 deck this year, everything is going to change. Could it be elongated? Sure. But I don't -- but I do believe in most cases, most large advisory firms believe this is a good thing for their clients and a good thing for them. And I believe we will see some form of DoL in the future. But I know as good as you what specifically does that mean."

The problem -- as [indiscernible] say, I just missed the last 10% or 15%, maybe I should stay on the sideline longer. Our job is to be helping our clients worldwide and helping them think about markets, thinking about exposures and helping them build an asset base to meet their liabilities.

Our dialogue that we're having worldwide indicate that we might see more money put to work, but I don't want to forecast it. I'm always disappointed of how much money is sitting in the sideline. And I believe that the end of every year, we talk about this that we need to have more of our clients, more of our investors to focus on the outcome investing and not whether the markets rich or cheap because that gets caught up in getting in and out of the market and therefore, missing big market movements. And this is a big issue. I believe this is one of the reasons why we're having deeper dialogue with our clients because we are talking about outcomes. We're not talking about a specific product, we're not talking active or passive, we're allowing our clients to make those decisions, whether they should have a bigger allocation in passive or active.

So we believe that 2016 result again highlighted our benefits of BlackRock's differentiated investment position, our technology positioning, our risk management platform and positioning and the impact of our investors we made over the last 5 years are the biggest growth products at BlackRock.

It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
The differentiation and strength of BlackRock's diverse global investment in technology platform allowed us continue to invest for growth during 2016, despite market volatility and macro-political uncertainty during the year. We saw strong results in our iShares' institutional and technology businesses that remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. 
Against a challenging backdrop for the asset management industry, BlackRock, once again, executed on each components of our framework for shareholder value creation. BlackRock generated $202 billion of total net inflows in 2016, the strongest close in our history, including nearly $100 billion in the fourth quarter. We expanded our full year operating margin by 80 basis points to 43.7%. 
Finally, after investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders during the year. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $5.14, both up 8% from a year ago. 
Full year operating income of $4.7 billion was flat versus a year ago, while earnings per share of $19.29 was down 2%, reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate in 2016. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $6 billion of net investment gains. Recall that nonoperating results in last year's fourth quarter included a $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.6%, reflecting the impact of several nonrecurring items compared to a rate of 30% a year ago. We continue to estimate the 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and potential tax reform. 
In an environment where growth in the asset management industry has been elusive, BlackRock's diverse global platform is thriving, delivering outcomes for our clients and differentiated organic growth for our shareholders. BlackRock's fourth quarter total net inflows of $98 billion included $88 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%; $18 billion of flows into our cash management business; and $7 billion of advisory outflows related to crisis Europe portfolio liquidation assignments. 
For the full year 2016, BlackRock generated record total net inflows of $202 billion, including long-term net inflows of $181 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic growth rate. 
Fourth quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher-average AUM, but offset by the impact of divergent beta, FX and mixed shift. 
For the full year, base fees were effectively flat. On a constant currency basis, base fees were up 3% versus last year's fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2016. 
Sequentially, base fees were down 2% as the negative impact of fixed income beta, divergent equity beta and continued dollar appreciation more than offset organic fee growth in the period. 
While we delivered robust organic asset growth during the year, our blended fee rate has been impacted by a number of factors that we have repeatedly discussed with you, including divergent equity beta and dollar appreciation as well as recent client preferences for lower risk asset classes and index over active strategies. However, while these headwinds are pervasive in our industry, our broad-based, solutions-focused investment platform is built to meet client preferences in any environment, whether risk on or risk off. And we remain confident that BlackRock can consistently grow client assets and base fees, both of which ended 2016 at record highs. 
Fourth quarter performance fees of $129 million were driven by our single-strategy hedge fund and loan-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $295 million decreased 52% from 2015, reflecting a challenging year for the hedge fund industry. 
BlackRock Solutions' fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was up 15% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Full year Aladdin revenue of $594 million, which represented 83% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by a number of sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2016. 
Aladdin is coming off a record year in terms of new client revenue and continues to benefit from strong market demand for both institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries. We have seen particularly high levels of demand for our newest product, Aladdin Risk for wealth management, in the current regulatory environment and are actively implementing for clients in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
Total expense declined 3% in 2016, reflecting lower compensation expense and continued G&A expense discipline. For the full year, compensation expense decreased $122 million or 3%, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees. 
Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full-year basis. 
Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $55 million year-over-year or 13%, reflecting lower marketing and promotional spend in the current quarter and $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the year-ago quarter. 
Sequentially, fourth quarter G&A expense increased $43 million, primarily reflected a planned uptick in the year-end marketing and promotional spend and higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense. 
Full year G&A expense of $1.3 billion was 6% below 2015 levels despite the impact of acquisitions on our run rate, reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment. Assuming stable markets, we would expect a modestly higher level of G&A spend in 2017. 
Despite an overall decline in 2016 revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we delivered 4% organic asset growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin to 43.7% for the year. 
While we remain committed to realizing the benefits of our scale for clients and shareholders alike, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We do remain keenly focused on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
During 2016, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we enter 2017, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. 
Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.50 per share, representing an increase of 9% over the prior level. Since instituting our dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its annual dividend per share at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 21%. 
We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of shares in 2016 and now have repurchased over 13 million shares during the last 4 years, resulting in a 13% unlevered compounded annual return for our shareholders. We remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders and anticipate a similar annual level of share repurchases in 2017. However, such amounts could vary based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price. 
In connection with this ongoing commitment, our board has authorized an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9 million shares, including 3 million shares which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2015. 
Our 2016 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Record full year total net inflows of $202 billion, including nearly $100 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter, were diversified across asset classes and benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. Globalized shares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. 
Fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $51 billion were driven by demand for U.S. market exposures, as equity markets rallied following the U.S. elections. Notwithstanding flat fourth quarter fixed income iShares flows, which were impacted by the significant move in long-term yields during the quarter, we continue to see an acceleration in the adoption of fixed income ETFs. 
Full year 2016 fixed income iShares inflows of $60 billion represented on organic growth rate of 24%. 
BlackRock's institutional franchise saw a record long term net inflows of $41 billion for the quarter and $51 billion for the year, positive across active and index strategies for both periods. Quarterly institutional active inflows of $6 billion were led by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives, as clients utilize BlackRock's broad range of investment strategies and customized solutions to achieve their investment goals. Institutional index inflows of $35 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by fixed income inflows of $26 billion, which reflected solutions-based LDI activity, primarily in Europe. 
We also ended 2016 with another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last 4 years, we've raised more than $22 billion of commitments for our fund of funds, real estate, infrastructure, opportunistic credit and all solution businesses and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw fourth quarter outflows of $2 billion and full year outflows of $11 billion, reflecting continued performance challenges in the active mutual fund industry as well as macro, political and regulatory uncertainty. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash business generated $18 billion and $29 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Investments we've made to expand the scale of our cash management offerings drove strong flows in 2016, and we are well positioned for additional demand and market share gains in the coming year. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of market volatility, divergent beta and significant currency movements, our diversified business model, once again, delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results that allowed us to continue investing for the future. We are committed to continuously evolving our platform as our clients' needs change, and believe our platform is well positioned, as it's ever been, to meet those needs and to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining our call. 
In a year dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our client's trust by delivering strong results. BlackRock's fourth quarter and 2016 results reflect the benefits of continuously investing in our business to better serve our clients. We're building out our investment teams and resources. We're expanding our technology footprint. And we're evolving our risk management capabilities as we continue to anticipate change in the world, in our economies and, most importantly, in our industry. 
As a result, more and more investors are turning to BlackRock to design, to deliver investment solutions to help them achieve their long-term financial goals. 
2016 was a turbulent year for investors, whether institutions or individual investors, one that no one fully predicted. Global political events like Brexit, the U.S. political -- U.S. presidential election and the Italian referendum has forced many of our clients and also ourselves to rethink our assumptions and our perceptions of the world. Even with some political surprises, the global economy began to show signs of optimism throughout 2016. 
The U.S. equity markets surged to all-time highs, as expectations for fiscal stimulus, reflation and tax and regulatory reform has sparked investor optimism and enthusiasm. The Fed's decision to raise REITs in December and the signal of additional hikes in 2017 suggest that the long period of accommodative monetary policy in the U.S. may finally subside at a faster rate that many have had anticipated. However, uncertainty in the wave of populism, upending the political status quo, persists. And despite the rally in the U.S. for domestic equities since we've had our U.S. election, many of our investors have seen a very different performance in their other markets. As Gary suggested, we see negative fixed income markets. We see underperforming international equities and a very strong dollar, which means for the dollar-based investors with broad global asset allocation, such as pension funds, the fourth quarter was more challenging than the market perception. 
We don't know exactly how the next few years will unfold, but we do know that in a challenging and changing environment, investors will look to BlackRock more than ever before. And our responsibility that we feel for our clients has never been greater. 
Throughout our history, BlackRock has always been focused on thinking ahead of our clients and repositioning our firm in advance of those perceived changes. 
Our results this year in a difficult environment for asset managers reflect the benefits of our deeper relationships that we built with our clients worldwide in areas where we've invested in our business over time. As Gary said, BlackRock saw total net inflows of $202 billion for the full year 2016, including nearly $100 billion in our fourth quarter. 
We generated record annual institutional and iShares flow of $51 billion institutionally and $140 billion in iShares. We actually grew net assets in 15 countries greater than $1 billion. We added more than 53 products in retail and iShares that generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. I think those 2 statistics alone identify the breadth of our platform. 
In 2016, the BlackRock Investment Institute reached more clients, regulators and policymakers than ever before, providing a forum for deep, timely and relevant dialogue on all macro issues. The Institute hosted calls after Brexit and the U.S. election, each time reaching nearly 5,000 external participants. This type of engagement has created tremendous value for our clients and filled a deeper and more direct relationship with our clients. 
We acquired BGI and iShares franchise more than 6 years ago, when iShares had $385 billion in AUM. Since then, we invested in the future of ETFs, building the market, expanding its presence, building a fixed income presence, a global presence, building products in anticipation of change of demand, whether it's factors or smart beta, and launched innovative new products. We've grown our iShares' AUM now to $1.3 trillion as more clients than ever before are using ETFs for transparent, liquid and efficient exposures, and we will continue to invest very aggressively in the growth and evolution of this market. 
iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion in inflows for the full year, earning the #1 market share of global U.S.-European equities and fixed income ETF flows for 2016. ETFs are being used by a diversified, growing set of institutional and retail clients. We are experienced, as I've said in many of these conferences, that we're seeing more and more investors using ETFs actively, not just for a task of exposure, but using them actively to try to get exposures where those exposures will outperform. We believe that will continue to be a great, great growth area for these products. And importantly, the expansion, the diversification of the ETF ecosystem is creating a deeper, more dynamic market for ETF trading. It is also enhancing liquidity for all investors worldwide. 
In 2016, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. core franchise to deliver the highest quality product at the best value to our clients at a time when they needed it most. We received very positive feedback from our clients on this move, and iShares gathered $29 billion of flows in our global core products in this quarter alone. 
We also continue to invest in fixed income ETFs. BlackRock has long seen the value in fixed income ETFs and has invested for years in building this market, even as many of our industry questions this opportunity. 2016, the fixed income ETF industry reached the milestone, crossing $600 billion in assets, with BlackRock managing a large component of that. 
During heightened market movements after the U.S. election, trading volumes in the U.S. fixed income ETFs surged to the highest level of the year. Fixed income ETFs or iShares, once again, performed under stress, in line with what our clients expected when they bought iShares, offering investors substantial on exchange liquidity. 
Fixed income ETFs remain a strategic priority and a significant growth opportunity for BlackRock and our clients. 
Smart beta ETFs are another area of strategic investment for BlackRock, where we are the #1 player in AUM, growing at a 37% organic growth rate in 2016. 
We all know that in 2016, we saw retail investor shifting away from traditional active funds, with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry experiencing $280 billion of outflows, representing the industry's worst year on record. And we, at BlackRock, experienced some of the same headwinds across our traditional active mutual funds. But because the way we are positioned, because how we are trying to help our clients by having both passive and active, we're working with the clients as they navigate the need between active and passive. 
I believe investors are going to continue to rethink their approach to active management. They may now move more towards factor-based strategies. They may have asset allocation or portfolio construction, but I do believe we're going to continue to see a drive using ETFs for active returns. 
We have been purposefully investing in our platforms to provide our clients with a full spectrum of offerings and to enhance global -- to enhance alpha-generating active strategies. We ended the quarter with 88% of our taxable fixed income, 91% of our scientific active equity and 65% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. We are confident that our top-performing franchise like Asian equities and our unconstrained fixed income, which have proven to thrive in a rising rate environment, are well positioned for 2017. 
Factor-based investing helps bridge the gap between active and index, and has been an area of significant focus for BlackRock and our clients in 2016. BlackRock manages over $150 billion in factor-based strategies, including smart beta ETFs, and our factor-based AUM grew at an organic growth rate in 2016 of 17%. 
We have a responsibility to provide our clients with the ability to focus on environmental and social issues, while simultaneously generating strong financial returns. We launched BlackRock's sustainable investing platform a year ago and has since built a range of equity and fixed income strategies that target positive environmental and social impact. 
We have frequently advocated for the benefits of an infrastructure investing. And within the U.S. alone, markets are anticipating up to $1 trillion of domestic infrastructure investments over the next few years. And we all know we desperately need those investments. BlackRock has built our infrastructure and brought our real estate platforms, both organically and inorganically over time. And we currently manage $29 billion of real asset AUM. We invested in our global cash management business in anticipation of regulatory reform in a rising rate environment. BlackRock is now positioned as a scale player with the broadest range of solutions. At a time when we anticipated an uptick in demand, we saw $18 billion of inflows in their fourth quarter alone. And now we have a cash management business that's over $400 billion. 
Over the past year, we have spoken to the increasing depth and quality of the solution orientation and solution-oriented conversations that BlackRock is having or other institutional clients in face of this global uncertainty. Even as these clients pause to assess the changing investment landscape, growth in 2016 was driven in particularly by our financial institution business, as insurance clients look to BlackRock for a highly customized portfolio. Our institutional business saw record fourth quarter and full year net inflows across both active and passive. We have the right pieces on our platform, but the key to designing and delivering a robust solution that targets specific outcomes for our clients is technology, which has always been at BlackRock's core. We see strong and growing demand for BlackRock's technology offerings. More and more asset managers, asset owners, banks, wealth managers, insurance companies are valuing the differentiating ability of our Aladdin platform and other technology offerings at BlackRock to help them achieve their goals. We are constantly enhancing our existing technology as well as coming up with new ways to use Aladdin to serve our clients. 
In 2016, we launched our Aladdin Risk for wealth platform, which empowers wealth managers' home offices to better understand the risk. We also introduced the Aladdin portfolio builder, which provides financial advisers with highly intuitive portfolio construction tools. We continue to see robust client interest in future adviser and iRetire offerings. We also recently announced a minority investment in partnership with iCapital, the leading technology-enabled illiquid alternative distribution platform for retail investors. 
In addition to technology, our people enable us to differentiate ourselves for our clients. Every year, together with our Board of Directors, we take a fresh look at our organization, which includes developing talent and positioning our leaders in a role that can broaden their experiences and maximize their potential for BlackRock and our clients. 
2016, we unified our Active Equity platform. We unified our beta platform, and we globalized our fixed income platform, all of which will help us benefit from the potential -- full potential of our global investment scale. At the same time, to create a more tailored client experience in each geography where we operate, we strengthened our regional management of our clients and marketing activities in line with our commitment to be global with a local identity and a local footprint. It is a quality and dedication of our teams across the globe that position us well for 2017. 
There are reasons that we afford such trusting and trusted relationships with our clients and why our clients turn to BlackRock to solve the biggest financial challenges. I am really proud of the depth of the talent of the firm and the leadership we have today. We have never had a more talented group of men and women than we have today, and we have the finest leadership in the history of the firm today. BlackRock has been adapted, repositioning our investment platform and technology capabilities and advance some change. I promise you we will continue to be in front of those needs, and we'll continue to change with the needs of our clients. 
And as paradigms shift, we will have an even greater responsibility to help our clients navigate the markets and plans for their retirement. We have a responsibility to continue to invest in broadening and deepening our investment platform. We have a responsibility to be a thought and opinion leader worldwide, globally and locally to every one of our clients. And throughout BlackRock's history, we have demonstrated the ability to invest in a business for growth like no other firm, while expanding our margins, raising our dividend rates and prudently returning capital to our shareholders. 
As we enter 2017, we will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future, to grow our technology footprint, to expand our investment capabilities and to further enhance our talent level, all to meet our daily responsibility to every client. Whether that client has awarded us $1,000 or if that client awarded us $10 billion, we have a responsibility to every client, and we are building a firm to meet those responsibilities every day. 
With that, let me open up for questions."

The other big headwind that we had all year, and actually accelerated in the fourth quarter, was the strength of the dollar. And so those are 2 of the big macro issues that we had faced. One of the great statistics that I think about going forward into next year, our average assets in 2016 were up 2%. Our spot close is up 11%, and that just gives you a color of some of the issues that we had. And I think that's a big macro context of thinking about how you should think about our business. Obviously, I'm going to have Gary go into the specificity of the fee rates, but I would just say, from the top of the house, I think you said it pretty well because the margin -- I think scale is a driver that is so important in how we look at it. I mean, when we look at lowering fees for market share opportunities, for delivering the needs to our clients and having higher margins, this is what -- this is how we think about doing this, working and focusing on the clients' needs, doing what we think is best, building market share, but also driving margin.

So look, I think -- let's deal with them separately. I think in terms of fee rate, there's really 4 primary reasons that you've seen a decline in our fee rate, whether year-over-year, quarter-over",549,"So good morning, Bill, and thanks for asking the question. So look, I think -- let's deal with them separately. I think in terms of fee rate, there's really 4 primary reasons that you've seen a decline in our fee rate, whether year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter or sequentially. First, obviously, is FX. We saw dollar appreciation, primarily versus the euro and the pound, roughly 4% on the euro, 16% against the pound during the year; and that obviously, relative to the stock of our business, increases the relative weighting of our dollar-denominated assets, which tend to have lower fees than our non-U.S. dollar-denominated product. In many cases, you're seeing a little bit of the same phenomenon in terms of equity beta. We've talked about divergent equity beta. But this year in particular, you saw various higher fee international markets, whether it be Europe, Asia X or Japan underperforming domestic U.S. markets. And as with FX, that also increases the relative weighting of our lower fee dollar-denominated assets under management. We saw a mixed shift. When we talk about mixed shift, we really talk about that as a client preference issue. So during 2016, we saw clients favoring index over active. We saw clients favoring fixed income over equity and multi-asset. And even within our cash business, we saw a huge preference for government over prime funds. And in each of those instances, you're seeing changes in fee rates from what was traditionally higher fee product to, at least in this year, lower fee product. And then finally, we actually took some of our own action in terms of price reductions with certain iShares core and fixed income that was later in the year. But again, with that what I would call investment, we've been very clear that we think that would be accretive to shareholder value over time. And I think as you heard, we've had strong progress to date in terms of our core performance so far. So in each of these cases, all of these items are going to impact fee rates over time. But I think the key issue is, those set of circumstances, whether they're market-driven or client-driven, will also change over time. And I think the key issue for BlackRock is that we have a broad-based enough platform to be able to meet client preferences in any market, and to basically deliver solutions-based and outcomes to them that basically makes sense. So that's the fee rate piece of it. In terms of margins, I think what I would say as we think about margins, I'll give the standard statement that we don't manage to a margin target. I think you've all heard that long enough. But I think that in a year where we obviously saw a difference, i.e. 4% asset growth versus less organic base fee growth, I think we were able to demonstrate that we can basically manage the business in that environment. And in fact, notwithstanding an overall decline in our revenues, which was fundamentally driven by performance fees, we were still able to deliver not only 80 basis points of margin improvement, but record flows during the year. So again, that interplay between revenue growth and margin, I think we're pretty well-established in terms of our ability to operate in most environments."

But what's important to us is not only performance as one of the levers that we look to go out and use to get clients to buy our products, but also our competitive position and where we stand in price. And most of our mutual funds have boards that we also have to respond to as well. So since we've made the changes, 4 of our funds have been upgraded by Morningstar, 3 of the government funds and 1 of the high yield funds, and they've all now become middle rated. And so that's important to us so that they are included in a lot of what our distribution forces can tell and how they're evaluated. So beyond performance, we also want to strive to be in at least the top quartile of expenses. And of course, in a very low rate environment, that also helps to drive performance. So the response has been very good by those that evaluate us. The response has been good by the distribution centers, and the response has been shown in creating and getting more assets. So over time, we're going to continue to be responsive to the competitive environment to make sure that we're included in the sales. We expect that sales will continue."

And I think that one is one that we tried to manage appropriately in a year where we're seeing lots of clients delay their investment allocation decisions with a lot of volatility. We'll be obviously looking at that pretty carefully in the context of the current environment as we enter this year. We also, as you probably noticed, just also hired a new Chief Marketing Officer, Frank Cooper, who will be taking his own look at our marketing and our spending strategy that we'll clearly be taking a careful look at. There's also some other items that I think you have to be wary of, where FX gets in the way. And also G&A impacts training, I think has recruiting. It has a bunch of things that are obviously tied to broader growth objectives as we grow the company. We kept our headcount pretty flat last year even after our first quarter reduction that we talked about. and Larry communicated that we need to be in growth mode during the year, and we were. So I think, frankly, the big drivers of G&A spend going forward will clearly be our ability to rightsize our marketing budget in the context of the current environment. And we'll be tied, obviously, to our desire to grow headcount as we see opportunities for growth going forward. The final item is obviously leveraging our scale. So there is technology. There is real estate. Some of that is more step function as opposed to overall growth. And I think that will be important to keep in mind. I think those are really the big issues. I think that this year was clearly in the context of the environment, a lower year for us. And we would expect numbers to be modestly higher for the next year."

I think we remain, first, committed to investing in our business. We then try to target a dividend payout ratio of around 40% to 50% on a full year basis. That's a target. That's not a policy. And then we effectively look to return any additional cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. The total payout ratio is really an output of how we see opportunities for the next year. It's not an input to our budgeting or financial planning process. And over the last few years, I think you've probably seen that our share repurchases broadly have been fairly constant in terms of dollar amounts. Obviously, as the share price has gone up, the number of shares that we're repurchasing is going down slightly. And we've been fairly consistent in trying to increase our dividend. So this year, the dividend is obviously up 9% to $2.50 a share. We've obviously reloaded our share repurchase authorization, and expect that next year's share repurchases from a dollar perspective would be broadly consistent with what we did in 2015. And we think, frankly, that combination has been very effective for shareholders. The dividend has now gone up at a compounded annual rate of about 11% over the last 5 years. We've got 13 million shares repurchased. I think we mentioned about a 13% unlevered return. And I think that's obviously good. And our share count is down roughly about 4% since we began this. And that's after issuing shares for deferred compensation while, at the same time, reinvesting in the business and effectively delevering as EBITDA has grown relative to our constant amount of long-term debt. So I think it's a balance. I think we felt as we -- given the stability and diversification of our model and our ability just to deliver more consistent and predictable results that we can support that dividend going into this year."

As I said, we are seeing more institutions using index and the allocation to these various exposures as an active strategy. And I think this is one of the key characteristics the market is not taking into the full context. In terms of institutions, I think into the fourth -- we said in the third quarter, institutions are pausing. They put some money to work in the fourth quarter. They put a lot of money to work at BlackRock in the fourth quarter. We're having deeper dialogue with more institutions than we ever had. I mean, the dialogues we're having with some very large insurance companies, pension funds worldwide are very encouraging. Whether they act in the first quarter, the second quarter of 2017, we'll see. But I do believe clients are reassessing their liabilities in the form of pension funds. Clients are really looking at what their liability rates in the terms of insurance companies. They're looking at their asset allocations accordingly now and how they're going to do it for insurance companies. The rise of interest rates, the steepening of the yield curves is very positive. And many insurance companies that I talked about early last year were short their liability. We were anticipating higher rates. And now with higher rates today, some of them are putting some money to work. So I don't want to -- I think it would be unfair to say that we're going to expect these types of flows institutionally at BlackRock quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, but we do feel very good about our positioning and working with our global institutions. In terms of the asset allocation, we are having dialogue with some clients right now. We're talking about -- more about alternatives. Rob Kapito has had 2 conversations which 2 large states in the last week about a bigger allocation and alternative. So I don't want to suggest there's one macro trend and one way of looking at asset allocation, but I can say we're involved in a lot of very deep conversations. And I do believe the market is still misunderstanding how people are using passive strategies. They're just not using them because they want to be indexed, they are using passive strategies that are very liquid, that they can navigate around markets to take active exposures."

We believe the DoL rule has some very great components to it. I mean, as you know, what we've spoken for years and years and years that we have done a very bad job in our country in helping people navigate to the outcome of retirement. And having better outcome-oriented strategies, whether we have a DoL or not, is imperative. We're going to have more and more people angry that their close to retirement with an adequate pools of money to retire. That anger then does not go away. So we believe the DoL rule has quite a bit of merit, but I know as much as you do in terms of how that would change, if it's going to change. Does it get totally eliminated, we'll see. What we see in terms of behaviors, and this is the important thing, and Rob said it very well, we have not seen much change in behaviors from the large distribution platforms. As Rob suggested, they're moving from a brokerage relationship to an advisory relationship. They're moving ahead with doing more model-based structuring. In fact, we won the biggest -- we were a part of a bigger award in terms of how models are going to be created in terms of are they going to be using our products or not. So in terms of behaviors, most firms are moving forward that some component, if not all of the components, of DoL will be moving forward. We are very active in helping whether the DoL rule happens or not, more and more of the distribution houses are saying, ""We need better technology to help us navigate our clients' relationships and their portfolios."" And that is why Aladdin for wealth is growing very rapidly and has a potential for even more substantial growth in the future. So in terms of our relationships with most of our advisers, we are seeing very little in terms of behavior changes. Now I am not here to tell you, on April 1 this year, everything's going to change. Could it be elongated? Sure. But I don't -- but I do believe, in most cases, most large advisory firms believe this is a good thing for their clients and a good thing for them. And I believe we will see some form of DoL in the future, but I know as good as you what specifically does that mean."

We believe it's a mistake, the amount of cash is sitting in the sidelines worldwide. The problem is clients say, ""Oh, I just missed the last 10% or 15%. Maybe I should stay in the sidelines longer."" Our job is to be helping our clients worldwide and helping them think about markets, thinking about exposures and helping them build an asset base to meet their liabilities. I don't believe, as you said, one quarter versus another is going to really determine whether we are seeing a renewed interest in putting the money to work. Certainly, in the fourth quarter, we did. Our dialogue that we're having worldwide indicate that we may see more money put to work, but I don't want to forecast that. I'm always disappointed of how much money is sitting in the sideline. And I believe at the end of every year we talk about this that we need to have more of our clients, more of our investors to focus on the outcome investing and not whether the market's rich or cheap because that gets caught up in getting in and out of the market and, therefore, missing big market movements. And this is a big issue. I believe this is one of the reasons why we're having deeper dialogue with our clients because we are talking about outcomes. We're not talking about a specific product. We're not talking active or passive. We're allowing our clients to make those decisions, whether they should have a bigger allocation in passive or active. We're making our clients determine whether they should be in high yield or unconstrained bond fund. We're allowing our clients to work on how to navigate.

BlackRock generated $202 billion of total net inflows in 2016, the strongest close in our history, including nearly $100 billion in the fourth quarter. We expanded our full year operating margin by 80 basis points to 43.7%. 
Finally, after investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders during the year. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $5.14, both up 8% from a year ago. 
Full year operating income of $4.7 billion was flat versus a year ago, while earnings per share of $19.29 was down 2%, reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate in 2016. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $6 million of net investment gains. Recall that nonoperating results in last year's fourth quarter included a $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.6%, reflecting the impact of several nonrecurring items compared to a rate of 30% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and potential tax reform. 
In an environment where growth in the asset management industry has been elusive, BlackRock's diverse global platform is thriving, delivering outcomes for our clients and differentiated organic growth for our shareholders. BlackRock's fourth quarter total net inflows of $98 billion included $88 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%; $18 billion of flows into our cash management business; and $7 billion of advisory outflows related to crisis-era portfolio liquidation assignments. 
For the full year 2016, BlackRock generated record total net inflows of $202 billion, including long-term net inflows of $181 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic growth rate. 
Fourth quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher-average AUM, but offset by the impact of divergent beta, FX and mix shift. 
For the full year, base fees were effectively flat. On a constant currency basis, base fees were up 3% versus last year's fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2016. 
Sequentially, base fees were down 2% as the negative impact of fixed income beta, divergent equity beta and continued dollar appreciation more than offset organic fee growth in the period. 
While we delivered robust organic asset growth during the year, our blended fee rate has been impacted by a number of factors that we have repeatedly discussed with you, including divergent equity beta and dollar appreciation as well as recent client preferences for lower risk asset classes and index over active strategies. However, while these headwinds are pervasive in our industry, our broad-based, solutions-focused investment platform is built to meet client preferences in any environment, whether risk on or risk off. And we remain confident that BlackRock can consistently grow client assets and base fees, both of which ended 2016 at record highs. 
Fourth quarter performance fees of $129 million were driven by our single-strategy hedge fund and long-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $295 million decreased 52% from 2015, reflecting a challenging year for the hedge fund industry. 
BlackRock Solutions' fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was up 15% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Full year Aladdin revenue of $594 million, which represented 83% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by a number of sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2016. 
Aladdin is coming off a record year in terms of new client revenue and continues to benefit from strong market demand for both institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries. We have seen particularly high levels of demand for our newest product, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, in the current regulatory environment and are actively implementing for clients in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
Total expense declined 3% in 2016, reflecting lower compensation expense and continued G&A expense discipline. For the full year, compensation expense decreased $122 million or 3%, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees. 
Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full-year basis. 
Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $55 million year-over-year or 13%, reflecting lower marketing and promotional spend in the current quarter and $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the year-ago quarter. 
Sequentially, fourth quarter G&A expense increased $43 million, primarily reflected a planned uptick in the year-end marketing and promotional spend and higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense. 
Full year G&A expense of $1.3 billion was 6% below 2015 levels despite the impact of acquisitions on our run rate, reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment. Assuming stable markets, we would expect a modestly higher level of G&A spend in 2017. 
Despite an overall decline in 2016 revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we delivered 4% organic asset growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin to 43.7% for the year. 
While we remain committed to realizing the benefits of our scale for clients and shareholders alike, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We do remain keenly focused on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
During 2016, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we enter 2017, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. 
Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.50 per share, representing an increase of 9% over the prior level. Since instituting our dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its annual dividend per share at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 21%. 
We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of shares in 2016 and now have repurchased over 13 million shares during the last 4 years, resulting in a 13% unlevered compounded annual return for our shareholders. We remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders and anticipate a similar annual level of share repurchases in 2017. However, such amounts could vary based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price. 
In connection with this ongoing commitment, our board has authorized an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9 million shares, including 3 million shares which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2015. 
Our 2016 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Record full year total net inflows of $202 billion, including nearly $100 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter, were diversified across asset classes and benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients used ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. Global iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. 
Fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $51 billion were driven by demand for U.S. market exposures, as equity markets rallied following the U.S. elections. Notwithstanding flat fourth quarter fixed income iShares flows, which were impacted by the significant move in long-term yields during the quarter, we continue to see an acceleration in the adoption of fixed income ETFs. 
Full year 2016 fixed income iShares inflows of $60 billion represented an organic growth rate of 24%. 
BlackRock's institutional franchise saw record long term net inflows of $41 billion for the quarter and $51 billion for the year, positive across active and index strategies for both periods. Quarterly institutional active inflows of $6 billion were led by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives, as clients utilized BlackRock's broad range of investment strategies and customized solutions to achieve their investment goals. Institutional index inflows of $35 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by fixed income inflows of $26 billion, which reflected solutions-based LDI activity, primarily in Europe. 
We also ended 2016 with another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last 4 years, we've raised more than $22 billion in commitments for our fund of funds, real estate, infrastructure, opportunistic credit and alt solution businesses and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw fourth quarter outflows of $2 billion and full year outflows of $11 billion, reflecting continued performance challenges in the active mutual fund industry as well as macro, political and regulatory uncertainty. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash business generated $18 billion and $29 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Investments we've made to expand the scale of our cash management offerings drove strong flows in 2016, and we are well positioned for additional demand and market share gains in the coming year. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of market volatility, divergent beta and significant currency movements, our diversified business model, once again, delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results that allowed us to continue investing for the future. We are committed to continuously evolving our platform as our clients' needs change, and believe our platform is well positioned as it's ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And good morning to everyone and thanks for joining our call. In a year dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our client's trust by delivering strong results.",2216,"Thanks, Gary. Happy new year to everyone. And good morning to everyone and thanks for joining our call. 
In a year dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our client's trust by delivering strong results. BlackRock's fourth quarter and 2016 results reflect the benefits of continuously investing in our business to better serve our clients. We're building out our investment teams and resources. We're expanding our technology footprint. And we're evolving our risk management capabilities as we continue to anticipate change in the world, in our economies and, most importantly, in our industry. 
As a result, more and more investors are turning to BlackRock to design, to deliver investment solutions that will help them achieve their long-term financial goals. 
2016 was a turbulent year for investors, whether institutions or individual investors, one that no one fully predicted. Global political events like Brexit, the U.S. political -- U.S. presidential election and the Italian referendum have forced many of our clients and also ourselves to rethink our assumptions and our perceptions of the world. Even with some political surprises, the global economy began to show signs of optimism throughout 2016. 
The U.S. equity markets surged to all-time highs, as expectations for fiscal stimulus, reflation and tax and regulatory reform has sparked investor optimism and enthusiasm. The Fed's decision to raise rates in December and the signal of additional hikes in 2017 suggest that the long period of accommodative monetary policy in the U.S. may finally subside at a faster rate than many have -- had anticipated. However, uncertainty and the wave of populism upending the political status quo persists. And despite the rally in the U.S. for domestic equities since we've had our U.S. election, many of our investors are seeing a very different performance in the other markets. As Gary suggested, we see negative fixed income markets. We've seen underperforming international equities and a very strong dollar, which means for the dollar-based investors with broad global asset allocation, such as pension funds, the fourth quarter was more challenging than the market perception. 
We don't know exactly how the next few years will unfold, but we do know that in a challenging and changing environment, investors will look to BlackRock more than ever before. And our responsibility that we feel for our clients has never been greater. 
Throughout our history, BlackRock has always been focused on thinking ahead of our clients and repositioning our firm in advance of those perceived changes. 
Our results this year in a difficult environment for asset managers reflect the benefits of our deeper relationships that we built with our clients worldwide in areas where we've invested in our business over time. As Gary said, BlackRock saw total net inflows of $202 billion for the full year 2016, including nearly $100 billion in our fourth quarter. 
We generated record annual institutional and iShares flow of $51 billion institutionally and $140 billion in iShares. We actually grew net assets in 15 countries greater than $1 billion. We added more than 53 products in retail and iShares that generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. I think those 2 statistics alone identify the breadth of our platform. 
In 2016, the BlackRock Investment Institute reached more clients, regulators and policymakers than ever before, providing a forum for deep, timely and relevant dialogue on all macro issues. The Institute hosted calls after Brexit and the U.S. election, each time reaching nearly 5,000 external participants. This type of engagement has created tremendous value for our clients and built a deeper and more direct relationship with our clients. 
We acquired BGI and iShares franchise more than 6 years ago when iShares had $385 billion in AUM. Since then, we invested in the future of ETFs, building the market, expanding its presence, building a fixed income presence, a global presence, building products in anticipation of change of demand, whether it's factors or smart beta, and launched innovative new products. We've grown our iShares' AUM now to $1.3 trillion as more clients than ever before are using ETFs for transparent, liquid and efficient exposures, and we will continue to invest very aggressively in the growth and evolution of this market. 
iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion in inflows for the full year, earning the #1 market share of global U.S.-European equities and fixed income ETF flows for 2016. ETFs are being used by a diversified, growing set of institutional and retail clients. We are experienced, as I've said in many of these conferences, that we're seeing more and more investors using ETFs actively, not just for a passive exposure, but using them actively to try to get exposures where they think those exposures will outperform. We believe that will continue to be a great, great growth area for these products. And importantly, the expansion, the diversification of the ETF ecosystem is creating a deeper, more dynamic market for ETF trading. It is also enhancing liquidity for all investors worldwide. 
In 2016, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. core franchise to deliver the highest quality products at the best value to our clients at a time when they needed it most. We received very positive feedback from our clients on this move, and iShares gathered $29 billion in flows in our global core products in this quarter alone. 
We also continue to invest in fixed income ETFs. BlackRock has long seen the value in fixed income ETFs and has invested for years in building this market, even as many of our industry questioned this opportunity. 2016, the fixed income ETF industry reached a milestone, crossing $600 billion in assets, with BlackRock managing a large component of that. 
During heightened market movements after the U.S. election, trading volumes in the U.S. fixed income ETFs surged to the highest level of the year. Fixed income ETFs or iShares, once again, performed, under stress, in line with what our clients expected when they bought iShares, offering investors substantial on-exchange liquidity. 
Fixed income ETFs remain a strategic priority and a significant growth opportunity for BlackRock and our clients. 
Smart beta ETFs are another area of strategic investment for BlackRock, where we are the #1 player in AUM, growing at a 37% organic growth rate in 2016. 
We all know that in 2016, we saw retail investors shifting away from traditional active funds, with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry experiencing $280 billion of outflows, representing the industry's worst year on record. And we, at BlackRock, experienced some of the same headwinds across our traditional active mutual funds. But because the way we are positioned, because how we are trying to help our clients by having both passive and active, we're working with the clients as they navigate the need between active and passive. 
I believe investors are going to continue to rethink their approach to active management. They may now move more towards factor-based strategies. They may have asset allocation or portfolio construction, but I do believe we're going to continue to see a drive using ETFs for active returns. 
We have been purposefully investing in our platforms to provide our clients with a full spectrum of offerings and to enhance global -- to enhance alpha-generating active strategies. We ended the quarter with 88% of our taxable fixed income, 91% of our scientific active equity and 65% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. We are confident that our top-performing franchises, like Asian equities and our unconstrained fixed income, which have proven to thrive in a rising rate environment, are well positioned for 2017. 
Factor-based investing helps bridge the gap between active and index, and has been an area of significant focus for BlackRock and our clients in 2016. BlackRock manages over $150 billion in factor-based strategies, including smart beta ETFs, and our factor-based AUM grew at an organic growth rate in 2016 of 17%. 
We have a responsibility to provide our clients with the ability to focus on environmental and social issues, while simultaneously generating strong financial returns. We launched BlackRock's sustainable investing platform a year ago and have since built a range of equity and fixed income strategies that target positive environmental and social impact. 
We have frequently advocated for the benefits of an infrastructure investing. And within the U.S. alone, markets are anticipating up to $1 trillion of domestic infrastructure investments over the next few years. And we all know we desperately need those investments. BlackRock has built our infrastructure and brought our real estate platforms both organically and inorganically over time. And we currently manage $29 billion in real asset AUM. We invested in our global cash management business in anticipation of regulatory reform and a rising rate environment. BlackRock is now positioned as a scale player with the broadest range of solutions. At a time when we anticipated an uptick in demand, we saw $18 billion in flows in our fourth quarter alone. And now we have a cash management business that's over $400 billion. 
Over the past year, we have spoken to the increasing depth and quality of the solution orientation and solution-oriented conversations that BlackRock is having with [ph] other [ph] institutional clients in face of this global uncertainty. Even as these clients pause to assess the changing investment landscape, growth in 2016 was driven in particularly by our financial institution business, as insurance clients look to BlackRock for a highly customized portfolio. Our institutional business saw record fourth quarter and full year net inflows across both active and passive. We have the right pieces on our platform, but the key to designing and delivering a robust solution that targets specific outcomes for our clients is technology, which has always been at BlackRock's core. We see strong and growing demand for BlackRock's technology offerings. More and more asset managers, asset owners, banks, wealth managers, insurance companies are valuing the differentiating ability of our Aladdin platform and other technology offerings at BlackRock to help them achieve their goals. We are constantly enhancing our existing technology as well as coming up with new ways to use Aladdin to serve our clients. 
In 2016, we launched our Aladdin Risk for Wealth platform, which empowers wealth managers' home offices to better understand risk. We also introduced the Aladdin Portfolio Builder, which provides financial advisers with highly intuitive portfolio construction tools. We continue to see robust client interest in future adviser and iRetire offerings. We also recently announced a minority investment in partnership with iCapital, the leading technology-enabled illiquid alternative distribution platform for retail investors. 
In addition to technology, our people enable us to differentiate ourselves before our clients. Every year, together with our Board of Directors, we take a fresh look at our organization, which includes developing talent and positioning our leaders in a role that can broaden their experiences and maximize their potential for BlackRock and our clients. 
2016, we unified our Active Equity platform. We unified our beta platform, and we globalized our fixed income platform, all of which will help us benefit from the potential -- the full potential of our global investment scale. At the same time, to create a more tailored client experience in each geography where we operate, we strengthened our regional management of our clients and marketing activities in line with our commitment to be global with a local identity and a local footprint. It is the quality and dedication of our teams across the globe that position us well for 2017. 
There are reasons that we afford such trusting and trusted relationships with our clients and why our clients turn to BlackRock to solve the biggest financial challenges. I am really proud of the depth of the talent of the firm and the leadership we have today. We have never had a more talented group of men and women than we have today, and we have the finest leadership in the history of the firm today. BlackRock has been adept at repositioning our investment platform and technology capabilities in advance of change. I promise you we will continue to be in front of those needs, and we'll continue to change with the needs of our clients. 
As paradigms shift, we will have an even greater responsibility to help our clients navigate the markets and plans for their retirement. We have a responsibility to continue to invest in broadening and deepening our investment platform. We have a responsibility to be a thought and opinion leader worldwide, globally and locally, to every one of our clients. And throughout BlackRock's history, we have demonstrated the ability to invest in our business for growth like no other firm, while expanding our margins, raising our dividend rates and prudently returning capital to our shareholders. 
As we enter 2017, we will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future, to grow our technology footprint, to expand our investment capabilities and to further enhance our talent level, all to meet our daily responsibility to every client. Whether that client has awarded us $1,000 or if that client awarded us $10 billion, we have a responsibility to every client, and we are building a firm to meet those responsibilities every day. 
With that, let me open up for questions."

And so we had huge headwinds in the first half of the year. The other big headwind that we had all year, and actually accelerated in the fourth quarter, was the strength of the dollar. And so those are 2 of the big macro issues that we had to face. One of the great statistics that I think about going forward into next year, our average assets in 2016 were up 2%. Our spot close is up 11%, and that just gives you a color of some of the issues that we had. And I think that's a big macro context of thinking about how you should think about our business. Obviously, I'm going to have Gary go into the specificity of the fee rates, but I would just say, from the top of the house, I think -- you said it pretty well because the margin, I think scale is a driver that is so important in how we look at it. I mean, when we look at lowering fees for market share opportunities, for delivering the needs to our clients and having higher margins, this is what -- this is how we think about doing this, working and focusing on the clients' needs, doing what we think is best, building market share, but also driving margin. But let me have Gary go into the specificity of your question."

So look, I think -- let's deal with them separately. I think in terms of fee rate, there's really 4 primary reasons that you've seen a decline in our fee rate, whether year-over-year, quarter-over",547,"So good morning, Bill, and thanks for asking the question. So look, I think -- let's deal with them separately. I think in terms of fee rate, there's really 4 primary reasons that you've seen a decline in our fee rate, whether year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter or sequentially. First, obviously, is FX. We saw dollar appreciation, primarily versus the euro and the pound, roughly 4% on the euro, 16% against the pound during the year; and that obviously, relative to the stock of our business, increases the relative weighting of our dollar-denominated assets, which tend to have lower fees than our non-U.S. dollar-denominated product. In many cases, you're seeing a little bit of the same phenomenon in terms of equity beta. We've talked about divergent equity beta. But this year in particular, you saw various higher fee international markets, whether it be Europe, Asia X or Japan underperforming domestic U.S. markets. And as with FX, that also increases the relative weighting of our lower fee dollar-denominated assets under management. We saw mix shift. When we talk about mix shift, we really talk about that as a client preference issue. So during 2016, we saw clients favoring index over active. We saw clients favoring fixed income over equity and multi-asset. And even within our cash business, we saw a huge preference for government over prime funds. And in each of those instances, you're seeing changes in fee rates from what was traditionally higher fee product to, at least in this year, lower fee product. And then finally, we actually took some of our own action in terms of price reductions with certain iShares, core and fixed income, that was later in the year. But again, with that, what I would call, investment, we've been very clear that we think that would be accretive to shareholder value over time. And I think as you heard, we've had strong progress to date in terms of our core performance so far. So in each of these cases, all of these items are going to impact fee rates over time. But I think the key issue is, those set of circumstances, whether they're market-driven or client-driven, will also change over time. And I think the key issue for BlackRock is that we have a broad-based enough platform to be able to meet client preferences in any market, and to basically deliver solutions-based and outcomes to them that basically makes sense. So that's the fee rate piece of it. In terms of margins, I think what I would say as we think about margins, I'll give the standard statement that we don't manage to a margin target. I think you've all heard that long enough. But I think that in a year where we obviously saw a difference, i.e. 4% asset growth versus less organic-based fee growth, I think we were able to demonstrate that we can basically manage the business in that environment. And in fact, notwithstanding an overall decline in our revenues, which was fundamentally driven by performance fees, we were still able to deliver not only 80 basis points of margin improvement, but record flows during the year.

But what's important to us is not only performance as one of the levers that we look to go out and use to get clients to buy our products, but also our competitive position and where we stand in price. And most of our mutual funds have boards that we also have to respond to as well. So since we've made the changes, 4 of our funds have been upgraded by Morningstar, 3 of the government funds and 1 of the high-yield funds, and they've all now become middle rated. And so that's important to us so that they are included in a lot of what our distribution forces can sell and how they're evaluated. So beyond performance, we also want to strive to be in at least the top quartile of expenses. And of course, in a very low rate environment, that also helps to drive performance. So the response has been very good by those that evaluate us. The response has been good by the distribution centers, and the response has been shown in creating and getting more assets. So over time, we're going to continue to be responsive to the competitive environment to make sure that we're included in the sales of these. And we expect that sales will continue."

And I think that one is one that we tried to manage appropriately in a year where we're seeing lots of clients delay their investment allocation decisions with a lot of volatility. We'll be, obviously, looking at that pretty carefully in the context of the current environment as we get into this year. We also, as you probably noticed, just also hired a new Chief Marketing Officer, Frank Cooper, who will be taking his own look at our marketing and our spending strategy that we'll clearly be taking a careful look at. There's also some other items that I think you have to be wary of where FX gets in the way. And also G&A impacts training, it has recruiting. It has a bunch of things that are obviously tied to broader growth objectives as we grow the company. We kept our headcount pretty flat last year, even -- that was even after our first quarter reduction that we talked about. and Larry communicated that we were going to continue to be in growth mode during the year, and we were. So I think, frankly, the big drivers of G&A spend going forward will clearly be our ability to rightsize our marketing budget in the context of the current environment and will be tied, obviously, to our desire to grow headcount as we see opportunities for growth going forward. The final item is obviously leveraging our scale. So there is technology. There is real estate. Some of that is more a step function as opposed to overall growth. And I think that will be important to keep in mind. I think those are really the big issues. I think that this year was clearly in the context of the environment, a lower year for us. And we would expect numbers to be modestly higher for the next year."

I think we remain, first, committed to investing in our business. We then try to target a dividend payout ratio of around 40% to 50% on a full year basis. That's a target. That's not a policy. And then we effectively look to return any additional cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. The total payout ratio is really an output of how we see opportunities for the next year. It's not an input to our budgeting or financial planning process. And over the last few years, I think you've probably seen that our share repurchases broadly have been fairly constant in terms of dollar amounts. Obviously, as the share price has gone up, the number of shares that we're repurchasing is going down slightly. And we've been fairly consistent in trying to increase our dividend. So this year, the dividend is obviously up 9% to $2.50 a share. We've obviously reloaded our share repurchase authorization and, again, expect that next year's share repurchases from a dollar perspective would be broadly consistent with what we did in 2015. And we think, frankly, that combination has been very effective for shareholders. The dividend has now gone up at a compounded annual rate of about 11% over the last 5 years. We've got 13 million shares repurchased. I think we mentioned about a 13% unlevered return. And I think that's obviously good. And our share count is down roughly about 4% since we began this. And that's after issuing shares for deferred compensation while, at the same time, reinvesting in the business and effectively delevering as EBITDA has grown relative to our constant amount of long-term debt. So I think it's a balance. And I think we felt as we -- given the stability and diversification of our model and our ability just to deliver more consistent and predictable results that we can support that dividend going into this year."

As I said, we are seeing more institutions using index and the allocation to the various exposures as an active strategy. And I think this is one of the key characteristics that the market is not taking into the full context. In terms of institutions, I think into the fourth -- we said in the third quarter, institutions are pausing. They put some money to work in the fourth quarter. They put a lot of money to work at BlackRock in the fourth quarter. We're having deeper dialogue with more institutions today than we ever had. I mean, the dialogues we're having with some very large insurance companies, pension funds worldwide are very encouraging. Whether they act in the first quarter, the second quarter of 2017, we'll see. But I do believe clients are reassessing their liabilities in the form of pension funds. Clients are really looking at what their liability rates in the terms of insurance companies. They're looking at their asset allocations accordingly now and how they're going to do it. For insurance companies, the rise of interest rates, the steepening of the yield curves is very positive. And many insurance companies that I think I talked about early last year were short their liability. They were anticipating higher rates. And now with higher rates today, some of them are putting some money to work. So I don't want to -- I think it would be unfair to say that we're going to expect these types of flows, institutionally, at BlackRock quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, but we do feel very good about our positioning and working with our global institutions. In terms of the asset allocation, we are having dialogue with some clients right now. We're talking about -- more about alternatives. Rob Kapito has had 2 conversations with 2 large states in the last week about a bigger allocation in alternative. So I don't want to suggest there's one macro trend and one way of looking at asset allocation, but I can say we're involved in a lot of very deep conversations. And I do believe the market is still misunderstanding how people are using passive strategies. They're just not using them because they want to be indexed, they are using passive strategies that are very liquid, that they can navigate around markets to take active exposures."

We believe the DoL rule has some very great components to it. I mean, as you know, we've spoken for years and years and years that we have done a very bad job in our country in helping people navigate to the outcome of retirement. And having better outcome-oriented strategies, whether we have a DoL or not, is imperative or we're going to have more and more people angry that they're close to retirement with inadequate pools of money to retire. And that anger then does not go away. So we believe the DoL rule has quite a bit of merit, but I know as much as you do in terms of how that would change, if it's going to change. Does it get totally eliminated, we'll see. What we see in terms of behaviors, and this is the important thing, and Rob said it very well, we have not seen much change in behaviors from the large distribution platforms. As Rob suggested, they're moving from a brokerage relationship to an adviser relationship. They're moving ahead with doing more model-based structuring. In fact, we won the biggest -- we were a part of a big award in terms of how models are going to be created in terms of are they going to be using our products or not. So in terms of behaviors, most firms are moving forward that some component, if not all the components, of DoL will be moving forward. We are very active in helping -- whether the DoL rule happens or not, more and more of the distribution houses are saying, ""We need better technology to help us navigate our clients' relationships and their portfolios."" And that is why Aladdin for Wealth is growing very rapidly and has a potential for even more substantial growth in the future. So in terms of our relationships with most of our advisers, we are seeing very little in terms of behavior changes. Now I am not here to tell you, on April 1 this year, everything's going to change. Could it be elongated? Sure. But I don't -- but I do believe, in most cases, most large advisory firms believe this is a good thing for their clients and a good thing for them. And I believe we will see some form of DoL in the future, but I know as good as you what specifically does that mean."

We believe it's a mistake, the amount of cash that's sitting on the sidelines worldwide. The problem is clients say, ""Oh, I just missed the last 10% or 15%. Maybe I should stay on the sidelines longer."" Our job is to be helping our clients worldwide and helping them think about markets, thinking about exposures and helping them build an asset base to meet their liabilities. I don't believe, as you said, one quarter versus another is going to really determine whether we are seeing a renewed interest in putting the money to work. Certainly, in the fourth quarter, we did. Our dialogues that we're having worldwide indicate that we may see more money put to work, but I don't want to forecast that. I'm always disappointed of how much money is sitting in the sidelines. And I believe at the end of every year we talk about this that we need to have more of our clients, more of our investors to focus on the outcome of investing and not whether the market's rich or cheap because that gets caught up in getting in and out of the market and, therefore, missing big market movements. And this is a big issue. I believe this is one of the reasons why we're having deeper dialogue with our clients because we are talking about outcomes. We're not talking about a specific product. We're not talking active or passive. We're allowing our clients to make those decisions, whether they should have a bigger allocation in passive or active. We're making our clients determine whether they should be in high yield or an unconstrained bond fund. We're allowing our clients to work on how to navigate. We'll give them input about what we think, but I do believe the fourth quarter of 2016 positioned us well because of how we are constantly repeatingly talking about solution-based relationship."

It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
The differentiation and strength of BlackRock's diverse global investment and technology platform allowed us continue to invest for growth during 2016, despite market volatility and macro-political uncertainty during the year. We saw strong results in our iShares' institutional and technology businesses and remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. 
Against a challenging backdrop for the asset management industry, BlackRock, once again, executed on each component of our framework for shareholder value creation. BlackRock generated $202 billion of total net inflows in 2016, the strongest close in our history, including nearly $100 billion in the fourth quarter. We expanded our full year operating margin by 80 basis points to 43.7%. 
Finally, after investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders during the year. 
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $5.14, both up 8% from a year ago. 
Full year operating income of $4.7 billion was flat versus a year ago, while earnings per share of $19.29 was down 2%, reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher tax rate in 2016. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $6 million of net investment gains. Recall that nonoperating results in last year's fourth quarter included a $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.6%, reflecting the impact of several nonrecurring items compared to a rate of 30% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and potential tax reform. 
In an environment where growth in the asset management industry has been elusive, BlackRock's diverse global platform is thriving, delivering outcomes for our clients and differentiated organic growth for our shareholders. BlackRock's fourth quarter total net inflows of $98 billion included $88 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%; $18 billion of flows into our cash management business; and $7 billion of advisory outflows related to crisis-era portfolio liquidation assignments. 
For the full year 2016, BlackRock generated record total net inflows of $202 billion, including long-term net inflows of $181 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic growth rate. 
Fourth quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher-average AUM, but offset by the impact of divergent beta, FX and mix shift. 
For the full year, base fees were effectively flat. On a constant currency basis, base fees were up 3% versus last year's fourth quarter and 2% for the full year 2016. 
Sequentially, base fees were down 2% as the negative impact of fixed income beta, divergent equity beta and continued dollar appreciation more than offset organic fee growth in the period. 
While we delivered robust organic asset growth during the year, our blended fee rate has been impacted by a number of factors that we have repeatedly discussed with you, including divergent equity beta and dollar appreciation as well as recent client preferences for lower risk asset classes and index over active strategies. However, while these headwinds are pervasive in our industry, our broad-based, solutions-focused investment platform is built to meet client preferences in any environment, whether risk on or risk off. And we remain confident that BlackRock can consistently grow client assets and base fees, both of which ended 2016 at record highs. 
Fourth quarter performance fees of $129 million were driven by our single-strategy hedge fund and long-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $295 million decreased 52% from 2015, reflecting a challenging year for the hedge fund industry. 
BlackRock Solutions' fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was up 15% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Full year Aladdin revenue of $594 million, which represented 83% of BlackRock Solutions' revenue, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by a number of sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2016. 
Aladdin is coming off a record year in terms of new client revenue and continues to benefit from strong market demand for both institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries. We have seen particularly high levels of demand for our newest product, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, in the current regulatory environment and are actively implementing for clients in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
Total expense declined 3% in 2016, reflecting lower compensation expense and continued G&A expense discipline. For the full year, compensation expense decreased $122 million or 3%, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees. 
Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full-year basis. 
Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $55 million year-over-year or 13%, reflecting lower marketing and promotional spend in the current quarter and $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the year-ago quarter. 
Sequentially, fourth quarter G&A expense increased $43 million, primarily reflected a planned uptick in the year-end marketing and promotional spend and higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense. 
Full year G&A expense of $1.3 billion was 6% below 2015 levels despite the impact of acquisitions on our run rate, reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment. Assuming stable markets, we would expect a modestly higher level of G&A spend in 2017. 
Despite an overall decline in 2016 revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we delivered 4% organic asset growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin to 43.7% for the year. 
While we remain committed to realizing the benefits of our scale for clients and shareholders alike, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We do remain keenly focused on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
During 2016, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we enter 2017, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. 
Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.50 per share, representing an increase of 9% over the prior level. Since instituting our dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its annual dividend per share at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 21%. 
We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of shares in 2016 and now have repurchased over 13 million shares during the last 4 years, resulting in a 13% unlevered compounded annual return for our shareholders. We remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders and anticipate a similar annual level of share repurchases in 2017. However, such amounts could vary based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price. 
In connection with this ongoing commitment, our board has authorized an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9 million shares, including 3 million shares which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2015. 
Our 2016 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Record full year total net inflows of $202 billion, including nearly $100 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter, were diversified across asset classes and benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients used ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. Global iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. 
Fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $51 billion were driven by demand for U.S. market exposures, as equity markets rallied following the U.S. elections. Notwithstanding flat fourth quarter fixed income iShares flows, which were impacted by the significant move in long-term yields during the quarter, we continue to see an acceleration in the adoption of fixed income ETFs. 
Full year 2016 fixed income iShares inflows of $60 billion represented an organic growth rate of 24%. 
BlackRock's institutional franchise saw record long term net inflows of $41 billion for the quarter and $51 billion for the year, positive across active and index strategies for both periods. Quarterly institutional active inflows of $6 billion were led by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives, as clients utilized BlackRock's broad range of investment strategies and customized solutions to achieve their investment goals. Institutional index inflows of $35 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by fixed income inflows of $26 billion, which reflected solutions-based LDI activity, primarily in Europe. 
We also ended 2016 with another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last 4 years, we've raised more than $22 billion in commitments for our fund of funds, real estate, infrastructure, opportunistic credit and alt solution businesses and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw fourth quarter outflows of $2 billion and full year outflows of $11 billion, reflecting continued performance challenges in the active mutual fund industry as well as macro, political and regulatory uncertainty. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash business generated $18 billion and $29 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Investments we've made to expand the scale of our cash management offerings drove strong flows in 2016, and we are well positioned for additional demand and market share gains in the coming year. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of market volatility, divergent beta and significant currency movements, our diversified business model, once again, delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results that allowed us to continue investing for the future. We are committed to continuously evolving our platform as our clients' needs change, and believe our platform is well positioned as it's ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

And good morning to everyone and thanks for joining our call. In a year dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our client's trust by delivering strong results.",2216,"Thanks, Gary. Happy new year to everyone. And good morning to everyone and thanks for joining our call. 
In a year dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our client's trust by delivering strong results. BlackRock's fourth quarter and 2016 results reflect the benefits of continuously investing in our business to better serve our clients. We're building out our investment teams and resources. We're expanding our technology footprint. And we're evolving our risk management capabilities as we continue to anticipate change in the world, in our economies and, most importantly, in our industry. 
As a result, more and more investors are turning to BlackRock to design, to deliver investment solutions that will help them achieve their long-term financial goals. 
2016 was a turbulent year for investors, whether institutions or individual investors, one that no one fully predicted. Global political events like Brexit, the U.S. political -- U.S. presidential election and the Italian referendum have forced many of our clients and also ourselves to rethink our assumptions and our perceptions of the world. Even with some political surprises, the global economy began to show signs of optimism throughout 2016. 
The U.S. equity markets surged to all-time highs, as expectations for fiscal stimulus, reflation and tax and regulatory reform has sparked investor optimism and enthusiasm. The Fed's decision to raise rates in December and the signal of additional hikes in 2017 suggest that the long period of accommodative monetary policy in the U.S. may finally subside at a faster rate than many have -- had anticipated. However, uncertainty and the wave of populism upending the political status quo persists. And despite the rally in the U.S. for domestic equities since we've had our U.S. election, many of our investors are seeing a very different performance in the other markets. As Gary suggested, we see negative fixed income markets. We've seen underperforming international equities and a very strong dollar, which means for the dollar-based investors with broad global asset allocation, such as pension funds, the fourth quarter was more challenging than the market perception. 
We don't know exactly how the next few years will unfold, but we do know that in a challenging and changing environment, investors will look to BlackRock more than ever before. And our responsibility that we feel for our clients has never been greater. 
Throughout our history, BlackRock has always been focused on thinking ahead of our clients and repositioning our firm in advance of those perceived changes. 
Our results this year in a difficult environment for asset managers reflect the benefits of our deeper relationships that we built with our clients worldwide in areas where we've invested in our business over time. As Gary said, BlackRock saw total net inflows of $202 billion for the full year 2016, including nearly $100 billion in our fourth quarter. 
We generated record annual institutional and iShares flow of $51 billion institutionally and $140 billion in iShares. We actually grew net assets in 15 countries greater than $1 billion. We added more than 53 products in retail and iShares that generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. I think those 2 statistics alone identify the breadth of our platform. 
In 2016, the BlackRock Investment Institute reached more clients, regulators and policymakers than ever before, providing a forum for deep, timely and relevant dialogue on all macro issues. The Institute hosted calls after Brexit and the U.S. election, each time reaching nearly 5,000 external participants. This type of engagement has created tremendous value for our clients and built a deeper and more direct relationship with our clients. 
We acquired BGI and iShares franchise more than 6 years ago when iShares had $385 billion in AUM. Since then, we invested in the future of ETFs, building the market, expanding its presence, building a fixed income presence, a global presence, building products in anticipation of change of demand, whether it's factors or smart beta, and launched innovative new products. We've grown our iShares' AUM now to $1.3 trillion as more clients than ever before are using ETFs for transparent, liquid and efficient exposures, and we will continue to invest very aggressively in the growth and evolution of this market. 
iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion in inflows for the full year, earning the #1 market share of global U.S.-European equities and fixed income ETF flows for 2016. ETFs are being used by a diversified, growing set of institutional and retail clients. We are experienced, as I've said in many of these conferences, that we're seeing more and more investors using ETFs actively, not just for a passive exposure, but using them actively to try to get exposures where they think those exposures will outperform. We believe that will continue to be a great, great growth area for these products. And importantly, the expansion, the diversification of the ETF ecosystem is creating a deeper, more dynamic market for ETF trading. It is also enhancing liquidity for all investors worldwide. 
In 2016, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. core franchise to deliver the highest quality products at the best value to our clients at a time when they needed it most. We received very positive feedback from our clients on this move, and iShares gathered $29 billion in flows in our global core products in this quarter alone. 
We also continue to invest in fixed income ETFs. BlackRock has long seen the value in fixed income ETFs and has invested for years in building this market, even as many of our industry questioned this opportunity. 2016, the fixed income ETF industry reached a milestone, crossing $600 billion in assets, with BlackRock managing a large component of that. 
During heightened market movements after the U.S. election, trading volumes in the U.S. fixed income ETFs surged to the highest level of the year. Fixed income ETFs or iShares, once again, performed, under stress, in line with what our clients expected when they bought iShares, offering investors substantial on-exchange liquidity. 
Fixed income ETFs remain a strategic priority and a significant growth opportunity for BlackRock and our clients. 
Smart beta ETFs are another area of strategic investment for BlackRock, where we are the #1 player in AUM, growing at a 37% organic growth rate in 2016. 
We all know that in 2016, we saw retail investors shifting away from traditional active funds, with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry experiencing $280 billion of outflows, representing the industry's worst year on record. And we, at BlackRock, experienced some of the same headwinds across our traditional active mutual funds. But because the way we are positioned, because how we are trying to help our clients by having both passive and active, we're working with the clients as they navigate the need between active and passive. 
I believe investors are going to continue to rethink their approach to active management. They may now move more towards factor-based strategies. They may have asset allocation or portfolio construction, but I do believe we're going to continue to see a drive using ETFs for active returns. 
We have been purposefully investing in our platforms to provide our clients with a full spectrum of offerings and to enhance global -- to enhance alpha-generating active strategies. We ended the quarter with 88% of our taxable fixed income, 91% of our scientific active equity and 65% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. We are confident that our top-performing franchises, like Asian equities and our unconstrained fixed income, which have proven to thrive in a rising rate environment, are well positioned for 2017. 
Factor-based investing helps bridge the gap between active and index, and has been an area of significant focus for BlackRock and our clients in 2016. BlackRock manages over $150 billion in factor-based strategies, including smart beta ETFs, and our factor-based AUM grew at an organic growth rate in 2016 of 17%. 
We have a responsibility to provide our clients with the ability to focus on environmental and social issues, while simultaneously generating strong financial returns. We launched BlackRock's sustainable investing platform a year ago and have since built a range of equity and fixed income strategies that target positive environmental and social impact. 
We have frequently advocated for the benefits of an infrastructure investing. And within the U.S. alone, markets are anticipating up to $1 trillion of domestic infrastructure investments over the next few years. And we all know we desperately need those investments. BlackRock has built our infrastructure and brought our real estate platforms both organically and inorganically over time. And we currently manage $29 billion in real asset AUM. We invested in our global cash management business in anticipation of regulatory reform and a rising rate environment. BlackRock is now positioned as a scale player with the broadest range of solutions. At a time when we anticipated an uptick in demand, we saw $18 billion in flows in our fourth quarter alone. And now we have a cash management business that's over $400 billion. 
Over the past year, we have spoken to the increasing depth and quality of the solution orientation and solution-oriented conversations that BlackRock is having with [ph] other [ph] institutional clients in face of this global uncertainty. Even as these clients pause to assess the changing investment landscape, growth in 2016 was driven in particularly by our financial institution business, as insurance clients look to BlackRock for a highly customized portfolio. Our institutional business saw record fourth quarter and full year net inflows across both active and passive. We have the right pieces on our platform, but the key to designing and delivering a robust solution that targets specific outcomes for our clients is technology, which has always been at BlackRock's core. We see strong and growing demand for BlackRock's technology offerings. More and more asset managers, asset owners, banks, wealth managers, insurance companies are valuing the differentiating ability of our Aladdin platform and other technology offerings at BlackRock to help them achieve their goals. We are constantly enhancing our existing technology as well as coming up with new ways to use Aladdin to serve our clients. 
In 2016, we launched our Aladdin Risk for Wealth platform, which empowers wealth managers' home offices to better understand risk. We also introduced the Aladdin Portfolio Builder, which provides financial advisers with highly intuitive portfolio construction tools. We continue to see robust client interest in future adviser and iRetire offerings. We also recently announced a minority investment in partnership with iCapital, the leading technology-enabled illiquid alternative distribution platform for retail investors. 
In addition to technology, our people enable us to differentiate ourselves before our clients. Every year, together with our Board of Directors, we take a fresh look at our organization, which includes developing talent and positioning our leaders in a role that can broaden their experiences and maximize their potential for BlackRock and our clients. 
2016, we unified our Active Equity platform. We unified our beta platform, and we globalized our fixed income platform, all of which will help us benefit from the potential -- the full potential of our global investment scale. At the same time, to create a more tailored client experience in each geography where we operate, we strengthened our regional management of our clients and marketing activities in line with our commitment to be global with a local identity and a local footprint. It is the quality and dedication of our teams across the globe that position us well for 2017. 
There are reasons that we afford such trusting and trusted relationships with our clients and why our clients turn to BlackRock to solve the biggest financial challenges. I am really proud of the depth of the talent of the firm and the leadership we have today. We have never had a more talented group of men and women than we have today, and we have the finest leadership in the history of the firm today. BlackRock has been adept at repositioning our investment platform and technology capabilities in advance of change. I promise you we will continue to be in front of those needs, and we'll continue to change with the needs of our clients. 
As paradigms shift, we will have an even greater responsibility to help our clients navigate the markets and plans for their retirement. We have a responsibility to continue to invest in broadening and deepening our investment platform. We have a responsibility to be a thought and opinion leader worldwide, globally and locally, to every one of our clients. And throughout BlackRock's history, we have demonstrated the ability to invest in our business for growth like no other firm, while expanding our margins, raising our dividend rates and prudently returning capital to our shareholders. 
As we enter 2017, we will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future, to grow our technology footprint, to expand our investment capabilities and to further enhance our talent level, all to meet our daily responsibility to every client. Whether that client has awarded us $1,000 or if that client awarded us $10 billion, we have a responsibility to every client, and we are building a firm to meet those responsibilities every day. 
With that, let me open up for questions."

And so we had huge headwinds in the first half of the year. The other big headwind that we had all year, and actually accelerated in the fourth quarter, was the strength of the dollar. And so those are 2 of the big macro issues that we had to face. One of the great statistics that I think about going forward into next year, our average assets in 2016 were up 2%. Our spot close is up 11%, and that just gives you a color of some of the issues that we had. And I think that's a big macro context of thinking about how you should think about our business. Obviously, I'm going to have Gary go into the specificity of the fee rates, but I would just say, from the top of the house, I think -- you said it pretty well because the margin, I think scale is a driver that is so important in how we look at it. I mean, when we look at lowering fees for market share opportunities, for delivering the needs to our clients and having higher margins, this is what -- this is how we think about doing this, working and focusing on the clients' needs, doing what we think is best, building market share, but also driving margin. But let me have Gary go into the specificity of your question."

So look, I think -- let's deal with them separately. I think in terms of fee rate, there's really 4 primary reasons that you've seen a decline in our fee rate, whether year-over-year, quarter-over",547,"So good morning, Bill, and thanks for asking the question. So look, I think -- let's deal with them separately. I think in terms of fee rate, there's really 4 primary reasons that you've seen a decline in our fee rate, whether year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter or sequentially. First, obviously, is FX. We saw dollar appreciation, primarily versus the euro and the pound, roughly 4% on the euro, 16% against the pound during the year; and that obviously, relative to the stock of our business, increases the relative weighting of our dollar-denominated assets, which tend to have lower fees than our non-U.S. dollar-denominated product. In many cases, you're seeing a little bit of the same phenomenon in terms of equity beta. We've talked about divergent equity beta. But this year in particular, you saw various higher fee international markets, whether it be Europe, Asia X or Japan underperforming domestic U.S. markets. And as with FX, that also increases the relative weighting of our lower fee dollar-denominated assets under management. We saw mix shift. When we talk about mix shift, we really talk about that as a client preference issue. So during 2016, we saw clients favoring index over active. We saw clients favoring fixed income over equity and multi-asset. And even within our cash business, we saw a huge preference for government over prime funds. And in each of those instances, you're seeing changes in fee rates from what was traditionally higher fee product to, at least in this year, lower fee product. And then finally, we actually took some of our own action in terms of price reductions with certain iShares, core and fixed income, that was later in the year. But again, with that, what I would call, investment, we've been very clear that we think that would be accretive to shareholder value over time. And I think as you heard, we've had strong progress to date in terms of our core performance so far. So in each of these cases, all of these items are going to impact fee rates over time. But I think the key issue is, those set of circumstances, whether they're market-driven or client-driven, will also change over time. And I think the key issue for BlackRock is that we have a broad-based enough platform to be able to meet client preferences in any market, and to basically deliver solutions-based and outcomes to them that basically makes sense. So that's the fee rate piece of it. In terms of margins, I think what I would say as we think about margins, I'll give the standard statement that we don't manage to a margin target. I think you've all heard that long enough. But I think that in a year where we obviously saw a difference, i.e. 4% asset growth versus less organic-based fee growth, I think we were able to demonstrate that we can basically manage the business in that environment. And in fact, notwithstanding an overall decline in our revenues, which was fundamentally driven by performance fees, we were still able to deliver not only 80 basis points of margin improvement, but record flows during the year. So again, that interplay between revenue growth and margin, I think we're pretty well-established in terms of our ability to operate in most environments."

And without lowering the fees, we might not be included in some of the models that a lot of the clients are now using and distribution centers are using. But what's important to us is not only performance as one of the levers that we look to go out and use to get clients to buy our products, but also our competitive position and where we stand in price. And most of our mutual funds have boards that we also have to respond to as well. So since we've made the changes, 4 of our funds have been upgraded by Morningstar, 3 of the government funds and 1 of the high-yield funds, and they've all now become middle rated. And so that's important to us so that they are included in a lot of what our distribution forces can sell and how they're evaluated. So beyond performance, we also want to strive to be in at least the top quartile of expenses. And of course, in a very low rate environment, that also helps to drive performance. So the response has been very good by those that evaluate us. The response has been good by the distribution centers, and the response has been shown in creating and getting more assets. So over time, we're going to continue to be responsive to the competitive environment to make sure that we're included in the sales of these. And we expect that sales will continue."

And I think that one is one that we tried to manage appropriately in a year where we're seeing lots of clients delay their investment allocation decisions with a lot of volatility. We'll be, obviously, looking at that pretty carefully in the context of the current environment as we get into this year. We also, as you probably noticed, just also hired a new Chief Marketing Officer, Frank Cooper, who will be taking his own look at our marketing and our spending strategy that we'll clearly be taking a careful look at. There's also some other items that I think you have to be wary of where FX gets in the way. And also G&A impacts training, it has recruiting. It has a bunch of things that are obviously tied to broader growth objectives as we grow the company. We kept our headcount pretty flat last year, even -- that was even after our first quarter reduction that we talked about. and Larry communicated that we were going to continue to be in growth mode during the year, and we were. So I think, frankly, the big drivers of G&A spend going forward will clearly be our ability to rightsize our marketing budget in the context of the current environment and will be tied, obviously, to our desire to grow headcount as we see opportunities for growth going forward. The final item is obviously leveraging our scale. So there is technology. There is real estate. Some of that is more a step function as opposed to overall growth. And I think that will be important to keep in mind. I think those are really the big issues. I think that this year was clearly in the context of the environment, a lower year for us. And we would expect numbers to be modestly higher for the next year."

I think we remain, first, committed to investing in our business. We then try to target a dividend payout ratio of around 40% to 50% on a full year basis. That's a target. That's not a policy. And then we effectively look to return any additional cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. The total payout ratio is really an output of how we see opportunities for the next year. It's not an input to our budgeting or financial planning process. And over the last few years, I think you've probably seen that our share repurchases broadly have been fairly constant in terms of dollar amounts. Obviously, as the share price has gone up, the number of shares that we're repurchasing is going down slightly. And we've been fairly consistent in trying to increase our dividend. So this year, the dividend is obviously up 9% to $2.50 a share. We've obviously reloaded our share repurchase authorization and, again, expect that next year's share repurchases from a dollar perspective would be broadly consistent with what we did in 2015. And we think, frankly, that combination has been very effective for shareholders. The dividend has now gone up at a compounded annual rate of about 11% over the last 5 years. We've got 13 million shares repurchased. I think we mentioned about a 13% unlevered return. And I think that's obviously good. And our share count is down roughly about 4% since we began this. And that's after issuing shares for deferred compensation while, at the same time, reinvesting in the business and effectively delevering as EBITDA has grown relative to our constant amount of long-term debt. So I think it's a balance. And I think we felt as we -- given the stability and diversification of our model and our ability just to deliver more consistent and predictable results that we can support that dividend going into this year."

As I said, we are seeing more institutions using index and the allocation to the various exposures as an active strategy. And I think this is one of the key characteristics that the market is not taking into the full context. In terms of institutions, I think into the fourth -- we said in the third quarter, institutions are pausing. They put some money to work in the fourth quarter. They put a lot of money to work at BlackRock in the fourth quarter. We're having deeper dialogue with more institutions today than we ever had. I mean, the dialogues we're having with some very large insurance companies, pension funds worldwide are very encouraging. Whether they act in the first quarter, the second quarter of 2017, we'll see. But I do believe clients are reassessing their liabilities in the form of pension funds. Clients are really looking at what their liability rates in the terms of insurance companies. They're looking at their asset allocations accordingly now and how they're going to do it. For insurance companies, the rise of interest rates, the steepening of the yield curves is very positive. And many insurance companies that I think I talked about early last year were short their liability. They were anticipating higher rates. And now with higher rates today, some of them are putting some money to work. So I don't want to -- I think it would be unfair to say that we're going to expect these types of flows, institutionally, at BlackRock quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, but we do feel very good about our positioning and working with our global institutions. In terms of the asset allocation, we are having dialogue with some clients right now. We're talking about -- more about alternatives. Rob Kapito has had 2 conversations with 2 large states in the last week about a bigger allocation in alternative. So I don't want to suggest there's one macro trend and one way of looking at asset allocation, but I can say we're involved in a lot of very deep conversations. And I do believe the market is still misunderstanding how people are using passive strategies. They're just not using them because they want to be indexed, they are using passive strategies that are very liquid, that they can navigate around markets to take active exposures."

We believe the DoL rule has some very great components to it. I mean, as you know, we've spoken for years and years and years that we have done a very bad job in our country in helping people navigate to the outcome of retirement. And having better outcome-oriented strategies, whether we have a DoL or not, is imperative or we're going to have more and more people angry that they're close to retirement with inadequate pools of money to retire. And that anger then does not go away. So we believe the DoL rule has quite a bit of merit, but I know as much as you do in terms of how that would change, if it's going to change. Does it get totally eliminated, we'll see. What we see in terms of behaviors, and this is the important thing, and Rob said it very well, we have not seen much change in behaviors from the large distribution platforms. As Rob suggested, they're moving from a brokerage relationship to an adviser relationship. They're moving ahead with doing more model-based structuring. In fact, we won the biggest -- we were a part of a big award in terms of how models are going to be created in terms of are they going to be using our products or not. So in terms of behaviors, most firms are moving forward that some component, if not all the components, of DoL will be moving forward. We are very active in helping -- whether the DoL rule happens or not, more and more of the distribution houses are saying, ""We need better technology to help us navigate our clients' relationships and their portfolios."" And that is why Aladdin for Wealth is growing very rapidly and has a potential for even more substantial growth in the future. So in terms of our relationships with most of our advisers, we are seeing very little in terms of behavior changes. Now I am not here to tell you, on April 1 this year, everything's going to change. Could it be elongated? Sure. But I don't -- but I do believe, in most cases, most large advisory firms believe this is a good thing for their clients and a good thing for them. And I believe we will see some form of DoL in the future, but I know as good as you what specifically does that mean."

We believe it's a mistake, the amount of cash that's sitting on the sidelines worldwide. The problem is clients say, ""Oh, I just missed the last 10% or 15%. Maybe I should stay on the sidelines longer."" Our job is to be helping our clients worldwide and helping them think about markets, thinking about exposures and helping them build an asset base to meet their liabilities. I don't believe, as you said, one quarter versus another is going to really determine whether we are seeing a renewed interest in putting the money to work. Certainly, in the fourth quarter, we did. Our dialogues that we're having worldwide indicate that we may see more money put to work, but I don't want to forecast that. I'm always disappointed of how much money is sitting in the sidelines. And I believe at the end of every year we talk about this that we need to have more of our clients, more of our investors to focus on the outcome of investing and not whether the market's rich or cheap because that gets caught up in getting in and out of the market and, therefore, missing big market movements. And this is a big issue. I believe this is one of the reasons why we're having deeper dialogue with our clients because we are talking about outcomes. We're not talking about a specific product. We're not talking active or passive. We're allowing our clients to make those decisions, whether they should have a bigger allocation in passive or active. We're making our clients determine whether they should be in high yield or an unconstrained bond fund. We're allowing our clients to work on how to navigate.

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's competitive position has allowed us to continuously invest from a position of strength and to adapt and change our business model, always with the goal of being prepared to deliver outcomes for clients by leveraging a comprehensive set of technology and risk management capabilities. This strategy has fostered deeper client relationships and led to a differentiated and more consistent level of organic growth. 
BlackRock's first quarter results reflect an $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7% and an annualized organic base fee growth rate of 5%, highlighting the value of these investments and the success of our broad-based global technology and investment platform. 
Flows were positive across product type, client type and region. 
First quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 8% higher than a year ago, and despite cost associated with the repositioning of our active equity business, operating income of $1.2 billion grows 10%. Earnings per share of $5.25 were up 24% compared to a year ago, driven also by higher nonoperating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $42 million of net investment gains, an increase from the first quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter. First quarter net interest expense included $14 million of called premium expense associated with the current quarter's successful refinancing of our $700 million, 6.25% notes, which were called prior to their September 2017 maturity. Our issuance of $700 million of 10-year notes yielding 3.25% will result in a reduction of $21 million of annual interest expense going forward. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% compared to 29.6% a year ago and included an $81 million discrete tax benefit associated with the adoption of new accounting items related to stock-based compensation that were divested during the quarter. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. 
First quarter base fees were 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by the positive impact of market appreciation and organic growth on our average assets under management. 
On a constant currency basis, we estimate that base fees were approximately 9% year-over-year. 
Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. Growth in both year-over-year and sequential base fees was partially offset by the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter of 2017. 
Performance fees of $70 million increased $36 million from the first quarter of 2016, reflecting better hedge fund and loan-only performance but declines $59 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to seasonally higher fees from funds with performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter. 
Aladdin revenue up $158 million was up 12% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable implementations going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. 
Internally, we recently realigned Financial Markets Advisory, or FMA business, the Client Solutions and the BlackRock Investment Institute to offer clients a more cohesive and comprehensive advisory service. To better align our external reporting in light with this change, Aladdin revenue, previously reported within the BlackRock Solutions and advisory line item on our income statement will now be presented as technology and risk management revenue on our P&L. 
Advisory revenue associated with our FMA business will now be combined with other revenue and included as part of an advisory and other revenue line item. Technology is changing how the world invest and how we interact with clients. We continue to see strong market demand for institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, FutureAdvisor and other technology solutions as client seeks sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools. This new presentation, which is reflected in our first quarter income statement, is intended to sharpen the focus and our technology and risk management businesses at BlackRock. 
Total expense increased 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially driven by higher compensation of volume-related expense, lower G&A expense and $22 million of certain onetime expense associated with the recently announced strategic repositioning of our active equity platform. 
Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $78 million or 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven primarily by higher performance fees and higher operating income and approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of the active equity platform. 
Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was up 4%. Reflecting these repositioning costs, higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2017 brands, partially offset by lower incentive compensation resulting from seasonally lower performance fees and operating income in the current quarter. 
G&A expense was down 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional spend. 
Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $54 million from the fourth quarter or 15%, primarily reflecting the seasonal impact of lower marketing and promotional expense in the first quarter and reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense. 
Aggregate G&A expense for the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, including marketing and promotional expense, which we anticipate will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2017.  Assuming stable markets, we continue to expect a modestly higher level of full year G&A spend in 2017 as compared to 2016. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 42.6% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a continued focus on striking appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. We remain committed to leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. 
We also remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting on our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we previously announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
First quarter long-term net inflows of $80 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and regions. Long-term net inflows benefited from significant flows into iShares as both institutional and retail clients increased their use of ETFs as the building blocks for their portfolios and in combinations to drive active returns. 
Globalized shares generated record quarterly net inflows of $64 billion, representing 20% annualized organic growth, driven in part by an accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory and the wealth channel and by rapid adoption of iShares' ETFs as financier instruments by professional money managers.
iShares captured the #1 share of first quarter industry globally in the U.S., Europe and in equity and fixed income with our U.S. iShares franchise crossing over $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time.
 iShares' equity net inflows of $45 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares' net inflows of $20 billion were led by flows into investment-grade corporate and emerging market bond funds. 
Our institutional business generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, driven primarily by indexed inflows. 
Institutional active net outflows of $1 billion reflected net outflows of equity and fixed income, partially offset by inflows into multi-asset and alternatives. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath target-date series which saw a $5 billion of net inflows in the quarter, the strongest flow quarter in recent history. Excluding return of client capital, institutional alternatives generated over $2 billion of net inflows reflecting deployment of committed capital in infrastructure and private equity and hedge funds solutions. 
Momentum in alternatives is continuing, evidenced by yet another strong fundraising quarter for illiquids as we raised more than $2 billion of new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key growth area for BlackRock as further demonstrated by our recent announcement of the acquisition of the first reserve infrastructure funds. We expect this acquisition to close later this quarter, bringing total invested and committed infrastructure capital to approximately $14 billion. 
Retail net inflows of $5 billion were led by inflows into fixed income and indexed equity products, partially offset by outflows from world allocation strategies. Fixed income net inflows of [ $5 million ] were diversified across our top-performing platform and included $2 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into emerging markets and municipals. 
In addition, our multi-asset income strategy raised $1 billion during the first quarter as investors continue to target specific income-oriented outcomes. 
Our first quarter financial and business results reflect the benefits in the investments we've made to evolve our global distribution, investment in technology platforms ahead of developing client needs and industry trends. Diversification, whether investment style, distribution channel, product or region and scale created truly advantage competitive position that will enable us to continue making strategic investments with a goal of delivering long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

BlackRock first quarter results were a reflection of a purple sold investments we have made for our first 29 years to create the broadest investment platform in the asset manageme",2075,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. 
BlackRock first quarter results were a reflection of a purple sold investments we have made for our first 29 years to create the broadest investment platform in the asset management industry, complemented by global distribution network and industry-leading technology. 
Our full range of investment strategies was strength in index, factors, smart beta, quantitative and fundamental active and alternatives uniquely positioned BlackRock to develop a more holistic relationship and connect deeper with our clients. Our strong results this quarter are not a result of what we did over the last 3 months, but really a result over our long-term strategy. We have always kept our focus on a long-term, working to understand the evolution of the asset management ecosystem and the anticipate changes in our clients' needs so that we can adapt ahead of change and better meet their needs. 
For this reason, clients today rely on BlackRock not only for investment solutions, but also for our insights and guidance on how to navigate the global investment landscape. 
Over the past year, global events have had a significant impact in markets and investor sentiment. Following the presidential election, U.S. equity markets surged to an all-time high, driven by expectations for fiscal stimulus and regulatory reform and reflation expectations have been steadily increasing. However, there's still uncertainty, uncertainty about our health care, uncertainty about tax and trade reform, when they will ultimately be implement it in the United States and investor confidence has partially changed their significant issues related to tax reform, infrastructure spending, and so we need to see how this all involves. We are still optimistic, but we have to see how these all evolve. 
Strong first quarter equity returns have been driven by a synchronized recovery in global economic growth with the sharpness recovery seen internationally. However, it is unclear how social and political agendas will play out, particularly in Europe ahead of several elections, which is creating even more market anxiety. 
Furthermore, as the dollar remains strong following a period a significant appreciation, we could see further headwinds for dollar-based investors with global portfolios. 
Despite recent action by the Federal Reserve, the impact to sustain low rates at our clients portfolios will continue. Many clients today are struggling to meet their liability needs, and this will likely to continue and will likely remain a challenge. 
As I talked about in my recent Chairman's letter to our shareholders in our Annual Report, at the heart of BlackRock is a culture that embraces change. We, as an organization, we anticipate, we prepare, and we transform change into opportunities. 
As the landscape for asset managers evolve, a challenging narrative has emerged across the industry, one of managers having to play defense to protect themselves from market headwinds, structural changes and fee pressure. The reason much of the asset management industry is in defensive is that many managers are not evolved and they're playing catch up. We build BlackRock differently. Evolution is a part and a critical part of our culture. 
Throughout our history, we're focused on identifying political trends. We anticipated how those trends will impact our clients' needs and then we pivot our business accordingly. 
As a result, we build [indiscernible] equipped with investment strategies and technology, one that is agile. We seek to adapt change -- we seek to adapt ahead of change, not in response to it. However, we also recognize that sometimes, we make a misstep and addressing those quickly as just as important. 
BlackRock has a full range of investment strategies, from market cap weighted index exposures at one end, to a illiquid alternatives at the other and everything in between. We've created technology capable of bringing those building blocks together to design and deliver outcomes for our clients, and we built unmatched scale that strategically positions us to create value for our clients and our shareholders. 
Now is the time more than ever for BlackRock to play offense. Our scalable investment in technology platform is our greatest durable competitive advantage. And going forward, we will continue to identify opportunities to use our advantaged market position to create better financial futures for clients and drive long-term growth for shareholders. 
We're using our scale to lower prices for clients and drive growth and market share increases for BlackRock and our U.S. iShares core ETFs. We're using our scale to create more efficient relationships with our service providers. And earlier this year, we announced our plans to move $1 trillion of custodial assets. 
We're using our scale to build industry-leading technology to optimize investment performance and outcomes for our clients. We're using our scale to enhance our talent profile by tapping into a diverse network. And we're using our skills to make tactical, filling out acquisitions that further enhances our platform, our technology capabilities and our geographic reach. 
This approach is widening our competitive advantage and driving our ability to generate consistent strong organic growth. And we're going to continue to press our competitive advantage going forward, always with the best interest of our clients and our shareholders. 
In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing a 7% annualized organic growth. Closer positive across product types, client types in all our regions. Record ETF flows were tangible example of the fundamental change we see in the ecosystem of wealth management and capital markets. 
Simple building blocks like iShares core is a strategic holding for long-term investors. Fixed income ETFs along side bonds for institutions, large asset owners taking greater control of portfolio risk profiles with factor-based ETFs, and and more and more investors are using a combination of ETFs to generate active returns. 
The investment landscape is changing and BlackRock is investing in iShares to lead industry growth in evolution. iShares saw a record first quarter inflows of $64 billion as clients saw ETFs in their portfolio, both for index exposures and as building blocks to deliver Alpha. 
Last October, we anticipated key changes impacting our retail and institutional clients that would change the way large pools of assets will be managed. We made a deliberate strategic investment in our U.S. iShares core ETFs, positioning this business to offer the highest quality product at the best value for our clients. This strategy is working, posting organic revenue and asset growth that exceeded our expectations. 
Since this strategic repricing, we have seen acceleration in growth in our iShares U.S. core ETFs with $52 billion of net inflows representing a 50% annualized organic growth. 
We've experienced a sizable uptick in our core market share, and we have recaptured more than 50% of the revenue impact through organic growth alone. 
Several years ago, we anticipated growing interest from our clients and factors in smart beta. Those strategies remain a significant area of focus for BlackRock, and BlackRock is positioned to win. We saw $2 billion in net inflows into BlackRock's smart beta ETFs in the first quarter, contributing to the total factor-based net inflows of $3 billion in our first quarter. The combination of our technology platform, our distribution connectivity, our commitment to risk management and our broad investment platform will enable us to be a leader in this space. 
We believe in active management more than ever before, especially in less efficient market where returns are less correlated. But we believe going forward, clients will be looking for different ways and different things from Active Equity and Alpha will need to be generated in the new ways. 
In October, we refined and expanded our active fixed income platform. 90% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund platform now offers top quartile performance and top quartile pricing. I constrain product ranges also is well positioned for a rising rate environment, and we're beginning to see momentum with over $2 billion in net inflows in the quarter. 
As active equity management is being reshaped by massive investments in technology and data science and clients are focusing more in outcomes, we recently revitalized our active equity platform so that we are in a position to officially and consistently deliver investment performance to our clients. We segmented our product offerings into a range of strategies that span different levels of Alpha generation and value with appropriate manufacturing cost for BlackRock, and we are harnessing the power of people in technology as we lean into supporting both our fundamental and our quantitative equity managers with a shared data science and technology capabilities. We believe that levering our global scale and technology, we can drive better outcomes for our clients and future growth for BlackRock. 
At the end of the quarter, 65% of our fundamental active equities at 85% of our scientific active equity assets were above benchmark or paramedian for the 3-year period. 
The investments that we made in iShares, in our active fixed income and in our active equity is about leveraging our breadth, our scale and our technology to reap the benefits of our competitive advantages to drive growth. And we will continue to find ways to lever those unique strengths. 
As we look for other opportunities evolve for our clients, alternatives remain a key area of focus as our clients increasingly are searching for additional source of income and hopefully, uncorrelated returns. We saw another strong fundraising quarter with $2 billion of commitments, and we now have more than $12 billion uninvested committed capital to invest going forward across our $100 billion core alternative platform. 
We continue to advocate for infrastructure investing and support of policies to unlock private capital which offer multiple benefits, including providing new sources of return for investors, creating jobs, improving productivity and increasing capacity for long-term economic growth. 
Today, we manage $30 billion in real assets, and we expect this to continue area of growth BlackRock. 
As we look to enhance BlackRock's global credit platform, last month, we brought in Tim O'Hara to lead BlackRock's Credit business alongside Jim Keenan. Believe that the combination of BlackRock's long established presence and expertise in fixed income and our growing alternative platform positions us to be a leading provider in both liquid and illiquid credit, which provides attractive risk-adjusted opportunity for our clients who are seeking differentiated sources of income. 
While technology has always been a key differentiator for BlackRock, it is more essential to our business than ever before. We believe technology can transform our industry with enhanced technology and risk management helping investors achieve better outcomes. And we, at BlackRock, are leading the transformation. Our goal is to be the most sophisticated user of data and technology in the financial services industry. We seek to transform and integrate the way assets and wealth managers are creating client outcomes through portfolio construction, asset allocation, risk management and digital distribution. 
Our Aladdin technology is being used by more than clients than ever before with revenues growing 12% year-over-year and demand for Aladdin's multi-asset capabilities by institutions globally, especially in Europe and Latin America, remains strong. 
We also continued to see momentum in retail demand for Aladdin as interest continues to increase for Aladdin risk for wealth manager, which provides intermediaries with institutional quality portfolio of construction, modeling and risk management technology.  We are currently implementing a handful of clients in this technology in the United States, in Europe and in Asia. 
Aladdin remains in the only integrated investment risk management system on the market, and we believe this differentiation will continue to drive the attractive value oppositions and premium price points. 
In line with a commitment to technology, we recently nominated Chuck Robbins to our Board of Directors. Chuck has helped global corporations navigate a world being reshaped by technology advancements. We have consistently and consciously developed our board with the eye towards the future, and Chuck brings a deep understanding of technology promise to our board at a critical time for BlackRock. 
Building on record total net inflows of $202 billion in 2016, we began 2017 by continuing to invest in our business to capture the opportunities ahead of us, to drive continued growth and to aggressively leverage the benefits of our scale. We are transforming the change around us into the opportunities for the future, finding new methods to generate sustainable Alpha, using technology in innovative ways, building on our platform to serve our clients' evolving needs, creating continued opportunities for our employees and delivering consistent returns for our shareholders.

As I said in my prepared remarks, we're seeing Aladdin interest in LatAm, in Europe. We have wealth management, Aladdin for wealth management integration going on right now in Asia. And so it's continuing to drive our platform, but where I'm most pleased, and I think has been the evolution of Aladdin beyond what its core competency was a few years back by allowing -- by having the ability to work with our wealth management clients and helping them having the analytical capacity to analyze the risk of every single client they have. And so especially in a world that is moving with MiFID II, with a world that is moving more towards advisory, less brokerage, I believe the need for greater oversight, greater understanding is going to be necessary and the Aladdin platform is one of the options that many people have to drive that technology knowledge. And then we will continue to do acquisitions. We have a few areas that we're looking at right now to further add opportunities that we have in technology. But let me just say importantly what technology is for BlackRock. It's the core of our culture, so -- and what I do believe with our clients are finding, when they have the Aladdin platform, and you have the singularity of one technology platform throughout an organization is driving our clients culture. And I do believe this is going to continue to drive a component of the growth that we see for Aladdin. So we're quite excited.

Good morning. So maybe I'll take a crack at that for you. I think if we could start, recall from Investor Day, which was, I guess, about 9 months ago, we showed the chart at Investor Day that detailed how despite growth of about $1.3 billion in our base fees, and I think it was from 2012 to '15, so that chart is a little dated now. Despite that growth, our fee rate had actually declined by a little over one basis point. I think it was about 1.3 basis points. Organic growth drove about 30% of the revenue growth over that period of time, and actually, expanded our fee rate by about 1 basis point. That, I would basically refer you to as mixed shift, and that is a phenomenal where our organic base fee growth is actually growing faster than our organic asset growth, which frankly, with the exception of last year has done pretty continuously. While beta and FX drove about 70% of the revenue growth, which, again, are elements outside of our direct control. It actually caused a 2 basis point decline in the fee rate over the time period, and that is really what we talked about as being divergent beta and FX. It actually increases our revenue, but it actually decreases our fee rate. And if you think about it pretty simply, the S&P has significantly outperformed global and emerging markets, and we've seen significant dollars strengthening by somewhere between 20% and 25% versus the pound and the euro. And what does that do to us that actually causes our dollar-denominated assets to increase, which have lower fees versus products in Europe and Asia and especially in emerging markets. Now bear in mind over the time period, there really were no meaningful fee cuts to speak of. Obviously, we did launch the core in the fall of 2012. Last year, just to true-up that chart, the fee rate declined about 1 basis point despite another year of positive organic fee growth in a tough market. And I think we've talked a lot about that where the trends were generally the same. But if you look back, whether it was -- we really general organic fee base growth of 6% in '13 and '14 and '15. And while it dipped to 1% last year, we generated 5% organic base fee growth in the first quarter, and that's even with the fee cuts that we have announced both in fixed income and iShares. So I think the bottom line really is divergent beta and FX in many cases, which is repricing in some respects $5 trillion of assets every day. But I also think that we are, as Larry mentioned, we really feel that we're as well positioned as we've ever been to grow not only assets, but also base fees in a variety of markets and really differentiate ourselves in terms of organic growth through a variety of market cycles."

I think if we can generate sustainable Alpha in a way that that -- in some ways kind of captures 3 to 4x the the fee over time, I think will be fine. If we're in a period of significantly lower returns and lower sustainable Alpha, then, obviously, I think fee rates are going to have to come down accordingly."

There's a greater belief that long-term returns are structurally lower than they were 10 and 20 years ago. So if you have expected long-term return of, let's say, 6%, which many people think that might be high when you look at a balanced portfolio. Fees take up a lot of that return. And as long as we believe the world is going to be in a low return environment, our clients are under a lot of pressure and clients are looking for different ways of seeking those outcomes. And this is why I actually believe why more clients are coming to us now because they have this structural problem. There liability or their actuarial needs are greater than they can earn with our asset base, and so they're looking either to buy build, they're looking to have less expensive products. But there are looking for a much more holistic solution. And I think the era where a manager sold a product, a sold product that is what's being threatened today. And as Rob just said, we're in a great position with our clients to try to help them with these really difficult issues. We've had a couple state funds and announced that they're lowering their actuarially ill rates, that's very hard to do. If a state fund lowers their actuarial rate, that means they have to go to their unions and say, pay more. That means they have to go to the state and say, contribute more. And so this is one of the real issues that I think is being lost. It's being -- so when you talk about -- when we talk about fee pressure, fee pressure comes from the real issue of lower expected returns. And I think this is one of the big issues around hedge funds and why we are constantly reading about some hedge funds closing, some hedge funds are lowering their fees because the fee structures are just too large versus the returns on a risk-adjusted basis that they are achieving. So this is a broad-based issue. It's not just in the wealth management area, it's across a spectrum of clients. I wont belaboring this point, but I think it's a very important point. But this is the environment we all live in, and I think this is in an environment that really positioned BlackRock in a very differentiated way. So we understand this problem, we are dealing with this issue, and we're taking advantage of it. I'll leave it at that."

So we look at technology not just for portfolio, construction portfolio management, we're using it for client connectivity, we're using it for efficiencies within our platform. The technology investments we've made in Aladdin related to dealing with a custodial bank saves us large sums of money, so I want to talk about. Technology is changing every component of our firm. And I think this is one of the reasons why our margins have been consistently strong by the utilization of technology across all the spectrums. You asked specifically related to technology, related to investing. Because the advancements to technology, because the utilization of sensor technology, because the Internet playing a role in everything and anything we do, there is information that we could not search for or find years ago whether it is communication by employees about their firms and consumer sentiments about a product. And so by having the ability to do deep dives on data, interpreting that data through different algorithms and models, hopefully that will be creating Alpha. As it creates products, it creates product turns, and so that's where we look at the greatest amount of investments. We're also looking at computers and can computers be learning and adapting in markets, but that's something for the future. But importantly, technology today for data analysis, technology for very quick analysis of that data is going to be really the key component of driving, I believe, returns and active investing in the future. And I do believe, because technology has created the efficiencies, it creates more efficiencies across, and we can't pass on this efficiencies also to our clients. And this is one thing is being missed. Here we are as we talk about some of the fee cuts and yet we have an increase of 100 basis points in margins. So we look at technology as a great efficiency provider for investing, for custodial assets, for communicating with our custodial clients, for communicating with our employees, for communicating with our clients. So it is the key element that is going to transform BlackRock, and I would say, every other financial services company. So technology is what is driving the scale at BlackRock, and it's driving, hopefully, better outcomes for and to our clients."

And quite frankly, after many years in the business, I can't think of a better product to use for asset allocation than ETFs. So one is, it's going to be tool where we're going to use it for our precision type investments where you can accent one specific area of the market in your portfolio. Two is that you can actually make better judgments in the Active Equity space by using what we would call smart beta ETF, so that would be a bit of a derivative to it, but focused on certain factors that you want to have. Three is that it's an obvious part of a multi-asset solution, which is a growing area of the market where you'd have just you need in order to get the returns that Larry is talking about in a low interest rate environment, you need to focus on specific sectors of the market and ETFs will allow you to do that at the right value. And the third thing, which I really like is in the fixed income area, where the exposure to just one particular fixed income bond is not going to give you that type of return. There's just too much risk from the cost of that. So by using an ETF in the asset allocation model in your fixed income portion, you also are diversifying your risk substantially at a much lower cost. Also, the world is moving more towards portfolio of construction capabilities. This is going to be what we're calling models that we're going to be offering. They offer much higher levels of risk management, and here is where we can utilize our technology as a differentiator. Because we can actually deliver a multi-asset solution, which has the right risk requirements for that particular client. And we're building technology around that. So you've heard us mention Aladdin portfolio builder where we're giving financial advisers the ability to take a multi-asset portfolio and put it together using our products, using other peoples' products to come up with the ultimate solution. We're using it in a product that we call iRetire, where we're trying to help get in the middle of solving probably the largest problem facing our country and others today, which is the lack of savings for retirement, getting those -- getting that cash and sitting on the sidelines, working for people for those people that are going to retire and being able to illustrate to financial advisors and their clients better capabilities to achieve those results. And then also, expanding into, giving model portfolios to the financial advisers and to our clients to use to solve their problems. So we have the technology on the outside. And then on the inside, we had precision instruments through the ETF business that can help our clients achieve their financial objectives."

I'll just give a little bit of a quick overview and then Larry and Rob can jump in as they feel. I mean, I think ultimately, we're looking at both efficiencies and development and maturity of markets. And when we think here about the repositioning, it really follows much more along the line of how we approach our product segmentation work with iShares a number of years ago at the end of 2012. And in that case, it was really trying to align who the particular buyers or the product were with the right fees. And in this case, it was really trying to align our ability to generate sustainable Alpha in certain products with the fee potential. And so if you think about segmenting the products between kind of core Alpha and high conviction in some respects, I think it's somewhat of an acknowledgment that in many parts of the U.S., large cap markets, in particular, ability to really generate sustainable Alpha and still charge premium fees in terms of very broad-based portfolios that really tinker around indexes. I don't want investors to think index hugging per se, but your ability to take risk and generate incremental returns need to be much more closely aligned with the fee potential. And so it was really in that context that we really try to align fee with the ability to generate a certain level of sustainable Alpha. Outside of the U.S. market, in lesser developed markets, less efficient markets, less dispersion, less correlation I think we feel strongly in places like Europe and Asia and certain emerging markets that frankly, the ability to generate sustainable Alpha can support higher fees. And I think our performance has certainly showed that over time."

Aladdin is more than just a risk management platform, it's an enterprise platform. So, A, there are many companies that provide enterprise platform for different companies, whether it's Oracle or SAP or cloud computing, so an enterprise system, and that's what Aladdin really is because it's a front and back office platform and a component of it is risk management. I think you're referring to the risk management component of it. It's a service model. We provide with different models each individual client can put their own algorithms onto a Aladdin that are customized for them. So they can interpret the models, so it's not a platform that is monolithic with one model. And so the notion that the fact that many people use it that it becomes systemic is just not a point of understanding what a platform really is. I think by the clients interest, the opportunities we have, the opportunities as large as ever, and it is because of its enterprise solution. And as we now have Aladdin provider working with the custodial banks, ultimately, it's going to simplify our trading -- trade entry, compliance, working alongside with a custodial bank, we create so much more efficiencies for the users across the Aladdin system. So if we could provide for Aladdin, for all the clients this enterprise system that creates these taped efficiencies that make them in a better position, we're all better off from it. So it's, once again, Aladdin as a service model, it's not BlackRock's models. So I think we have -- we're happy to give you a demo on Aladdin, what it is and what it isn't."

I'm hoping that you'll see both. I mean, as Rob said, part of repositioning the active portfolio was basically trying to use scale to bring better outcomes to clients, obviously, in terms of better sustainable Alpha at a more efficient price point for them. But the intent the end of the day is to generate incremental growth for BlackRock shareholders by having a better value proposition in terms of pricing performance that we think ultimately will drive better organic growth. In terms of some of the things you mentioned around just leveraging service providers in many cases in certain instances our clients pay those fees in which case that will be a direct benefit for them and in a certain cases, it's as if our ETF, which is a unitary price structure BlackRock itself pays those fees so our shareholders will clearly benefit. So I think that in all cases, we're going to basically try to use our scale to drive growth. That growth is ultimately better for both clients as well as shareholders. And I think as you look at margin expansion over -- whether it's just the last year-over-year where it's 100 basis points or frankly, ever since we closed the BGI deal at the end of 2009, margins are probably up 400 to 500-plus basis points since then and I think there's no question that we're using our scale to generate better outcomes for both clients and shareholders. So it's good for the client at the end of the day. We strongly believe it's going to be good for the BlackRock shareholders."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's competitive position has allowed us to continuously invest from a position of strength and to adapt and change our business model, always with the goal of being prepared to deliver outcomes for clients by leveraging a comprehensive set of technology and risk management capabilities. This strategy has fostered deeper client relationships and led to a differentiated and more consistent level of organic growth. 
BlackRock's first quarter results reflect an $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7% and an annualized organic base fee growth rate of 5%, highlighting the value of these investments and the success of our broad-based global technology and investment platform. 
Flows were positive across product type, client type and region. 
First quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 8% higher than a year ago. And despite cost associated with the repositioning of our active equity business, operating income of $1.2 billion gross 10%. Earnings per share of $5.25 were up 24% compared to a year ago, driven also by higher nonoperating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $42 million of net investment gains, an increase from the first quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter. First quarter net interest expense included $14 million of called premium expense associated with the current quarter's successful refinancing of our $700 million, 6.25% notes, which were called prior to their September 2017 maturity. Our issuance of $700 million of tenure notes yielding 3.25% will result in a reduction of $21 million of annual interest expense going forward. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% compared to 29.6% a year ago and included an $81 million discrete tax benefit associated with the adoption of new accounting items related to stock-based compensation awards divested during the quarter. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. 
First quarter base fees were 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by the positive impact of market appreciation and organic growth on our average assets under management. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew approximately 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. Growth in both year-over-year and sequential base fees was partially offset by the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter of 2017.  
Performance fees of $70 million increased $36 million from the first quarter of 2016, reflecting better hedge fund and loan-only performance. but declines $59 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to seasonally higher fees from funds with a performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter. 
Aladdin revenue of $158 million was up 12% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable implementations going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. 
Internally, we recently realigned Financial Markets Advisory, or our FMA business, with Client Solutions and the BlackRock Investment Institute to offer clients a more cohesive and comprehensive advisory service. To better align our external reporting in light of this change, Aladdin revenue, previously reported within the BlackRock Solutions and advisory line item on our income statement, will now be presented as technology and risk management revenue on our P&L. Advisory revenue associated with our FMA business will now be combined with other revenue and included as part of an advisory and other revenue line item. 
Technology is changing how the world invest and how we interact with clients. We continue to see strong market demand for institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for wealth management, FutureAdvisor and other technology solutions as clients seek sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools. This new presentation, which is reflected in our first quarter income statement, is intended to sharpen the focus on our technology and risk management businesses at BlackRock. 
Total expense increased 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially driven by higher compensation and volume-related expense, lower G&A expense and $22 million of certain onetime expense associated with the recently announced strategic repositioning of our active equity platform. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $78 million, or 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation driven primarily by higher performance fees and higher operating income, and approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of the active equity platform. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was up 4%, reflecting these repositioning costs, higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2017 grants, partially offset by lower incentive compensation resulting from seasonally lower performance fees and operating income in the current quarter. 
G&A expense was down 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $54 million from the fourth quarter, or 15%, primarily reflecting the seasonal impact of lower marketing and promotional expense in the first quarter and reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense. 
Aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, including marketing and promotional expense, which we anticipate will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2017.  Assuming stable markets, we continue to expect a modestly higher level of full year G&A spend in 2017 as compared to 2016. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 42.6% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a continued focus on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. We remain committed to leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. 
We also remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting on our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we previously announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
First quarter long-term net inflows of $80 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and regions. Long-term net inflows benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients increased their use of ETFs as the building blocks for their portfolios and in combinations to drive active returns. 
Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $64 billion, representing 20% annualized organic growth, driven in part by an accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth channel and by rapid adoption of iShares' ETFs as financier instruments by professional money managers.
iShares captured the #1 share of first quarter industry first globally in the U.S., Europe and in equity and fixed income with our U.S. iShares franchise crossing over $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time.
iShares' equity net inflows of $45 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares' net inflows of $20 billion were led by flows into investment-grade corporate and emerging market bond funds. 
Our institutional business generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, driven primarily by indexed inflows. 
Institutional active net outflows of $1 billion reflected net outflows of equity and fixed income, partially offset by inflows into multi-asset and alternatives. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath target-date series, which saw $5 billion of net inflows in the quarter, the strongest flow quarter in recent history. Excluding return of client capital, institutional alternatives generated over $2 billion of net inflows, reflecting deployment of committed capital in infrastructure and private equity and hedge fund solutions. 
Momentum in alternatives is continuing, evidenced by yet another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid as we raised more than $2 billion of new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key growth area for BlackRock as further demonstrated by our recent announcement of the acquisition of the First Reserve Infrastructure Funds. We expect this acquisition to close later this quarter, bringing total invested and committed infrastructure capital to approximately $14 billion. 
Retail net inflows of $5 billion were led by inflows into fixed income and indexed equity products, partially offset by outflows from world allocation strategies. Fixed income net inflows of $5 million were diversified across our top-performing platform and included $2 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into emerging markets and municipals. 
In addition, our multi-asset income strategy raised $1 billion during the first quarter as investors continue to target specific income-oriented outcomes. 
Our first quarter financial and business results reflect the benefits in the investments we've made to evolve our global distribution, investment and technology platforms ahead of the developing client needs and industry trends. Diversification, whether investment style, distribution channel, product or region and scale, create a truly advantage competitive position that will enable us to continue making strategic investments with the goal of delivering long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

BlackRock's first quarter results were a reflection of the purposeful investments we have made over our first 29 years to create the broadest investment platform in the asset mana",2078,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. 
BlackRock's first quarter results were a reflection of the purposeful investments we have made over our first 29 years to create the broadest investment platform in the asset management industry, complemented by a global distribution network and industry-leading technology. 
Our full range of investment strategies with strength in index, factors, smart beta, quantitative and fundamental active and alternatives uniquely position BlackRock to develop a more holistic relationship and connect deeper with our clients. Our strong results this quarter are not a result of what we did over the last 3 months, but really a result over our long-term strategy. We have always kept our focus on the long-term, working to understand the evolution of the asset management ecosystem and the anticipated changes in our clients' needs, so that we can adapt ahead of change and better meet their needs. For this reason, clients today rely on BlackRock not only for investment solutions, but also for our insights and guidance on how to navigate the global investment landscape. 
Over the past year, global events have had a significant impact in markets and investor sentiment. Following the presidential election, U.S. equity markets surged to an all-time high, driven by expectations for fiscal stimulus and regulatory reform. And reflation expectations have been steadily increasing. However, there's still uncertainty, uncertainty about our health care, uncertainty about tax and trade reform, when they will ultimately be implemented in the United States. And investor confidence has partially changed. There are significant issues related to tax reform, infrastructure spending, and so we need to see how this all involves. We are still optimistic, but we have to see how these all evolve. 
Strong first quarter equity returns have been driven by a synchronized recovery in global economic growth with the sharpest recovery seen internationally. However, it is unclear how social and political agendas will play out, particularly in Europe ahead of several elections, which is creating even more market anxiety. 
Furthermore, as the dollar remains strong following a period of significant appreciation, we could see further headwinds for dollar-based investors with global portfolios. 
Despite recent action by the Federal Reserve, the impact to sustain low rates on our clients' portfolios will continue. Many clients today are struggling to meet their liability needs, and this will likely to continue and will likely remain a challenge. 
As I talk about in my recent Chairman's letter to our shareholders in our Annual Report, at the heart of BlackRock is a culture that embraces change. We, as an organization, we anticipate, we prepare, and we transform change into opportunities. 
As the landscape for asset managers evolve, a challenging narrative has emerged across the industry, one of managers having to play defense to protect themselves from market headwinds, structural changes and fee pressure. The reason much of the asset management industry is in defensive is that many managers have not evolved and they're playing catch up. We build BlackRock differently. Evolution is a part and a critical part of our culture. Throughout our history, we have focused on identifying critical trends. We anticipated how those trends will impact our clients' needs and then we pivot our business accordingly. As a result, we build a firm that is equipped with investment strategies and technology, one that is agile. We seek to adapt change -- we seek to adapt ahead of change, not in response to it. However, we also recognize that sometimes, we make a misstep and addressing those quickly is just as important. 
BlackRock has a full range of investment strategies, from market cap weighted index exposures at one end to liquid alternatives at the other and everything in between. We've created technology capable of bringing those building blocks together to design and deliver outcomes for our clients. And we built unmatched scale that strategically positions us to create value for our clients and our shareholders. 
Now is the time more than ever for BlackRock to play offense. Our scalable investment in technology platform is our greatest durable competitive advantage. And going forward, we will continue to identify opportunities to use our advantaged market position to create better financial futures for clients and drive long-term growth for shareholders. 
We're using our scale to lower prices for clients and drive growth and market share increases for BlackRock and our U.S. iShares core ETFs. We're using our scale to create more efficient relationships with our service providers. And earlier this year, we announced our plans to move $1 trillion of custodial assets. We're using our scale to build industry-leading technology to optimize investment performance and outcomes for our clients. We're using our scale to enhance our talent profile by tapping into a diverse network. And we're using our scale to make tactical, filling out acquisitions that further enhances our platform, our technology capabilities and our geographic reach. 
This approach is widening our competitive advantage and driving our ability to generate consistently strong organic growth. And we're going to continue to press our competitive advantage going forward, always with the best interest of our clients and our shareholders. 
In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing a 7% annualized organic growth, closer positive across product types, client types and all our regions. Record ETF flows were a tangible example of the fundamental change we see in the ecosystem of wealth management and capital markets. 
Simple building blocks like iShares core is a strategic holding for long-term investors. Fixed income ETFs along side bonds for institutions, large asset owners taking greater control of portfolio risk profiles with factor-based ETFs, and more and more investors are using a combination of ETFs to generate active returns. 
The investment landscape is changing, and BlackRock is investing in iShares to lead industry growth in evolution. iShares saw a record first quarter inflows of $64 billion as clients saw ETFs in their portfolio, both for index exposures and as building blocks to deliver alpha. 
Last October, we anticipated the key changes impacting our retail and institutional clients that would change the way large pools of assets will be managed. We made a deliberate strategic investment in our U.S. iShares core ETFs, positioning this business to offer the highest-quality product at the best value for our clients. This strategy is working, posting organic revenue and asset growth that exceeded our expectations. Since the strategic repricing, we have seen an acceleration in growth in our iShares U.S. core ETFs with $52 billion of net inflows, representing a 50% annualized organic growth. 
We have experienced a sizable uptick in our core market share. And we have recaptured more than 50% of the revenue impact through organic growth alone. 
Several years ago, we anticipated growing interest from our clients and factors in smart beta. Those strategies remain a significant area of focus for BlackRock, and BlackRock is positioned to win. We saw $2 billion in net inflows into BlackRock's smart beta ETFs in the first quarter, contributing to the total factor-based net inflows of $3 billion in our first quarter. The combination of our technology platform, our distribution connectivity, our commitment to risk management and our broad investment platform will enable us to be a leader in this space. 
We believe in active management more than ever before, especially in less-efficient markets where returns are less correlated. But we believe going forward, clients will be looking for different ways and different things from Active Equity. And alpha will need to be generated into new ways. 
In October, we refined and expanded our active fixed income platform. 90% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund platform now offers top quartile performance and top quartile pricing. Our unconstrained product range is also well positioned for a rising rate environment, and we are beginning to see momentum with over $2 billion in net inflows in the quarter. 
As active equity management is being reshaped by massive investments in technology and data science, and clients are focusing more in outcomes, we recently revitalized our Active Equity platform, so that we are in a position to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance to our clients. We segmented our product offering into a range of strategies that span different levels of alpha generation and value with appropriate manufacturing cost for BlackRock. And we are harnessing the power of people in technology as we lean into supporting both our fundamental and our quantitative equity managers with a shared data science and technology capabilities. We believe that levering our global scale and technology, we can drive better outcomes for our clients and future growth for BlackRock. At the end of the quarter, 65% of our fundamental active equities at 85% of our scientific active equity assets were above benchmark or paramedian for the 3-year period. 
The investments that we made in iShares, in our active fixed income and in our active equities are about leveraging our breadth, our scale and our technology to reap the benefits of our competitive advantages to drive growth. And we will continue to find ways to lever those unique strengths. 
As we look for other opportunities evolve for our clients, alternatives remain a key area of focus as our clients increasingly are searching for additional source of income and hopefully, uncorrelated returns. We saw another strong fundraising quarter with $2 billion of commitments. And we now have more than $12 billion of uninvested committed capital to invest going forward across our $100 billion core alternative platform. 
We continue to advocate for infrastructure investing in support of policies to unlock private capital, which offer multiple benefits, including providing new sources of return for investors, creating jobs, improving productivity and increasing capacity for long-term economic growth. Today, we manage $30 billion in real assets, and we expect this to continue area of growth BlackRock. 
As we look to enhance BlackRock's global credit platform, last month, we brought in Tim O'Hara to lead BlackRock's credit business alongside Jimmy Keenan. Believe that the combination of BlackRock's long established presence and expertise in fixed income and our growing alternative platform positions us to be a leading provider in both liquid and illiquid credit, which provides attractive risk-adjusted opportunity for our clients who are seeking differentiated sources of income. 
While technology has always been a key differentiator for BlackRock, it is more essential to our business than ever before. We believe technology can transform our industry with enhanced technology and risk management helping investors achieve better outcomes. And we, at BlackRock, are leading that transformation. Our goal is to be the most sophisticated user of data and technology in the financial services industry. We seek to transform and integrate the way assets and wealth managers are creating client outcomes through portfolio construction, asset allocation, risk management and digital distribution. 
Our Aladdin technology is being used by more clients than ever before with revenues growing 12% year-over-year. And demand for Aladdin's multi-asset capabilities by institutions globally, especially in Europe and Latin America, remains strong. We also continued to see momentum in retail demand for Aladdin, as interest continues to increase for Aladdin Risk for wealth management, which provides intermediaries with institutional quality portfolio of construction, modeling and risk management technology. We are currently implementing a handful of clients in this technology in the United States, in Europe and in Asia. Aladdin remains the only integrated investment risk management system on the market, and we believe this differentiation will continue to drive the attractive value propositions and premium price points. 
In line with a commitment to technology, we recently nominated Chuck Robbins to our Board of Directors. Chuck has helped global corporations navigate a world being reshaped by technology advancements. We have consistently and consciously developed our board with the eye towards the future. And Chuck brings a deep understanding of technology promise to our board at a critical time for BlackRock. 
Building on record total net inflows of $202 billion in 2016, we began 2017 by continuing to invest in our business to capture the opportunities ahead of us, to drive continued growth and to aggressively leverage the benefits of our scale. We are transforming the change around us into the opportunities for the future, finding new methods to generate sustainable alpha, using technology in innovative ways, building on our platform to serve our clients' evolving needs, creating continued opportunities for our employees and delivering consistent returns for our shareholders.

And so it's continuing to drive our platform, but I'm -- where I'm most pleased, and I think has been the evolution of Aladdin beyond what its core competency was a few years back by allowing -- by having the ability to work with our wealth management clients and helping them having the analytical capacity to analyze the risk of every single client they have. And so especially in a world that is moving with MiFID II, with a world that is moving more towards advisory, less brokerage, I believe the need for greater oversight, greater understanding is going to be necessary. And the Aladdin platform is one of the options that many people have to drive that technology knowledge. So -- and then we will continue to do acquisitions. We have a few areas that we're looking at right now to further add opportunities that we have in technology. But let me just say importantly what technology is for BlackRock. It's the core of our culture, so it's -- and what I do believe with our clients are finding, when they have the Aladdin platform, and you have the singularity of one technology platform throughout an organization is driving our clients' culture. And I do believe this is going to continue to drive a component of the growth that we see for Aladdin. So we're quite excited. At times, we're pretty overwhelmed with the opportunities.

Good morning. So maybe I'll take a crack at that for you. I think if we could start, recall from Investor Day, which was, I guess, about 9 months ago, we showed a chart at Investor Day that detailed how despite growth of about $1.3 billion on our base fees -- and I think it was from 2012 to '15, so that chart is a little dated now. Despite that growth, our fee rate had actually declined by a little over 1 basis point. I think it was about 1.3 basis points. Organic growth drove about 30% of the revenue growth over that period of time and actually expanded our fee rate by about 1 basis point. That, I would basically refer you to as mix shift, and that is a phenomena where our organic base fee growth is actually growing faster than our organic asset growth, which frankly, with the exception of last year, has done pretty continuously. While beta and FX drove about 70% of the revenue growth, which, again, are elements outside of our direct control, it actually caused a 2 basis point decline in the fee rate over that time period. And that is really what we talk about as being divergent beta and FX. It actually increases our revenue, but it actually decreases our fee rate. And if you think about it pretty simply, the S&P has significantly outperformed global and emerging markets. And we've seen significant dollar strengthening by somewhere between 20% and 25% versus the pound and the euro. And what does that do to us? That actually causes our dollar-denominated assets to increase, which have lower fees versus products in Europe and Asia and especially in the emerging markets. Now bear in mind, over that time period, there really were no meaningful fee cuts to speak of. Obviously, we did launch the core in the fall of 2012. Last year, just to true-up that chart, the fee rate declined about 1 basis point, despite another year of positive organic fee growth in a tough market. And I think we've talked a lot about that where the trends were generally the same. But if you look back, whether it was -- we've really generated organic base fee growth of 6% in '13, in '14 and '15. And while it dipped to 1% last year, we generated 5% organic base fee growth in the first quarter, and that's even with the fee cuts that we have announced, both in fixed income and iShares. So I think the bottom line really is divergent beta and FX in many cases, which is repricing, in some respects, $5 trillion of assets every day. But I also think that we are, as Larry mentioned, we really feel that we're as well positioned as we've ever been to grow not only assets, but also base fees in a variety of markets and really differentiate ourselves in terms of organic growth through a variety of market cycles."

Because the way I see is that, that's sort of like a fixed rate, somewhere 5 to 10 basis points. But as the management fee rate continues to work lower, that economic model seems to be under a lot of strain in my view. And is technology the answer?

I think ultimately, this comes down to our ability to generate sustainable alpha. I think if we can generate sustainable alpha in a way that, in some ways, kind of captures 3 to 4x the fee over time, I think, will be fine. If we're in a period of significantly lower returns and lower sustainable alpha, then obviously, I think fee rates are going to have to come down accordingly."

There is a greater belief that long-term returns are structurally lower than they were 10 and 20 years ago. So if you have an expected long-term return of, let's say, 6%, which many people think that might be high when you look at a balanced portfolio. Fees take up a lot of that return. And as long as we believe the world is going to be in a low return environment, our clients are under a lot of pressure. And clients are looking for different ways of seeking those outcomes. And this is why I actually believe why more clients are coming to us now because they have this structural problem. Their liability or their actuarial needs are greater than they could earn with our asset base. And so they're looking either to barbell or looking to have less expensive products. But they're looking for a much more holistic solution. And I think the era where a manager sold a product, a sold product that is what's being threatened today. And as Rob just said, we're in a great position with our clients to try to help them with these really difficult issues. We've had a couple state funds announced that they're lowering their actuarial rates, that's very hard to do. A -- if a state fund lowers their actuarial rate, that means they have to go to their unions and say, ""Pay more."" That means they have to go to the state and say, ""Contribute more."" And so this is one of the real issues that, I think, is being lost. It's being -- and so when you talk about -- or when we talk about fee pressure, fee pressure comes from the real issue of lower expectated (sic) [ expected ] returns. And I think this is one of the big issues around hedge funds and why we're constantly reading about some hedge funds closing, some hedge funds are lowering their fees because the fee structures are just too large versus the returns on a risk-adjusted basis that they're achieving. So this is a broad-based issue. It's not just in the wealth management area. It's across the spectrum of clients. I know and belaboring this point, but I think it's a very important point. But this is the environment we all live in. And I think this is in an environment that really positions BlackRock in a very differentiated way. So we understand this problem, we're dealing with this issue and we're taking advantage of it. I'll leave it at that."

You asked specifically related to technology, related to investing. Because the advancements in technology, because the utilization of sensor technology, because the Internet playing a role in everything and anything we do, there is information that we could not search for or find years ago, whether it is communication by employees about their firms and consumer sentiments about a product. And so by having the ability to do deep dives on data, interpreting that data through different algorithms and models, hopefully, that will be creating excess alpha. So it creates product, it creates product returns. And so that's where we look at the greatest amount of advancements. We're also looking at computers. And can computers be learning and adapting in markets? But that's something for the future. But importantly, technology today for data analysis, technology for very quick analysis of that data is going to be really the key component of driving, I believe, returns and active investing in the future. And I do believe, because technology has created the efficiencies, it creates more efficiencies across, and we can pass on those efficiencies also to our clients. And I think this is one thing that's being missed. Here we are, as we talk about some of the fee cuts and yet, we have an increase of 100 basis points in margins. So we look at technology as a great efficiency provider for investing, for custodial assets, for communicating with our custodial client, for communicating with our employees, for communicating with our clients. So it is the key element that is going to transform BlackRock, and I would say, every other financial services company.

I guess, just few thoughts here. One, how far do you see that trend going? And I guess, the second, how do you think about the impact that this has on the value chain for the industry? In other words, if the shift toward asset allocation continues and the move towards building blocks in assembly, how do you see the value shifting here and your ability to chart for manufacturing versus the ability to charge for distribution -- excuse me, for your ability to charge for assembly and then also the value of distribution here? Where is it most dispensable? And how do you think about evolving your positioning from here?"

And quite frankly, after many years in the business, I can't think of a better product to use for asset allocation than ETFs. So one is, it's going to be a tool where we're going to use it for our precision-type investments where you can accent one specific area of the market in your portfolio. Two is that you can actually make better judgments in the active equity space by using what we would call smart beta ETF, so that would be a bit of a derivative to it, but focused on certain factors that you'd want to have. Three is that it's an obvious part of a multi-asset solution, which is a growing area of the market where you'd have just -- you need in order to get the returns that Larry is talking about in a low interest rate environment. You need to focus on specific sectors of the market and ETFs will allow you to do that at the right value. And the third thing, which I really like, is in the fixed income area where the exposure to just one particular fixed income bond is not going to give you that type of return. There's just too much risk for the cost of that. So by using an ETF in that -- in the asset allocation model in your fixed income portion, you also are diversifying your risk substantially at a much lower cost. Also the world is moving more towards portfolio of construction capabilities. This is going to be in what we're calling models that we're going to be offering. They offer much higher levels of risk management, and here is where we can utilize our technology as a differentiator because we can actually deliver a multi-asset solution, which has the right risk requirements for that particular client. And we're building technology around that. So you've heard us mention Aladdin portfolio builder where we're giving financial advisers the ability to take a multi-asset portfolio and put it together using our products, using other peoples' products to come up with the ultimate solution. We're using it in a product that we call iRetire where we're trying to help get in the middle of solving probably the largest problem facing our country and others today, which is the lack of savings for retirement, getting those -- letting that cash and sitting on the sidelines, working for people those -- for those people that are going to retire and being able to illustrate to financial advisers and their clients better capabilities to achieve those results. And then also expanding into giving model portfolios to the financial advisers and to our clients to use to solve their problems. So we have the technology on the outside. And then on the inside, we have precision instruments through the ETF business that can help our clients achieve their financial objectives."

I'll just give a little bit of a quick overview and then Larry and Rob can jump in as they feel. I mean, I think ultimately, we're looking at both efficiencies and development and maturity of markets. And when we think here about the repositioning, it really follows much more along the line of how we approach our product segmentation work with iShares a number of years ago at the end of 2012. And in that case, it was really trying to align who the particular buyers of a product were with the right fees. And in this case, it was really trying to align our ability to generate sustainable alpha in certain products with the fee potential. And so if you think about segmenting the products between kind of core alpha and high conviction in some respects, I think it's somewhat of an acknowledgment that in many parts of the U.S., large cap markets in particular, ability to really generate sustainable alpha and still charge premium fees in terms of very broad-based portfolios that really tinker around indexes. I don't want to necessarily say index hugging per se, but your ability to take risk and generate incremental return needs to be much more closely aligned with the fee potential. And so it was really in that context that we really try to align fee with the ability to generate a certain level of sustainable alpha. Outside of the U.S. market, in lesser developed markets, less-efficient markets, more dispersion, less correlation, I think we still feel very strongly in places like Europe and Asia and certain emerging markets that frankly, the ability to generate sustainable alpha can support higher fees. And I think our performance has certainly showed that over time."

Aladdin is more than just a risk management platform. It's an enterprise platform. So, a, there are many companies that provide enterprise platforms for different companies, whether it's a Oracle or SAP or cloud computing, so an enterprise system, and that's what Aladdin really is because it's a front, middle and back office platform. And a component of it is risk management. I think you're referring to the risk management component of it. It's a service model. We provide with different models each individual client can put their own algorithms onto Aladdin that are customized for them. So they can interpret the models. So it's not a platform that is monolithic with one model. And so the notion that the fact that many people use it that it becomes systemic is just not a point of understanding what a platform really is. I think by the clients' interest, the opportunities we have, the opportunities are as large as ever. And it is because of its enterprise solution. And as we now have Aladdin provider working with the custodial banks, ultimately, it's going to simplify all trading -- trade entry, compliance, working alongside with the custodial bank. It will create so much more efficiencies for the users across the Aladdin system. So if we could provide for Aladdin, for all the clients this enterprise system that creates these taped efficiencies that make them in a better position, we're all better off from it. So it's -- once again, Aladdin is a service model. It's not BlackRock's models. And so I think we have -- we're happy to give you a demo on Aladdin, what it is and what it isn't."

I'm hoping that you'll see both. I mean, as Rob said, part of the repositioning in the active portfolio was basically trying to use scale to bring better outcomes to clients, obviously, in terms of better sustainable alpha at a more efficient price point for them. But the intent at the end of the day is to generate incremental growth for BlackRock shareholders by having a better value proposition in terms of pricing performance that, we think, ultimately, will drive better organic growth. In terms of some of the things you mentioned around just leveraging service providers, in many cases, in certain instances, our clients pay those fees, in which case that will be a direct benefit to them and in a certain cases, as if in our ETF, which is a unitary price structure BlackRock itself pays those fees, so our shareholders will clearly benefit. So I think that in all cases, we're going to basically try to use our scale to drive growth. That growth is ultimately better for both clients as well as shareholders. And I think, as you look at margin expansion over -- whether it's just the last year-over-year where it was 100 basis points or frankly, ever since we closed the BGI deal at the end of 2009, margins are probably up 400 to 500-plus basis points since then. And I think there is no question that we're using our scale to generate better outcomes for both clients and shareholders. So it's good for the client at the end of the day.

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's competitive position has allowed us to continuously invest from a position of strength and to adapt and change our business model, always with the goal of being prepared to deliver outcomes for clients by leveraging a comprehensive set of technology and risk management capabilities. This strategy has fostered deeper client relationships and led to a differentiated and more consistent level of organic growth. 
BlackRock's first quarter results reflected $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7% and an annualized organic base fee growth rate of 5%, highlighting the value of these investments and the success of our broad-based global technology and investment platform. 
Flows were positive across product type, client type and region. 
First quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 8% higher than a year ago. And despite costs associated with the repositioning of our Active Equity business, operating income of $1.2 billion rose 10%. Earnings per share of $5.25 were up 24% compared to a year ago, driven also by higher nonoperating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $42 million of net investment gains, an increase from the first quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter. First quarter net interest expense included $14 million of call premium expense associated with the current quarter's successful refinancing of our $700 million, 6.25% notes, which were called prior to their September 2017 maturity. Our issuance of $700 million of 10-year notes yielding 3.25% will result in a reduction of $21 million of annual interest expense going forward. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% compared to 29.6% a year ago and included an $81 million discrete tax benefit associated with the adoption of new accounting items related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. 
First quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by the positive impact of market appreciation and organic growth on our average assets under management. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew approximately 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. Growth in both year-over-year and sequential base fees was partially offset by the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter of 2017.  
Performance fees of $70 million increased $36 million from the first quarter of 2016, reflecting better hedge fund and long-only performance, but declines $59 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to seasonally higher fees from funds with a performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter. 
Aladdin revenue of $158 million was up 12% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable implementations going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. 
Internally, we recently realigned Financial Markets Advisory, or our FMA business, with Client Solutions and the BlackRock Investment Institute to offer clients a more cohesive and comprehensive advisory service. To better align our external reporting in light of this change, Aladdin revenue, previously reported within the BlackRock Solutions and advisory line item on our income statement, will now be presented as technology and risk management revenue on our P&L. Advisory revenue associated with our FMA business will now be combined with other revenue and included as part of an advisory and other revenue line item. 
Technology is changing how the world invests and how we interact with clients. We continue to see strong market demand for institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for wealth management, FutureAdvisor and other technology solutions as clients seek sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools. This new presentation, which is reflected in our first quarter income statement, is intended to sharpen the focus on our technology and risk management businesses at BlackRock. 
Total expense increased 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, driven by higher compensation and volume-related expense, lower G&A expense and $22 million of certain onetime expense associated with the recently announced strategic repositioning of our Active Equity platform. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $78 million, or 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation driven primarily by higher performance fees and higher operating income, and approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of the Active Equity platform. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was up 4%, reflecting these repositioning costs, higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2017 grants, partially offset by lower incentive compensation resulting from seasonally lower performance fees and operating income in the current quarter. 
G&A expense was down 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $54 million from the fourth quarter, or 15%, primarily reflecting the seasonal impact of lower marketing and promotional expense in the first quarter and reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense. 
Aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, including marketing and promotional expense, which we anticipate will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2017.  Assuming stable markets, we continue to expect a modestly higher level of full year G&A spend in 2017 as compared to 2016. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 42.6% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a continued focus on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. We remain committed to leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. 
We also remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we previously announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
First quarter long-term net inflows of $80 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and regions. Long-term net inflows benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients increased their use of ETFs as the building blocks for their portfolios and in combinations to drive active returns. 
Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $64 billion, representing 20% annualized organic growth, driven in part by an accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth channel and by rapid adoption of iShares' ETFs as financier instruments by professional money managers.
iShares captured the #1 share of first quarter industry flows globally in the U.S., Europe and in equity and fixed income, with our U.S. iShares franchise crossing over $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time.
iShares' equity net inflows of $45 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares' net inflows of $20 billion were led by flows into investment-grade corporate and emerging market bond funds. 
Our institutional business generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, driven primarily by index inflows. 
Institutional active net outflows of $1 billion reflected net outflows of equity and fixed income, partially offset by inflows into multi-asset and alternatives. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath target-date series, which saw $5 billion of net inflows in the quarter, the strongest flow quarter in recent history. Excluding return of client capital, institutional alternatives generated over $2 billion of net inflows, reflecting deployment of committed capital in infrastructure and private equity and hedge fund solutions. 
Momentum in alternatives is continuing, evidenced by yet another strong fundraising quarter for illiquids as we raised more than $2 billion in new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key growth area for BlackRock as further demonstrated by our recent announcement of the acquisition of the First Reserve Infrastructure Funds. We expect this acquisition to close later this quarter, bringing total invested and committed infrastructure capital to approximately $14 billion. 
Retail net inflows of $5 billion were led by inflows into fixed income and index equity products, partially offset by outflows from world allocation strategies. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion were diversified across our top-performing platform and included $2 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into emerging markets and municipals. 
In addition, our multi-asset income strategy raised $1 billion during the first quarter as investors continue to target specific income-oriented outcomes. 
Our first quarter financial and business results reflect the benefits and the investments we've made to evolve our global distribution, investment and technology platforms ahead of evolving client needs and industry trends. Diversification, whether investment style, distribution channel, product or region and scale, create a truly advantaged competitive position that will enable us to continue making strategic investments with the goal of delivering long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. 
BlackRock's first quarter results were a reflection of the purposeful investments we have made over our first 29 years to create the broadest investment platform in the asset management industry, complemented by a global distribution network and industry-leading technology. 
Our full range of investment strategies with strength in index, factors, smart beta, quantitative and fundamental actives and alternatives uniquely position BlackRock to develop a more holistic relationship and connect deeper with our clients. Our strong results this quarter are not a result of what we did over the last 3 months, but really a result over our long-term strategy. We have always kept our focus on the long term, working to understand the evolution of the asset management ecosystem and to anticipate changes in our clients' needs, so that we can adapt ahead of change and better meet their needs. For this reason, clients today rely on BlackRock not only for investment solutions, but also for our insights and guidance on how to navigate the global investment landscape. 
Over the past year, global events have had a significant impact on markets and investor sentiment. Following the presidential election, U.S. equity markets surged to an all-time high, driven by expectations for fiscal stimulus and regulatory reform. And reflation expectations have been steadily increasing. However, there's still uncertainty, uncertainty about our health care, uncertainty about tax and trade reform, when they will ultimately be implemented in the United States. And investor confidence has partially changed. There are significant issues related to tax reform, infrastructure spending, and so we need to see how this all evolves. We are still optimistic, but we have to see how these all evolve. 
Strong first quarter equity returns have been driven by a synchronized recovery in global economic growth, with the sharpest recovery seen internationally. However, it is unclear how social and political agendas will play out, particularly in Europe ahead of several elections, which is creating even more market anxiety. 
Furthermore, as the dollar remains strong following a period of significant appreciation, we could see further headwinds for dollar-based investors with global portfolios. 
Despite recent action by the Federal Reserve, the impact of sustained low rates on our clients' portfolios will continue. Many clients today are struggling to meet their liability needs, and this will likely continue and will likely remain a challenge. 
As I talked about in my recent Chairman's letter to our shareholders in our Annual Report, at the heart of BlackRock is a culture that embraces change. We, as an organization, we anticipate, we prepare, and we transform change into opportunities. 
As the landscape for asset managers evolve, a challenging narrative has emerged across the industry, one of managers having to play defense to protect themselves from market headwinds, structural changes and fee pressure. The reason much of the asset management industry is in defensive is that many managers have not evolved and they're playing catch-up. We built BlackRock differently. Evolution is a part and a critical part of our culture. Throughout our history, we have focused on identifying critical trends. We anticipated how those trends will impact our clients' needs and then we pivot our business accordingly. As a result, we built a firm that is equipped with investment strategies and technology, one that is agile. We seek to adapt change -- we seek to adapt ahead of change, not in response to it. However, we also recognize that sometimes we make a misstep, and addressing those quickly is just as important. 
BlackRock has a full range of investment strategies, from market cap weighted index exposures at one end to illiquid alternatives at the other and everything in between. We've created technology capable of bringing those building blocks together to design and deliver outcomes for our clients. And we built unmatched scale that strategically positions us to create value for our clients and our shareholders. 
Now is the time more than ever for BlackRock to play offense. Our scalable investment and technology platform is our greatest durable competitive advantage. And going forward, we will continue to identify opportunities to use our advantaged market position to create better financial futures for clients and drive long-term growth for shareholders. 
We're using our scale to lower prices for clients and drive growth and market share increases for BlackRock in our U.S. iShares Core ETFs. We're using our scale to create more efficient relationships with our service providers. And earlier this year, we announced our plans to move $1 trillion of custodial assets. We're using our scale to build industry-leading technology to optimize investment performance and outcomes for our clients. We're using our scale to enhance our talent profile by tapping into a diverse network. And we're using our scale to make tactical, filling-out acquisitions that further enhances our platform, our technology capabilities and our geographic reach. 
This approach is widening our competitive advantage and driving our ability to generate consistently strong organic growth. And we're going to continue to press our competitive advantage going forward, always with the best interest of our clients and our shareholders. 
In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing a 7% annualized organic growth. Flows were positive across product types, client types and all our regions. Record ETF flows were a tangible example of the fundamental change we see in the ecosystem of wealth management and capital markets. 
Simple building blocks like iShares Core is a strategic holding for long-term investors, fixed income ETFs alongside bonds for institutions, large asset owners taking greater control of portfolio risk profiles with factor-based ETFs, and more and more investors are using a combination of ETFs to generate active returns. 
The investment landscape is changing, and BlackRock is investing in iShares to lead industry growth and evolution. iShares saw record first quarter inflows of $64 billion as clients sought ETFs in their portfolio, both for index exposures and as building blocks to deliver alpha. 
Last October, we anticipated the key changes impacting our retail and institutional clients that would change the way large pools of assets will be managed. We made a deliberate strategic investment in our U.S. iShares Core ETFs, positioning this business to offer the highest-quality product at the best value for our clients. This strategy is working, posting organic revenue and asset growth that exceeded our expectations. Since the strategic repricing, we have seen an acceleration in growth in our iShares U.S. Core ETFs with $52 billion of net inflows, representing a 50% annualized organic growth. 
We have experienced a sizable uptick in our core market share. And we have recaptured more than 50% of the revenue impact through organic growth alone. 
Several years ago, we anticipated growing interest from our clients in factors and smart beta. Those strategies remain a significant area of focus for BlackRock, and BlackRock is positioned to win. We saw $2 billion in net inflows into BlackRock's smart beta ETFs in the first quarter, contributing to the total factor-based net inflows of $3 billion in our first quarter. The combination of our technology platform, our distribution connectivity, our commitment to risk management and our broad investment platform will enable us to be a leader in this space. 
We believe in active management more than ever before, especially in less-efficient markets where returns are less correlated. But we believe going forward, clients will be looking for different ways and different things from Active Equity, and alpha will need to be generated in new ways. 
In October, we refined and expanded our active fixed income platform. 90% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund platform now offers top quartile performance and top quartile pricing. Our unconstrained product range is also well positioned for a rising rate environment, and we are beginning to see momentum with over $2 billion in net inflows in the quarter. 
As active equity management is being reshaped by massive investments in technology and data science, and clients are focusing more on outcomes, we recently revitalized our Active Equity platform so that we are in a position to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance to our clients. We segmented our product offering into a range of strategies that span different levels of alpha generation and value with appropriate manufacturing costs for BlackRock. And we are harnessing the power of people and technology as we lean into supporting both our fundamental and our quantitative equity managers with our shared data science and technology capabilities. We believe that levering our global scale and technology, we can drive better outcomes for our clients and future growth for BlackRock. At the end of the quarter, 65% of our fundamental active equities and 85% of our scientific active equity assets were above benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period. 
The investments that we made in iShares, in our active fixed income and in our active equities are about leveraging our breadth, our scale and our technology to reap the benefits of our competitive advantages to drive growth. And we will continue to find ways to lever those unique strengths. 
As we look for other opportunities [ to evolve ] for our clients, alternatives remain a key area of focus as our clients increasingly are searching for additional sources of income and hopefully, uncorrelated returns. We saw another strong fundraising quarter with $2 billion of commitments. And we now have more than $12 billion of uninvested committed capital to invest going forward across our $100 billion core alternative platform. 
We continue to advocate for infrastructure investing in support of policies to unlock private capital, which offer multiple benefits, including providing new sources of return for investors, creating jobs, improving productivity and increasing capacity for long-term economic growth. Today, we manage $30 billion in real assets, and we expect this to continue [ to be an ] area of growth BlackRock. 
As we look to enhance BlackRock's global credit platform, last month, we brought in Tim O'Hara to lead BlackRock's credit business alongside Jimmy Keenan. We believe that the combination of BlackRock's long established presence and expertise in fixed income and our growing alternative platform positions us to be a leading provider in both liquid and illiquid credit, which provides attractive risk-adjusted opportunity for our clients who are seeking differentiated sources of income. 
While technology has always been a key differentiator for BlackRock, it is more essential to our business than ever before. We believe technology can transform our industry, with enhanced technology and risk management helping investors achieve better outcomes. And we, at BlackRock, are leading that transformation. Our goal is to be the most sophisticated user of data and technology in the financial services industry. We seek to transform and integrate the way assets and wealth managers are creating client outcomes through portfolio construction, asset allocation, risk management and digital distribution. 
Our Aladdin technology is being used by more clients than ever before with revenues growing 12% year-over-year. And demand for Aladdin's multi-asset capabilities by institutions globally, especially in Europe and Latin America, remains strong. We also continue to see momentum in retail demand for Aladdin as interest continues to increase for Aladdin Risk for wealth management, which provides intermediaries with institutional quality portfolio construction, modeling and risk management technology. We are currently implementing a handful of clients in this technology in the United States, in Europe and in Asia. Aladdin remains the only integrated investment risk management system on the market, and we believe this differentiation will continue to drive the attractive value propositions and premium price points. 
In line with a commitment to technology, we recently nominated Chuck Robbins to our Board of Directors. Chuck has helped global corporations navigate a world being reshaped by technology advancements. We have consistently and consciously developed our board with the eye towards the future. And Chuck brings a deep understanding of technology promise to our board at a critical time for BlackRock. 
Building on record total net inflows of $202 billion in 2016, we began 2017 by continuing to invest in our business to capture the opportunities ahead of us, to drive continued growth and to aggressively leverage the benefits of our scale. We are transforming the change around us into the opportunities for the future, finding new methods to generate sustainable alpha, using technology in innovative ways, building on our platform to serve our clients' evolving needs, creating continued opportunities for our employees and delivering consistent returns for our shareholders.

As I said in my prepared remarks, we're seeing Aladdin interest in LatAm, in Europe. We have wealth management -- Aladdin for wealth management integration going on right now in Asia. And so it's continuing to drive our platform, but I'm -- where I'm most pleased, and I think -- has been the evolution of Aladdin beyond what its core competency was a few years back by allowing -- by having the ability to work with our wealth management clients and helping them having the analytical capacity to analyze the risk of every single client they have. And so especially in a world that is moving with MiFID II, with a world that is moving more towards advisory, less brokerage, I believe the need for greater oversight, greater understanding is going to be necessary. And the Aladdin platform is one of the options that many people have to drive that technology knowledge. So -- and then we will continue to do acquisitions. We have a few areas that we're looking at right now to further add opportunities that we have in technology. But let me just say importantly what technology is for BlackRock. It's the core of our culture, so it's -- and what I do believe what our clients are finding, when they have the Aladdin platform, and you have the singularity of one technology platform throughout an organization, it's driving our clients' culture. And I do believe this is going to continue to drive a component of the growth that we see for Aladdin. So we're quite excited. At times, we're pretty overwhelmed with the opportunities. But Mr. Goldstein and team have done a very good job in terms of driving those opportunities."

Good morning. So maybe I'll take a crack at that for you. I think if we could start, recall from Investor Day, which was, I guess, about 9 months ago, we showed a chart at Investor Day that detailed how despite growth of about $1.3 billion on our base fees -- and I think it was from 2012 to '15, so that chart is a little dated now. Despite that growth, our fee rate had actually declined by a little over 1 basis point. I think it was about 1.3 basis points. Organic growth drove about 30% of the revenue growth over that period of time and actually expanded our fee rate by about 1 basis point. That, I would basically refer you to as mix shift, and that is a phenomena where our organic base fee growth is actually growing faster than our organic asset growth, which frankly, with the exception of last year, has done pretty continuously. While beta and FX drove about 70% of the revenue growth, which, again, are elements outside of our direct control, it actually caused a 2 basis point decline in the fee rate over that time period. And that is really what we talk about as being divergent beta and FX. It actually increases our revenue, but it actually decreases our fee rate. And if you think about it pretty simply, the S&P has significantly outperformed global and emerging markets. And we've seen significant dollar strengthening by somewhere between 20% and 25% versus the pound and the euro. And what does that do to us? That actually causes our dollar-denominated assets to increase, which have lower fees versus products in Europe and Asia and especially in the emerging markets. Now bear in mind, over that time period, there really were no meaningful fee cuts to speak of, though obviously, we did launch the core in the fall of 2012. Last year, just to true-up that chart, the fee rate declined about 1 basis point, despite another year of positive organic fee growth in a tough market. And I think we've talked a lot about that, where the trends were generally the same. But if you look back, whether it was -- we've really generated organic base fee growth of 6% in '13, in '14 and '15. And while it dipped to 1% last year, we generated 5% organic base fee growth in the first quarter, and that's even with the fee cuts that we have announced, both in fixed income and iShares. So I think the bottom line really is divergent beta and FX in many cases, which is repricing, in some respects, $5 trillion of assets every day. But I also think that we are -- as Larry mentioned, we really feel that we're as well positioned as we've ever been to grow not only assets, but also base fees in a variety of markets and really differentiate ourselves in terms of organic growth through a variety of market cycles."

I think in that same article that Ken had mentioned, you sort of reiterated the likelihood that fee rates will continue to work lower in the industry, which I think is pretty widely understood now. So my question is, when you start thinking about the conversations you're having with the retail distributors at the point-of-sale -- around point-of-sale economics, what's happening with that dialogue? Because the way I see is that that's sort of like a fixed rate, somewhere 5 to 10 basis points. But as the management fee rate continues to work lower, that economic model seems to be under a lot of strain in my view. And is technology the answer? And just how do you sort of think that, that plays out?"

I think ultimately, this comes down to our ability to generate sustainable alpha. I think if we can generate sustainable alpha in a way that, in some ways, kind of captures 3 to 4x the fee over time, I think we'll be fine. If we're in a period of significantly lower returns and lower sustainable alpha, then obviously, I think fee rates are going to have to come down accordingly."

There is a greater belief that long-term returns are structurally lower than they were 10 and 20 years ago. So if you have an expected long-term return of, let's say, 6%, which many people think that might be high when you look at a balanced portfolio. Fees take up a lot of that return. And as long as we believe the world is going to be in a low-return environment, our clients are under a lot of pressure. And clients are looking for different ways of seeking those outcomes. And this is why I actually believe why more clients are coming to us now because they have this structural problem. Their liability or their actuarial needs are greater than they could earn with their asset base. And so they're looking either to barbell or looking to have less expensive products. But they're looking for a much more holistic solution. And I think the era where a manager sold a product, a sole product, that is what's being threatened today. And as Rob just said, we're in a great position with our clients to try to help them with these really difficult issues. We've had a couple state funds announce that they're lowering their actuarial rates. That's very hard to do. A -- if a state fund lowers their actuarial rate, that means they have to go to their unions and say, ""Pay more."" That means they have to go to the state and say, ""Contribute more."" And so this is one of the real issues that I think is being lost. It's being -- and so when you talk about -- or when we talk about fee pressure, fee pressure comes from the real issue of lower expectated (sic) [ expected ] returns. And I think this is one of the big issues around hedge funds and why we're constantly reading about some hedge funds closing, some hedge funds are lowering their fees, because the fee structures are just too large versus the returns on a risk-adjusted basis that they're achieving. So this is a broad-based issue. It's not just in the wealth management area. It's across the spectrum of clients. I know I'm belaboring this point, but I think it's a very important point. But this is the environment we all live in. And I think this is in an environment that really positions BlackRock in a very differentiated way. So we understand this problem, we're dealing with this issue and we're taking advantage of it. I'll leave it at that."

The technology advancements we made in Aladdin, related to dealing with our custodial bank, saves us large sums of money. So I want to talk about -- technology is changing every component of our firm. And I think this is one of the reasons why our margins have been consistently strong by the utilization of technology across all the spectrums. You asked specifically related to technology, related to investing. Because the advancements in technology, because the utilization of sensor technology, because the Internet playing a role in everything and anything we do, there is information that we could not search for or find years ago, whether it is communication by employees about their firms and consumer sentiments about a product. And so by having the ability to do deep dives on data, interpreting that data through different algorithms and models, hopefully, that will be creating excess alpha. So it creates product, it creates product returns. And so that's where we look at the greatest amount of advancements. We're also looking at computers, and can computers be learning and adapting in markets. But that's something for the future. But importantly, technology today for data analysis, technology for very quick analysis of that data is going to be really the key component of driving, I believe, returns and active investing in the future. And I do believe, because technology has created the efficiencies, it creates more efficiencies across, and we can pass on those efficiencies also to our clients. And I think this is one thing that's being missed. Here we are, as we talk about some of the fee cuts, and yet, we have an increase of 100 basis points in margins. So we look at technology as a great efficiency provider for investing, for custodial assets, for communicating with our custodial clients, for communicating with our employees, for communicating with our clients. So it is the key element that is going to transform BlackRock, and I would say, every other financial services company. So technology is what is driving the scale at BlackRock, and it's driving, hopefully, better outcomes for and to our clients."

And quite frankly, after many years in the business, I can't think of a better product to use for asset allocation than ETFs. So one is, it's going to be a tool where we're going to use it for our precision-type investments where you can accent one specific area of the market in your portfolio. Two is that you can actually make better judgments in the active equity space by using what we would call smart beta ETFs, so that would be a bit of a derivative to it, but focused on certain factors that you'd want to have. Three is that it's an obvious part of a multi-asset solution, which is a growing area of the market where you'd have just -- you need -- in order to get the returns that Larry is talking about in a low interest rate environment, you need to focus on specific sectors of the market, and ETFs will allow you to do that at the right value. And the third thing, which I really like, is in the fixed income area, where the exposure to just one particular fixed income bond is not going to give you that type of return. There's just too much risk for the cost of that. So by using an ETF in that -- in the asset allocation model in your fixed income portion, you also are diversifying your risk substantially at a much lower cost. Also the world is moving more towards portfolio construction capabilities. This is going to be in what we're calling models that we're going to be offering. They offer much higher levels of risk management, and here is where we can utilize our technology as a differentiator because we can actually deliver a multi-asset solution which has the right risk requirements for that particular client. And we're building technology around that. So you've heard us mention Aladdin Portfolio Builder where we're giving financial advisers the ability to take a multi-asset portfolio and put it together using our products, using other peoples' products to come up with the ultimate solution. We're using it in a product that we call iRetire, where we're trying to help get in the middle of solving probably the largest problem facing our country and others today, which is the lack of savings for retirement, getting those -- getting that cash that's sitting on the sidelines working for people those -- for those people that are going to retire, and being able to illustrate to financial advisers and their clients better capabilities to achieve those results. And then also expanding into giving model portfolios to the financial advisers and to our clients to use to solve their problems. So we have the technology on the outside.

I'll just give a little bit of a quick overview and then Larry and Rob can jump in as they feel. I mean, I think ultimately, we're looking at both efficiencies and development and maturity of markets. And when we think here about the repositioning, it really follows much more along the line of how we approached our product segmentation work with iShares a number of years ago, at the end of 2012. And in that case, it was really trying to align who the particular buyers of a product were with the right fees. And in this case, it was really trying to align our ability to generate sustainable alpha in certain products with the fee potential. And so if you think about segmenting the products between kind of core alpha and high conviction, in some respects, I think it's somewhat of an acknowledgment that in many parts of the U.S., large cap markets in particular, ability to really generate sustainable alpha and still charge premium fees in terms of very broad-based portfolios that really tinker around indexes -- I don't want to necessarily say index hugging per se, but your ability to take risk and generate incremental return needs to be much more closely aligned with the fee potential. And so it was really in that context that we really tried to align fee with the ability to generate a certain level of sustainable alpha. Outside of the U.S. market, in lesser developed markets, less-efficient markets, more dispersion, less correlation, I think we still feel very strongly in places like Europe and Asia and certain emerging markets that, frankly, the ability to generate sustainable alpha can support higher fees. And I think our performance has certainly showed that over time."

Aladdin is more than just a risk management platform. It's an enterprise platform. So, a, there are many companies that provide enterprise platforms for different companies, whether it's Oracle or SAP or cloud computing. So an enterprise system -- and that's what Aladdin really is because it's a front, middle and back-office platform. And a component of it is risk management. I think you're referring to the risk management component of it. It's a service model. We provide with different models. Each individual client can put their own algorithms onto Aladdin that are customized for them. So they can interpret the models. So it's not a platform that is monolithic with one model. And so the notion that the fact that many people use it that it becomes systemic is just not a point of understanding what a platform really is. I think by the clients' interest, the opportunities we have, the opportunities are as large as ever. And it is because of this enterprise solution. And as we now have Aladdin provider working with the custodial banks, ultimately, it's going to simplify all trading -- trade entry, compliance, working alongside with the custodial bank. It creates so much more efficiencies for the users across the Aladdin system. So if we could provide for Aladdin, for our other clients, this enterprise system that creates these [ type ] efficiencies that make them in a better position, we're all better off from it. So it's -- once again, Aladdin is a service model. It's not BlackRock's models. And so I think we have -- we're happy to give you a demo on Aladdin, what it is and what it isn't."

I'm hoping that you'll see both. I mean, as Rob said, part of the repositioning in the active portfolio was basically trying to use scale to bring better outcomes to clients, obviously, in terms of better sustainable alpha at a more efficient price point for them. But the intent at the end of the day is to generate incremental growth for BlackRock shareholders by having a better value proposition in terms of price and performance that we think, ultimately, will drive better organic growth. In terms of some of the things you mentioned around just leveraging service providers, in many cases, in certain instances, our clients pay those fees, in which case that will be a direct benefit to them, and in certain cases, as if -- in our ETF, which is a unitary price structure, BlackRock itself pays those fees, so our shareholders will clearly benefit. So I think that in all cases, we're going to basically try to use our scale to drive growth. That growth is ultimately better for both clients as well as shareholders. And I think, as you look at margin expansion over -- whether it's just the last year-over-year where it was 100 basis points or frankly, ever since we closed the BGI deal at the end of 2009, margins are probably up 400 to 500-plus basis points since then. And I think there is no question that we're using our scale to generate better outcomes for both clients and shareholders. If it's good for the client at the end of the day, we strongly believe it's going to be good for the BlackRock shareholder."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's competitive position has allowed us to continuously invest from a position of strength and to adapt and change our business model, always with the goal of being prepared to deliver outcomes for clients by leveraging a comprehensive set of technology and risk management capabilities. This strategy has fostered deeper client relationships and led to a differentiated and more consistent level of organic growth. 
BlackRock's first quarter results reflected $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7% and an annualized organic base fee growth rate of 5%, highlighting the value of these investments and the success of our broad-based global technology and investment platform. 
Flows were positive across product type, client type and region. 
First quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 8% higher than a year ago. And despite costs associated with the repositioning of our Active Equity business, operating income of $1.2 billion rose 10%. Earnings per share of $5.25 were up 24% compared to a year ago, driven also by higher nonoperating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $42 million of net investment gains, an increase from the first quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter. First quarter net interest expense included $14 million of call premium expense associated with the current quarter's successful refinancing of our $700 million, 6.25% notes, which were called prior to their September 2017 maturity. Our issuance of $700 million of 10-year notes yielding 3.25% will result in a reduction of $21 million of annual interest expense going forward. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% compared to 29.6% a year ago and included an $81 million discrete tax benefit associated with the adoption of new accounting items related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. 
First quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by the positive impact of market appreciation and organic growth on our average assets under management. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew approximately 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. Growth in both year-over-year and sequential base fees was partially offset by the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter of 2017. 
Performance fees of $70 million increased $36 million from the first quarter of 2016, reflecting better hedge fund and long-only performance, but declines $59 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to seasonally higher fees from funds with a performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter. 
Aladdin revenue of $158 million was up 12% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable implementations going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. 
Internally, we recently realigned Financial Markets Advisory, or our FMA business, with Client Solutions and the BlackRock Investment Institute to offer clients a more cohesive and comprehensive advisory service. To better align our external reporting in light of this change, Aladdin revenue, previously reported within the BlackRock Solutions and advisory line item on our income statement, will now be presented as technology and risk management revenue on our P&L. Advisory revenue associated with our FMA business will now be combined with other revenue and included as part of an advisory and other revenue line item. 
Technology is changing how the world invests and how we interact with clients. We continue to see strong market demand for institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for wealth management, FutureAdvisor and other technology solutions as clients seek sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools. This new presentation, which is reflected in our first quarter income statement, is intended to sharpen the focus on our technology and risk management businesses at BlackRock. 
Total expense increased 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, driven by higher compensation and volume-related expense, lower G&A expense and $22 million of certain onetime expense associated with the recently announced strategic repositioning of our Active Equity platform. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $78 million, or 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation driven primarily by higher performance fees and higher operating income, and approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of the Active Equity platform. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was up 4%, reflecting these repositioning costs, higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2017 grants, partially offset by lower incentive compensation resulting from seasonally lower performance fees and operating income in the current quarter. 
G&A expense was down 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $54 million from the fourth quarter, or 15%, primarily reflecting the seasonal impact of lower marketing and promotional expense in the first quarter and reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense. 
Aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, including marketing and promotional expense, which we anticipate will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2017. Assuming stable markets, we continue to expect a modestly higher level of full year G&A spend in 2017 as compared to 2016. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 42.6% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a continued focus on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. We remain committed to leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. 
We also remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we previously announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
First quarter long-term net inflows of $80 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and regions. Long-term net inflows benefited from significant flows into iShares, as both institutional and retail clients increased their use of ETFs as the building blocks for their portfolios and in combinations to drive active returns. 
Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $64 billion, representing 20% annualized organic growth, driven in part by an accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth channel and by rapid adoption of iShares' ETFs as financier instruments by professional money managers.
iShares captured the #1 share of first quarter industry flows globally in the U.S., Europe and in equity and fixed income, with our U.S. iShares franchise crossing over $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time.
iShares' equity net inflows of $45 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares' net inflows of $20 billion were led by flows into investment-grade corporate and emerging market bond funds. 
Our institutional business generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, driven primarily by index inflows. 
Institutional active net outflows of $1 billion reflected net outflows of equity and fixed income, partially offset by inflows into multi-asset and alternatives. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath target-date series, which saw $5 billion of net inflows in the quarter, the strongest flow quarter in recent history. Excluding return of client capital, institutional alternatives generated over $2 billion of net inflows, reflecting deployment of committed capital in infrastructure and private equity and hedge fund solutions. 
Momentum in alternatives is continuing, evidenced by yet another strong fundraising quarter for illiquids as we raised more than $2 billion in new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key growth area for BlackRock as further demonstrated by our recent announcement of the acquisition of the First Reserve Infrastructure Funds. We expect this acquisition to close later this quarter, bringing total invested and committed infrastructure capital to approximately $14 billion. 
Retail net inflows of $5 billion were led by inflows into fixed income and index equity products, partially offset by outflows from world allocation strategies. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion were diversified across our top-performing platform and included $2 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into emerging markets and municipals. 
In addition, our multi-asset income strategy raised $1 billion during the first quarter as investors continue to target specific income-oriented outcomes. 
Our first quarter financial and business results reflect the benefits and the investments we've made to evolve our global distribution, investment and technology platforms ahead of evolving client needs and industry trends. Diversification, whether investment style, distribution channel, product or region and scale, create a truly advantaged competitive position that will enable us to continue making strategic investments with the goal of delivering long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. 
BlackRock's first quarter results were a reflection of the purposeful investments we have made over our first 29 years to create the broadest investment platform in the asset management industry, complemented by a global distribution network and industry-leading technology. 
Our full range of investment strategies with strength in index, factors, smart beta, quantitative and fundamental actives and alternatives uniquely position BlackRock to develop a more holistic relationship and connect deeper with our clients. Our strong results this quarter are not a result of what we did over the last 3 months, but really a result over our long-term strategy. We have always kept our focus on the long term, working to understand the evolution of the asset management ecosystem and to anticipate changes in our clients' needs, so that we can adapt ahead of change and better meet their needs. For this reason, clients today rely on BlackRock not only for investment solutions, but also for our insights and guidance on how to navigate the global investment landscape. 
Over the past year, global events have had a significant impact on markets and investor sentiment. Following the presidential election, U.S. equity markets surged to an all-time high, driven by expectations for fiscal stimulus and regulatory reform. And reflation expectations have been steadily increasing. However, there's still uncertainty, uncertainty about our health care, uncertainty about tax and trade reform, when they will ultimately be implemented in the United States. And investor confidence has partially changed. There are significant issues related to tax reform, infrastructure spending, and so we need to see how this all evolves. We are still optimistic, but we have to see how these all evolve. 
Strong first quarter equity returns have been driven by a synchronized recovery in global economic growth, with the sharpest recovery seen internationally. However, it is unclear how social and political agendas will play out, particularly in Europe ahead of several elections, which is creating even more market anxiety. 
Furthermore, as the dollar remains strong following a period of significant appreciation, we could see further headwinds for dollar-based investors with global portfolios. 
Despite recent action by the Federal Reserve, the impact of sustained low rates on our clients' portfolios will continue. Many clients today are struggling to meet their liability needs, and this will likely continue and will likely remain a challenge. 
As I talked about in my recent Chairman's letter to our shareholders in our Annual Report, at the heart of BlackRock is a culture that embraces change. We, as an organization, we anticipate, we prepare, and we transform change into opportunities. 
As the landscape for asset managers evolve, a challenging narrative has emerged across the industry, one of managers having to play defense to protect themselves from market headwinds, structural changes and fee pressure. The reason much of the asset management industry is in defensive is that many managers have not evolved and they're playing catch-up. We built BlackRock differently. Evolution is a part and a critical part of our culture. Throughout our history, we have focused on identifying critical trends. We anticipated how those trends will impact our clients' needs and then we pivot our business accordingly. As a result, we built a firm that is equipped with investment strategies and technology, one that is agile. We seek to adapt change -- we seek to adapt ahead of change, not in response to it. However, we also recognize that sometimes we make a misstep, and addressing those quickly is just as important. 
BlackRock has a full range of investment strategies, from market cap weighted index exposures at one end to illiquid alternatives at the other and everything in between. We've created technology capable of bringing those building blocks together to design and deliver outcomes for our clients. And we built unmatched scale that strategically positions us to create value for our clients and our shareholders. 
Now is the time more than ever for BlackRock to play offense. Our scalable investment and technology platform is our greatest durable competitive advantage. And going forward, we will continue to identify opportunities to use our advantaged market position to create better financial futures for clients and drive long-term growth for shareholders. 
We're using our scale to lower prices for clients and drive growth and market share increases for BlackRock in our U.S. iShares Core ETFs. We're using our scale to create more efficient relationships with our service providers. And earlier this year, we announced our plans to move $1 trillion of custodial assets. We're using our scale to build industry-leading technology to optimize investment performance and outcomes for our clients. We're using our scale to enhance our talent profile by tapping into a diverse network. And we're using our scale to make tactical, filling-out acquisitions that further enhances our platform, our technology capabilities and our geographic reach. 
This approach is widening our competitive advantage and driving our ability to generate consistently strong organic growth. And we're going to continue to press our competitive advantage going forward, always with the best interest of our clients and our shareholders. 
In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing a 7% annualized organic growth. Flows were positive across product types, client types and all our regions. Record ETF flows were a tangible example of the fundamental change we see in the ecosystem of wealth management and capital markets. 
Simple building blocks like iShares Core is a strategic holding for long-term investors, fixed income ETFs alongside bonds for institutions, large asset owners taking greater control of portfolio risk profiles with factor-based ETFs, and more and more investors are using a combination of ETFs to generate active returns. 
The investment landscape is changing, and BlackRock is investing in iShares to lead industry growth and evolution. iShares saw record first quarter inflows of $64 billion as clients sought ETFs in their portfolio, both for index exposures and as building blocks to deliver alpha. 
Last October, we anticipated the key changes impacting our retail and institutional clients that would change the way large pools of assets will be managed. We made a deliberate strategic investment in our U.S. iShares Core ETFs, positioning this business to offer the highest-quality product at the best value for our clients. This strategy is working, posting organic revenue and asset growth that exceeded our expectations. Since the strategic repricing, we have seen an acceleration in growth in our iShares U.S. Core ETFs with $52 billion of net inflows, representing a 50% annualized organic growth. 
We have experienced a sizable uptick in our core market share. And we have recaptured more than 50% of the revenue impact through organic growth alone. 
Several years ago, we anticipated growing interest from our clients in factors and smart beta. Those strategies remain a significant area of focus for BlackRock, and BlackRock is positioned to win. We saw $2 billion in net inflows into BlackRock's smart beta ETFs in the first quarter, contributing to the total factor-based net inflows of $3 billion in our first quarter. The combination of our technology platform, our distribution connectivity, our commitment to risk management and our broad investment platform will enable us to be a leader in this space. 
We believe in active management more than ever before, especially in less-efficient markets where returns are less correlated. But we believe going forward, clients will be looking for different ways and different things from Active Equity, and alpha will need to be generated in new ways. 
In October, we refined and expanded our active fixed income platform. 90% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund platform now offers top quartile performance and top quartile pricing. Our unconstrained product range is also well positioned for a rising rate environment, and we are beginning to see momentum with over $2 billion in net inflows in the quarter. 
As active equity management is being reshaped by massive investments in technology and data science, and clients are focusing more on outcomes, we recently revitalized our Active Equity platform so that we are in a position to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance to our clients. We segmented our product offering into a range of strategies that span different levels of alpha generation and value with appropriate manufacturing costs for BlackRock. And we are harnessing the power of people and technology as we lean into supporting both our fundamental and our quantitative equity managers with our shared data science and technology capabilities. We believe that levering our global scale and technology, we can drive better outcomes for our clients and future growth for BlackRock. At the end of the quarter, 65% of our fundamental active equities and 85% of our scientific active equity assets were above benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period. 
The investments that we made in iShares, in our active fixed income and in our active equities are about leveraging our breadth, our scale and our technology to reap the benefits of our competitive advantages to drive growth. And we will continue to find ways to lever those unique strengths. 
As we look for other opportunities [ to evolve ] for our clients, alternatives remain a key area of focus as our clients increasingly are searching for additional sources of income and hopefully, uncorrelated returns. We saw another strong fundraising quarter with $2 billion of commitments. And we now have more than $12 billion of uninvested committed capital to invest going forward across our $100 billion core alternative platform. 
We continue to advocate for infrastructure investing in support of policies to unlock private capital, which offer multiple benefits, including providing new sources of return for investors, creating jobs, improving productivity and increasing capacity for long-term economic growth. Today, we manage $30 billion in real assets, and we expect this to continue [ to be an ] area of growth BlackRock. 
As we look to enhance BlackRock's global credit platform, last month, we brought in Tim O'Hara to lead BlackRock's credit business alongside Jimmy Keenan. We believe that the combination of BlackRock's long established presence and expertise in fixed income and our growing alternative platform positions us to be a leading provider in both liquid and illiquid credit, which provides attractive risk-adjusted opportunity for our clients who are seeking differentiated sources of income. 
While technology has always been a key differentiator for BlackRock, it is more essential to our business than ever before. We believe technology can transform our industry, with enhanced technology and risk management helping investors achieve better outcomes. And we, at BlackRock, are leading that transformation. Our goal is to be the most sophisticated user of data and technology in the financial services industry. We seek to transform and integrate the way assets and wealth managers are creating client outcomes through portfolio construction, asset allocation, risk management and digital distribution. 
Our Aladdin technology is being used by more clients than ever before with revenues growing 12% year-over-year. And demand for Aladdin's multi-asset capabilities by institutions globally, especially in Europe and Latin America, remains strong. We also continue to see momentum in retail demand for Aladdin as interest continues to increase for Aladdin Risk for wealth management, which provides intermediaries with institutional quality portfolio construction, modeling and risk management technology. We are currently implementing a handful of clients in this technology in the United States, in Europe and in Asia. Aladdin remains the only integrated investment risk management system on the market, and we believe this differentiation will continue to drive the attractive value propositions and premium price points. 
In line with a commitment to technology, we recently nominated Chuck Robbins to our Board of Directors. Chuck has helped global corporations navigate a world being reshaped by technology advancements. We have consistently and consciously developed our board with the eye towards the future. And Chuck brings a deep understanding of technology promise to our board at a critical time for BlackRock. 
Building on record total net inflows of $202 billion in 2016, we began 2017 by continuing to invest in our business to capture the opportunities ahead of us, to drive continued growth and to aggressively leverage the benefits of our scale. We are transforming the change around us into the opportunities for the future, finding new methods to generate sustainable alpha, using technology in innovative ways, building on our platform to serve our clients' evolving needs, creating continued opportunities for our employees and delivering consistent returns for our shareholders.

As I said in my prepared remarks, we're seeing Aladdin interest in LatAm, in Europe. We have wealth management -- Aladdin for wealth management integration going on right now in Asia. And so it's continuing to drive our platform, but I'm -- where I'm most pleased, and I think -- has been the evolution of Aladdin beyond what its core competency was a few years back by allowing -- by having the ability to work with our wealth management clients and helping them having the analytical capacity to analyze the risk of every single client they have. And so especially in a world that is moving with MiFID II, with a world that is moving more towards advisory, less brokerage, I believe the need for greater oversight, greater understanding is going to be necessary. And the Aladdin platform is one of the options that many people have to drive that technology knowledge. So -- and then we will continue to do acquisitions. We have a few areas that we're looking at right now to further add opportunities that we have in technology. But let me just say importantly what technology is for BlackRock. It's the core of our culture, so it's -- and what I do believe what our clients are finding, when they have the Aladdin platform, and you have the singularity of one technology platform throughout an organization, it's driving our clients' culture. And I do believe this is going to continue to drive a component of the growth that we see for Aladdin. So we're quite excited. At times, we're pretty overwhelmed with the opportunities. But Mr. Goldstein and team have done a very good job in terms of driving those opportunities."

Good morning. So maybe I'll take a crack at that for you. I think if we could start, recall from Investor Day, which was, I guess, about 9 months ago, we showed a chart at Investor Day that detailed how despite growth of about $1.3 billion on our base fees -- and I think it was from 2012 to '15, so that chart is a little dated now. Despite that growth, our fee rate had actually declined by a little over 1 basis point. I think it was about 1.3 basis points. Organic growth drove about 30% of the revenue growth over that period of time and actually expanded our fee rate by about 1 basis point. That, I would basically refer you to as mix shift, and that is a phenomena where our organic base fee growth is actually growing faster than our organic asset growth, which frankly, with the exception of last year, has done pretty continuously. While beta and FX drove about 70% of the revenue growth, which, again, are elements outside of our direct control, it actually caused a 2 basis point decline in the fee rate over that time period. And that is really what we talk about as being divergent beta and FX. It actually increases our revenue, but it actually decreases our fee rate. And if you think about it pretty simply, the S&P has significantly outperformed global and emerging markets. And we've seen significant dollar strengthening by somewhere between 20% and 25% versus the pound and the euro. And what does that do to us? That actually causes our dollar-denominated assets to increase, which have lower fees versus products in Europe and Asia and especially in the emerging markets. Now bear in mind, over that time period, there really were no meaningful fee cuts to speak of, though obviously, we did launch the core in the fall of 2012. Last year, just to true-up that chart, the fee rate declined about 1 basis point, despite another year of positive organic fee growth in a tough market. And I think we've talked a lot about that, where the trends were generally the same. But if you look back, whether it was -- we've really generated organic base fee growth of 6% in '13, in '14 and '15. And while it dipped to 1% last year, we generated 5% organic base fee growth in the first quarter, and that's even with the fee cuts that we have announced, both in fixed income and iShares. So I think the bottom line really is divergent beta and FX in many cases, which is repricing, in some respects, $5 trillion of assets every day. But I also think that we are -- as Larry mentioned, we really feel that we're as well positioned as we've ever been to grow not only assets, but also base fees in a variety of markets and really differentiate ourselves in terms of organic growth through a variety of market cycles."

I think in that same article that Ken had mentioned, you sort of reiterated the likelihood that fee rates will continue to work lower in the industry, which I think is pretty widely understood now. So my question is, when you start thinking about the conversations you're having with the retail distributors at the point-of-sale -- around point-of-sale economics, what's happening with that dialogue? Because the way I see is that that's sort of like a fixed rate, somewhere 5 to 10 basis points. But as the management fee rate continues to work lower, that economic model seems to be under a lot of strain in my view. And is technology the answer? And just how do you sort of think that, that plays out?"

I think ultimately, this comes down to our ability to generate sustainable alpha. I think if we can generate sustainable alpha in a way that, in some ways, kind of captures 3 to 4x the fee over time, I think we'll be fine. If we're in a period of significantly lower returns and lower sustainable alpha, then obviously, I think fee rates are going to have to come down accordingly."

There is a greater belief that long-term returns are structurally lower than they were 10 and 20 years ago. So if you have an expected long-term return of, let's say, 6%, which many people think that might be high when you look at a balanced portfolio. Fees take up a lot of that return. And as long as we believe the world is going to be in a low-return environment, our clients are under a lot of pressure. And clients are looking for different ways of seeking those outcomes. And this is why I actually believe why more clients are coming to us now because they have this structural problem. Their liability or their actuarial needs are greater than they could earn with their asset base. And so they're looking either to barbell or looking to have less expensive products. But they're looking for a much more holistic solution. And I think the era where a manager sold a product, a sole product, that is what's being threatened today. And as Rob just said, we're in a great position with our clients to try to help them with these really difficult issues. We've had a couple state funds announce that they're lowering their actuarial rates. That's very hard to do. A -- if a state fund lowers their actuarial rate, that means they have to go to their unions and say, ""Pay more."" That means they have to go to the state and say, ""Contribute more."" And so this is one of the real issues that I think is being lost. It's being -- and so when you talk about -- or when we talk about fee pressure, fee pressure comes from the real issue of lower expectated (sic) [ expected ] returns. And I think this is one of the big issues around hedge funds and why we're constantly reading about some hedge funds closing, some hedge funds are lowering their fees, because the fee structures are just too large versus the returns on a risk-adjusted basis that they're achieving. So this is a broad-based issue. It's not just in the wealth management area. It's across the spectrum of clients. I know I'm belaboring this point, but I think it's a very important point. But this is the environment we all live in. And I think this is in an environment that really positions BlackRock in a very differentiated way. So we understand this problem, we're dealing with this issue and we're taking advantage of it. I'll leave it at that."

So we look at technology not just for portfolio construction and portfolio management. We're using it for client connectivity. We're using it for efficiencies within our platform. The technology advancements we made in Aladdin, related to dealing with our custodial bank, saves us large sums of money. So I want to talk about -- technology is changing every component of our firm. And I think this is one of the reasons why our margins have been consistently strong by the utilization of technology across all the spectrums. You asked specifically related to technology, related to investing. Because the advancements in technology, because the utilization of sensor technology, because the Internet playing a role in everything and anything we do, there is information that we could not search for or find years ago, whether it is communication by employees about their firms and consumer sentiments about a product. And so by having the ability to do deep dives on data, interpreting that data through different algorithms and models, hopefully, that will be creating excess alpha. So it creates product, it creates product returns. And so that's where we look at the greatest amount of advancements. We're also looking at computers, and can computers be learning and adapting in markets. But that's something for the future. But importantly, technology today for data analysis, technology for very quick analysis of that data is going to be really the key component of driving, I believe, returns and active investing in the future. And I do believe, because technology has created the efficiencies, it creates more efficiencies across, and we can pass on those efficiencies also to our clients. And I think this is one thing that's being missed. Here we are, as we talk about some of the fee cuts, and yet, we have an increase of 100 basis points in margins. So we look at technology as a great efficiency provider for investing, for custodial assets, for communicating with our custodial clients, for communicating with our employees, for communicating with our clients. So it is the key element that is going to transform BlackRock, and I would say, every other financial services company. So technology is what is driving the scale at BlackRock, and it's driving, hopefully, better outcomes for and to our clients."

And quite frankly, after many years in the business, I can't think of a better product to use for asset allocation than ETFs. So one is, it's going to be a tool where we're going to use it for our precision-type investments where you can accent one specific area of the market in your portfolio. Two is that you can actually make better judgments in the active equity space by using what we would call smart beta ETFs, so that would be a bit of a derivative to it, but focused on certain factors that you'd want to have. Three is that it's an obvious part of a multi-asset solution, which is a growing area of the market where you'd have just -- you need -- in order to get the returns that Larry is talking about in a low interest rate environment, you need to focus on specific sectors of the market, and ETFs will allow you to do that at the right value. And the third thing, which I really like, is in the fixed income area, where the exposure to just one particular fixed income bond is not going to give you that type of return. There's just too much risk for the cost of that. So by using an ETF in that -- in the asset allocation model in your fixed income portion, you also are diversifying your risk substantially at a much lower cost. Also the world is moving more towards portfolio construction capabilities. This is going to be in what we're calling models that we're going to be offering. They offer much higher levels of risk management, and here is where we can utilize our technology as a differentiator because we can actually deliver a multi-asset solution which has the right risk requirements for that particular client. And we're building technology around that. So you've heard us mention Aladdin Portfolio Builder where we're giving financial advisers the ability to take a multi-asset portfolio and put it together using our products, using other peoples' products to come up with the ultimate solution. We're using it in a product that we call iRetire, where we're trying to help get in the middle of solving probably the largest problem facing our country and others today, which is the lack of savings for retirement, getting those -- getting that cash that's sitting on the sidelines working for people those -- for those people that are going to retire, and being able to illustrate to financial advisers and their clients better capabilities to achieve those results. And then also expanding into giving model portfolios to the financial advisers and to our clients to use to solve their problems. So we have the technology on the outside. And then on the inside, we have precision instruments through the ETF business that can help our clients achieve their financial objectives."

I'll just give a little bit of a quick overview and then Larry and Rob can jump in as they feel. I mean, I think ultimately, we're looking at both efficiencies and development and maturity of markets. And when we think here about the repositioning, it really follows much more along the line of how we approached our product segmentation work with iShares a number of years ago, at the end of 2012. And in that case, it was really trying to align who the particular buyers of a product were with the right fees. And in this case, it was really trying to align our ability to generate sustainable alpha in certain products with the fee potential. And so if you think about segmenting the products between kind of core alpha and high conviction, in some respects, I think it's somewhat of an acknowledgment that in many parts of the U.S., large cap markets in particular, ability to really generate sustainable alpha and still charge premium fees in terms of very broad-based portfolios that really tinker around indexes -- I don't want to necessarily say index hugging per se, but your ability to take risk and generate incremental return needs to be much more closely aligned with the fee potential. And so it was really in that context that we really tried to align fee with the ability to generate a certain level of sustainable alpha. Outside of the U.S. market, in lesser developed markets, less-efficient markets, more dispersion, less correlation, I think we still feel very strongly in places like Europe and Asia and certain emerging markets that, frankly, the ability to generate sustainable alpha can support higher fees. And I think our performance has certainly showed that over time."

So in the platform that the portfolio managers are going to be using going forward, they're going to have the ability to tap in to both the data that we're getting from our technology, from our Scientific Active Equity Groups and the fundamental groups because we believe that those people talking together, using the data, using the signals that we're getting and the block-and-tackle fundamental approach together are better than either individually. So it is a platform change that we made. It did have, because of the reasons Gary cited, more immediate attention on the U.S., but it's a platform change that we're making globally in our active investment business."

Aladdin is more than just a risk management platform. It's an enterprise platform. So a, there are many companies that provide enterprise platforms for different companies, whether it's Oracle or SAP or cloud computing. So an enterprise system -- and that's what Aladdin really is because it's a front, middle and back-office platform. And a component of it is risk management. I think you're referring to the risk management component of it. It's a service model. We provide with different models. Each individual client can put their own algorithms onto Aladdin that are customized for them. So they can interpret the models. So it's not a platform that is monolithic with one model. And so the notion that the fact that many people use it that it becomes systemic is just not a point of understanding what a platform really is. I think by the clients' interest, the opportunities we have, the opportunities are as large as ever. And it is because of this enterprise solution. And as we now have Aladdin provider working with the custodial banks, ultimately, it's going to simplify all trading -- trade entry, compliance, working alongside with the custodial bank. It creates so much more efficiencies for the users across the Aladdin system. So if we could provide for Aladdin, for our other clients, this enterprise system that creates these [ type ] efficiencies that make them in a better position, we're all better off from it. So it's -- once again, Aladdin is a service model. It's not BlackRock's models. And so I think we have -- we're happy to give you a demo on Aladdin, what it is and what it isn't."

I'm hoping that you'll see both. I mean, as Rob said, part of the repositioning in the active portfolio was basically trying to use scale to bring better outcomes to clients, obviously, in terms of better sustainable alpha at a more efficient price point for them. But the intent at the end of the day is to generate incremental growth for BlackRock shareholders by having a better value proposition in terms of price and performance that we think, ultimately, will drive better organic growth. In terms of some of the things you mentioned around just leveraging service providers, in many cases, in certain instances, our clients pay those fees, in which case that will be a direct benefit to them, and in certain cases, as if -- in our ETF, which is a unitary price structure, BlackRock itself pays those fees, so our shareholders will clearly benefit. So I think that in all cases, we're going to basically try to use our scale to drive growth. That growth is ultimately better for both clients as well as shareholders. And I think, as you look at margin expansion over -- whether it's just the last year-over-year where it was 100 basis points or frankly, ever since we closed the BGI deal at the end of 2009, margins are probably up 400 to 500-plus basis points since then. And I think there is no question that we're using our scale to generate better outcomes for both clients and shareholders. If it's good for the client at the end of the day, we strongly believe it's going to be good for the BlackRock shareholder."

It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release d",1619,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. 
While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be proposing primarily on as-adjusted results. BlackRock's globally integrated technology and investment platform continues to position us as the solutions provider of choice for both retail and institutional clients. The breadth and scale of our capabilities allows us to continuously and efficiently reinvest in our investment, distribution, technology and risk management franchises in order to provide increased ties both clients and shareholders over time. 
As a result of that commitment to reinvest, net inflows for the last 12 months totaled $336 billion as organic growth accelerated in the second quarter. Total quarterly closed exceeded $100 billion and were positive across client types, asset classes and investment styles, highlighting the uniqueness of our diversified investment platform, which includes cash, market cap weighted index products, a spectrum of active offerings from smart beta and factors to high conviction alpha strategies and illiquid alternatives. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were a record for BlackRock and represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7% annualized organic base fee growth was 8% for the quarter and 5% for the last 12 months despite the pricing changes we have previously announced over the last 9 months. 
Record quarterly revenue of $3 billion was 6% up over a year ago. Operating income of $1.2 billion was also 6% higher than a year ago, and earnings per share of $5.24 increased 10%. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $26 million of net investment gains, an increase from the second quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter and the impact of our debt refinancing last quarter. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.5%. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected cash run rate for the remainder of 2017 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. 
Second quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year driven primarily by the positive impact of organic growth and market appreciation on average AUM, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements and certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's second quarter. 
While the dollar has recently given us gains versus major currencies, the impact of dollar appreciation over the last year still reduced our quarterly year-over-year based fee growth by about 1%. 
Sequentially, base fees were up 6% and benefited from higher securities lending revenue in the second quarter, which increased 11%, driven by seasonality and higher on loan balances. Last 
month at the Morgan Stanley conference, I spoke about several exogenous factors, including divergent beta and FX that have negatively impacted our blended fee rate over the last several years and mask the benefit we have achieved from executing our differentiated growth strategy. As some of these headwinds lessened during the second quarter with emerging markets outperforming U.S. markets and the U.S. dollar weakening, our blended fee rate has stabilized and the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth should become more apparent. 
Performance fees of $48 million decreased $26 million from the prior year due to weaker relative performance and loan-only equity funds with annual locks in the second quarter. 
Technology and risk management revenue of $164 million increased 12% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the Aladdin platform and new client wins. 
Market demand remains strong for our full range of products, including institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, Provider Aladdin, iRetire and FutureAdvisor. 
Clients continue to seek sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio of construction and scalable distribution tools and our first 3 Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management clients went live on the platform earlier in the quarter. 
In line with our strategic focus on technology to enhance value and deliver innovative solutions to clients, we announced the acquisition of Cachematrix, a leading provider of financial technology that simplifies the cash management process for corporate treasury clients and the minority investment in Scalable Capital, one of the fastest-growing digital investment managers in Europe. 
Together with our minority investment in iCapital, we believe BlackRock can significantly enhance the growth profile of these businesses while simultaneously benefiting from their unique capabilities. 
The strong organic growth we are experiencing today is a result of the investments we've made in our business over time, and we continue to invest aggressively to create more opportunity for the future. 
Expense increased 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense as a result of higher-average AUM and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $24 million or 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher headcount. 
Sequentially, compensation expense was down 2%, reflecting lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter and $20 million of onetime expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform in the prior quarter. 
The accelerating shift to passes is impacting growth in our volume-related expense and direct fund expense was up $29 million or 15% year-over-year primarily reflecting significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
G&A expense was up $34 million or 11% year-over-year, reflecting increased levels of spent to drive growth, including investments in technology and data and higher discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Year-over-year comparisons were also impacted by the timing of certain approvals and additional expense related to the sale of our U.K. defined contribution platform. 
Sequentially, G&A expense increased $49 million from the first quarter or 16%, reflecting similar increases in technology, data and marketing spend, but also higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter. 
Assuming stable markets and given the timing and levels of our spend in the first half of 2017, we would anticipate planned G&A expense for the second half of 2017 to be in the range of $750 million. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was flat year-over-year and up 130 basis points sequentially. As we have stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. 
We're also committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and and then returning excess cash to shareholders. 
In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of First Reserves infrastructure equity funds. Larry will talk more about additional investments in innovation across the broader ecosystem to support future growth. 
We also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were positive across client types and the diversified across asset classes and investment styles. Long-term net inflows were driven by iShares, which crossed $1.5 trillion of global AUM in the quarter and continue to benefit from the accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth channel and the rapid adoption of iShares' ETFs as asset allocation tools and financial instruments by professional money managers. 
Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $74 billion, representing 21% annualized organic growth with strength across our core and noncore exposures. In the 9 months since we announced pricing changes to the core in October of last year, we have already recaptured over 75% of our investment to organic growth alone.
 iShares' equity net inflows of $52 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee position exposures and smart beta ETFs. 
Fixed income iShares net inflows of $21 billion were led by flows into investment-grade corporate, emerging market bonds and treasury funds. 
Our institutional business generated $13 billion of long-term net inflows across both active and index strategies. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by strong multi-asset and alternative inflows, partially offset by equity and fixed income outflows. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath Target A series, which saw record net inflows of $9 billion. 
We also saw strength in fiduciary mandates and factors, each with approximately $1 billion of net inflows. Alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows, driven primarily by our global infrastructure franchise. 
Institutional index net inflows of $9 billion reflected strong close of $17 billion into fixed income, partially offset by index equity outflows of $9 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation decisions during the quarter. 
Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally, led by fixed income and index equity products, partially offset by outflows from multi-asset. 
Fixed income net inflows of $7 billion were diversified across our top-performing platform and included $1 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well a strong flows into municipals and total return strategies. 
While total multi-asset flows were, once again, impacted by outflows from world allocation strategies, our multi-asset income strategy, nevertheless, raised another $2 billion during the quarter as investors continue to target income-oriented outcomes. 
BlackRock's second quarter results reflects the benefits of our ongoing commitment to continuously invest for the future. Our diversification, scale and globally integrated investment in technology platform enables us to generate differentiated and more consistent organic growth in AUM and base fees, resulting in long-term value creation for both clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,528688129,1244517,"BlackRock, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2017",2017-07-17,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary.

BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform. BlackRock's ability to partner with clients across our broad range of investment strategies and technology solutions and as a thought leader drove $104 billion of total net inflows in the quarter with a record $94 billion in long-term strategies, which were positive across all client types, product types and investment styles. 
While significant cash remains on the sidelines, investors have begun to put more of their assets to work and global equity markets continue to rise in the quarter, underscoring a generally healthier global economy and proving that so far, markets have been resilient to political shocks. 
Through the second quarter, the S&P was up 8% year-to-date, reaching all-time highs, and many international markets have even outperformed. 
At the same time, while markets have started to anticipate a normalization of policy in the environment of sustained expansion, negative yields remain a reality in some countries and expectation for a continued low-yield environment persist. 
And while amounts of cash is still invested and the ongoing risk of both economic and political disruption on the horizons, investors continue to face challenges in meeting their clients' future needs. 
Both institutional and retail clients are looking to BlackRock for investment strategies and for Aladdin risk management and portfolio construction technology. 
They're also turning to BlackRock for insights to help them understand how to navigate the investment landscape. 
Insurance companies are one example of clients that continue to face significant challenges in this low-yield environment. Last month, leveraging BlackRock's extensive experience with the need of insurance clients and risk modeling capabilities, we launched an insurance industry risk study. We took the investment portfolios of the entire U.S. insurance industry at the individual security line item level, uploading them onto Aladdin and then cut the data in a variety of ways to see who's taking what kinds of risk and how they are being rewarded for that type of risk. And we brought together a group of insurance company CEOs to talk about the results, to answer questions like what is the current opportunity set in their own individual portfolio and how should they be positioned in the event of a stressed economy or another crisis. We also showed the CEOs how their investment positions reflected versus their peers. And so as an incredible peer analysis for the CEOs. Our goal was to provide them with more information to look to BlackRock to help them making strategic decisions that would ultimately drive their stakeholder returns. 
This is just one example. BlackRock is increasingly using our technology, our scale and innovative ways to enhance the value that we can provide to our clients. 
As a wealth management landscape evolves globally, our intermediary partners are accelerating their movement, their changes towards a fee-based advisory and fee-based accounts and are expected to grow by upward of $8 trillion in the U.S. over the next several years. As a result, our wealth partners are placing more emphasis than ever before on portfolios, not just a product, not just an individual bond or not just an individual stock. They're all so focused on both performance and the value that the underlying investments can provide to investors and increasingly, our partners are looking for access to high-quality portfolio construction and digital technologies to help execute repeatable processes. 
In this environment, BlackRock is able to provide more value to wealth management client than ever before. And in the U.S. through technology like Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, which I'll talk about in a few minutes, the reinvention of our sales model and tech-enabled advisory engagement had allowed us to partner with 25% more financial advisers this year than we did the same point last year at no additional cost. 
The combination of BlackRock's differentiated technology offerings and our broad-based investment platforms position us as the most sophisticated portfolio construction partner in the industry for both institutions and wealth managers. 
Looking at flows for the quarter. BlackRock saw $8 billion of active net flows, driven by multi-asset fixed income and alternatives, which contributed to strong organic-based fee growth in the quarter. 
BlackRock is seeing increasingly strong fundraising momentum in illiquid alternatives with $9 billion in flows and commitment year-to-date with particularly strengthened infrastructure funds as the the investments we've made in our platform over time are resonating with our clients. 
Our acquisition of First Reserve infrastructure equity funds, which closed in the quarter as a talented team with specific expertise and energy infrastructure investing and $3 billion of assets to our platform. We now have over $16 billion of total investment and commitment infrastructure capital to manage on behalf of our clients. 
We also launched the U.K.'s first alternative solution fund earlier this month. The fund offers pension searching for yield, a long term outcome-oriented strategy in a single portfolio, which again leverages BlackRock specialist teams across credit, real estate and infrastructure. 
We now manage $98 billion of assets across our core alternative platform and have an additional $15 billion of committed capital to invest going forward. 
BlackRock saw $86 billion of net inflows into iShares and index funds in the second quarter. Global iShares momentum continued with a record $74 billion of net inflows for a total of $138 billion on net inflows year-to-date. 
As growth continues following our strategic investment to lower prices for clients, we generated $35 billion of inflows in iShares' core funds in the quarter. 
Importantly, noncore iShares exposures generated over $38 billion of flows, contributing to a higher organic base fee growth for the firm. 
The rapid growth we're seeing in iShares is increasingly due to the fact that ETFs are no longer used only as a passive allocation, but by active investors to generate alpha in their portfolios. ETFs provide those targeting exposures without the idiosyncratic risk of any one single stock or one any single bond. 
Accelerating growth is also coming from the investments we're making more broadly to innovate across the entire ETF ecosystem. This is more than just a product innovation, it's innovation in distribution, it's innovation in portfolio construction technology and ETF in portfolio construction education and in building new markets for new users, all of which foster further adaptation of ETFs worldwide. 
As we deepen our partnership with clients and continue to strengthen our brand through both investment in technology offerings, global iShares market share of year-to-date flows has expanded to more than 40%. 
Fixed income ETFs are a great example of the area where broad ecosystem innovation is driving growth. 
After several years of BlackRock working with the national association of insurance commissioners on the mechanics of fixed income ETFs, accounting guidelines will now treat them as bonds instead of equities. They will treat it through as a look through treatment to the underlying assets, making it much more efficient for insurers to own fixed income ETFs for their portfolios. 
Another example is the new segment for ETF. We recently announced changes in our iShares ETF MBB, the industry flagship mortgage backed security ETF, to drive accelerated growth. 
We're evolving MBB, or our mortgage-backed bond ETFs, to become the leading financial instrument, and I want to underline risk management tool for institutions to access fully funded exposures to physical mortgage pools. 
By lowering the price to make the fund competitive with direct investments in mortgage securities, institutions will have a more efficient, a more liquid option for hedging their mortgage-backed exposures and their direct mortgage origination. 
We also launched BlackRock's first self index ETFs. Two smart beta fixed income ETFs. These new indexes are based on unique intellectual property and leveraging the best of BlackRock's analytics and modeling capabilities to achieve superior investment outcome for clients. This illustrates one of the ways we are using our scale in technology to reduce manufacturing costs and pass along greater savings to our clients. 
Technology is transforming the asset management industry, and that pace of technology innovation is accelerating. I've talked about BlackRock's aspirational target of 30% of our revenue being enabled by technology 5 years from now. That is a vision for how I believe technology will help drive revenues and create efficiencies across BlackRock. Some of that vision will be driven by growth in Aladdin and our technology offerings, but much of it will come from using technology to drive investment performance and build better distribution capabilities, ultimately delivering growth in base fees and performance fees. And in addition, I am using this target as a mechanism to get all 13,000 of BlackRock's employees to understand how technology and the utilization of technology is going to change BlackRock, is going to change our clients' needs, and will change the entire ecosystem in what we do. 
Technology will impact all aspects of our business. The way we generate Alpha, the way we build portfolios, the way we manage risk, the way we distribute solutions, the way we engage with service providers, the way we operate and even the way we source talent. 
Aladdin's portfolio and risk management technology continues to be in demand by institutional clients looking to invest and operate smarter and with more efficiencies. We now have nearly 200 institutional clients using Aladdin. Our investment teams are combining big data and machine learning with traditional fundamental human analysis to generate better sustainable Alpha for our clients. 
As portfolios become increasingly complex and interconnected, we are leveraging our analytical and risk management technology to create more sophisticated and more scalable portfolio construction. Asset allocation and risk management tools for wealth management. Our first 3 Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management clients are now live and they're benefiting from the Aladdin technology. 
We are also providing our wealth management partners with integrated digital distribution platforms so they can reach and interact with their investors in a more scalable, in a more repeatable way. 
Building on our acquisitions of FutureAdvisor, our investment in iCapital, we continue to expand our digital distribution capabilities with the acquisition of Cachematrix and a minority investment in Scalable Capital, both platforms will allow us to provide our clients with scalable technology-enabled solutions. 
In addition to driving growth, we're using Aladdin to drive operating efficiencies. The investments we've made in our trading technology and operations have dramatically reduced the cost of our trades. We have reduced our trades by 80% over the last 5 years. This has been a huge reduction in those basic cost, and it's totally driven by technology. 
Going forward, technology-enabled scale will be increasingly important for every aspects of an asset managers business, our client service, our asset generation and operational excellence. 
This year, we will be spending $1 billion on technology and data, and have over 3,500 employees working on technology and data-related roles. We recently signed a 20-year lease for our new global headquarters at Hudson Yards in New York, which will be the state-of-the-art hub that is technologically advanced, environmentally sustainable and operationally resilient. Our new headquarters will epitomize our tech-centric culture and create a world-class experience for our people and our clients. 
As I've said many times, but I mean it as much as ever today, I have never seen more opportunities for BlackRock than I do today. The record growth we're seeing is a direct result of the investments we made to build our platform over time. Continuing to invest in high-growth areas of our business and moving into adjacent areas to enhance the solutions we get offered to our clients, both remain a critical priorities in order to drive future growth and provide increased value to both our clients and to our shareholders. 
With that, let me open it up for questions."

Obviously, there are long implementations as there are for any Aladdin implementation, which could be as long as 12 to 18 months, where we bear more significant cost upfront as we've talked about before. But I think really the clients that we had -- we're all still learning together about all of the amazing things that we can do with these clients, both from a top down in terms of some of the risk and compliance opportunities and then more importantly, some of the other bottoms-up, more specific financial adviser opportunities regarding portfolio of construction and asset allocation that move from adviser on up.

Ultimately, Aladdin for Wealth Management is going to be dealt at the house level, at the CIO level and then ultimately, will be implemented may be depending on each firm at the individual financial adviser level, and this will allow us to have an opportunity to be a financial advisers desktops. So the actual implementation probably is a little longer because it's the significance of the scale of it. But let's be clear, this may become one of the great opportunities for BlackRock. We are going to continue to be driving more and more of the opportunities for Aladdin for Wealth Management. I see this being our transformation for our position in retail globally. And what I believe this does, it allows BlackRock to be even more important in the overall ecosystem in wealth management. It gives us -- the Aladdin system will provide portfolio construction tools. It provides risk management. It is not a tools to sell only BlackRock products, it is a tool that enhance the wealth  managers' value proposition. They'll be able to use other products to other firms, but we believe by having that placement in the desktop, that placement -- and we've seen this in other areas, it gives us that opportunity to have deeper, better dialogues. And so we look at this is one of the more fundamental, long-term strategies for our positioning. And as Gary suggested, their revenues now -- that the revenues are very somehow how the institutional side are, they're very modest and the margins are subdued during this process of implementation. And once utilized, depending on how well they're utilized by the amount of financial advisers, then we would expect increased utilization and through increased utilization were revenues from the platform."

One thing I would say, the key issue for Europe is over 72% of all savings is in cash in Europe. One of the great reasons why P/E ratios are lower in Europe than the United States is most savers are only in cash and bank deposits. If through regulatory changes, through digital advice, through low-cost alternatives, if we could provide Europeans with a better alternative, that they look towards for investing overall long horizon by being position there with digital technology with our iShares brand in Europe, I think we're as well positioned us any firm in the whole continent."

We're seeing regulatory changes, we're seeing regulatory changes change of the ETFs environment. We do believe we're seeing accelerated flows because of the MiFID II, because of the movement towards the fiduciary rolling in the United States. We're seeing more active investors using ETFs to express their exposures, which I talked about. I think that is accelerating. Having the insurance commissioners changing capital -- having a look through treatment for fixed income ETFs is very important because insurance industry did not use EPS because the differential in capital charges just because of the CUSIP number and now you have a look through treatment. And so we believe the environmental for ETFs is continuing to evolve. We believe it's continuing to grow. And much of it also has to do with ecosystem innovation. I think what we are doing in the mortgage-backed area is going to have even a large opportunity for ETF growth as we can now use ETFs as a via call to hedge mortgage production. So I think what's going on is -- and then I'll let Rob Kapito to speak up. I do believe you're seeing more utilization ETFs from institutions and retail for an exposure in the active side, we're seeing more utilization across the board in more products. And I think that's what we're starting to see that acceleration. I just -- before Rob speaks, I just want to site one important point. Index and ETF still only represent 10% of the entire equity market global capitalization. And here we are talking about a great amount of flows but with $160-odd add trillion global equity market capitalization, we have much more opportunities for ETFs to grow, not just in equities but in fixed income. And I believe this is just the beginning. It reminds me of when Rob and I were young, driving the mortgage-backed securities market in the late '70s, early '80s.

So there's new and newer uses for ETFs every single day, and that's why what we're trying to do is respond to be in front of our clients, and we have to go out and discuss with them ways that they can use ETFs that they have not been able to use than before.

So again, I just want to take a step back, again, just back to the Morgan Stanley conference. So we talked there about the fact that the blended fee rate over the last several years has, obviously, been impacted by a variety of factors that we don't control. We've talked about them as exogenous factors. We've, obviously, pointed to both divergent equity beta, dollar appreciation, but importantly, also shifting client preferences towards lower risk asset classes and index strategies, especially last year where, obviously, we saw probably -- we saw a large dispersion between our asset growth rate and our base fee growth rate, and that actually had also has an impact by virtue of mix in terms of our fee rate. And I think all of those factors have really masked the benefit we have achieved from executing a pretty good differentiated growth strategy. The fee rate declined about 1.4 basis points from the second quarter of last year, and that was a continuation of some of the things we've talked about impacted international market underperformance, dollar appreciation throughout last year, impact importantly of recent price cuts or what we would rather call an investment in our iShares franchise that were not reflected in last year's prior second quarter. And importantly, a slower rate of organic base fee growth relative to asset growth in the second half of last Year. 
Sequentially, the fee rate has stabilized as those headwinds as you mentioned associated with the divergent beta and FX have abated and should those trends continue, the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth rate, which has been about 6% year-to-date so far clearly should be a more apparent over time. 
In my opinion, if we can sustain organic base fee growth in excess of 5% and frankly, we've done that in 2012, '13, '14, '15 and year-to-date this year, last year was really the first year in the last five that we didn't do that, I'm not really sure why the fee rate itself is garnering that much attention other than I understand that it's the basis of a lot of the modeling that everybody is doing. But I think right now, we're feeling incredibly comfortable with the level of organic base fee growth rate that we're seeing and are paying a little less attention to the overall fee rate as long as we can generate that revenue momentum."

So we announced changes to our active equity platform in March. These changes were not effective until mid- to late-June. So it's a little early to tell and see any material progress from the [indiscernible] of flows and financial advice. But as anticipated, we saw some accelerated outflows from the funds impacted by the changes, which contributed to some of the active equity outflows in the second quarter. But other of our fundamental active equity funds that weren't part of the changes to the platform actually saw a slight improvement in outflows. Additionally, we had a few large client redemptions from our scientific active equity. But a portion of these outflows were recaptured on our platform as certain clients move in to index strategies. So our focus is going to be on generating strong performance, which we believe differentiates our ability to work with our clients to achieve their desired long-term outcomes to drive improvements in both the scientific and fundamental active equity funds since last year. And there, I've already seen some excellent performance in the quantitative side, 92% of our active, quantitative active equity and 78% of our fundamental active equity assets are above their benchmark and peer mediums for the 3-year period. And then the creation of our advantage series, which is offering clients the ability to outperform and have the lowest fees, all of those are showing results and all of this, I believe, is part of our announcement of monarch and the upside that we have to come. So we're very encouraged. The portfolio managers are energized to be out, to share information across multiple platforms. We've heard very positive views of our clients because everyone is focused on figuring out how to utilize the big data that's out there to their advantage to great performance.

So just to give a little bit of color on the people and the investment. That 3,500 rough-cut people in technology and data-related roles includes expected technology roles such as programmers and plump modelers, but also less obvious ones that leverage technology and data in a significant way like our iShares analytics and electronic trading teams. So as Larry basically mentioned, we're thinking technology much more holistically, not as a specific definition, but embracing technology to drive our overall business. We're spending about $1 billion this year to support that technology and data initiative, which includes a number of things, but also includes compensation and related expenses associated with obviously, those people as well as hardware, software and market data costs for the firm more broadly. I think in terms of margins more broadly, as you know, we're not really big on talking about individual margins of vertical businesses. And so as we really think about incremental margins on specific products or businesses that's not an overwhelming relevant number that we think about me today. But, for example, to think about driving growth in iShares as an example, we're investing beyond simple product innovation, we're investing in the entire ETF ecosystem, we investing in distribution, we're investing in portfolio construction technology, we're investing in capital markets, ETF and portfolio construction, education. We're talking about building new markets for new users, and I think there's no question that the accelerating growth that we're seeing in iShares is a direct result of those investments more broadly. We're really trying to take a much more portfolio-oriented approach to investing in technology. And so, notwithstanding some of the things that we're doing that go also to our P&L, you're also seeing us make a number of strategic acquisitions or other investments. Sometimes their control like Cachematrix and sometimes they're really getting a seat on the table and try to learn and help our partners evolve like Scalable Capital and iCapital. I think the important thing is that whichever direction we're going to go, we're going to continue to use our scale, which we think is a huge driver of our ability to officially spend on technology and ways that others can't really to drive that growth and increase market share for both shareholders and our clients."

And in my view, my personal view, quarterly comparisons here are less relevant and you really should look at our performance over a more appropriate period of time, especially in the context of the organic growth that we're generating today. Our commitment has not changed. Our commitment has always been to optimize organic growth in a most efficient way possible, especially by leveraging our scale for both clients and shareholders. And I think if you look back over the work that we've done since BGI, in particular, the operating margin is up well over 500 basis points, and we've invested significantly back into the business. We are currently generating record organic growth, especially in terms of base fees. As I mentioned over the last 12 months, $335 billion-plus of net new business, that's 7% organic AUM growth, and importantly, 5% organic base fee growth. There was a significant time where people were asking us when we're going to get to those levels, and while I think it's still early to call it sustainable for a significant period of time, this level of growth is clearly a direct result of the investments that we've made over time. No one likes higher margins than I do or well maybe the guy sitting next to me actually does, but I also know that our level of organic growth determines on multiple and continuing to invest to support this record levels of organic growth is a critical priority for us and one that will be maintained going forward. While there is, obviously, an upward bias to our margin as we continue to grow in a constructive environment, I think as Larry indicated in his remarks, we intend to continue playing offense by aggressively investing to create more opportunities for future growth."

It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release d",1617,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's globally integrated technology and investment platform continues to position us as the solutions provider of choice to both retail and institutional clients. The breadth and scale of our capabilities allows us to continuously and efficiently reinvest in our investment, distribution, technology and risk management franchises in order to provide increased ties both clients and shareholders over time. 
As a result of that commitment to reinvest, net inflows for the last 12 months totaled $336 billion as organic growth accelerated in the second quarter. Total quarterly flows exceeded $100 billion and were positive across client types, asset classes and investment styles, highlighting the uniqueness of our diversified investment platform, which includes cash, market cap weighted index products, a spectrum of active offerings from smart beta and factors to high conviction alpha strategies and illiquid alternatives. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were a record for BlackRock and represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%. Annualized organic base fee growth was 8% for the quarter and 5% for the last 12 months despite the pricing changes we have previously announced over the last 9 months. 
Record quarterly revenue of $3 billion was 6% up over a year ago. Operating income of $1.2 billion was also 6% higher than a year ago, and earnings per share of $5.24 increased 10%. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $26 million of net investment gains, an increase from the second quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter and the impact of our debt refinancing last quarter. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.5%. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable protected -- projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. 
Second quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year driven primarily by the positive impact of organic growth and market appreciation on average AUM, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements and certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's second quarter. 
While the dollar has recently given up gains versus major currencies, the impact of dollar appreciation over the last year still reduced our quarterly year-over-year based fee growth by about 1%. Sequentially, base fees were up 6% and benefited from higher securities lending revenue in the second quarter, which increased 11%, driven by seasonality and higher on-loan balances. 
Last month at the Morgan Stanley conference, I spoke about several exogenous factors, including divergent beta and FX that have negatively impacted our blended fee rate over the last several years and masked the benefit we have achieved from executing our differentiated growth strategy. As some of these headwinds lessened during the second quarter, with emerging markets outperforming U.S. markets and the U.S. dollar weakening, our blended fee rate has stabilized and the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth should become more apparent. 
Performance fees of $48 million decreased $26 million from the prior year due to weaker relative performance and loan-only equity funds with annual locks in the second quarter. Technology and risk management revenue of $164 million increased 12% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the Aladdin platform and new client wins. 
Market demand remains strong for our full range of products, including institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, Provider Aladdin, iRetire and FutureAdvisor. Clients continue to seek sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio of construction and scalable distribution tools and our first 3 Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management clients went live on the platform earlier in the quarter. 
In line with our strategic focus on technology to enhance value and deliver innovative solutions to clients, we announced the acquisition of Cachematrix, a leading provider of financial technology that simplifies the cash management process for corporate treasury clients and the minority investment in Scalable Capital, one of the fastest-growing digital investment managers in Europe. Together with our minority investment in iCapital, we believe BlackRock can significantly enhance the growth profile of these businesses while simultaneously benefiting from their unique capabilities. 
The strong organic growth we are experiencing today is a result of the investments we've made in our business over time, and we continue to invest aggressively to create more opportunity for the future. 
Expense increased 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense as a result of higher-average AUM and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $24 million or 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher headcount. Sequentially, compensation expense was down 2%, reflecting lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter and $20 million of onetime expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform in the prior quarter. 
The accelerating shift to passes is impacting growth in our volume-related expense and direct fund expense was up $29 million or 15% year-over-year primarily reflecting significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
G&A expense was up $34 million or 11% year-over-year, reflecting increased levels of spend to drive growth, including investments in technology and data and higher discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Year-over-year comparisons were also impacted by the timing of certain approvals and additional expense related to the sale of our U.K. defined contribution platform. 
Sequentially, G&A expense increased $49 million from the first quarter or 16%, reflecting similar increases in technology, data and marketing spend, but also higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter. 
Assuming stable markets and given the timing and levels of our spend in the first half of 2017, we would anticipate planned G&A expense for the second half of 2017 to be in the range of $750 million. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was flat year-over-year and up 130 basis points sequentially. As we have stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target but remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. 
We're also committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of First Reserves infrastructure equity funds. Larry will talk more about additional investments in innovation across the broader ecosystem to support future growth. We also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and investment styles. Long-term net inflows were driven by iShares, which crossed $1.5 trillion of global AUM in the quarter and continue to benefit from the accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth channel and the rapid adoption of iShares' ETFs as asset allocation tools and financial instruments by professional money managers. 
Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $74 billion, representing 21% annualized organic growth with strength across our core and noncore exposures. In the 9 months since we announced pricing changes to the core in October of last year, we have already recaptured over 75% of our investment through organic growth alone.
iShares' equity net inflows of $52 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares' net inflows of $21 billion were led by flows into investment-grade corporate, emerging market bond and treasury funds. 
Our institutional business generated $13 billion of long-term net inflows across both active and index strategies. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by strong multi-asset and alternative inflows, partially offset by equity and fixed income outflows. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath Target A series, which saw record net inflows of $9 billion. We also saw strength in fiduciary mandates and factors, each with approximately $1 billion of net inflows. Alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows, driven primarily by our global infrastructure franchise. 
Institutional index net inflows of $9 billion reflected strong flows of $17 billion into fixed income, partially offset by index equity outflows of $9 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation decisions during the quarter. 
Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally, led by fixed income and index equity products, partially offset by outflows from multi-asset. Fixed income net inflows of $7 billion were diversified across our top-performing platform and included $1 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals and total return strategies. 
While total multi-asset flows were, once again, impacted by outflows from world allocation strategies, our multi-asset income strategy, nevertheless, raised another $2 billion during the quarter as investors continued to target income-oriented outcomes. 
BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to continuously invest for the future. Our diversification, scale and globally-integrated investment in technology platform enables us to generate differentiated and more consistent organic growth in AUM and base fees, resulting in long-term value creation for both clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,528688129,1244606,"BlackRock, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2017",2017-07-17,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform.

BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform. BlackRock's ability to partner with clients across our broad range of investment strategies and technology solutions and as a thought leader drove $104 billion of total net inflows in the quarter with a record $94 billion in long-term strategies, which were positive across all client types, product types and investment styles. 
While significant cash remains on the sidelines, investors have begun to put more of their assets to work and global equity markets continue to rise in the quarter, underscoring a generally healthier global economy and proving that so far, markets have been resilient to political shocks. Through the second quarter, the S&P was up 8% year-to-date, reaching all-time highs, and many international markets have even outperformed. 
At the same time, while markets have started to anticipate a normalization of policy in the environment of sustained expansion, negative yields remain a reality in some countries and expectation for a continued low-yield environment persist. And while amounts of cash is still are uninvested and the ongoing risk of both economic and political disruption on the horizons, investors continue to face challenges in meeting their clients' future needs. 
Both institutional and retail clients are looking to BlackRock for investment strategies and for Aladdin risk management and portfolio construction technology. They're also turning to BlackRock for our insights to help them understand how to navigate the investment landscape. 
Insurance companies are one example of clients that continue to face significant challenges in this low-yield environment. Last month, leveraging BlackRock's extensive experience with the need of insurance clients and risk modeling capabilities, we launched an insurance industry risk study. We took the investment portfolios of the entire U.S. insurance industry at the individual security line item level, uploading them onto Aladdin and then cut the data in a variety of ways to see who's taking what kinds of risk and how are they being rewarded for that type of risk. 
And we brought together a group of insurance company CEOs to talk about the results, to answer questions like what is the current opportunity set in their own individual portfolio and how should they be positioned in the event of a stressed economy or another crisis. We also showed the CEOs how their investment positions reflected versus their peers, and so it was an incredible peer analysis for the CEOs. Our goal was to provide them with more information to look to BlackRock to help them in making strategic decisions that would ultimately drive their stakeholder returns. 
This is just one example. BlackRock is increasingly using our technology, our scale and innovative ways to enhance the value that we can provide to our clients. As the wealth management landscape evolves globally, our intermediary partners are accelerating their movement, their changes towards a fee-based advisory and fee-based accounts and are expected to grow by upward of $8 trillion in the U.S. over the next several years. 
As a result, our wealth partners are placing more emphasis than ever before on portfolios, not just a product, not just an individual bond or not just an individual stock. They're also focused on both performance and the value that the underlying investments can provide to investors and increasingly, our partners are looking for access to high-quality portfolio construction and digital technologies to help execute repeatable processes. 
In this environment, BlackRock is able to provide more value to wealth management client than ever before. And in the U.S. through technology like Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, which I'll talk about in a few minutes, the reinvention of our sales model and tech-enabled advisory engagement had allowed us to partner with 25% more financial advisers this year than we did at the same point last year at no additional cost. 
The combination of BlackRock's differentiated technology offerings and our broad-based investment platforms position us as the most sophisticated portfolio construction partner in the industry for both institutions and wealth managers. 
Looking at flows for the quarter. BlackRock saw $8 billion of active net flows driven by multi-asset fixed income and alternatives, which contributed to strong organic-based fee growth in the quarter. 
BlackRock is seeing increasingly strong fundraising momentum in illiquid alternatives with $9 billion in flows and commitments year-to-date. We particularly strengthened infrastructure funds as the investments we've made in our platform over time are resonating with our clients. 
Our acquisition of First Reserve infrastructure equity funds, which closed in the quarter, adds a talented team with specific expertise in energy infrastructure investing and $3 billion of assets to our platform. We now have over $16 billion of total investment and commitment infrastructure capital to manage on behalf of our clients. 
We also launched the U.K.'s first alternative solution fund earlier this month. The fund offers pension searching for yield, a long term outcome-oriented strategy in a single portfolio, which, again, leverages BlackRock specialist teams across credit, real estate and infrastructure. 
We now manage $98 billion of assets across our core alternative platform and have an additional $15 billion of committed capital to invest going forward. 
BlackRock saw $86 billion of net inflows into iShares and index funds in the second quarter. Global iShares momentum continued with a record $74 billion of net inflows for a total of $138 billion on net inflows year-to-date. 
As growth continues following our strategic investment to lower prices for clients, we generated $35 billion of inflows in iShares' core funds in the quarter. Importantly, noncore iShares exposures generated over $38 billion of flows, contributing to a higher organic base fee growth for the firm. 
The rapid growth we're seeing in iShares is increasingly due to the fact that ETFs are no longer used only as a passive allocation, but by active investors to generate alpha in their portfolios. ETFs provide those investors targeting exposures without the idiosyncratic risk of any one single stock or one any single bond. 
Accelerating growth is also coming from the investments we're making more broadly to innovate across the entire ETF ecosystem. This is more than just a product innovation, it's innovation in distribution, it's innovation in portfolio construction technology and ETF in portfolio construction education and in building new markets for new users, all of which foster further adaptation of ETFs worldwide. 
As we deepen our partnership with clients and continue to strengthen our brand through both investment and technology offerings, global iShares market share of year-to-date flows has expanded to more than 40%. Fixed income ETFs are a great example of the area where broad ecosystem innovation is driving growth. 
After several years of BlackRock working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on the mechanics of fixed income ETFs, accounting guidelines will now treat them as bonds instead of equities. They will treat it through as a look-through treatment to the underlying assets, making it much more efficient for insurers to own fixed income ETFs for their portfolios. 
Another example is the new segment for ETFs. We recently announced changes in our iShares ETF MBB, the industry flagship mortgage-backed security ETF, to drive accelerated growth. We're evolving MBB, or our mortgage-backed bond ETFs, to become the leading financial instrument, and I want to underline risk management tool for institutions to access fully funded exposures to physical mortgage pools. By lowering the price to make the fund competitive with direct investments in mortgage securities, institutions will have a more efficient, a more liquid option for hedging their mortgage-backed exposures and their direct mortgage origination. 
We also launched BlackRock's first self index ETFs, 2 smart beta fixed income ETFs. These new indexes are based on unique intellectual property and leveraging the best of BlackRock's analytics and modeling capabilities to achieve superior investment outcomes for clients. This illustrates one of the ways we are using our scale in technology to reduce manufacturing costs and pass along greater savings to our clients. 
Technology is transforming the asset management industry, and that pace of technology innovation is accelerating. I've talked about BlackRock's aspirational target of 30% of our revenues being enabled by technology 5 years from now. That is a vision for how I believe technology will help drive revenues and create efficiencies across BlackRock. Some of that vision will be driven by growth in Aladdin and our technology offerings, but much of it will come from using technology to drive investment performance and build better distribution capabilities, ultimately delivering growth in base fees and performance fees. 
And in addition, I am using this target as a mechanism to get all 13,000 of BlackRock's employees to understand how technology and the utilization of technology is going to change BlackRock, is going to change our clients' needs, and will change the entire ecosystem in what we do. Technology will impact all aspects of our business: the way we generate Alpha; the way we build portfolios; the way we manage risk; the way we distribute solutions; the way we engage with service providers; the way we operate; and even the way we source talent. 
Aladdin's portfolio in risk management technology continues to be in demand by institutional clients looking to invest and operate smarter and with more efficiencies. We now have nearly 200 institutional clients using Aladdin. Our investment teams are combining big data and machine learning with traditional fundamental human analysis to generate better sustainable Alpha for our clients. 
As portfolios become increasingly complex and interconnected, we are leveraging our analytical and risk management technology to create more sophisticated and more scalable portfolio construction of asset allocation and risk management tools for wealth management. Our first 3 Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management clients are now live, and they're benefiting from the Aladdin technology. 
We are also providing our wealth management partners with integrated digital distribution platforms, so they can reach and interact with their end investors in a more scalable, in a more repeatable way. Building on our acquisitions of FutureAdvisor, our investment in iCapital, we continue to expand our digital distribution capabilities with the acquisition of Cachematrix and a minority investment in Scalable Capital, both platforms will allow us to provide our clients with scalable technology-enabled solutions. 
In addition to driving growth, we're using Aladdin to drive operating efficiencies. The investments we've made in our trading technology and operations have dramatically reduced the cost of our trades. We have reduced our trades by 80% over the last 5 years. This has been a huge reduction in those basic costs, and it's totally driven by technology. 
Going forward, technology-enabled scale will be increasingly important for every aspect of an asset manager's business, our client service, our asset generation and operational excellence. This year, we will be spending $1 billion on technology and data, and have over 3,500 employees working on technology and data-related roles. 
We recently signed a 20-year lease for our new global headquarters at Hudson Yards in New York, which will be the state-of-the-art hub that is technologically advanced, environmentally sustainable and operationally resilient. Our new headquarters will epitomize our tech-centric culture and create a world-class experience for our people and our clients. 
As I've said many times, but I mean it as much as ever today, I have never seen more opportunities for BlackRock than I do today. The record growth we're seeing is a direct result of the investments we made to build our platform over time. Continuing to invest in high-growth areas of our business and moving into adjacent areas to enhance the solutions we can offer to our clients, both remain a critical priority in order to drive future growth and provide increased value to both our clients and to our shareholders. 
With that, let me open it up for questions."

Ultimately, Aladdin for Wealth Management is going to be dealt at the house level, at the CIO level and then ultimately, it will be implemented, it may be -- depending on each firm at the individual financial adviser level. And this will allow us to have an opportunity to be at our financial advisers desktops. So the actual implementation probably is a little longer because of the significance of the scale of it. But let's be clear, this may become one of the great opportunities for BlackRock. We are going to continue to be driving more and more of the opportunities for Aladdin for Wealth Management. I see this being our transformation for our position in retail globally. And what I believe this does, it allows BlackRock to be even more important in the overall ecosystem of -- in wealth management. It gives us -- the Aladdin system will provide portfolio construction tools. It provides risk management. It is not a tool to sell only BlackRock products, it is a tool to enhance the wealth managers' value proposition. They'll be able to use other products to other firms, but we believe by having that placement in the desktop, that placement -- and we've seen this in other areas, it gives us that opportunity to have deeper, better dialogues. And so we look at this as one of the more fundamental, long-term strategies for our positioning. And as Gary suggested, their revenues now -- that the revenues are very similar to how the institutional side are, they're very modest and the margins are subdued during this process of implementation. And once utilized, depending on how well they're utilized and by the amount of financial advisers, then we would expect increased utilization and through increased utilization were revenues from the platform."

But I think that everything there feels constructive. We're supportive of basically trying to inform how we do business in a more transparent manner with investors, and we'll be making and, obviously, continuing to work with the regulators to make additional comments to effectively try and optimize that going forward. But I think we feel that we're incredibly well positioned from the study to drive our business. I think the U.S. in many respects, in terms of most of the change that's occurred here, in terms of the migration to fee-based planning, which we think is, obviously, where Europe is going to go positions us incredibly well to learn and to basically effectuate that opportunity. And I think our desire to basically grow that is exactly why we looked for an opportunity like Scalable Capital to do it in a manner that will help us evolve with the marketplace."

And so once again, we're trying to stay a couple steps ahead of our clients, and we are, I think, paying a good attention to the ecosystem changes that the regulators are evolving themselves in terms of making this a better environment for more investors. One thing I would say, the key issue for Europe is over 72% of all savings is in cash in Europe. One of the great reasons why P/E ratios are lower in Europe than the United States is most savers are only in cash and bank deposits. If through regulatory changes, through digital advice, through low-cost alternatives, if we could provide Europeans with a better alternative that they look towards for investing over a long horizon by being positioned there with digital technology with our iShares brand in Europe, I think we're as well positioned us any firm in the whole continent."

We're seeing regulatory changes, we're seeing regulatory changes change the ETFs environment. We do believe we're seeing accelerated flows because of the MiFID II, because of the movement towards the fiduciary role in the United States. We're seeing more active investors using ETFs to express their exposures, which I talked about. I think that is accelerating. Having the insurance commissioners changing capital -- having a look through treatment for fixed income ETFs is very important because insurance industry did not use ETFs because of the differential in capital charges, just because of the CUSIP number and now you have a look-through treatment. And so we believe the environmental for ETFs is continuing to evolve. We believe it's continuing to grow. And much of it also has to do with ecosystem innovation. I think what we are doing in the mortgage-backed area is going to have even a large opportunity for ETF growth as we can now use ETFs as a vehicle to hedge mortgage production. So I think what's going on is -- and then I'll let Rob Kapito to speak up. I do believe you're seeing more utilization ETFs from institutions and retail for an exposure in the active side, we're seeing more utilization across the board in more products. And I think that's what you're -- we're starting to see that acceleration. I just -- before Rob speaks, I just want to cite one important point. Index and ETF still only represent 10% of the entire equity market global capitalization. And here we are talking about a great amount of flows but with $160-odd trillion global equity market capitalization, we have much more opportunities for ETFs to grow, not just in equities but in fixed income. And I believe this is just the beginning. It reminds me of when Rob and I were young, driving the mortgage-backed securities market in the late '70s, early '80s. Well, for me, the late '70s, Rob in the '80s, I'm older. Rob, any comments?"

What's exciting is new areas that are being created with the awareness of ETFs, that not only can that be used for hedging vehicles, they can be used, as Larry mentioned, in the insurance area now with mortgage-backed securities, which, as you know, are very expensive to buy because of prepayments and because of custodial costs. So there's new and newer uses for ETFs every single day, and that's why what we're trying to do is respond and be in front of our clients, and we have to go out and discuss with them ways that they can use ETFs that they have not been able to use them before. So I would say it's not only stealing market share, it's creating new market share, which is really the big opportunity for all of us."

So again, I just want to take a step back, again, just back to the Morgan Stanley conference. So we talked there about the fact that the blended fee rate over the last several years has, obviously, been impacted by a variety of factors that we don't control. We've talked about them as exogenous factors. We've, obviously, pointed to both divergent equity beta, dollar appreciation, but importantly also, shift in client preferences towards lower risk asset classes and index strategies, especially last year, where, obviously, we saw probably -- we saw a large dispersion between our asset growth rate and our base fee growth rate. And that actually has also has an impact by virtue of mix in terms of our fee rate. And I think all of those factors have really masked the benefit we have achieved from executing a pretty good differentiated growth strategy. The fee rate declined about 1.4 basis points from the second quarter of last year, and that was a continuation of some of the things we've talked about: impacted international market underperformance; dollar appreciation throughout last year; impact importantly of recent price cuts or, what we would rather call, an investment in our iShares franchise that were not reflected in last year's prior second quarter; and importantly, a slower rate of organic base fee growth relative to asset growth in the second half of last year. Sequentially, the fee rate has stabilized as those headwinds, as you mentioned associated with the divergent beta and FX, have abated. And should those trends continue, the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth rate, which has been about 6% year-to-date, so far, clearly should be more apparent over time. In my opinion, if we can sustain organic base fee growth in excess of 5% and frankly, we've done that in 2012, '13, '14, '15 and year-to-date this year. Last year was really the first year in the last five that we didn't do that. I'm not really sure why the fee rate itself is garnering that much attention other than I understand that it's the basis of a lot of the modeling that everybody is doing. But I think right now, we're feeling incredibly comfortable with the level of organic base fee growth rate that we're seeing and are paying a little less attention to the overall fee rate as long as we can generate that revenue momentum."

So we announced changes to our active equity platform in March. These changes were not effective until mid- to late-June. So it's a little early to tell and see any material progress from the reorg in -- of those flows of financial advice. But as anticipated, we saw some accelerated outflows from the funds impacted by the changes, which contributed to some of the active equity outflows in the second quarter. But other of our fundamental active equity funds that weren't part of the changes to the platform actually saw a slight improvement in outflows. Additionally, we had a few large client redemptions from our scientific active equity. But a portion of these outflows were recaptured on our platform as certain clients moved in to index strategies. So our focus is going to be on generating strong performance, which we believe differentiates our ability to work with our clients to achieve their desired long-term outcomes to drive improvements in both the scientific and fundamental active equity funds since last year. And there, I've already seen some excellent performance in the quantitative side, 92% of our active, quantitative active equity and 78% of our fundamental active equity assets are above their benchmark and peer mediums for the 3-year period. And then the creation of our advantage series, which is offering clients the ability to outperform and have the lowest fees. All of those are showing results and all of this, I believe, is part of our announcement of monarch and the upside that we have to come. So we're very encouraged. The portfolio managers are energized to be out, to share information across both of the platforms. We've heard very positive views from our clients because everyone is focused on figuring out how to utilize the big data that's out there to their advantage to create performance. So the rollout of it has been something that we've gotten very, very good client feedback from, and I'm very optimistic about it going forward."

So just to give a little bit of color on the people in the investment. The 3,500 rough-cut people in technology and data-related roles includes expected technology roles such as programmers and crump modelers, but also less obvious ones that leverage technology and data in a significant way like our iShares analytics and electronic trading teams. So as Larry basically mentioned, we're thinking technology much more holistically, not as a specific definition, but embracing technology to drive our overall business. We're spending about $1 billion this year to support that technology and data initiative, which includes a number of things, but also includes compensation and related expenses associated with obviously, those people as well as hardware, software and market data costs for the firm more broadly. I think in terms of margins, more broadly, as you know, we're not really big on talking about individual margins of vertical businesses. And so as we really think about incremental margins on specific products or businesses, that's not an overwhelming relevant number that we think about day to day. But, for example, to think about driving growth in iShares as an example, we're investing beyond simple product innovation. We're investing in the entire ETF ecosystem. We're investing in distribution. We're investing in portfolio construction technology. We're investing in capital markets, ETF and portfolio construction, education. We're talking about building new markets for new users. And I think there's no question that the accelerating growth that we're seeing in iShares is a direct result of those investments more broadly. We're really trying to take a much more portfolio-oriented approach to investing in technology. And so, notwithstanding some of the things that we're doing that go also through our P&L, you're also seeing us make a number of strategic acquisitions or other investments. Sometimes they're control, like Cachematrix, and sometimes they're really to get a seat at the table and try to learn and help our partners evolve, like Scalable Capital and iCapital. I think the important thing is that whichever direction we're going to go, we're going to continue to use our scale, which we think is a huge driver of our ability to officially spend on technology in ways that others can't, really to drive that growth and increase market share for both shareholders and our clients."

And in my view, my personal view, quarterly comparisons here are less relevant, and you really should look at our performance over a more appropriate period of time, especially in the context of the organic growth that we're generating today. Our commitment has not changed. Our commitment has always been to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible, especially by leveraging our scale for both clients and shareholders. And I think if you look back over the work that we've done since BGI, in particular, the operating margin is up well over 500 basis points. And we've invested significantly back into the business. We are currently generating record organic growth, especially in terms of base fees. As I mentioned over the last 12 months, $335 billion-plus of net new business, that's 7% organic AUM growth, and importantly, 5% organic base fee growth. There was a significant time, where people were asking us when we were going to get to those levels, and well, I think it's still early to call it sustainable for a significant period of time, this level of growth is clearly a direct result of the investments that we've made over time. No one likes higher margins than I do or well, maybe the guy sitting next to me actually does, but I also know that our level of organic growth determines our multiple and continuing to invest to support these record levels of organic growth is a critical priority for us and one that will be maintained going forward. While there is, obviously, an upward bias to our margin as we continue to grow in a constructive environment, I think as Larry indicated in his remarks, we intend to continue playing offense by aggressively investing to create more opportunities for future growth."

403413,528688129,1244666,"BlackRock, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2017",2017-07-17,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release d",1617,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's globally integrated technology and investment platform continues to position us as the solutions provider of choice to both retail and institutional clients. The breadth and scale of our capabilities allows us to continuously and efficiently reinvest in our investment, distribution, technology and risk management franchises in order to provide increased value to both clients and shareholders over time. 
As a result of that commitment to reinvest, net inflows for the last 12 months totaled $336 billion as organic growth accelerated in the second quarter. Total quarterly flows exceeded $100 billion and were positive across client types, asset classes and investment styles, highlighting the uniqueness of our diversified investment platform, which includes cash, market cap weighted index products, a spectrum of active offerings from smart beta and factors to high conviction alpha strategies and illiquid alternatives. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were a record for BlackRock and represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%. Annualized organic base fee growth was 8% for the quarter and 5% for the last 12 months despite the pricing changes we have previously announced over the last 9 months. 
Record quarterly revenue of $3 billion was 6% up over a year ago. Operating income of $1.2 billion was also 6% higher than a year ago, and earnings per share of $5.24 increased 10%. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $26 million of net investment gains, an increase from the second quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter and the impact of our debt refinancing last quarter. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.5%. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable protected -- projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. 
Second quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year driven primarily by the positive impact of organic growth and market appreciation on average AUM, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements and certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's second quarter. 
While the dollar has recently given up gains versus major currencies, the impact of dollar appreciation over the last year still reduced our quarterly year-over-year based fee growth by about 1%. Sequentially, base fees were up 6% and benefited from higher securities lending revenue in the second quarter, which increased 11%, driven by seasonality and higher on-loan balances. 
Last month at the Morgan Stanley conference, I spoke about several exogenous factors, including divergent beta and FX that have negatively impacted our blended fee rate over the last several years and masked the benefit we have achieved from executing our differentiated growth strategy. As some of these headwinds lessened during the second quarter, with emerging markets outperforming U.S. markets and the U.S. dollar weakening, our blended fee rate has stabilized and the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth should become more apparent. 
Performance fees of $48 million decreased $26 million from the prior year due to weaker relative performance in long-only equity funds with annual locks in the second quarter. Technology and risk management revenue of $164 million increased 12% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the Aladdin platform and new client wins. 
Market demand remains strong for our full range of products, including institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, Provider Aladdin, iRetire and FutureAdvisor. Clients continue to seek sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio construction and scalable distribution tools, and our first 3 Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management clients went live on the platform earlier in the quarter. 
In line with our strategic focus on technology to enhance value and deliver innovative solutions to clients, we announced the acquisition of Cachematrix, a leading provider of financial technology that simplifies the cash management process for corporate treasury clients, and a minority investment in Scalable Capital, one of the fastest-growing digital investment managers in Europe. Together with our minority investment in iCapital, we believe BlackRock can significantly enhance the growth profile of these businesses while simultaneously benefiting from their unique capabilities. 
The strong organic growth we are experiencing today is a result of the investments we've made in our business over time, and we continue to invest aggressively to create more opportunity for the future. 
Expense increased 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense as a result of higher-average AUM and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $24 million, or 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher headcount. Sequentially, compensation expense was down 2%, reflecting lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter and $20 million of onetime expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform in the prior quarter. 
The accelerating shift to passive is impacting growth in our volume-related expense and direct fund expense was up $29 million or 15% year-over-year primarily reflecting significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
G&A expense was up $34 million or 11% year-over-year, reflecting increased levels of spend to drive growth, including investments in technology and data and higher discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Year-over-year comparisons were also impacted by the timing of certain accruals and additional expense related to the sale of our U.K. defined contribution platform. 
Sequentially, G&A expense increased $49 million from the first quarter or 16%, reflecting similar increases in technology, data and marketing spend, but also higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter. 
Assuming stable markets and given the timing and levels of our spend in the first half of 2017, we would anticipate planned G&A expense for the second half of 2017 to be in the range of $750 million. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was flat year-over-year and up 130 basis points sequentially. As we have stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target but remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. 
We're also committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of First Reserves infrastructure equity funds. Larry will talk more about additional investments in innovation across the broader ecosystem to support future growth. We also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and investment styles. Long-term net inflows were driven by iShares, which crossed $1.5 trillion of global AUM in the quarter and continue to benefit from the accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth channel and the rapid adoption of iShares' ETFs as asset allocation tools and financial instruments by professional money managers. 
Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $74 billion, representing 21% annualized organic growth with strength across our core and non-core exposures. In the 9 months since we announced pricing changes to the core in October of last year, we have already recaptured over 75% of our investment through organic growth alone.
iShares' equity net inflows of $52 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares' net inflows of $21 billion were led by flows into investment-grade corporate, emerging market bond and treasury funds. 
Our institutional business generated $13 billion of long-term net inflows across both active and index strategies. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by strong multi-asset and alternative inflows, partially offset by equity and fixed income outflows. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath Target Date series, which saw record net inflows of $9 billion. We also saw strength in fiduciary mandates and factors, each with approximately $1 billion of net inflows. Alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows, driven primarily by our global infrastructure franchise. 
Institutional index net inflows of $9 billion reflected strong flows of $17 billion into fixed income, partially offset by index equity outflows of $9 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation decisions during the quarter. 
Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally, led by fixed income and index equity products, partially offset by outflows from multi-asset. Fixed income net inflows of $7 billion were diversified across our top-performing platform and included $1 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals and total return strategies. 
While total multi-asset flows were, once again, impacted by outflows from world allocation strategies, our multi-asset income strategy, nevertheless, raised another $2 billion during the quarter as investors continued to target income-oriented outcomes. 
BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to continuously invest for the future. Our diversification, scale and globally-integrated investment in technology platform enables us to generate differentiated and more consistent organic growth in AUM and base fees, resulting in long-term value creation for both clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,528688129,1244666,"BlackRock, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2017",2017-07-17,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform.

BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform. BlackRock's ability to partner with clients across our broad range of investment strategies and technology solutions and as a thought leader drove $104 billion of total net inflows in the quarter with a record $94 billion in long-term strategies, which were positive across all client types, product types and investment styles. 
While significant cash remains on the sidelines, investors have begun to put more of their assets to work and global equity markets continue to rise in the quarter, underscoring a generally healthier global economy and proving that, so far, markets have been resilient to political shocks. Through the second quarter, the S&P was up 8% year-to-date, reaching all-time highs, and many international markets have even outperformed. 
At the same time, while markets have started to anticipate a normalization of policy in the environment of sustained expansion, negative yields remain a reality in some countries and expectation for a continued low-yield environment persist. And while amounts of cash still are uninvested and the ongoing risk of both economic and political disruption on the horizons, investors continue to face challenges in meeting their clients' future needs. 
Both institutional and retail clients are looking to BlackRock for investment strategies and for Aladdin risk management and portfolio construction technology. They're also turning to BlackRock for our insights to help them understand how to navigate the investment landscape. 
Insurance companies are one example of clients that continue to face significant challenges in this low-yield environment. Last month, leveraging BlackRock's extensive experience with the needs of insurance clients and risk modeling capabilities, we launched an insurance industry risk study. We took the investment portfolios of the entire U.S. insurance industry at the individual security line item level, uploading them onto Aladdin and then cut the data in a variety of ways to see who's taking what kinds of risk and how are they being rewarded for that type of risk. 
And we brought together a group of insurance company CEOs to talk about the results, to answer questions like what is the current opportunity set in their own individual portfolio and how should they be positioned in the event of a stressed economy or another crisis. We also showed the CEOs how their investment positions reflected versus their peers, and so it was an incredible peer analysis for the CEOs. Our goal was to provide them with more information to look to BlackRock to help them making strategic decisions that would ultimately drive their stakeholder returns. 
This is just one example. BlackRock is increasingly using our technology, our scale and innovative ways to enhance the value that we can provide to our clients. As the wealth management landscape evolves globally, our intermediary partners are accelerating their movement, their changes towards a fee-based advisory and fee-based accounts and are expected to grow by upward of $8 trillion in the U.S. over the next several years. 
As a result, our wealth partners are placing more emphasis than ever before on portfolios, not just a product, not just an individual bond or not just an individual stock. They're also focused on both performance and the value that the underlying investments can provide to investors and increasingly, our partners are looking for access to high-quality portfolio construction and digital technologies to help execute repeatable processes. 
In this environment, BlackRock is able to provide more value to wealth management clients than ever before. And in the U.S. through technology like Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, which I'll talk about in a few minutes, the reinvention of our sales model and tech-enabled advisor engagement had allowed us to partner with 25% more financial advisers this year than we did at the same point last year at no additional cost. 
The combination of BlackRock's differentiated technology offerings and our broad-based investment platforms position us as the most sophisticated portfolio construction partner in the industry for both institutions and wealth managers. 
Looking at flows for the quarter. BlackRock saw $8 billion of active net flows driven by multi-asset fixed income and alternatives, which contributed to strong organic base fee growth in the quarter. 
BlackRock is seeing increasingly strong fundraising momentum in illiquid alternatives with $9 billion in flows and commitments year-to-date. We have particularly strengthened infrastructure funds as the investments we've made in our platform over time are resonating with our clients. 
Our acquisition of First Reserve infrastructure equity funds, which closed in the quarter, adds a talented team with specific expertise in energy infrastructure investing and $3 billion of assets to our platform. We now have over $16 billion of total investment and commitment infrastructure capital to manage on behalf of our clients. 
We also launched the U.K.'s first alternative solution fund earlier this month. The fund offers pension's searching for yield, a long term outcome-oriented strategy in a single portfolio, which, again, leverages BlackRock specialist teams across credit, real estate and infrastructure. 
We now manage $98 billion of assets across our core alternative platform and have an additional $15 billion of committed capital to invest going forward. 
BlackRock saw $86 billion of net inflows into iShares and index funds in the second quarter. Global iShares momentum continued with a record $74 billion of net inflows for a total of $138 billion on net inflows year-to-date. 
As growth continues following our strategic investment to lower prices for clients, we generated $35 billion of inflows in iShares' core funds in the quarter. Importantly, noncore iShares exposures generated over $38 billion of flows, contributing to a higher organic base fee growth for the firm. 
The rapid growth we're seeing in iShares is increasingly due to the fact that ETFs are no longer used only as a passive allocation, but by active investors to generate alpha in their portfolios. ETFs provide those investors targeting exposures without the idiosyncratic risk of any one single stock or one any single bond. 
Accelerating growth is also coming from the investments we're making more broadly to innovate across the entire ETF ecosystem. This is more than just a product innovation, it's innovation in distribution, it's innovation in portfolio construction technology, in ETF and portfolio construction education and in building new markets for new users, all of which foster further adaptation of ETFs worldwide. 
As we deepen our partnership with clients and continue to strengthen our brand through both investment and technology offerings, global iShares market share of year-to-date flows has expanded to more than 40%. Fixed income ETFs are a great example of the area where broad ecosystem innovation is driving growth. 
After several years of BlackRock working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on the mechanics of fixed income ETFs, accounting guidelines will now treat them as bonds instead of equities. They will treat it through -- as a look-through treatment to the underlying assets, making it much more efficient for insurers to own fixed income ETFs for their portfolios. 
Another example is the new segment for ETFs. We recently announced changes in our iShares ETF MBB, the industry flagship mortgage-backed security ETF, to drive accelerated growth. We're evolving MBB, or our mortgage-backed bond ETFs, to become the leading financial instrument and, I want to underline, risk management tool for institutions to access fully funded exposures to physical mortgage pools. By lowering the price to make the fund competitive with direct investments in mortgage securities, institutions will have a more efficient, a more liquid option for hedging their mortgage-backed exposures and their direct mortgage originations. 
We also launched BlackRock's first self-indexed ETFs, 2 smart beta fixed income ETFs. These new indexes are based on unique intellectual property and leveraging the best of BlackRock's analytics and modeling capabilities to achieve superior investment outcomes for clients. This illustrates one of the ways we are using our scale and technology to reduce manufacturing costs and pass along greater savings to our clients. 
Technology is transforming the asset management industry, and that pace of technology innovation is accelerating. I've talked about BlackRock's aspirational target of 30% of our revenues being enabled by technology 5 years from now. That is a vision for how I believe technology will help drive revenues and create efficiencies across BlackRock. Some of that vision will be driven by growth in Aladdin and our technology offerings, but much of it will come from using technology to drive investment performance and build better distribution capabilities, ultimately delivering growth in base fees and performance fees. 
And in addition, I am using this target as a mechanism to get all 13,000 of BlackRock's employees to understand how technology and the utilization of technology is going to change BlackRock, is going to change our clients' needs, and will change the entire ecosystem in what we do. Technology will impact all aspects of our business: the way we generate Alpha; the way we build portfolios; the way we manage risk; the way we distribute solutions; the way we engage with service providers; the way we operate; and even the way we source talent. 
Aladdin's portfolio in risk management technology continues to be in demand by institutional clients looking to invest and operate smarter and with more efficiencies. We now have nearly 200 institutional clients using Aladdin. Our investment teams are combining big data and machine learning with traditional fundamental human analysis to generate better sustainable alpha for our clients. 
As portfolios become increasingly complex and interconnected, we are leveraging our analytical and risk management technology to create more sophisticated and more scalable portfolio construction, asset allocation and risk management tools for wealth management. Our first 3 Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management clients are now live, and they're benefiting from the Aladdin technology. 
We are also providing our wealth management partners with integrated digital distribution platforms, so they can reach and interact with their end investors in a more scalable, in a more repeatable way. Building on our acquisitions of FutureAdvisor, our investment in iCapital, we continue to expand our digital distribution capabilities with an acquisition of Cachematrix and a minority investment in Scalable Capital. Both platforms will allow us to provide our clients with scalable technology-enabled solutions. 
In addition to driving growth, we're using Aladdin to drive operating efficiencies. The investments we've made in our trading technology and operations have dramatically reduced the cost of our trades. We have reduced our trades by 80% over the last 5 years. This has been a huge reduction in those basic costs, and it's totally driven by technology. 
Going forward, technology-enabled scale will be increasingly important for every aspect of an asset manager's business, our client service, our asset generation and operational excellence. This year, we will be spending $1 billion on technology and data, and have over 3,500 employees working on technology and data-related roles. 
We recently signed a 20-year lease for our new global headquarters at Hudson Yards in New York, which will be the state-of-the-art hub that is technologically advanced, environmentally sustainable and operationally resilient. Our new headquarters will epitomize our tech-centric culture and create a world-class experience for our people and our clients. 
As I've said many times, but I mean it as much as ever today, I have never seen more opportunity for BlackRock than I do today. The record growth we're seeing is a direct result of the investments we made to build our platform over time. Continuing to invest in high-growth areas of our business and moving into adjacent areas to enhance the solutions we can offer to our clients, both remain critical priorities in order to drive future growth and provide increased value to both our clients and to our shareholders. 
With that, let me open it up for questions."

Ultimately, Aladdin for Wealth Management is going to be dealt at the house level, at the CIO level and then ultimately, it will be implemented, maybe, depending on each firm at the individual financial adviser level. And this will allow us to have an opportunity to be at our financial advisers desktops. So the actual implementation probably is a little longer because of the significance of the scale of it. But let's be clear, this may become one of the great opportunities for BlackRock. We are going to continue to be driving more and more of the opportunities for Aladdin for Wealth Management. I see this being our transformation for our position in retail globally. And what I believe this does, it allows BlackRock to be even more important in the overall ecosystem of -- in wealth management. It gives us -- the Aladdin system will provide portfolio construction tools. It provides risk management. It is not a tool to sell only BlackRock products, it is a tool to enhance the wealth managers' value proposition. They'll be able to use other products on it, other firms, but we believe by having that placement in the desktop, that placement -- and we've seen this in other areas, it gives us that opportunity to have deeper, better dialogues. And more -- so we look at this as one of the more fundamental, long-term strategies for our positioning. And as Gary suggested, there are revenues now, but the revenues are very similar to how the institutional side are, they're very modest and the margins are subdued during this process of implementation. And once utilized, depending on how well they're utilized and by the amount of financial advisers, then we would expect increased utilization and through increased utilization were revenues from the platform."

I think the U.S. in many respects, in terms of most of the change that's occurred here, in terms of the migration to fee-based planning, which we think is, obviously, where Europe is going to go, positions us incredibly well to learn and to basically effectuate that opportunity.

One thing I would say, the key issue for Europe is over 72% of all savings is in cash in Europe. One of the great reasons why P/E ratios are lower in Europe than the United States is most savers are only in cash and bank deposits. If, through regulatory changes, through digital advice, through low-cost alternatives, if we could provide Europeans with a better alternative that they looked towards for investing over a long horizon by being positioned there with digital technology with our iShares brand in Europe, I think we're as well positioned as any firm in the whole continent."

Do you have any data or thoughts that you can share behind this trend to help us think about how much of iShares' growth is actually coming from the outside of the asset management industry?"

We're seeing regulatory changes, we're seeing regulatory changes change the ETF environment. We do believe we're seeing accelerated flows because of the MiFID II, because of the movement towards the fiduciary role in the United States. We're seeing more active investors using ETFs to express their exposures, which I talked about. I think that is accelerating. Having the insurance commissioners changing capital -- having a look through treatment for fixed income ETFs is very important because insurance industry did not use ETFs because of the differential in capital charges, just because of the CUSIP number and now you have a look-through treatment. And so we believe the environmental for ETFs is continuing to evolve. We believe it's continuing to grow. And much of it also has to do with ecosystem innovation. I think what we are doing in the mortgage-backed area is going to have even a large opportunity for ETF growth as we can now use ETFs as a vehicle to hedge mortgage production. So I think what's going on is -- and then I'll let Rob Kapito to speak up. I do believe you're seeing more utilization ETFs from institutions and retail for an exposure in the active side, we're seeing more utilization across the board in more products. And I think that's what you're -- we're starting to see that acceleration. 
I just -- before Rob speaks, I just want to cite one important point. Index and ETF still only represent 10% of the entire equity market global capitalization. And here we are talking about a great amount of flows but with $160-odd trillion global equity market capitalization, we have much more opportunities for ETFs to grow, not just in equities but in fixed income. And I believe this is just the beginning. It reminds me of when Rob and I were young, driving the mortgage-backed securities market in the late '70s, early '80s -- well, for me, the late '70s, Rob in the '80s, I'm older. Rob, any comments?"

But second of all, Craig, I think it's not just stealing market share, it's obvious where that's coming from whether it be mutual funds or whether it become futures or others. What's exciting is new areas that are being created with the awareness of ETFs, that not only can they be used for hedging vehicles, they can be used, as Larry mentioned, in the insurance area now with mortgage-backed securities, which, as you know, are very expensive to buy because of prepayments and because of custodial costs. So there's new and newer uses for ETFs every single day, and that's why what we're trying to do is respond and be in front of our clients, and we have to go out and discuss with them ways that they can use ETFs that they have not been able to use them before. So I would say it's not only stealing market share, it's creating new market share, which is really the big opportunity for all of us."

So we look at this as a net positive. And when people talk about this, they're not taking into the context how large derivative swaps and futures have been and now -- which was totally nontransparent and now, all this activity is moving much more onto a transparent platform, which, obviously, is one of the reason why you're seeing the growth.

So again, I just want to take a step back, again, just back to the Morgan Stanley conference. So we talked there about the fact that the blended fee rate over the last several years has, obviously, been impacted by a variety of factors that we don't control. We've talked about them as exogenous factors. We've, obviously, pointed to both divergent equity beta, dollar appreciation, but importantly also, shift in client preferences towards lower risk asset classes and index strategies, especially last year, where, obviously, we saw probably -- we saw a large dispersion between our asset growth rate and our base fee growth rate. And that actually has also has an impact by virtue of mix in terms of our fee rate. And I think all of those factors have really masked the benefit we have achieved from executing a pretty good differentiated growth strategy. 
The fee rate declined about 1.4 basis points from the second quarter of last year, and that was a continuation of some of the things we've talked about: impact of international market underperformance; dollar appreciation throughout last year; impact, importantly, of recent price cuts or what we would rather call an investment in our iShares franchise that were not reflected in last year's prior second quarter; and importantly, a slower rate of organic base fee growth relative to asset growth in the second half of last year. Sequentially, the fee rate has stabilized as those headwinds, as you mentioned associated with the divergent beta and FX, have abated. And should those trends continue, the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth rate, which has been about 6% year-to-date, so far, clearly should be more apparent over time. 
In my opinion, if we can sustain organic base fee growth in excess of 5% and frankly, we've done that in 2012, '13, '14, '15 and year-to-date this year. Last year was really the first year in the last five that we didn't do that. I'm not really sure why the fee rate itself is garnering that much attention other than I understand that it's the basis of a lot of the modeling that everybody is doing. But I think right now, we're feeling incredibly comfortable with the level of organic base fee growth rate that we're seeing and are paying a little less attention to the overall fee rate as long as we can generate that revenue momentum."

So we announced changes to our active equity platform in March. These changes were not effective until mid- to late-June. So it's a little early to tell and see any material progress from the reorg in -- of those flows or financial advice. But as anticipated, we saw some accelerated outflows from the funds impacted by the changes, which contributed to some of the active equity outflows in the second quarter. But other of our fundamental active equity funds that weren't part of the changes to the platform actually saw a slight improvement in outflows. And additionally, we had a few large client redemptions from our scientific active equity. But a portion of these outflows were recaptured on our platform as certain clients moved in to index strategies. So our focus is going to be on generating strong performance, which we believe differentiates our ability to work with our clients to achieve their desired long-term outcomes to drive improvements in both the scientific and fundamental active equity funds since last year. And there, I've already seen some excellent performance in the quantitative side, 92% of our active, quantitative active equity and 78% of our fundamental active equity assets are above their benchmark and peer mediums for the 3-year period. And then the creation of our advantage series, which is offering clients the ability to outperform and have the lowest fees.

So just to give a little bit of color on the people and the investment. The 3,500 rough-cut people in technology and data-related roles includes expected technology roles such as programmers and quant modelers, but also less obvious ones that leverage technology and data in a significant way like our iShares analytics and electronic trading teams. So as Larry basically mentioned, we're thinking technology much more holistically, not as a specific definition, but embracing technology to drive our overall business. 
We're spending about $1 billion this year to support that technology and data initiative, which includes a number of things, but also includes compensation and related expenses associated with, obviously, those people as well as hardware, software and market data costs for the firm more broadly. I think in terms of margins, more broadly, as you know, we're not really big on talking about individual margins of vertical businesses. And so as we really think about incremental margins on specific products or businesses, that's not an overwhelmingly relevant number that we think about day to day. But, for example, to think about driving growth in iShares, as an example, we're investing beyond simple product innovation. We're investing in the entire ETF ecosystem. We're investing in distribution. We're investing in portfolio construction technology. We're investing in capital markets, ETF and portfolio construction, education. We're talking about building new markets for new users. And I think there's no question that the accelerating growth that we're seeing in iShares is a direct result of those investments more broadly. We're really trying to take a much more portfolio-oriented approach to investing in technology. And so, notwithstanding some of the things that we're doing that go also through our P&L, you're also seeing us make a number of strategic acquisitions or other investments. Sometimes they're controlled, like Cachematrix, and sometimes they're really to get a seat at the table and try to learn and help our partners evolve, like Scalable Capital and iCapital. I think the important thing is that whichever direction we're going to go, we're going to continue to use our scale, which we think is a huge driver of our ability to efficiently spend on technology in ways that others can't, really to drive that growth and increase market share for both shareholders and our clients."

And in my view, my personal view, quarterly comparisons here are less relevant, and you really should look at our performance over a more appropriate period of time, especially in the context of the organic growth that we're generating today. 
Our commitment has not changed. Our commitment has always been to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible, especially by leveraging our scale for both clients and shareholders. And I think if you look back over the work that we've done since BGI, in particular, the operating margin is up well over 500 basis points. And we've invested significantly back into the business. We are currently generating record organic growth, especially in terms of base fees. As I mentioned over the last 12 months, $335 billion-plus of net new business, that's 7% organic AUM growth, and importantly, 5% organic base fee growth. There was a significant time where people were asking us when we were going to get to those levels, and while I think it's still early to call it sustainable for a significant period of time, this level of growth is clearly a direct result of the investments that we've made over time. No one likes higher margins than I do or -- well, maybe the guy sitting next to me actually does, but I also know that our level of organic growth determines our multiple and continuing to invest to support these record levels of organic growth is a critical priority for us and one that will be maintained going forward. 
While there is, obviously, an upward bias to our margin as we continue to grow in a constructive environment, I think as Larry indicated in his remarks, we intend to continue playing offense by aggressively investing to create more opportunities for future growth."

It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release d",1617,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's globally integrated technology and investment platform continues to position us as the solutions provider of choice to both retail and institutional clients. The breadth and scale of our capabilities allows us to continuously and efficiently reinvest in our investment, distribution, technology and risk management franchises in order to provide increased value to both clients and shareholders over time. 
As a result of that commitment to reinvest, net inflows for the last 12 months totaled $336 billion as organic growth accelerated in the second quarter. Total quarterly flows exceeded $100 billion and were positive across client types, asset classes and investment styles, highlighting the uniqueness of our diversified investment platform, which includes cash, market cap weighted index products, a spectrum of active offerings from smart beta and factors to high conviction alpha strategies and illiquid alternatives. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were a record for BlackRock and represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%. Annualized organic base fee growth was 8% for the quarter and 5% for the last 12 months despite the pricing changes we have previously announced over the last 9 months. 
Record quarterly revenue of $3 billion was 6% up over a year ago. Operating income of $1.2 billion was also 6% higher than a year ago, and earnings per share of $5.24 increased 10%. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $26 million of net investment gains, an increase from the second quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter and the impact of our debt refinancing last quarter. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.5%. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable protected -- projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year. 
Second quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year driven primarily by the positive impact of organic growth and market appreciation on average AUM, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements and certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's second quarter. 
While the dollar has recently given up gains versus major currencies, the impact of dollar appreciation over the last year still reduced our quarterly year-over-year based fee growth by about 1%. Sequentially, base fees were up 6% and benefited from higher securities lending revenue in the second quarter, which increased 11%, driven by seasonality and higher on-loan balances. 
Last month at the Morgan Stanley conference, I spoke about several exogenous factors, including divergent beta and FX that have negatively impacted our blended fee rate over the last several years and masked the benefit we have achieved from executing our differentiated growth strategy. As some of these headwinds lessened during the second quarter, with emerging markets outperforming U.S. markets and the U.S. dollar weakening, our blended fee rate has stabilized and the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth should become more apparent. 
Performance fees of $48 million decreased $26 million from the prior year due to weaker relative performance in long-only equity funds with annual locks in the second quarter. Technology and risk management revenue of $164 million increased 12% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the Aladdin platform and new client wins. 
Market demand remains strong for our full range of products, including institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, Provider Aladdin, iRetire and FutureAdvisor. Clients continue to seek sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio construction and scalable distribution tools, and our first 3 Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management clients went live on the platform earlier in the quarter. 
In line with our strategic focus on technology to enhance value and deliver innovative solutions to clients, we announced the acquisition of Cachematrix, a leading provider of financial technology that simplifies the cash management process for corporate treasury clients, and a minority investment in Scalable Capital, one of the fastest-growing digital investment managers in Europe. Together with our minority investment in iCapital, we believe BlackRock can significantly enhance the growth profile of these businesses while simultaneously benefiting from their unique capabilities. 
The strong organic growth we are experiencing today is a result of the investments we've made in our business over time, and we continue to invest aggressively to create more opportunity for the future. 
Expense increased 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense as a result of higher-average AUM and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $24 million, or 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher headcount. Sequentially, compensation expense was down 2%, reflecting lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter and $20 million of onetime expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform in the prior quarter. 
The accelerating shift to passive is impacting growth in our volume-related expense and direct fund expense was up $29 million or 15% year-over-year primarily reflecting significant growth in our iShares franchise. 
G&A expense was up $34 million or 11% year-over-year, reflecting increased levels of spend to drive growth, including investments in technology and data and higher discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Year-over-year comparisons were also impacted by the timing of certain accruals and additional expense related to the sale of our U.K. defined contribution platform. 
Sequentially, G&A expense increased $49 million from the first quarter or 16%, reflecting similar increases in technology, data and marketing spend, but also higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter. 
Assuming stable markets and given the timing and levels of our spend in the first half of 2017, we would anticipate planned G&A expense for the second half of 2017 to be in the range of $750 million. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was flat year-over-year and up 130 basis points sequentially. As we have stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target but remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. 
We're also committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of First Reserves infrastructure equity funds. Larry will talk more about additional investments in innovation across the broader ecosystem to support future growth. We also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and investment styles. Long-term net inflows were driven by iShares, which crossed $1.5 trillion of global AUM in the quarter and continue to benefit from the accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth channel and the rapid adoption of iShares' ETFs as asset allocation tools and financial instruments by professional money managers. 
Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $74 billion, representing 21% annualized organic growth with strength across our core and non-core exposures. In the 9 months since we announced pricing changes to the core in October of last year, we have already recaptured over 75% of our investment through organic growth alone.
iShares' equity net inflows of $52 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares' net inflows of $21 billion were led by flows into investment-grade corporate, emerging market bond and treasury funds. 
Our institutional business generated $13 billion of long-term net inflows across both active and index strategies. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by strong multi-asset and alternative inflows, partially offset by equity and fixed income outflows. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath Target Date series, which saw record net inflows of $9 billion. We also saw strength in fiduciary mandates and factors, each with approximately $1 billion of net inflows. Alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows, driven primarily by our global infrastructure franchise. 
Institutional index net inflows of $9 billion reflected strong flows of $17 billion into fixed income, partially offset by index equity outflows of $9 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation decisions during the quarter. 
Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally, led by fixed income and index equity products, partially offset by outflows from multi-asset. Fixed income net inflows of $7 billion were diversified across our top-performing platform and included $1 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals and total return strategies. 
While total multi-asset flows were, once again, impacted by outflows from world allocation strategies, our multi-asset income strategy, nevertheless, raised another $2 billion during the quarter as investors continued to target income-oriented outcomes. 
BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to continuously invest for the future. Our diversification, scale and globally-integrated investment in technology platform enables us to generate differentiated and more consistent organic growth in AUM and base fees, resulting in long-term value creation for both clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,528688129,1244859,"BlackRock, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 17, 2017",2017-07-17,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform. BlackRock's ability to partner with clients ac",1964,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. 
BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform. BlackRock's ability to partner with clients across our broad range of investment strategies and technology solutions and as a thought leader drove $104 billion of total net inflows in the quarter with a record $94 billion in long-term strategies, which were positive across all client types, product types and investment styles. 
While significant cash remains on the sidelines, investors have begun to put more of their assets to work and global equity markets continue to rise in the quarter, underscoring a generally healthier global economy and proving that, so far, markets have been resilient to political shocks. Through the second quarter, the S&P was up 8% year-to-date, reaching all-time highs, and many international markets have even outperformed. 
At the same time, while markets have started to anticipate a normalization of policy in the environment of sustained expansion, negative yields remain a reality in some countries and expectation for a continued low-yield environment persist. And while amounts of cash still are uninvested and the ongoing risk of both economic and political disruption on the horizons, investors continue to face challenges in meeting their clients' future needs. 
Both institutional and retail clients are looking to BlackRock for investment strategies and for Aladdin risk management and portfolio construction technology. They're also turning to BlackRock for our insights to help them understand how to navigate the investment landscape. 
Insurance companies are one example of clients that continue to face significant challenges in this low-yield environment. Last month, leveraging BlackRock's extensive experience with the needs of insurance clients and risk modeling capabilities, we launched an insurance industry risk study. We took the investment portfolios of the entire U.S. insurance industry at the individual security line item level, uploading them onto Aladdin and then cut the data in a variety of ways to see who's taking what kinds of risk and how are they being rewarded for that type of risk. 
And we brought together a group of insurance company CEOs to talk about the results, to answer questions like what is the current opportunity set in their own individual portfolio and how should they be positioned in the event of a stressed economy or another crisis. We also showed the CEOs how their investment positions reflected versus their peers, and so it was an incredible peer analysis for the CEOs. Our goal was to provide them with more information to look to BlackRock to help them making strategic decisions that would ultimately drive their stakeholder returns. 
This is just one example. BlackRock is increasingly using our technology, our scale and innovative ways to enhance the value that we can provide to our clients. As the wealth management landscape evolves globally, our intermediary partners are accelerating their movement, their changes towards a fee-based advisory and fee-based accounts and are expected to grow by upward of $8 trillion in the U.S. over the next several years. 
As a result, our wealth partners are placing more emphasis than ever before on portfolios, not just a product, not just an individual bond or not just an individual stock. They're also focused on both performance and the value that the underlying investments can provide to investors and increasingly, our partners are looking for access to high-quality portfolio construction and digital technologies to help execute repeatable processes. 
In this environment, BlackRock is able to provide more value to wealth management clients than ever before. And in the U.S. through technology like Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, which I'll talk about in a few minutes, the reinvention of our sales model and tech-enabled advisor engagement had allowed us to partner with 25% more financial advisers this year than we did at the same point last year at no additional cost. 
The combination of BlackRock's differentiated technology offerings and our broad-based investment platforms position us as the most sophisticated portfolio construction partner in the industry for both institutions and wealth managers. 
Looking at flows for the quarter. BlackRock saw $8 billion of active net flows driven by multi-asset fixed income and alternatives, which contributed to strong organic base fee growth in the quarter. 
BlackRock is seeing increasingly strong fundraising momentum in illiquid alternatives with $9 billion in flows and commitments year-to-date. We have particularly strengthened infrastructure funds as the investments we've made in our platform over time are resonating with our clients. 
Our acquisition of First Reserve infrastructure equity funds, which closed in the quarter, adds a talented team with specific expertise in energy infrastructure investing and $3 billion of assets to our platform. We now have over $16 billion of total investment and commitment infrastructure capital to manage on behalf of our clients. 
We also launched the U.K.'s first alternative solution fund earlier this month. The fund offers pension's searching for yield, a long term outcome-oriented strategy in a single portfolio, which, again, leverages BlackRock specialist teams across credit, real estate and infrastructure. 
We now manage $98 billion of assets across our core alternative platform and have an additional $15 billion of committed capital to invest going forward. 
BlackRock saw $86 billion of net inflows into iShares and index funds in the second quarter. Global iShares momentum continued with a record $74 billion of net inflows for a total of $138 billion on net inflows year-to-date. 
As growth continues following our strategic investment to lower prices for clients, we generated $35 billion of inflows in iShares' core funds in the quarter. Importantly, noncore iShares exposures generated over $38 billion of flows, contributing to a higher organic base fee growth for the firm. 
The rapid growth we're seeing in iShares is increasingly due to the fact that ETFs are no longer used only as a passive allocation, but by active investors to generate alpha in their portfolios. ETFs provide those investors targeting exposures without the idiosyncratic risk of any one single stock or one any single bond. 
Accelerating growth is also coming from the investments we're making more broadly to innovate across the entire ETF ecosystem. This is more than just a product innovation, it's innovation in distribution, it's innovation in portfolio construction technology, in ETF and portfolio construction education and in building new markets for new users, all of which foster further adaptation of ETFs worldwide. 
As we deepen our partnership with clients and continue to strengthen our brand through both investment and technology offerings, global iShares market share of year-to-date flows has expanded to more than 40%. Fixed income ETFs are a great example of the area where broad ecosystem innovation is driving growth. 
After several years of BlackRock working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on the mechanics of fixed income ETFs, accounting guidelines will now treat them as bonds instead of equities. They will treat it through -- as a look-through treatment to the underlying assets, making it much more efficient for insurers to own fixed income ETFs for their portfolios. 
Another example is the new segment for ETFs. We recently announced changes in our iShares ETF MBB, the industry flagship mortgage-backed security ETF, to drive accelerated growth. We're evolving MBB, or our mortgage-backed bond ETFs, to become the leading financial instrument and, I want to underline, risk management tool for institutions to access fully funded exposures to physical mortgage pools. By lowering the price to make the fund competitive with direct investments in mortgage securities, institutions will have a more efficient, a more liquid option for hedging their mortgage-backed exposures and their direct mortgage originations. 
We also launched BlackRock's first self-indexed ETFs, 2 smart beta fixed income ETFs. These new indexes are based on unique intellectual property and leveraging the best of BlackRock's analytics and modeling capabilities to achieve superior investment outcomes for clients. This illustrates one of the ways we are using our scale and technology to reduce manufacturing costs and pass along greater savings to our clients. 
Technology is transforming the asset management industry, and that pace of technology innovation is accelerating. I've talked about BlackRock's aspirational target of 30% of our revenues being enabled by technology 5 years from now. That is a vision for how I believe technology will help drive revenues and create efficiencies across BlackRock. Some of that vision will be driven by growth in Aladdin and our technology offerings, but much of it will come from using technology to drive investment performance and build better distribution capabilities, ultimately delivering growth in base fees and performance fees. 
And in addition, I am using this target as a mechanism to get all 13,000 of BlackRock's employees to understand how technology and the utilization of technology is going to change BlackRock, is going to change our clients' needs, and will change the entire ecosystem in what we do. Technology will impact all aspects of our business: the way we generate Alpha; the way we build portfolios; the way we manage risk; the way we distribute solutions; the way we engage with service providers; the way we operate; and even the way we source talent. 
Aladdin's portfolio in risk management technology continues to be in demand by institutional clients looking to invest and operate smarter and with more efficiencies. We now have nearly 200 institutional clients using Aladdin. Our investment teams are combining big data and machine learning with traditional fundamental human analysis to generate better sustainable alpha for our clients. 
As portfolios become increasingly complex and interconnected, we are leveraging our analytical and risk management technology to create more sophisticated and more scalable portfolio construction, asset allocation and risk management tools for wealth management. Our first 3 Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management clients are now live, and they're benefiting from the Aladdin technology. 
We are also providing our wealth management partners with integrated digital distribution platforms, so they can reach and interact with their end investors in a more scalable, in a more repeatable way. Building on our acquisitions of FutureAdvisor, our investment in iCapital, we continue to expand our digital distribution capabilities with an acquisition of Cachematrix and a minority investment in Scalable Capital. Both platforms will allow us to provide our clients with scalable technology-enabled solutions. 
In addition to driving growth, we're using Aladdin to drive operating efficiencies. The investments we've made in our trading technology and operations have dramatically reduced the cost of our trades. We have reduced our trades by 80% over the last 5 years. This has been a huge reduction in those basic costs, and it's totally driven by technology. 
Going forward, technology-enabled scale will be increasingly important for every aspect of an asset manager's business, our client service, our asset generation and operational excellence. This year, we will be spending $1 billion on technology and data, and have over 3,500 employees working on technology and data-related roles. 
We recently signed a 20-year lease for our new global headquarters at Hudson Yards in New York, which will be the state-of-the-art hub that is technologically advanced, environmentally sustainable and operationally resilient. Our new headquarters will epitomize our tech-centric culture and create a world-class experience for our people and our clients. 
As I've said many times, but I mean it as much as ever today, I have never seen more opportunity for BlackRock than I do today. The record growth we're seeing is a direct result of the investments we made to build our platform over time. Continuing to invest in high-growth areas of our business and moving into adjacent areas to enhance the solutions we can offer to our clients, both remain critical priorities in order to drive future growth and provide increased value to both our clients and to our shareholders. 
With that, let me open it up for questions."

But I think, really, the clients that we had are -- we're all still learning together about all of the amazing things that we can do with these clients, both from the top down in terms of some of the risks and compliance opportunities and then more importantly, some of the other bottoms-up, more specific financial adviser opportunities regarding portfolio construction and asset allocation that move from adviser on up.

Ultimately, Aladdin for Wealth Management is going to be dealt at the house level, at the CIO level and then ultimately, it will be implemented, maybe, depending on each firm at the individual financial adviser level. And this will allow us to have an opportunity to be at our financial advisers desktops. So the actual implementation probably is a little longer because of the significance of the scale of it. But let's be clear, this may become one of the great opportunities for BlackRock. We are going to continue to be driving more and more of the opportunities for Aladdin for Wealth Management. I see this being our transformation for our position in retail globally. And what I believe this does, it allows BlackRock to be even more important in the overall ecosystem of -- in wealth management. It gives us -- the Aladdin system will provide portfolio construction tools. It provides risk management. It is not a tool to sell only BlackRock products, it is a tool to enhance the wealth managers' value proposition. They'll be able to use other products on it, other firms, but we believe by having that placement in the desktop, that placement -- and we've seen this in other areas, it gives us that opportunity to have deeper, better dialogues. And more -- so we look at this as one of the more fundamental, long-term strategies for our positioning. And as Gary suggested, there are revenues now, but the revenues are very similar to how the institutional side are, they're very modest and the margins are subdued during this process of implementation. And once utilized, depending on how well they're utilized and by the amount of financial advisers, then we would expect increased utilization and through increased utilization were revenues from the platform."

I think the U.S. in many respects, in terms of most of the change that's occurred here, in terms of the migration to fee-based planning, which we think is, obviously, where Europe is going to go, positions us incredibly well to learn and to basically effectuate that opportunity.

One thing I would say, the key issue for Europe is over 72% of all savings is in cash in Europe. One of the great reasons why P/E ratios are lower in Europe than the United States is most savers are only in cash and bank deposits. If, through regulatory changes, through digital advice, through low-cost alternatives, if we could provide Europeans with a better alternative that they looked towards for investing over a long horizon by being positioned there with digital technology with our iShares brand in Europe, I think we're as well positioned as any firm in the whole continent."

We're seeing regulatory changes, we're seeing regulatory changes change the ETF environment. We do believe we're seeing accelerated flows because of the MiFID II, because of the movement towards the fiduciary role in the United States. We're seeing more active investors using ETFs to express their exposures, which I talked about. I think that is accelerating. Having the insurance commissioners changing capital -- having a look through treatment for fixed income ETFs is very important because insurance industry did not use ETFs because of the differential in capital charges, just because of the CUSIP number and now you have a look-through treatment. And so we believe the environmental for ETFs is continuing to evolve. We believe it's continuing to grow. And much of it also has to do with ecosystem innovation. I think what we are doing in the mortgage-backed area is going to have even a large opportunity for ETF growth as we can now use ETFs as a vehicle to hedge mortgage production. So I think what's going on is -- and then I'll let Rob Kapito to speak up. I do believe you're seeing more utilization ETFs from institutions and retail for an exposure in the active side, we're seeing more utilization across the board in more products. And I think that's what you're -- we're starting to see that acceleration. 
I just -- before Rob speaks, I just want to cite one important point. Index and ETF still only represent 10% of the entire equity market global capitalization. And here we are talking about a great amount of flows but with $160-odd trillion global equity market capitalization, we have much more opportunities for ETFs to grow, not just in equities but in fixed income. And I believe this is just the beginning. It reminds me of when Rob and I were young, driving the mortgage-backed securities market in the late '70s, early '80s -- well, for me, the late '70s, Rob in the '80s, I'm older. Rob, any comments?"

So there's new and newer uses for ETFs every single day, and that's why what we're trying to do is respond and be in front of our clients, and we have to go out and discuss with them ways that they can use ETFs that they have not been able to use them before.

What we are now seeing, whether it's a bank, a trading desk or a bank balance sheet, an insurance company, a mortgage originator, we're now starting to see more and more utilization of ETFs, which is transparent. So we look at this as a net positive. And when people talk about this, they're not taking into the context how large derivative swaps and futures have been and now -- which was totally nontransparent and now, all this activity is moving much more onto a transparent platform, which, obviously, is one of the reason why you're seeing the growth. And the other thing I would just say, and Rob talked about it, we're seeing more and more investors instead of buying individual stocks or individual bonds, they're using ETFs to get their exposures."

Just kind of curious whether or not -- is it too much to expect that some of the reversal of those trends that have hindered your fee rate over the last few years could actually turn into tailwinds, which might allow for the fee rate to expand? Or is stability the best way we should think about it? And I know that sometimes, averages can cause the numbers to -- on a quarterly basis, to not necessarily reflect the whole story. So when we think about the exit rate coming out of the quarter here, how should we think about the fee rate here, tactically, more in the near term, too?"

So again, I just want to take a step back, again, just back to the Morgan Stanley conference. So we talked there about the fact that the blended fee rate over the last several years has, obviously, been impacted by a variety of factors that we don't control. We've talked about them as exogenous factors. We've, obviously, pointed to both divergent equity beta, dollar appreciation, but importantly also, shift in client preferences towards lower risk asset classes and index strategies, especially last year, where, obviously, we saw probably -- we saw a large dispersion between our asset growth rate and our base fee growth rate. And that actually has also has an impact by virtue of mix in terms of our fee rate. And I think all of those factors have really masked the benefit we have achieved from executing a pretty good differentiated growth strategy. 
The fee rate declined about 1.4 basis points from the second quarter of last year, and that was a continuation of some of the things we've talked about: impact of international market underperformance; dollar appreciation throughout last year; impact, importantly, of recent price cuts or what we would rather call an investment in our iShares franchise that were not reflected in last year's prior second quarter; and importantly, a slower rate of organic base fee growth relative to asset growth in the second half of last year. Sequentially, the fee rate has stabilized as those headwinds, as you mentioned associated with the divergent beta and FX, have abated. And should those trends continue, the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth rate, which has been about 6% year-to-date, so far, clearly should be more apparent over time. 
In my opinion, if we can sustain organic base fee growth in excess of 5% and frankly, we've done that in 2012, '13, '14, '15 and year-to-date this year. Last year was really the first year in the last five that we didn't do that. I'm not really sure why the fee rate itself is garnering that much attention other than I understand that it's the basis of a lot of the modeling that everybody is doing. But I think right now, we're feeling incredibly comfortable with the level of organic base fee growth rate that we're seeing and are paying a little less attention to the overall fee rate as long as we can generate that revenue momentum."

So we announced changes to our active equity platform in March. These changes were not effective until mid- to late-June. So it's a little early to tell and see any material progress from the reorg in -- of those flows or financial advice. But as anticipated, we saw some accelerated outflows from the funds impacted by the changes, which contributed to some of the active equity outflows in the second quarter. But other of our fundamental active equity funds that weren't part of the changes to the platform actually saw a slight improvement in outflows. And additionally, we had a few large client redemptions from our scientific active equity. But a portion of these outflows were recaptured on our platform as certain clients moved in to index strategies. 
So our focus is going to be on generating strong performance, which we believe differentiates our ability to work with our clients to achieve their desired long-term outcomes to drive improvements in both the scientific and fundamental active equity funds since last year. And there, I've already seen some excellent performance in the quantitative side, 92% of our active, quantitative active equity and 78% of our fundamental active equity assets are above their benchmark and peer mediums for the 3-year period. And then the creation of our advantage series, which is offering clients the ability to outperform and have the lowest fees. All of those are showing results and all of this, I believe, is part of our announcement of [ monarch ] and the upside that we have to come. So we're very encouraged. The portfolio managers are energized to be out, to share information across both of the platforms. We've heard very positive views from our clients because everyone is focused on figuring out how to utilize the big data that's out there to their advantage to create performance. So the rollout of it has been something that we've gotten very, very good client feedback from, and I'm very optimistic about it going forward."

So just to give a little bit of color on the people and the investment. The 3,500 rough-cut people in technology and data-related roles includes expected technology roles such as programmers and quant modelers, but also less obvious ones that leverage technology and data in a significant way like our iShares analytics and electronic trading teams. So as Larry basically mentioned, we're thinking technology much more holistically, not as a specific definition, but embracing technology to drive our overall business. 
We're spending about $1 billion this year to support that technology and data initiative, which includes a number of things, but also includes compensation and related expenses associated with, obviously, those people as well as hardware, software and market data costs for the firm more broadly. I think in terms of margins, more broadly, as you know, we're not really big on talking about individual margins of vertical businesses. And so as we really think about incremental margins on specific products or businesses, that's not an overwhelmingly relevant number that we think about day to day. But, for example, to think about driving growth in iShares, as an example, we're investing beyond simple product innovation. We're investing in the entire ETF ecosystem. We're investing in distribution. We're investing in portfolio construction technology. We're investing in capital markets, ETF and portfolio construction, education. We're talking about building new markets for new users. 
And I think there's no question that the accelerating growth that we're seeing in iShares is a direct result of those investments more broadly. We're really trying to take a much more portfolio-oriented approach to investing in technology. And so, notwithstanding some of the things that we're doing that go also through our P&L, you're also seeing us make a number of strategic acquisitions or other investments. Sometimes they're controlled, like Cachematrix, and sometimes they're really to get a seat at the table and try to learn and help our partners evolve, like Scalable Capital and iCapital. I think the important thing is that whichever direction we're going to go, we're going to continue to use our scale, which we think is a huge driver of our ability to efficiently spend on technology in ways that others can't, really to drive that growth and increase market share for both shareholders and our clients."

So look, as we've said in the past, we really don't manage the business to a specific margin target. And in my view, my personal view, quarterly comparisons here are less relevant, and you really should look at our performance over a more appropriate period of time, especially in the context of the organic growth that we're generating today. 
Our commitment has not changed. Our commitment has always been to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible, especially by leveraging our scale for both clients and shareholders. And I think if you look back over the work that we've done since BGI, in particular, the operating margin is up well over 500 basis points. And we've invested significantly back into the business. We are currently generating record organic growth, especially in terms of base fees. As I mentioned over the last 12 months, $335 billion-plus of net new business, that's 7% organic AUM growth, and importantly, 5% organic base fee growth. There was a significant time where people were asking us when we were going to get to those levels, and while I think it's still early to call it sustainable for a significant period of time, this level of growth is clearly a direct result of the investments that we've made over time. No one likes higher margins than I do or -- well, maybe the guy sitting next to me actually does, but I also know that our level of organic growth determines our multiple and continuing to invest to support these record levels of organic growth is a critical priority for us and one that will be maintained going forward. 
While there is, obviously, an upward bias to our margin as we continue to grow in a constructive environment, I think as Larry indicated in his remarks, we intend to continue playing offense by aggressively investing to create more opportunities for future growth."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on an as-adjusted results. 
The breadth and scale of BlackRock's globally integrated investment and technology platform continue to drive strong business and financial results. The impact of the investments we have made over time and continue to make today are driving better Alpha generation, fostering stronger client partnerships and allowing us to more efficiently operate our business. 
Total quarterly net inflows of $96 billion included long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth and were positive across client type, investment style and region. 
BlackRock has now generated over 5% long-term organic asset growth for 5 consecutive quarters. More importantly, we've achieved a long-term organic base fee growth rate of 5% for the last 12 months. Bear in mind, these long-term growth rates don't include the impact of our cash business, which has generated almost 10% growth over the last year. 
Record quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $5.92, both increased 15% versus a year ago. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.6%. Assuming no current year impact from potential future change in tax laws, we continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of discrete items that could arise in the future. 
Third quarter base fees rose 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's third quarter. 
Performance fees of $191 million increased $133 million from the prior year and $143 million sequentially, reflecting strong overall performance from our broad-based hedge fund platform and the impact of a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance and [ lots ] annually in the third quarter. 
Technology and risk management revenue of $175 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management platforms. Demand remains strong across all our full range of technology and risk management capabilities with both retail intermediaries and institutional clients increasingly focused on using technology to improve portfolio construction capabilities, optimize risk management and operate more efficiently. 
We continue to invest in technology and data initiatives across the firm to generate better Alpha, more effectively service existing clients and leverage our global distribution capabilities. Whether investing through the income statement, the inorganic opportunities like FutureAdvisor or Cachematrix or using our balance sheet to make minority investments in fast-growing businesses like Scalable Capital or iCapital, our goal is to drive profitable growth in both base fees and technology revenue. 
Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Direct fund expense was up $34 million or 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher-average AUM and significant growth in our iShares franchise. G&A expense was up $51 million or 60% year-over-year, in line with previous guidance, reflecting higher technology and data spend. Current quarter G&A expense also reflected higher professional service fees, FX remeasurement expense and increased contingent consideration fair value adjustments versus a year ago. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. While we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, we are very margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
We continue to execute our consistent capital management strategy during the quarter, repurchasing an additional 275 million in common shares and stand by our previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
Third quarter long-term net inflows of $76 billion representing 6% annualized organic asset growth were positive across client type, investment style and region. 
Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $52 billion, representing 14% annualized organic growth, with strength across both core and noncore exposures. 
In the one year since we repriced the core funds last October, BlackRock has recaptured more than 100% of the annual revenue impact of our investment, primarily through accelerated organic growth and expanded our total U.S. market share of net flows by over 600 basis points. 
iShares' net of it inflows of $33 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta funds. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $18 billion reflected a continued adoption of fixed income ETFs by a broader set of clients, with flows led by treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds. 
Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion, once again, showcased the strength of our top-performing active platform and included $1 billion into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals, emerging market debt and total return strategies. Multi-asset flows were driven by $1 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. 
Our institutional business generated $16 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter, positive across index and active. Institutional index net inflows of $16 billion reflected $37 billion into fixed income, driven by significant client demand for LDI strategies, partially offset by equity outflows of $20 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation changes during the quarter. 
Modest institutional active net inflows were driven by strong multi-asset inflows, reflecting continued demand for our LifePath target-date series and factor strategies, partially offset by active equity outflows. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business show a $20 billion of net inflows during the quarter, reflecting several large client wins and reached its highest ever level of AUM. 
BlackRock's third quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to invest on behalf of our clients and continued execution of our framework for shareholder value creation, differentiated organic growth, operating leverage, consistent capital return. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock generated strong results in the third quarter as our differentiated global investment and technology platform increasingly resonates with our clients, driving deeper partnerships than ever before. 
Over the past year, the market environment has improved considerably. We've seen greater political stability in Europe. China is continuing to show economics strength, and after a long the of stagnation, we're seeing consistent growth in Japan. 
Overall, the world has become much more resilient. However, large cash balances remain on the sidelines, and many global institutions are invested in assets with return profiles that are not expected to meet their liabilities overtime, which is creating significant demand for asset allocation and investment strategies across multiple asset classes. 
In these times of great economic certainty, there's also a greater need for people to be invested. And more than anytime in history, clients are reaching out to BlackRock for advice and for solutions. 
We built customized solutions from our investment platform that spans index to illiquid alternatives. Our technology and risk management capabilities enable us and our clients to construct better portfolios, generate Alpha more consistently, manage risks smarter and scale operations more efficiently. 
Combined with insights of a BlackRock Investment Institute, we are able to form stronger and more differentiated partnerships with our clients. And all of this is showing up in our flows. 
As Gary said, BlackRock saw third quarter total net inflows of $96 billion. These flows came from both institutional and retail clients across all major regions and investment styles. We now seen a total of $264 billion of flows so far this year compared to $202 billion for all of 2016. 
As we deepen our relationships with the clients and partners, we recognize and embrace the growing responsibility we have on a daily basis. It is an enormous responsibility, and we take this seriously, and we also attempt everyday to achieve the responsibilities with our goals. 
Gary talked about our shareholder value-creation framework and organic growth as a primary driver of that framework. Our strategy for growth is centered on being a fiduciary to our clients. This means investing to be a leader in the areas of high client demand and growth like ETFs, like illiquid alternatives. 
It also means investing to generate differentiated Alpha for clients and to enhance our competitive advantages in Aladdin, and most importantly, technology and to grow our scale. 
With regulation, technology and market forces transforming the ecosystem for asset and wealth managements globally, BlackRock's is at the forefront of change in the industry and our focus remains on the long-term for our clients worldwide. 
In the U.S., there are 2 major shifts converging in wealth management. First, in one of the largest asset movements, fee-based advisory assets are expected to double by 2020 in the shift from brokerage to fee-based accounts. The second digital technologies are disrupting traditional wealth advisory practices, which create competition for client assets and provide leverage for fast-growing adviser practices. 
These trends has several major implications for our entire industry. Value for cost is critical to advisers and asset allocation decisions. Advisors are increasingly focused on managing risk and constructing portfolios. Chief Investment Officers are taking more control over asset allocation decisions so there's a heightened focus on repeatable systematized processes that can be scaled. I guess, as backdrop, wealth managers are concentrating their business with fewer asset managers. Demand is increasingly for a strategic partnerships beyond anyone's specific investment product. They're looking for partnerships with BlackRock that we can have ability to bring tremendous value to our relationships to our clients. BlackRock has the building blocks. BlackRock has the technology and BlackRock has the expertise to glide clients on how to effectively use our scale. 
Our U.S. Wealth Advisory sales teams have adopted digital processes to scale and deepen financial adviser engagements. We increased engagements by 23% relative to same time last year, in part by leveraging technology. We've held more than 15,000 virtual meetings this year from none, 2 years ago, which has especially been productive for us to reach more advisers in our fast-growing independent channel. 
Our focus on investment and wealth management technology is aligned with our investment in the ETF ecosystem, which is increasingly driving our flows. We are creating new opportunities globally for clients to use ETF for asset allocation and Alpha generation. We are developing new products, we're spending time on ETF education across the industry and BlackRock is at the forefront of innovation in the ETF distribution side. 
The investments we have made in iShares are showing realtime results. For both the third quarter and year-to-date, iShares capture the #1 share of flows in the United States and Europe and globally. Usage is increasingly across client types, from wealth clients seeking low-cost exposures and fee-based advisory models to insurers, asset managers, banks, pensions, sovereign wealth funds, using ETFs alongside individual stocks, alongside bonds, futures swaps as a necessary component of their portfolios. 
We are similarly seeing growth across all of our key products segments. We've seen $58 billion of flows into fixed income ETFs over the past year and continue to see growth in our core, in our financial instruments, in our factors, in our Smart Beta and ASG. 
 
In Alpha seeking strategies, we are focused on generating consistent performance for our clients. We believe the revitalization of our active equity platform this year will drive better client outcomes and future growth for BlackRock. We are seeing early signs of progress, with 81% of fundamental and 90% of scientific active equity assets are above our benchmark or peer media now for 3 years. 
Growth that we are seeing across our platform is a direct result of the investments we've made over time to position ourselves ahead of our client needs. 
We invested to build our infrastructure business beginning with a lift out of a small renewable team in 2011. Today, as a result of both organic growth and acquisitions, our global infrastructure team of nearly 150 professionals manages $16 billion of invested in committed assets across a diverse set of equity and debt infrastructure strategies. 
Last year, we invested $75 million into our iShares quarter shares to drive growth at a time when we anticipated the significant changes in our ecosystem. 
With industry flows at record highs, we have recaptured more than 100% of the revenue impact of our investment and grew our share flows from 25% in 2016, prior to our repositioning last October, to 41% market share over the past year. 
Technology is increasingly significant growth driver for our business. Importantly, technology that enhances distribution and alpha generation is driving increased flows, our base fees and performance fees. We're also growing our direct technology and risk management revenues, which increased by 15% year-over-year. 
One example of that tech investment is Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. After the idea was born out of an internal employee innovation competition, we quickly built into a business to drive value for our clients. 
Less than 2 years later, Aladdin Risk for Wealth has nearly 75 dedicated employees and 5 clients have gone live in our platform. 
Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management and other digital offerings and partnerships like iRetire, FutureAdvisor, iCapital, Scalable Capital, reaching tens of thousands of financial advisers who manage assets on behalf of millions of investors. 
As our digital offerings enable financial adviser to have a more productive conversation with our clients, they are driving more growth in our iShares and other BlackRock investment strategies. 
We invested our cash management business both organically and through acquisition to start strengthen our platform to leverage our scale and drive incremental growth. We've grown assets by 70% over the last 5 years without significantly increasing our expense base. In the third quarter, we saw $20 billion of net inflows into cash management strategy and now manage more than $400 billion in cash. 
Our long-term strategy of anticipating change and investing for growth is clearly working. Areas that we focus on today like factors, ASG, illiquid alternatives and digital wealth management are some of the areas that will definitely be driving growth for our future. 
It is critical that we continue to invest in these opportunities while being mindful of the impact of our bottom line. This will continue to position BlackRock as a right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future. 
No firm in our industry is better positioned to take advantage of the scale to invest in the future of our clients. This is and will be our biggest competitive advantage in building stronger relationships with our clients and driving growth in our business. 
If we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, BlackRock will remain positioned to deliver a differentiated growth and a differentiated financial results, and that's why we continue to believe in our future. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I don't know all the answers to that question because some of this is just being introduced today, but we expect significant growth opportunities for Aladdin. I feel very confident we're going to continue to have double-digit growth. In our core business, we were seeing great interest from institutional clients worldwide. It is still our biggest driver in net revenue call. What is very interesting also, we're seeing opportunities from existing Aladdin clients, specifically in fixed income, we're now -- are now taking on Aladdin for equity. So we are now becoming a larger component with those clients that have already experienced the Aladdin environment, they've seen the success in terms of their own operation, and they're now expanding it into other asset categories. We're now seeing more interest from what I would say our core pension and insurance clients and from global asset managers throughout the world. So the foundational business is continuing to drive much of the success for Aladdin, and we expect that to continue and grow, as we said, double-digit. For Fiber Aladdin, we're in the testing phase right now, where we are -- Aladdin providers has been put to the custodial banks. We are working very closely with them on that, and ultimately, we believe that's not going to be -- -- obviously, it's a revenue driver as the custodian banks put it on, but let me also be clear on, it creates greater efficiencies for us. By having Provider Aladdin a seamless block chain, which is a private block chain between us and our custodial relationships, it's really creates a more seamless processing, and it should reduce many, many errors, let's assume. We have never -- we won't have anymore errors, we do have some. If this is successful, we expect to expand that beyond BlackRock and then use the Aladdin environment all our clients to have the same type of platform to utilize it. And then it would grow significantly. Aladdin for wealth management has a big future opportunity. As we've said, we have now 5 clients, we're now implementing those 5 clients. The demand is a significant. What we're so pleased, we have demand from Asia, we have demand from Europe and North America. So Aladdin for Wealth Management is a very well positioned for caring that growth that we see."

So we're talking to our clients, we're working with this. I would say one thing very clearly though, I'm very -- I think the outcome of having us be having more responsibility of our own research is a fantastic thing. I do believe by having more proprietary research will allow us to have more what I would call incremental and differentiated ideas. And so we look at this as an opportunity, we look at this as an opportunity to differentiate us. I do believe our scale gives us unique opportunities in this, too. So we will -- we are working this -- working on this, we're studying this. We look at this as not just an added expense of any magnitude, we're looking at this as a opportunity, and we're treating it as a opportunity. And we're having dialers with our clients. I would say in ecosystem, if I was never nervous about MiFID II and I've talked to regulators about this, we are worried about what the impact will be with some of the small cap companies that will -- are having trouble which we're hearing too many companies already and getting people to follow them. We had a conversation with our regulator yesterday about this. I'm also worried about can -- are we going to see the proper research for new companies. I'm not talking about the big giant IPOs that we are accustomed to, but the small IPOs that are quite small. So I think we have to see how MiFID II works out in the European environment for us to have a real strong opinion globally. But I think the trend will be as you clearly framed your question is probably movement towards that fiduciary standard worldwide. And we'll see how this plays out. We would like to think that over time, we have, as a whole ecosystem, regulators, the asset management side, the sell-side, we have a better understanding how this plays out. The key -- the most important point when you have these big giant regulatory issues, we need to make sure that we understand all the unanticipated changes and impacts on markets. And so I would -- we are constructive on this, but there could be some negative outcomes if it's not properly monitored and organized. The last thing I would just say related to what MiFID II will be, with greater transparency, first, that's great for investors. Investors -- one of my biggest worries, which I repeatedly said in these calls is my worry about retirement worldwide. I just finished a world tour. The amount of cash that individuals are holding in bank accounts in Japan, it's $5 trillion in banking, that's with negative returns; in Europe, it's huge amounts of money sitting in bank accounts. If we got to move some of these money into long-term investing because much of the savings is [indiscernible] retirement, we probably have even more dynamic economies worldwide. So clearly, more transparency ultimately should be good for the industry, but we have the industry as a transition to go through. And the last thing I would say with greater transparency, it will move more assets towards ETFs, and this is one of the big systems that I talked about in my prepared speech that I do believe these big changes are going to move more money to manage portfolios, to fee-based relationships that are going to drive more ETF flows."

So Bill, as it relates to, I think, you were referring to the fulcrum fee pricing model. I think that our view would be on this that as the industry continues to evolve due to a variety of issues, not the least of which are both regulatory and changing client trends, there are a number of active managers thinking about new ways to evolve fee structure. So we've seen a bunch of announcements of intentions to introduce a new performance-based model. I think we saw one change more recently in the United States, including the fulcrum fee, which is actually been in use in the U.S. for some time, but many of those details have yet to be rolled out or implemented. I think we continuously monitor pricing structures. We currently utilize both flat fee structures as well as performance-based fee structures across our product range. We're mindful of that. That was a big driver of our decision to restructure, reposition some of our active equity businesses in launch of the low-cost advantage suite earlier in the year. And as the landscape continues to evolve, we'll continue to explore a variety of structures, including fulcrum fees and other and frankly, other innovative structures to determine whether they're appropriate for our products, and most importantly, for clients. Your second question in terms of just the tonality of margin, I don't really think there's any change candidly, but I think we've been very clear historically that we don't manage the business to a margin, and we're trying to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. And I just wanted people to understand that not managing, the margin doesn't actually make people understand that we're not focused on margin. And so obviously, trying to make sure that we can do -- deliver the highest growth rates with the highest margins is something we're always focused on. And so I want to make sure people know that we are very margin-aware even though we might not be managing the business to a specific margin target at any point in time."

And we do believe that data, technology, risk management, it's going to continue to drive, hopefully, better financial literacy. It gets back to my, once again, my whole concept of financial literacy for better outcome investing. The organization that can provide that seamless information to get some of that money that's essentially been trapped in short term strategies into proper long-term investing, it would have a remarkable impact on the results for clients, remarkable impact to the society and remarkable impact to the companies that provide that. So I look at this is essential. And so, we will continue to be investing to be that one key leader for those events, and those opportunities."

The demand on opportunities that we see are greater than our ability to achieve. So you're correct in asserting that we see more opportunities or let me restate, potential opportunities. The key is for us is to focus on the opportunities that we think we can maximize with our platform, with our clients. I would say clearly over the last number of years, I would say clearly, for more than 10 years, we've been more right of those strategies so not -- this is why I personally spend so much time on strategy and positioning our firm. This is another reason why spend so much time with clients. I would clearly say loud and clear, 80% of our strategies have been led by what we are hearing from our clients, which is that they can have some type of technology from the solution, they want to have better understanding of ASG, they want to have better understanding of how they can integrate more infrastructure as a platform, how they can navigate the defined contribution plan and some form of glide path. So it is a big task in trying to making sure that we're focused on the right strategy. And what I would say, what Gary Shedlin and Rob Goldstein and really navigating the moment by moment types of issues surrounding there, they're constantly focused on eliminating some organizational inefficiencies. So I don't want to say we're perfect, and I don't want to say we don t constantly have to refresh ourselves because we do. We have to refresh ourselves to stay in front of the environment that we're operating, stay in front of our clients. And there are always inefficiencies, so I'm not trying to suggest we are solving all the problems, but if we have teams that are focusing on eliminating organizational efficiencies, we're making decisions by listening to the end clients, and we also believe what is necessary, Rob Kapito mentioned this earlier, we have to be closer to our clients and this is why the regionalization effort is so very important, so we can listen to our clients better. And then I would say, one of the great successes in picking our strategies has been the advent of the BlackRock investor institute by bringing all the thoughts together, hopefully to have better Alpha outcomes, but also bringing all that information flow into one platform to redistribute it really gives us great insight. And if that insight that helps us navigate the strategies that we are going to concentrate in. And I believe it's true that insight that has allowed us to have a better batting average in picking the right strategies to invest in the future."

As I said, the CIO office, we're going to have a lot more responsibility in the various platforms. And so that drives a lot of interest in Aladdin for Wealth Management. So we continue to believe that will continue to drive more opportunities. In terms of efficiencies, obviously, we've learned; a lot from the beginnings of our institutional Aladdin business. So there unquestionably, as we gain more clients, we are a more efficient platform. But Aladdin for Wealth Management is a considerably different platform. I mean, Aladdin for Wealth Management, we can have 10,000 users, and it's a very different platform and this is why I don't want to say Aladdin -- the institutional Aladdin business is going to create so many efficiencies for us as margin expansion as we utilize it for wealth management. We believe -- if we could penetrate more, and we see great opportunities for penetration, unquestionably overtime, there's more efficiencies, but let's possibly clear, much of the success around Aladdin for Wealth Management will drive more close to BlackRock. It's going to evolve. Let's be clear because I get tired of that question, Mike, that I was asked before related to technology. Our ecosystem is evolving. I think it's evolving very rapidly now. I think this low return environment is forcing clients more than ever before to focus on fees, to focus on relationships, to focus on how they want solutions to be provided. So you have a incredibly evolving ecosystem worldwide. At the same time, we're seeing a huge expansion of global capital markets. And less what we are seeing more utilization of more technology, on how technology is disrupting traditional things and changing the ecosystem even more rapidly. So the most important thing for us is to stay in front of it, to be helpful to all our clients and obviously, we're helpful for all our clients, we're going to win more share, with more share, we're going to drive better efficiencies. So efficiencies are important, so I'm not trying to dispute anything about it, we focus on efficiencies and I can tell you, Rob Goldstein and Gary Shedlin focus on that relentlessly, but it's more important that we stay in front of change as an organization. If we are a firm that space in front of change on behalf of our clients, our clients will award us more share of wallet."

It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release disc",1083,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
The breadth and scale of BlackRock's globally integrated investment and technology platform continue to drive strong business and financial results. The impact of the investments we have made over time and continue to make today are driving better alpha generation, fostering stronger client partnerships and allowing us to more efficiently operate our business. 
Total quarterly net inflows of $96 billion included long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth and were positive across client type, investment style and region. BlackRock has now generated over 5% long-term organic asset growth for 5 consecutive quarters. More importantly, we've achieved a long-term organic base fee growth rate of 5% for the last 12 months. Bear in mind, these long-term growth rates don't include the impact of our cash business, which has generated almost 10% growth over the last year. 
Record quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $5.92 both increased 15% versus a year ago. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.6%. Assuming no current year impact from potential future change in tax laws, we continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of discrete items that could arise in the future. 
Third quarter base fees rose 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's third quarter. Performance fees of $191 million increased $133 million from the prior year and $143 million sequentially, reflecting strong overall performance from our broad-based hedge fund platform and the impact of a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance and [indiscernible] annually in the third quarter. 
Technology and risk management revenue of $175 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management platforms. Demand remained strong across our full range of technology and risk management capabilities with both retail intermediaries and institutional clients increasingly focused on using technology to improve portfolio construction capabilities, optimize risk management and operate more efficiently. 
We continue to invest in technology and data initiatives across the firm to generate better alpha, more effectively service existing clients and leverage our global distribution capabilities. Whether investing through the income statement via inorganic opportunities like FutureAdvisor or Cachematrix or using our balance sheet to make minority investments in fast-growing businesses like Scalable Capital or iCapital, our goal is to drive profitable growth in both base fees and technology revenue. 
Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Direct fund expense was up $34 million or 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM and significant growth in our iShares franchise. G&A expense was up $51 million or 60% year-over-year, in line with previous guidance, reflecting higher technology and data spend. Current quarter G&A expense also reflected higher professional service fees, FX remeasurement expense and increased contingent consideration fair value adjustments versus a year ago. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. While we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, we are very margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We continue to execute our consistent capital management strategy during the quarter, repurchasing an additional $275 million in common shares and stand by our previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year.  
Third quarter long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth, were positive across client type, investment style and region. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $52 billion, representing 14% annualized organic growth with strength across both core and non-core exposures. In the 1 year since we repriced the core funds last October, BlackRock has recaptured more than 100% of the annual revenue impact of our investment, primarily through accelerated organic growth, and expanded our total U.S. market share of net flows by over 600 basis points. 
iShares equity net inflows of $33 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta funds. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $18 billion reflected a continued adoption of fixed income ETFs by a broader set of clients with flows led by treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion once again showcased the strength of our top-performing active platform and included $1 billion into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals, emerging market debt and total return strategies. Multi-asset flows were driven by $1 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. 
Our institutional business generated $16 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter, positive across index and active. Institutional index net inflows of $16 billion reflected $37 billion into fixed income, driven by significant client demand for LDI strategies, partially offset by equity outflows of $20 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation changes during the quarter. Modest institutional active net inflows were driven by strong multi-asset inflows, reflecting continued demand for our LifePath target-date series and factor strategies, partially offset by active equity outflows. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business saw $20 billion of net inflows during the quarter, reflecting several large client wins and reached its highest-ever level of AUM. BlackRock's third quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to invest on behalf of our clients and continued execution of our framework for shareholder value creation, differentiated organic growth, operating leverage and consistent capital return. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock generated strong results in the third quarter as our differentiated global investment and technology platform increasingly resonates with our clients, driving deeper partnerships than ever before. 
Over the past year, the market environment has improved considerably. We've seen greater political stability in Europe. China is continuing to show economic strength. And after a long period of stagnation, we're seeing consistent growth in Japan. Overall, the world has become much more resilient. However, large cash balances remain on the sidelines. And many global institutions are invested in assets with return profiles that are not expected to meet their liabilities over time, which is creating significant demand for asset allocation and investment strategies across multiple asset classes. 
In these times of greater economic certainty, there's also a greater need for people to be invested. And more than any time in history, clients are reaching out to BlackRock for advice and for solutions. We build customized solutions from our investment platform that spans index to illiquid alternatives. Our technology and risk management capabilities enable us and our clients to construct better portfolios, generate alpha more consistently, manage risks smarter and scale operations more efficiently. Combined with insights of a BlackRock Investment Institute, we are able to form stronger and more differentiated partnerships with our clients. And all of this is showing up in our flows. 
As Gary said, BlackRock saw third quarter total net inflows of $96 billion. These flows came from both institutional and retail clients across all major regions and investment styles. We've now seen a total of $264 billion of flows so far this year compared to $202 billion for all of 2016. As we deepen our relationships with clients and partners, we recognize and embrace the growing responsibility we have on a daily basis. It is an enormous responsibility, and we take this seriously. And we also attempt every day to achieve the responsibilities with our goals. 
Gary talked about our shareholder value creation framework and organic growth as a primary driver of that framework. Our strategy for growth is centered on being a fiduciary to our clients. This means investing to be a leader in the areas of high client demand and growth, like ETFs, like illiquid alternatives. It also means investing to generate differentiated alpha for clients and to enhance our competitive advantages in Aladdin and most importantly, technology and to grow our scale. With regulation, technology and market forces transforming the ecosystem for asset and wealth management globally, BlackRock is at the forefront of change in the industry and our focus remains on the long term for our clients worldwide. 
In the U.S., there are 2 major shifts converging in wealth management. First, in one of the largest asset movements, fee-based advisory assets are expected to double by 2020 in the shift from brokerage to fee-based accounts. The second, digital technologies are disrupting traditional wealth advisory practices, which create competition for client assets and provide leverage for fast-growing advisory practices. 
These trends have several major implications for our entire industry. Value for cost is critical to advisers and asset allocation decisions. Advisors are increasingly focused on managing risk and constructing portfolios. Chief Investment Officers are taking more control over asset allocation decisions. So there is a heightened focus on repeatable systematized processes that can be scaled. I guess, as backdrop, wealth managers are concentrating their business with fewer asset managers. Demand is increasingly for strategic partnerships beyond anyone's specific investment product. They're looking for partnerships with BlackRock that we can have ability to bring tremendous value to our relationships to our clients. BlackRock has the building blocks. BlackRock has the technology. And BlackRock has the expertise to guide clients on how to effectively use our scale. 
Our U.S. Wealth Advisory sales teams have adopted digital processes to scale and deepen financial adviser engagements. We increased engagements by 23% relative to the same time last year, in part by leveraging technology. We have held more than 15,000 virtual meetings this year from none 2 years ago, which has especially been productive for us to reach more advisers in our fast-growing independent channel. 
Our focus in investment in wealth management technology is aligned with our investment in the ETF ecosystem, which is increasingly driving our flows. We are creating new opportunities globally for clients to use ETF for asset allocation and alpha generation. We are developing new products. We're spending time on ETF education across the industry. And BlackRock is at the forefront of innovation in the ETF distribution side. 
The investments we have made in iShares are showing real-time results. For both the third quarter and year-to-date, iShares captured the #1 share of flows in the United States and Europe and globally. Usage has been increasingly across client types, from wealth clients seeking low-cost exposures in fee-based advisory models to insurers, asset managers, banks, pensions, sovereign wealth funds using ETFs alongside individual stocks, alongside bonds, futures swaps as a necessary component of their portfolios. 
We are similarly seeing growth across all of our key products segments. We've seen $58 billion of flows into fixed income ETFs over the past year and continue to see growth in our core, in our financial instruments, in our factors and our smart beta and ESG. In alpha-seeking strategies, we are focused on generating consistent performance for our clients. We believe the revitalization of our active equity platform this year will drive better client outcomes and future growth for BlackRock. We are seeing early signs of progress, with 81% of fundamental and 90% of scientific active equity assets are above our benchmarks or peer mediums now for 3 years. 
The growth that we are seeing across our platform is a direct result of the investments we made over time to position ourselves ahead of our client needs. We invested to build our infrastructure business, beginning with a lift-out of a small renewable team in 2011. Today, as a result of both organic growth and acquisitions, our global infrastructure team of nearly 150 professionals manages $16 billion of invested and committed assets across a diverse set of equity and debt infrastructure strategies. Last year, we invested $75 million into our iShares Core Series to drive growth at a time when we anticipated these significant changes in our ecosystem. With industry flows at record-highs, we have recaptured more than 100% of the revenue impact of our investment and grew our share flows from 25% in 2016, prior to our repositioning last October, to 41% market share over the past year. 
Technology is an increasingly significant growth driver for our business. Importantly, technology that enhances distribution and alpha generation is driving increased flows, our base fees and performance fees. And we were also growing our direct technology and risk management revenues, which increased by 15% year-over-year. One example of that tech investment is Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. 
After the idea was born out of an internal employee innovation competition, we quickly built into a business to drive value for our clients. Less than 2 years later, Aladdin Risk for Wealth has nearly 75 dedicated employees and 5 clients have gone live on our platform. Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management and other digital offerings and partnerships, like iRetire, FutureAdvisor, iCapital, Scalable Capital, are reaching tens of thousands of financial advisers, who manage assets on behalf of millions of end investors. As our digital offerings enable financial advisers to have a more productive conversation with our clients, they are driving more growth in our iShares and other BlackRock investment strategies. 
We invested in our cash management business both organically and through acquisitions to strengthen our platform, to leverage our scale and drive incremental growth. We've grown assets by 70% over the last 5 years without significantly increasing our expense base. In the third quarter, we saw $20 billion of net inflows into cash management strategy and now manage more than $400 billion in cash. Our long-term strategy of anticipating change and investing for growth is clearly working. Areas that we focus on today like factors, ESG, illiquid alternatives and digital wealth management are some of the areas that will definitely be driving growth for our future. 
It is critical that we continue to invest in these opportunities while being mindful of the impact of our bottom line. This will continue to position BlackRock as a right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future. No firm in our industry is better positioned to take advantage of the scale to invest in the future of our clients. This is and will be our biggest competitive advantage in building stronger relationships with our clients and driving growth in our business. If we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, BlackRock will remain positioned to deliver a differentiated growth and a differentiated financial result. And that's why we continue to believe in our future. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I don't know all the answers to that question because some of this is just being introduced today. But we expect significant growth opportunities for Aladdin. I feel very confident we're going to continue to have double-digit growth. In our core business, we were seeing great interest from institutional clients worldwide. It is still our biggest driver in that revenue column. What is very interesting also, we're seeing opportunities from existing Aladdin clients. Specifically in fixed income, we're now -- are now taking on Aladdin for equity. So we are now becoming a larger component with those clients that have already experienced the Aladdin environment. They have seen the success in terms of their own operation. And they're now expanding it into other asset categories. We're now seeing more interest from what I would say our core pension and insurance clients and from global asset managers throughout the world. So the foundational business is continuing to drive much of the success for Aladdin. And we expect that to continue and grow, as we've said, double digit. Provider Aladdin, we're in the testing phases right now, where we are -- Aladdin Provider has been put on to the custodial banks. We are working very closely with them on that. And ultimately, we believe that's not going to be -- -- obviously, it's a revenue driver as the custodian banks put it on. But let me also be clear on it, it creates greater efficiencies for us. By having Provider Aladdin, a seamless blockchain which is a private blockchain between us and our custodial relationships, it really creates a more seamless processing. And it should reduce many, many errors, let's assume. We have never -- we won't have any more errors, we do have some. If this is successful, we expect to expand that beyond BlackRock, and then use the Aladdin environment, all our clients to have that same type of a platform to utilize it. And then it would grow significantly. Aladdin for Wealth Management has a big future opportunity. As we've said, we have now won 5 clients. We're now implementing those 5 clients. The demand is significant. What we're so pleased, we have demand from Asia, we have demand from Europe and North America. So Aladdin for Wealth Management is a very well positioned for carrying that growth that we see."

And there's not obviously the immediate pressure related to MiFID II or of the likes if it in the United States than we have immediacy in Europe. So we're talking to our clients, we're working with this. I would say one thing very clearly though, I'm very -- I think the outcome of having us be having more responsibility of our own research is a fantastic thing. I do believe by having more proprietary research will allow us to have more what I would call incremental and differentiated ideas. And so we look at this as an opportunity. We look at this as an opportunity to differentiate us. I do believe our scale gives us unique opportunities in this, too. So we will -- we are working this -- working on this, we're studying this. We look at this as not just an added expense of any magnitude. We're looking at this as a opportunity and we're treating it as a opportunity. And we're having dialogues with our clients. I would say an ecosystem, if I was nervous about MiFID II and I've talked to regulators about this, we are worried about what the impact will be with some of the small cap companies that will -- are having trouble, which we're hearing too many companies already and getting people to follow them. We had a conversation with a regulator yesterday about this. I'm also worried about can -- are we going to see the proper research for new companies? I'm not talking about the big, giant IPOs that we are accustomed to. But the small IPOs that are quite small. So I think we have to see how MiFID II works out in the European environment for us to have a real strong opinion globally. But I think the trend will be, as you clearly framed your question, is probably movement towards that fiduciary standard worldwide. And we'll see how this plays out. We would like to think that over time, we have, as a whole ecosystem, regulators, the asset management side, the sell side, we have a better understanding of how this plays out. The key -- the most important point when you have these big, giant regulatory issues, we need to make sure that we understand all the unanticipated changes and impacts on markets. And so I would -- we are constructive on this, but there could be some negative outcomes if it's not properly monitored and organized. The last thing I would just say related to what MiFID II will be, with greater transparency, first, that's great for investors. Investors -- one of my biggest worries, which I repeatedly said in these calls, is my worry about retirement worldwide. I just finished a world tour. The amount of cash that individuals are holding in bank accounts in Japan, it's $5 trillion in banking, that's with negative returns; in Europe, it's huge amounts of money sitting in bank accounts. If we're going to move some of this money into long-term investing because much of the savings is towards retirement, we probably would've had even more dynamic economies worldwide. So clearly, more transparency ultimately should be good for the industry. But we, as the industry as a transition to go through. And the last thing I would say with greater transparency, it will move more assets towards ETFs. And this is one of the big systems that I talked about in my prepared speech, that I do believe these big changes are going to move more money to manage portfolios to fee-based relationships that are going to drive more ETF flows."

So Bill, as it relates to, I think, you were referring to the fulcrum fee pricing model, I think that our view would be on this that as the industry continues to evolve due to a variety of issues, not the least of which are both regulatory and changing client trends, there are a number of active managers thinking about new ways to evolve fee structure. So we've seen a bunch of announcements of intentions to introduce a new performance-based model. I think we saw one change more recently in the United States, including the fulcrum fee, which has actually been in use in the U.S. for some time. But many of those details have yet to be rolled out or implemented. I think we continuously monitor pricing structures. We currently utilize both flat fee structures as well as performance-based fee structures across our product range. We're mindful of that. That was a big driver of our decision to restructure, reposition some of our active equity businesses in launch of the low-cost Advantage suite earlier in the year. And as the landscape continues to evolve, we'll continue to explore a variety of structures, including fulcrum fees and other -- and frankly, other innovative structures to determine whether they're appropriate for our products and most importantly for clients. Your second question in terms of just the tonality of margin, I don't really think there's any change candidly. But I think we've been very clear historically that we don't manage the business to a margin and we're trying to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. And I just wanted people to understand that not managing to margin doesn't actually make people understand that we're not focused on margin. And so obviously, trying to make sure that we can do -- deliver the highest growth rates with the highest margins is something we're always focused on. And so I want to make sure people know that we are very margin-aware, even though we may not be managing the business to a specific margin target at any point in time."

In the core, we clearly have seen a group of clients who are significantly more focused on price than they are necessarily aftermarket liquidity, bid-ask spread or tracking error. And so for that segment of the world, we are obviously focusing a product significantly more focused on price. There's another segment of the marketplace that frankly is not necessarily long-term buy-and-hold. They're much more interested in tracking error. They're much more interested in making sure there's enough liquidity if they decide to get out in significant volume. And for that segment of the population, they are less focused on price and more on the other elements of the value proposition that the ETF brings to the table.

We did that already earlier this year in terms of really enhancing some of the regional coverage, enhancing our alts business and enhancing -- and really enhancing our global equity platforms. The demand on opportunities that we see are greater than our ability to achieve them. So you're correct in asserting that we see more opportunities -- or let me restate, potential opportunities. The key is for us is to focus on the opportunities that we think we can maximize with our platform, with our clients. I would say clearly over the last number of years, I would say clearly for more than 10 years, we've been more right on those strategies than not. This is why I personally spend so much time on strategy and positioning our firm. This is another reason why I spend so much time visiting clients. I would clearly say loud and clear, 80% of our strategies have been led by what we are hearing from our clients, wishes that they can have some type of technology point of solution. They want to have better understanding of ESG. They want to have better understanding of how they could integrate more infrastructure as a platform, how they can navigate the defined contribution plan in some form of glide path. So it is a big task in trying to making sure that we are focused on the right strategy. And what I would say, what Gary Shedlin and Rob Goldstein in really navigating the moment-by-moment types of issues around there, they're constantly focused on eliminating some organizational inefficiencies. So I don't want to say we're perfect. And I don't want to say we don't constantly have to refresh ourselves because we do. We have to refresh ourselves to stay in front of the environment that we're operating, stay in front of our clients. And there are always inefficiencies. So I'm not trying to suggest we are solving all the problems. But we have teams that are focusing on eliminating organizational efficiencies. We're making decisions by listening to the end clients. And we also believe what is necessary, and Rob Kapito mentioned this earlier, we have to be closer to our clients. And this is why the regionalization effort is so very important, so we can listen to our clients better. And then I would say one of the great successes in picking our strategies has been the advent of the [ BlackRock Investor Institute ] by bringing all the thoughts together hopefully to have better alpha outcomes, but also bringing all that information flow into one platform to redistribute it really gives us great insight. And it's that insight that helps us navigate the strategies that we are going to concentrate in. And I believe it's true that insight that has allowed us to have a better batting average in picking the right strategies to invest in the future."

And so that drives a lot of interest in Aladdin for Wealth Management. So we continue to believe that will continue to drive more opportunities. In terms of efficiencies, obviously we've learned a lot from the beginnings of our institutional Aladdin business. So that unquestionably, as we gain more clients, we are a more efficient platform. But Aladdin for Wealth Management is a considerably different platform. I mean, Aladdin for Wealth Management, we could have 10,000 users. And it's a very different platform. And this is why I don't want to say Aladdin -- the institutional Aladdin business is going to create so many efficiencies for us in margin expansion as we use to line it for wealth management. We believe if we could penetrate more and we see great opportunities for penetration, unquestionably over time, there's more efficiencies. But let's also be clear, much of the success around Aladdin for Wealth Management will drive more flows for BlackRock. It's going to evolve. Let's be clear because I could tie that question, Mike, with the question that I was asked before related to technology. Our ecosystem is evolving. I think it's evolving very rapidly now. I think this low return environment is forcing clients more than ever before to focus on fees, to focus on relationships, to focus on how they want solutions to be provided. So you have a incredibly evolving ecosystem worldwide. At the same time, we're seeing a huge expansion of the global capital markets. And also we are seeing the utilization of more technology and how technology is disrupting traditional things and changing the ecosystem even more rapidly. So the most important thing for us is to stay in front of it, to be helpful to all our clients. And obviously, if we're helpful for more of our clients, we're going to win more share. With more share, we're going to drive better efficiencies. So efficiencies are important. So I'm not trying to dispute anything about it. And we focus on efficiencies.

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
The breadth and scale of BlackRock's globally integrated investment and technology platform continue to drive strong business and financial results. The impact of the investments we have made over time and continue to make today are driving better alpha generation, fostering stronger client partnerships and allowing us to more efficiently operate our business. 
Total quarterly net inflows of $96 billion included long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth and were positive across client type, investment style and region. BlackRock has now generated over 5% long-term organic asset growth for 5 consecutive quarters. More importantly, we've achieved a long-term organic base fee growth rate of 5% for the last 12 months. Bear in mind, these long-term growth rates don't include the impact of our cash business, which has generated almost 10% growth over the last year. 
Record quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $5.92 both increased 15% versus a year ago. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.6%. Assuming no current year impact from potential future change in tax laws, we continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of discrete items that could arise in the future. 
Third quarter base fees rose 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's third quarter. Performance fees of $191 million increased $133 million from the prior year and $143 million sequentially, reflecting strong overall performance from our broad-based hedge fund platform and the impact of a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance and locks annually in the third quarter. 
Technology and risk management revenue of $175 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management platforms. Demand remained strong across our full range of technology and risk management capabilities with both retail intermediaries and institutional clients increasingly focused on using technology to improve portfolio construction capabilities, optimize risk management and operate more efficiently. 
We continue to invest in technology and data initiatives across the firm to generate better alpha, more effectively service existing clients and leverage our global distribution capabilities. Whether investing through the income statement via inorganic opportunities like FutureAdvisor or Cachematrix or using our balance sheet to make minority investments in fast-growing businesses like Scalable Capital or iCapital, our goal is to drive profitable growth in both base fees and technology revenue. 
Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Direct fund expense was up $34 million or 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM and significant growth in our iShares franchise. G&A expense was up $51 million or 16% year-over-year, in line with previous guidance, reflecting higher technology and data spend. Current quarter G&A expense also reflected higher professional service fees, FX remeasurement expense and increased contingent consideration fair value adjustments versus a year ago. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. While we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, we are very margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We continue to execute our consistent capital management strategy during the quarter, repurchasing an additional $275 million in common shares and stand by our previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year.  
Third quarter long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth, were positive across client type, investment style and region. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $52 billion, representing 14% annualized organic growth with strength across both core and non-core exposures. In the 1 year since we repriced the core funds last October, BlackRock has recaptured more than 100% of the annual revenue impact of our investment, primarily through accelerated organic growth, and expanded our total U.S. market share of net flows by over 600 basis points. 
iShares equity net inflows of $33 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta funds. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $18 billion reflected continued adoption of fixed income ETFs by a broader set of clients with flows led by treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion once again showcased the strength of our top-performing active platform and included $1 billion into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals, emerging market debt and total return strategies. Multi-asset flows were driven by $1 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. 
Our institutional business generated $16 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter, positive across index and active. Institutional index net inflows of $16 billion reflected $37 billion into fixed income, driven by significant client demand for LDI strategies, partially offset by equity outflows of $20 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation changes during the quarter. Modest institutional active net inflows were driven by strong multi-asset inflows, reflecting continued demand for our LifePath target-date series and factor strategies, partially offset by active equity outflows. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business saw $20 billion of net inflows during the quarter, reflecting several large client wins and reached its highest-ever level of AUM. BlackRock's third quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to invest on behalf of our clients and continued execution of our framework for shareholder value creation, differentiated organic growth, operating leverage and consistent capital return. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock generated strong results in the third quarter as our differentiated global investment and technology platform increasingly resonates with our clients, driving deeper partnerships than ever before. 
Over the past year, the market environment has improved considerably. We've seen greater political stability in Europe. China is continuing to show economic strength. And after a long period of stagnation, we're seeing consistent growth in Japan. Overall, the world has become much more resilient. However, large cash balances remain on the sidelines. And many global institutions are invested in assets with return profiles that are not expected to meet their liabilities over time, which is creating significant demand for asset allocation and investment strategies across multiple asset classes. 
In these times of greater economic certainty, there's also a greater need for people to be invested. And more than any time in history, clients are reaching out to BlackRock for advice and for solutions. We build customized solutions from our investment platform that spans index to illiquid alternatives. Our technology and risk management capabilities enable us and our clients to construct better portfolios, generate alpha more consistently, manage risks smarter and scale operations more efficiently. Combined with insights of the BlackRock Investment Institute, we are able to form stronger and more differentiated partnerships with our clients. And all of this is showing up in our flows. 
As Gary said, BlackRock saw third quarter total net inflows of $96 billion. These flows came from both institutional and retail clients across all major regions and investment styles. We've now seen a total of $264 billion of flows so far this year compared to $202 billion for all of 2016. As we deepen our relationships with clients and partners, we recognize and embrace the growing responsibility we have on a daily basis. It is an enormous responsibility, and we take this seriously. And we also attempt every day to achieve the responsibilities with our goals. 
Gary talked about our shareholder value creation framework and organic growth as a primary driver of that framework. Our strategy for growth is centered on being a fiduciary to our clients. This means investing to be a leader in the areas of high client demand and growth, like ETFs, like illiquid alternatives. It also means investing to generate differentiated alpha for clients and to enhance our competitive advantages in Aladdin and most importantly, technology, and to grow our scale. With regulation, technology and market forces transforming the ecosystem for asset and wealth management globally, BlackRock is at the forefront of change in the industry and our focus remains on the long term for our clients worldwide. 
In the U.S., there are 2 major shifts converging in wealth management. First, in one of the largest asset movements, fee-based advisory assets are expected to double by 2020 in the shift from brokerage to fee-based accounts. The second, digital technologies are disrupting traditional wealth advisory practices, which create competition for client assets and provide leverage for fast-growing advisory practices. 
These trends have several major implications for our entire industry. Value for cost is critical to advisers in asset allocation decisions. Advisers are increasingly focused on managing risk and constructing portfolios. Chief Investment Officers are taking more control over asset allocation decisions. So there is a heightened focus on repeatable systematized processes that can be scaled. Against this backdrop, wealth managers are concentrating their business with fewer asset managers. Demand is increasingly for strategic partnerships beyond any one specific investment product. They're looking for partnerships with BlackRock that we can have ability to bring tremendous value to our relationships to our clients. BlackRock has the building blocks. BlackRock has the technology. And BlackRock has the expertise to guide clients on how to effectively use our scale. 
Our U.S. Wealth Advisory sales teams have adopted digital processes to scale and deepen financial adviser engagements. We increased engagements by 23% relative to the same time last year, in part by leveraging technology. We have held more than 15,000 virtual meetings this year from none 2 years ago, which has especially been productive for us to reach more advisers in our fast-growing independent channel. 
Our focus in investment in wealth management technology is aligned with our investment in the ETF ecosystem, which is increasingly driving our flows. We are creating new opportunities globally for clients to use ETF for asset allocation and alpha generation. We are developing new products. We're spending time on ETF education across the industry. And BlackRock is at the forefront of innovation in the ETF distribution side. 
The investments we have made in iShares are showing real-time results. For both the third quarter and year-to-date, iShares captured the #1 share of flows in the United States and Europe and globally. Usage has been increasingly across client types, from wealth clients seeking low-cost exposures in fee-based advisory models to insurers, asset managers, banks, pensions, sovereign wealth funds using ETFs alongside individual stocks, alongside bonds, futures swaps as a necessary component of their portfolios. 
We are similarly seeing growth across all our key products segments. We've seen $58 billion of flows into fixed income ETFs over the past year and continue to see growth in our core, in our financial instruments, in our factors and our smart beta and ESG. In alpha-seeking strategies, we are focused on generating consistent performance for our clients. We believe the revitalization of our active equity platform this year will drive better client outcomes and future growth for BlackRock. We are seeing early signs of progress, with 81% of fundamental and 90% of scientific active equity assets are above our benchmarks or peer medians now for 3 years. 
The growth that we are seeing across our platform is a direct result of the investments we made over time to position ourself ahead of our client needs. We invested to build our infrastructure business, beginning with a lift-out of a small renewable team in 2011. Today, as a result of both organic growth and acquisitions, our global infrastructure team of nearly 150 professionals manages $16 billion of invested and committed assets across a diverse set of equity and debt infrastructure strategies. Last year, we invested $75 million into our iShares Core Series to drive growth at a time when we anticipated these significant changes in our ecosystem. With industry flows at record-highs, we have recaptured more than 100% of the revenue impact of our investment and grew our share of flows from 25% in 2016, prior to our repositioning last October, to 41% market share over the past year. 
Technology is an increasingly significant growth driver for our business. Importantly, technology that enhances distribution and alpha generation is driving increased flows, our base fees and performance fees. And we are also growing our direct technology and risk management revenues, which increased by 15% year-over-year. One example of that tech investment is Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. 
After the idea was born out of an internal employee innovation competition, we quickly built it into a business to drive value for our clients. Less than 2 years later, Aladdin Risk for Wealth has nearly 75 dedicated employees and 5 clients have gone live on our platform. Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management and other digital offerings and partnerships, like iRetire, FutureAdvisor, iCapital, Scalable Capital, are reaching tens of thousands of financial advisers, who manage assets on behalf of millions of end investors. As our digital offerings enable financial advisers to have a more productive conversation with our clients, they are driving more growth in our iShares and other BlackRock investment strategies. 
We invested in our cash management business both organically and through acquisitions to strengthen our platform, to leverage our scale and drive incremental growth. We've grown assets by 70% over the last 5 years without significantly increasing our expense base. In the third quarter, we saw $20 billion of net inflows into cash management strategy and now manage more than $400 billion in cash. Our long-term strategy of anticipating change and investing for growth is clearly working. Areas that we focus on today like factors, ESG, illiquid alternatives and digital wealth management are some of the areas that will definitely be driving growth for our future. 
It is critical that we continue to invest in these opportunities while being mindful of the impact of our bottom line. This will continue to position BlackRock as the right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future. No firm in our industry is better positioned to take advantage of the scale to invest in the future of our clients. This is and will be our biggest competitive advantage in building stronger relationships with our clients and driving growth in our business. If we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, BlackRock will remain positioned to deliver a differentiated growth and a differentiated financial result. And that's why we continue to believe in our future. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I don't know all the answers to that question because some of this is just being introduced today. But we expect significant growth opportunities for Aladdin. I feel very confident we're going to continue to have double-digit growth. In our core business, we are seeing great interest from institutional clients worldwide. It is still our biggest driver in that revenue column. What is very interesting also, we're seeing opportunities from existing Aladdin clients. Specifically in fixed income, we're now -- are now taking on Aladdin for equity. So we are now becoming even a larger component with those clients that have already experienced the Aladdin environment. They have seen the success in terms of their own operation. And they're now expanding it into other asset categories. We're now seeing more interest from what I would say are our core pension and insurance clients and from global asset managers throughout the world. So the foundational business is continuing to drive much of the success for Aladdin. And we expect that to continue and grow, as we've said, double digit. Provider Aladdin, we're in the testing phases right now, where we are -- Aladdin Provider has been put on to the custodial banks. We are working very closely with them on that. And ultimately, we believe that's not going to be -- obviously, it's a revenue driver as the custodian banks put it on. But let me also be clear on, it creates greater efficiencies for us. By having Provider Aladdin, a seamless blockchain which is a private blockchain between us and our custodial relationships, it really creates a more seamless processing. And it should reduce many, many errors, let's assume. We have never -- we won't have any more errors, we do have some. If this is successful, we expect to expand that beyond BlackRock, and then use the Aladdin environment, all our clients to have that same type of a platform to utilize it. And then it would grow significantly. Aladdin for Wealth Management has a big future opportunity. As we've said, we have now won 5 clients. We're now implementing those 5 clients. The demand is significant. What we're so pleased, we have demand from Asia, we have demand from Europe and North America. So Aladdin for Wealth Management is a very well positioned for carrying that growth that we see."

And there's not obviously the immediate pressure related to MiFID II or of the likes of it in the United States than we have immediacy in Europe. So we're talking to our clients, we're working with this. I would say one thing very clearly though, I'm very -- I think the outcome of having us be having more responsibility of our own research is a fantastic thing. I do believe by having more proprietary research will allow us to have more what I would call incremental and differentiated ideas. And so we look at this as an opportunity. We look at this as an opportunity to differentiate us. I do believe our scale gives us unique opportunities in this, too. So we will -- we are working this -- working on this, we're studying this. We look at this as not just an added expense of any magnitude. We're looking at this as a opportunity and we're treating it as a opportunity. And we're having dialogues with our clients. I would say an ecosystem, if I was nervous about MiFID II and I've talked to regulators about this, we are worried about what the impact will be with some of the small cap companies that will -- are having trouble, which we're hearing from many companies already and getting people to follow them. We had a conversation with a regulator yesterday about this. I'm also worried about can -- are we going to see the proper research for new companies? I'm not talking about the big, giant IPOs that we are accustomed to. But the small IPOs that are quite small. So I think we have to see how MiFID II works out in the European environment for us to have a real strong opinion globally. But I think the trend will be, as you clearly framed your question, is probably a movement more towards that fiduciary standard worldwide. And we'll see how this plays out. We would like to think that over time, we have, as a whole ecosystem, regulators, the asset management side, the sell side, we have a better understanding of how this plays out. The key -- the most important point when you have these big, giant regulatory issues, we need to make sure that we understand all the unanticipated changes and impacts on markets. And so I would -- we are constructive on this, but there could be some negative outcomes if it's not properly monitored and organized. The last thing I would just say related to what MiFID II will be, with greater transparency, first, that's great for investors. Investors -- one of my biggest worries, which I repeatedly said in these calls, is my worry about retirement worldwide. I just finished a world tour. The amount of cash that individuals are holding in bank accounts, in Japan, it's $5 trillion in banking accounts with negative returns; in Europe, it's huge amounts of money sitting in bank accounts. If we could have moved some of this money into long-term investing, because much of the savings is towards retirement, we probably would've had even more dynamic economies worldwide. So clearly, more transparency ultimately should be good for the industry. But we have -- the industry has a transition to go through. And the last thing I would say with greater transparency, it will move more assets towards ETFs. And this is one of the big systems that I talked about in my prepared speech, that I do believe these big changes are going to move more money to managed portfolios to fee-based relationships that are going to drive more ETF flows."

So Bill, as it relates to, I think, you were referring to the fulcrum fee pricing model, I think that our view would be on this that as the industry continues to evolve due to a variety of issues, not the least of which are both regulatory and changing client trends, there are a number of active managers thinking about new ways to evolve fee structure. So we've seen a bunch of announcements of intentions to introduce a new performance-based model. I think we saw one change more recently in the United States, including the fulcrum fee, which has actually been in use in the U.S. for some time. But many of those details have yet to be rolled out or implemented. I think we continuously monitor pricing structures. We currently utilize both flat fee structures as well as performance-based fee structures across our product range. We're mindful of that. That was a big driver of our decision to restructure, reposition some of our active equity businesses in launch of the low-cost Advantage suite earlier in the year. And as the landscape continues to evolve, we'll continue to explore a variety of structures, including fulcrum fees and other -- and frankly, other innovative structures to determine whether they're appropriate for our products and most importantly for clients. Your second question in terms of just the tonality of margin, I don't really think there's any change candidly. But I think we've been very clear historically that we don't manage the business to a margin and we're trying to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. And I just wanted people to understand that not managing to margin doesn't actually make people understand that we're not focused on margin. And so obviously, trying to make sure that we can do -- deliver the highest growth rates with the highest margins is something we're always focused on. And so I want to make sure people know that we are very margin-aware, even though we may not be managing the business to a specific margin target at any point in time."

And we've always said that we believe that if we execute our strategies properly that we could see expansion in margins. If we see great growth opportunities though, that we will look at that as a tradeoff. And as Gary said, that has not changed, so I'll leave it at that."

In the core, we clearly have seen a group of clients who are significantly more focused on price than they are necessarily aftermarket liquidity, bid-ask spread or tracking error. And so for that segment of the world, we are obviously focusing a product significantly more focused on price. There's another segment of the marketplace that frankly is not necessarily long-term buy-and-hold. They're much more interested in tracking error. They're much more interested in making sure there's enough liquidity if they decide to get out in significant volume. And for that segment of the population, they are less focused on price and more on the other elements of the value proposition that the ETF brings to the table. And so that segmentation, we talk about core, we talk about precision instruments, we talk about financial instruments.

And as I said in my prepared remarks, if we did not make those investments a few years back, we would not be in the position of really working with our clients and picking up considerable market share with our clients institutionally and in retail. And we look at this in a very competitive way. We believe our scale is a real advantage. And as Gary said, as our scale has increased, it gives us even a greater competitive advantage. And we do believe data, technology, risk management is going to continue to drive hopefully better financial literacy. It gets back to my -- once again, my whole concept of financial literacy for better outcome investing. The organization that can provide that seamless information to get some of that money that's essentially been trapped in short-term strategies into proper long-term investing, it would have a remarkable impact on the results for our clients, remarkable impact on society and a remarkable impact on the companies that provide that.

We did that already earlier this year in terms of really enhancing some of the regional coverage, enhancing our alts business and enhancing -- and really enhancing our global equity platforms. The demand on opportunities that we see are greater than our ability to achieve them. So you're correct in asserting that we see more opportunities -- or let me restate, potential opportunities. The key is for us is to focus on the opportunities that we think we can maximize with our platform, with our clients. I would say clearly over the last number of years, I would say clearly for more than 10 years, we've been more right on those strategies than not. This is why I personally spend so much time on strategy and positioning our firm. This is another reason why I spend so much time visiting clients. I would clearly say loud and clear, 80% of our strategies have been led by what we are hearing from our clients, wishes that they could have some type of technology [ point of ] solution. They want to have better understanding of ESG. They want to have better understanding of how they could integrate more infrastructure as a platform, how they can navigate the defined contribution plan in some form of glide path. So it is a big task in trying to making sure that we are focused on the right strategy. And what I would say, what Gary Shedlin and Rob Goldstein in really navigating the moment-by-moment types of issues around there, they're constantly focused on eliminating some organizational inefficiencies. So I don't want to say we're perfect. And I don't want to say we don't constantly have to refresh ourselves because we do. We have to refresh ourselves to stay in front of the environment that we're operating, stay in front of our clients. And there are always inefficiencies. So I'm not trying to suggest we are solving all the problems. But if we have teams that are focusing on eliminating organizational efficiencies. We're making decisions by listening to the end clients. And we also believe what is necessary, and Rob Kapito mentioned this earlier, we have to be closer to our clients. And this is why the regionalization effort is so very important, so we can listen to our clients better. And then I would say one of the great successes in picking our strategies has been the advent of the BlackRock Investor Institute by bringing all the thoughts together hopefully to have better alpha outcomes, but also bringing all that information flow into one platform to redistribute it really gives us great insight. And it's that insight that helps us navigate the strategies that we are going to concentrate in. And I believe it's through that insight that has allowed us to have a better batting average in picking the right strategies to invest in the future."

And so that drives a lot of interest in Aladdin for Wealth Management. So we continue to believe that will continue to drive more opportunities. The -- in terms of efficiencies, obviously we've learned a lot from the beginnings of our institutional Aladdin business. So that unquestionably, as we gain more clients, we are a more efficient platform. As -- but Aladdin for Wealth Management is a considerably different platform. I mean, Aladdin for Wealth Management, we could have 10,000 users. And it's a very different platform. And this is why I don't want to say Aladdin -- the institutional Aladdin business is going to create so many efficiencies for us in margin expansion as we utilize it for wealth management. We believe if we could penetrate more and we see great opportunities for penetration, unquestionably over time, there's more efficiencies. But let's also be clear, much of the success around Aladdin for Wealth Management will drive more flows for BlackRock. Both -- it's going to evolve. Let's be clear because I could tie that question, Mike, with the question that I was asked before related to technology. Our ecosystem is evolving. I think it's evolving very rapidly now. I think this low return environment is forcing clients more than ever before to focus on fees, to focus on relationships, to focus on how they want solutions to be provided. So you have a incredibly evolving ecosystem worldwide. At the same time, we're seeing a huge expansion of the global capital markets. And also we are seeing the utilization of more technology and how technology is disrupting traditional things and changing the ecosystem even more rapidly. So the most important thing for us is to stay in front of it, to be helpful to all our clients. And obviously, if we're helpful for more of our clients, we're going to win more share. With more share, we're going to drive better efficiencies. So efficiencies are important. So I'm not trying to dispute anything about it. And we focus on efficiencies. And I could tell you, Rob Goldstein and Gary Shedlin focus on that relentlessly. But it's more important that we stay in front of change as an organization. If we are the firm that stays in front of change on behalf of our clients, our clients will award us more share of wallet."

While our earnings release disc",1082,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2017. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
The breadth and scale of BlackRock's globally integrated investment and technology platform continue to drive strong business and financial results. The impact of the investments we have made over time and continue to make today are driving better alpha generation, fostering stronger client partnerships and allowing us to more efficiently operate our business. 
Total quarterly net inflows of $96 billion included long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth and were positive across client type, investment style and region. BlackRock has now generated over 5% long-term organic asset growth for 5 consecutive quarters. More importantly, we've achieved a long-term organic base fee growth rate of 5% for the last 12 months. Bear in mind, these long-term growth rates don't include the impact of our cash business, which has generated almost 10% growth over the last year. 
Record quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $5.92 both increased 15% versus a year ago. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.6%. Assuming no current year impact from potential future change in tax laws, we continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of discrete items that could arise in the future. 
Third quarter base fees rose 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's third quarter. Performance fees of $191 million increased $133 million from the prior year and $143 million sequentially, reflecting strong overall performance from our broad-based hedge fund platform and the impact of a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance and locks annually in the third quarter. 
Technology and risk management revenue of $175 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management platforms. Demand remained strong across our full range of technology and risk management capabilities with both retail intermediaries and institutional clients increasingly focused on using technology to improve portfolio construction capabilities, optimize risk management and operate more efficiently. 
We continue to invest in technology and data initiatives across the firm to generate better alpha, more effectively service existing clients and leverage our global distribution capabilities. Whether investing through the income statement via inorganic opportunities like FutureAdvisor or Cachematrix or using our balance sheet to make minority investments in fast-growing businesses like Scalable Capital or iCapital, our goal is to drive profitable growth in both base fees and technology revenue. 
Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Direct fund expense was up $34 million or 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM and significant growth in our iShares franchise. G&A expense was up $51 million or 16% year-over-year, in line with previous guidance, reflecting higher technology and data spend. Current quarter G&A expense also reflected higher professional service fees, FX remeasurement expense and increased contingent consideration fair value adjustments versus a year ago. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. While we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, we are very margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We continue to execute our consistent capital management strategy during the quarter, repurchasing an additional $275 million in common shares and stand by our previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year.  
Third quarter long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth, were positive across client type, investment style and region. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $52 billion, representing 14% annualized organic growth with strength across both core and non-core exposures. In the 1 year since we repriced the core funds last October, BlackRock has recaptured more than 100% of the annual revenue impact of our investment, primarily through accelerated organic growth, and expanded our total U.S. market share of net flows by over 600 basis points. 
iShares equity net inflows of $33 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta funds. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $18 billion reflected continued adoption of fixed income ETFs by a broader set of clients with flows led by treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion once again showcased the strength of our top-performing active platform and included $1 billion into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals, emerging market debt and total return strategies. Multi-asset flows were driven by $1 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. 
Our institutional business generated $16 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter, positive across index and active. Institutional index net inflows of $16 billion reflected $37 billion into fixed income, driven by significant client demand for LDI strategies, partially offset by equity outflows of $20 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation changes during the quarter. Modest institutional active net inflows were driven by strong multi-asset inflows, reflecting continued demand for our LifePath target-date series and factor strategies, partially offset by active equity outflows. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management business saw $20 billion of net inflows during the quarter, reflecting several large client wins and reached its highest-ever level of AUM. BlackRock's third quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to invest on behalf of our clients and continued execution of our framework for shareholder value creation, differentiated organic growth, operating leverage and consistent capital return. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock generated strong results in the third quarter as our differentiated global investment and technology platform increasingly resonates with our clients, driving deeper partnerships than ever before. 
Over the past year, the market environment has improved considerably. We've seen greater political stability in Europe. China is continuing to show economic strength. And after a long period of stagnation, we're seeing consistent growth in Japan. Overall, the world has become much more resilient. However, large cash balances remain on the sidelines. And many global institutions are invested in assets with return profiles that are not expected to meet their liabilities over time, which is creating significant demand for asset allocation and investment strategies across multiple asset classes. 
In these times of greater economic certainty, there's also a greater need for people to be invested. And more than any time in history, clients are reaching out to BlackRock for advice and for solutions. We build customized solutions from our investment platform that spans index to illiquid alternatives. Our technology and risk management capabilities enable us and our clients to construct better portfolios, generate alpha more consistently, manage risks smarter and scale operations more efficiently. Combined with insights of the BlackRock Investment Institute, we are able to form stronger and more differentiated partnerships with our clients. And all of this is showing up in our flows. 
As Gary said, BlackRock saw third quarter total net inflows of $96 billion. These flows came from both institutional and retail clients across all major regions and investment styles. We've now seen a total of $264 billion of flows so far this year compared to $202 billion for all of 2016. As we deepen our relationships with clients and partners, we recognize and embrace the growing responsibility we have on a daily basis. It is an enormous responsibility, and we take this seriously. And we also attempt every day to achieve the responsibilities with our goals. 
Gary talked about our shareholder value creation framework and organic growth as a primary driver of that framework. Our strategy for growth is centered on being a fiduciary to our clients. This means investing to be a leader in the areas of high client demand and growth, like ETFs, like illiquid alternatives. It also means investing to generate differentiated alpha for clients and to enhance our competitive advantages in Aladdin and most importantly, technology, and to grow our scale. With regulation, technology and market forces transforming the ecosystem for asset and wealth management globally, BlackRock is at the forefront of change in the industry and our focus remains on the long term for our clients worldwide. 
In the U.S., there are 2 major shifts converging in wealth management. First, in one of the largest asset movements, fee-based advisory assets are expected to double by 2020 in the shift from brokerage to fee-based accounts. The second, digital technologies are disrupting traditional wealth advisory practices, which create competition for client assets and provide leverage for fast-growing advisory practices. 
These trends have several major implications for our entire industry. Value for cost is critical to advisers in asset allocation decisions. Advisers are increasingly focused on managing risk and constructing portfolios. Chief Investment Officers are taking more control over asset allocation decisions. So there is a heightened focus on repeatable systematized processes that can be scaled. Against this backdrop, wealth managers are concentrating their business with fewer asset managers. Demand is increasingly for strategic partnerships beyond any one specific investment product. They're looking for partnerships with BlackRock that we can have ability to bring tremendous value to our relationships to our clients. BlackRock has the building blocks. BlackRock has the technology. And BlackRock has the expertise to guide clients on how to effectively use our scale. 
Our U.S. Wealth Advisory sales teams have adopted digital processes to scale and deepen financial adviser engagements. We increased engagements by 23% relative to the same time last year, in part by leveraging technology. We have held more than 15,000 virtual meetings this year from none 2 years ago, which has especially been productive for us to reach more advisers in our fast-growing independent channel. 
Our focus in investment in wealth management technology is aligned with our investment in the ETF ecosystem, which is increasingly driving our flows. We are creating new opportunities globally for clients to use ETF for asset allocation and alpha generation. We are developing new products. We're spending time on ETF education across the industry. And BlackRock is at the forefront of innovation in the ETF distribution side. 
The investments we have made in iShares are showing real-time results. For both the third quarter and year-to-date, iShares captured the #1 share of flows in the United States and Europe and globally. Usage has been increasingly across client types, from wealth clients seeking low-cost exposures in fee-based advisory models to insurers, asset managers, banks, pensions, sovereign wealth funds using ETFs alongside individual stocks, alongside bonds, futures swaps as a necessary component of their portfolios. 
We are similarly seeing growth across all our key products segments. We've seen $58 billion of flows into fixed income ETFs over the past year and continue to see growth in our core, in our financial instruments, in our factors and our smart beta and ESG. In alpha-seeking strategies, we are focused on generating consistent performance for our clients. We believe the revitalization of our active equity platform this year will drive better client outcomes and future growth for BlackRock. We are seeing early signs of progress, with 81% of fundamental and 90% of scientific active equity assets are above our benchmarks or peer medians now for 3 years. 
The growth that we are seeing across our platform is a direct result of the investments we made over time to position ourself ahead of our client needs. We invested to build our infrastructure business, beginning with a lift-out of a small renewable team in 2011. Today, as a result of both organic growth and acquisitions, our global infrastructure team of nearly 150 professionals manages $16 billion of invested and committed assets across a diverse set of equity and debt infrastructure strategies. Last year, we invested $75 million into our iShares Core Series to drive growth at a time when we anticipated these significant changes in our ecosystem. With industry flows at record-highs, we have recaptured more than 100% of the revenue impact of our investment and grew our share of flows from 25% in 2016, prior to our repositioning last October, to 41% market share over the past year. 
Technology is an increasingly significant growth driver for our business. Importantly, technology that enhances distribution and alpha generation is driving increased flows, our base fees and performance fees. And we are also growing our direct technology and risk management revenues, which increased by 15% year-over-year. One example of that tech investment is Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. 
After the idea was born out of an internal employee innovation competition, we quickly built it into a business to drive value for our clients. Less than 2 years later, Aladdin Risk for Wealth has nearly 75 dedicated employees and 5 clients have gone live on our platform. Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management and other digital offerings and partnerships, like iRetire, FutureAdvisor, iCapital, Scalable Capital, are reaching tens of thousands of financial advisers, who manage assets on behalf of millions of end investors. As our digital offerings enable financial advisers to have a more productive conversation with our clients, they are driving more growth in our iShares and other BlackRock investment strategies. 
We invested in our cash management business both organically and through acquisitions to strengthen our platform, to leverage our scale and drive incremental growth. We've grown assets by 70% over the last 5 years without significantly increasing our expense base. In the third quarter, we saw $20 billion of net inflows into cash management strategy and now manage more than $400 billion in cash. Our long-term strategy of anticipating change and investing for growth is clearly working. Areas that we focus on today like factors, ESG, illiquid alternatives and digital wealth management are some of the areas that will definitely be driving growth for our future. 
It is critical that we continue to invest in these opportunities while being mindful of the impact of our bottom line. This will continue to position BlackRock as the right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future. No firm in our industry is better positioned to take advantage of the scale to invest in the future of our clients. This is and will be our biggest competitive advantage in building stronger relationships with our clients and driving growth in our business. If we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, BlackRock will remain positioned to deliver a differentiated growth and a differentiated financial result. And that's why we continue to believe in our future. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I don't know all the answers to that question because some of this is just being introduced today. But we expect significant growth opportunities for Aladdin. I feel very confident we're going to continue to have double-digit growth. In our core business, we are seeing great interest from institutional clients worldwide. It is still our biggest driver in that revenue column. What is very interesting also, we're seeing opportunities from existing Aladdin clients. Specifically in fixed income, we're now -- are now taking on Aladdin for equity. So we are now becoming even a larger component with those clients that have already experienced the Aladdin environment. They have seen the success in terms of their own operation. And they're now expanding it into other asset categories. We're now seeing more interest from what I would say are our core pension and insurance clients and from global asset managers throughout the world. So the foundational business is continuing to drive much of the success for Aladdin. And we expect that to continue and grow, as we've said, double digit. Provider Aladdin, we're in the testing phases right now, where we are -- Aladdin Provider has been put on to the custodial banks. We are working very closely with them on that. And ultimately, we believe that's not going to be -- obviously, it's a revenue driver as the custodian banks put it on. But let me also be clear on, it creates greater efficiencies for us. By having Provider Aladdin, a seamless blockchain which is a private blockchain between us and our custodial relationships, it really creates a more seamless processing. And it should reduce many, many errors, let's assume. We have never -- we won't have any more errors, we do have some. If this is successful, we expect to expand that beyond BlackRock, and then use the Aladdin environment, all our clients to have that same type of a platform to utilize it. And then it would grow significantly. Aladdin for Wealth Management has a big future opportunity. As we've said, we have now won 5 clients. We're now implementing those 5 clients. The demand is significant. What we're so pleased, we have demand from Asia, we have demand from Europe and North America. So Aladdin for Wealth Management is a very well positioned for carrying that growth that we see."

And there's not obviously the immediate pressure related to MiFID II or of the likes of it in the United States than we have immediacy in Europe. So we're talking to our clients, we're working with this. I would say one thing very clearly though, I'm very -- I think the outcome of having us be having more responsibility of our own research is a fantastic thing. I do believe by having more proprietary research will allow us to have more what I would call incremental and differentiated ideas. And so we look at this as an opportunity. We look at this as an opportunity to differentiate us. I do believe our scale gives us unique opportunities in this, too. So we will -- we are working this -- working on this, we're studying this. We look at this as not just an added expense of any magnitude. We're looking at this as a opportunity and we're treating it as a opportunity. And we're having dialogues with our clients. I would say an ecosystem, if I was nervous about MiFID II and I've talked to regulators about this, we are worried about what the impact will be with some of the small cap companies that will -- are having trouble, which we're hearing from many companies already and getting people to follow them. We had a conversation with a regulator yesterday about this. I'm also worried about can -- are we going to see the proper research for new companies? I'm not talking about the big, giant IPOs that we are accustomed to. But the small IPOs that are quite small. So I think we have to see how MiFID II works out in the European environment for us to have a real strong opinion globally. But I think the trend will be, as you clearly framed your question, is probably a movement more towards that fiduciary standard worldwide. And we'll see how this plays out. We would like to think that over time, we have, as a whole ecosystem, regulators, the asset management side, the sell side, we have a better understanding of how this plays out. The key -- the most important point when you have these big, giant regulatory issues, we need to make sure that we understand all the unanticipated changes and impacts on markets. And so I would -- we are constructive on this, but there could be some negative outcomes if it's not properly monitored and organized. The last thing I would just say related to what MiFID II will be, with greater transparency, first, that's great for investors. Investors -- one of my biggest worries, which I repeatedly said in these calls, is my worry about retirement worldwide. I just finished a world tour. The amount of cash that individuals are holding in bank accounts, in Japan, it's $5 trillion in banking accounts with negative returns; in Europe, it's huge amounts of money sitting in bank accounts. If we could have moved some of this money into long-term investing, because much of the savings is towards retirement, we probably would've had even more dynamic economies worldwide. So clearly, more transparency ultimately should be good for the industry. But we have -- the industry has a transition to go through. And the last thing I would say with greater transparency, it will move more assets towards ETFs. And this is one of the big systems that I talked about in my prepared speech, that I do believe these big changes are going to move more money to managed portfolios to fee-based relationships that are going to drive more ETF flows."

So it's a very big growth area for us. We have, as you know, almost 1/3 of our people out in Europe. And we're going to continue to grow.

So Bill, as it relates to, I think, you were referring to the fulcrum fee pricing model, I think that our view would be on this that as the industry continues to evolve due to a variety of issues, not the least of which are both regulatory and changing client trends, there are a number of active managers thinking about new ways to evolve fee structure. So we've seen a bunch of announcements of intentions to introduce a new performance-based model. I think we saw one change more recently in the United States, including the fulcrum fee, which has actually been in use in the U.S. for some time. But many of those details have yet to be rolled out or implemented. I think we continuously monitor pricing structures. We currently utilize both flat fee structures as well as performance-based fee structures across our product range. We're mindful of that. That was a big driver of our decision to restructure, reposition some of our active equity businesses in launch of the low-cost Advantage suite earlier in the year. And as the landscape continues to evolve, we'll continue to explore a variety of structures, including fulcrum fees and other -- and frankly, other innovative structures to determine whether they're appropriate for our products and most importantly for clients. Your second question in terms of just the tonality of margin, I don't really think there's any change candidly. But I think we've been very clear historically that we don't manage the business to a margin and we're trying to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. And I just wanted people to understand that not managing to margin doesn't actually make people understand that we're not focused on margin. And so obviously, trying to make sure that we can do -- deliver the highest growth rates with the highest margins is something we're always focused on. And so I want to make sure people know that we are very margin-aware, even though we may not be managing the business to a specific margin target at any point in time."

If we see great growth opportunities though, that we will look at that as a tradeoff. And as Gary said, that has not changed, so I'll leave it at that."

And I think in every instance, what we're trying to do is to effectively evaluate the value proposition to an individual client from buying the product. In the core, we clearly have seen a group of clients who are significantly more focused on price than they are necessarily aftermarket liquidity, bid-ask spread or tracking error. And so for that segment of the world, we are obviously focusing a product significantly more focused on price. There's another segment of the marketplace that frankly is not necessarily long-term buy-and-hold. They're much more interested in tracking error. They're much more interested in making sure there's enough liquidity if they decide to get out in significant volume. And for that segment of the population, they are less focused on price and more on the other elements of the value proposition that the ETF brings to the table.

And just given the changes that are occurring within the industry, do you feel a need to accelerate or pick up the pace of investments versus what you've done historically?"

I mean, these are just a number of things that we're doing, not the least of which is planning for a new headquarters 6 years out and other things that are just kind of more business as usual. So I think there's no question that we are continuing to invest. Obviously, to the extent you have markets that cooperate with you, it makes some of those decisions a little bit easier. But I think as we've shown in prior years, we're trying to be very consistent with our investment spend, notwithstanding what markets are doing at any point in time because we do stay focused on the long term. And to the extent that basically we find ourselves trying to balance the tradeoff between growth and margin, we aggressively look to reallocate our resources in a way that allows us to do both at any point in time."

I think we have a unique competitive advantage. Because of those investments, it's clear to me that we need to continue to invest to be competitively in front of the needs of our clients and our competitors. And I do believe, as we position our technology, especially the investment technology to reach more clients, Aladdin for Wealth Manage to be on more desktops with more of the financial advisers, investing in alpha signals, in our scientific businesses, I believe it's critical for us to stay in front of these big, giant trends. And as I said in my prepared remarks, if we did not make those investments a few years back, we would not be in the position of really working with our clients and picking up considerable market share with our clients institutionally and in retail. And we look at this in a very competitive way. We believe our scale is a real advantage. And as Gary said, as our scale has increased, it gives us even a greater competitive advantage. And we do believe data, technology, risk management is going to continue to drive hopefully better financial literacy. It gets back to my -- once again, my whole concept of financial literacy for better outcome investing. The organization that can provide that seamless information to get some of that money that's essentially been trapped in short-term strategies into proper long-term investing, it would have a remarkable impact on the results for our clients, remarkable impact on society and a remarkable impact on the companies that provide that. So I look at this as essential. And so we will continue to be investing to be that one key leader for those events and those opportunities."

We did that already earlier this year in terms of really enhancing some of the regional coverage, enhancing our alts business and enhancing -- and really enhancing our global equity platforms. The demand on opportunities that we see are greater than our ability to achieve them. So you're correct in asserting that we see more opportunities -- or let me restate, potential opportunities. The key is for us is to focus on the opportunities that we think we can maximize with our platform, with our clients. I would say clearly over the last number of years, I would say clearly for more than 10 years, we've been more right on those strategies than not. This is why I personally spend so much time on strategy and positioning our firm. This is another reason why I spend so much time visiting clients. I would clearly say loud and clear, 80% of our strategies have been led by what we are hearing from our clients, wishes that they could have some type of technology [ point of ] solution. They want to have better understanding of ESG. They want to have better understanding of how they could integrate more infrastructure as a platform, how they can navigate the defined contribution plan in some form of glide path. So it is a big task in trying to making sure that we are focused on the right strategy. And what I would say, what Gary Shedlin and Rob Goldstein in really navigating the moment-by-moment types of issues around there, they're constantly focused on eliminating some organizational inefficiencies. So I don't want to say we're perfect. And I don't want to say we don't constantly have to refresh ourselves because we do. We have to refresh ourselves to stay in front of the environment that we're operating, stay in front of our clients. And there are always inefficiencies. So I'm not trying to suggest we are solving all the problems. But if we have teams that are focusing on eliminating organizational efficiencies. We're making decisions by listening to the end clients. And we also believe what is necessary, and Rob Kapito mentioned this earlier, we have to be closer to our clients. And this is why the regionalization effort is so very important, so we can listen to our clients better. And then I would say one of the great successes in picking our strategies has been the advent of the BlackRock Investor Institute by bringing all the thoughts together hopefully to have better alpha outcomes, but also bringing all that information flow into one platform to redistribute it really gives us great insight. And it's that insight that helps us navigate the strategies that we are going to concentrate in. And I believe it's through that insight that has allowed us to have a better batting average in picking the right strategies to invest in the future."

And your relative size there versus institutional seems like there's a great opportunity. I just wanted to see if you could either size that or where you are in maybe the penetration of that opportunity.

As that continues to scale up, are you -- do you kind of make progress on that opportunity, how that will play through efficiencies and through the operating leverage, given the model?"

Under a fiduciary standard rule, as I said, the CIO office is going to have a lot more responsibility in their various platforms. And so that drives a lot of interest in Aladdin for Wealth Management. So we continue to believe that will continue to drive more opportunities. The -- in terms of efficiencies, obviously we've learned a lot from the beginnings of our institutional Aladdin business. So that unquestionably, as we gain more clients, we are a more efficient platform. As -- but Aladdin for Wealth Management is a considerably different platform. I mean, Aladdin for Wealth Management, we could have 10,000 users. And it's a very different platform. And this is why I don't want to say Aladdin -- the institutional Aladdin business is going to create so many efficiencies for us in margin expansion as we utilize it for wealth management. We believe if we could penetrate more and we see great opportunities for penetration, unquestionably over time, there's more efficiencies. But let's also be clear, much of the success around Aladdin for Wealth Management will drive more flows for BlackRock. Both -- it's going to evolve. Let's be clear because I could tie that question, Mike, with the question that I was asked before related to technology. Our ecosystem is evolving. I think it's evolving very rapidly now. I think this low return environment is forcing clients more than ever before to focus on fees, to focus on relationships, to focus on how they want solutions to be provided. So you have a incredibly evolving ecosystem worldwide. At the same time, we're seeing a huge expansion of the global capital markets. And also we are seeing the utilization of more technology and how technology is disrupting traditional things and changing the ecosystem even more rapidly. So the most important thing for us is to stay in front of it, to be helpful to all our clients. And obviously, if we're helpful for more of our clients, we're going to win more share. With more share, we're going to drive better efficiencies. So efficiencies are important. So I'm not trying to dispute anything about it. And we focus on efficiencies. And I could tell you, Rob Goldstein and Gary Shedlin focus on that relentlessly. But it's more important that we stay in front of change as an organization. If we are the firm that stays in front of change on behalf of our clients, our clients will award us more share of wallet."
