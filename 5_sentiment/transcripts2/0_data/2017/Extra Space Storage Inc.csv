We executed at a high level and produced great results coming off 2015, the best year for storage. 
2016 same-store revenue increased 6.9%, and NOI grew 9.2%. FFO per share as adjusted increased by 23%. 
For the fourth quarter, same-store revenue growth was 5.2%, and we were able to decrease year-over-year expenses by 2.1%, resulting in NOI growth of 7.9%. 
FFO per share as adjusted increased by 18%. Our FFO growth was driven by property performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these tools to continue to grow shareholder value. 
As we expected, revenue growth moderated throughout 2016 as the benefit from growing occupancy went away and Street rate growth trended from peak levels to more historically normal levels by year-end. Despite the moderation, the fundamentals of the storage sector remained positive. While we saw a deacceleration of revenue growth in certain markets, we are also encouraged to observe reacceleration in other MSAs, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We continue to enjoy the benefits of a well-balanced, diversified portfolio and operational scale.
In the fourth quarter, we acquired 27 [ph] wholly-owned stores for a total purchase price of $316 million. This includes the buyout of a joint venture partner's interest in 11 stores, which we announced on our last call. 
For the year, we invested $1.1 billion in acquisitions. The large majority of these transactions were not broadly marketed and came from joint ventures, our third-party managed portfolio or through other relationships. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott Stubbs."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.05. The beat was the result of 3 factors: first, outperformance by our 2015 acquisitions including SmartStop and our CofO deals; second, timing of our Q4 2016 acquisitions that closed earlier than anticipated; and third, lower property and G&A expenses. 
For the year, FFO as adjusted was $3.85 per share, also exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.05. Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the year at 92%, an 80 basis point decrease from the end of 2015. This includes the impact of 6 expansion projects, which were completed during the quarter. Excluding the additional vacancy created in these 6 stores, our ending occupancy would have finished 20 basis points higher at 92.2%. 
During the quarter, we completed a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility. To date, we have drawn $662 million. The 5- and 7-year tranches have delayed draw features, and we will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt. The unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goals include having access to multiple types of capital, laddering our maturities and maintaining financial flexibility. This credit facility helps accomplish these goals.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2017. Our new same-store pool will increase by 168 stores for a new total of 732. We expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by an average of 50 basis points over the year.
For 2017, our acquisition guidance includes $325 million in wholly-owned stores. We also project $225 million in joint venture acquisitions with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. This results in total investment in 2017 of $400 million, approximately half of which is currently identified. 
Our guidance assumes the remaining balance be weighted to the back half of the year. Seller pricing expectations are still high, and we are committed to being disciplined in only transacting of prices that are accretive for shareholders. 
Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $4.15 to $4.24 per share. Our guidance includes $0.08 of dilution from our CofO stores and additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.16. 
I'll now turn the time back to Joe."

During 2016, there was significant focus on new supply and deacceleration of revenue growth. The effect these issues have on same-store NOI is an appropriate topic to focus on, but not to the exclusion of FFO growth and the overall health of the industry, but I will make a few comments on these areas of concern.
First, we are seeing new supply. This supply is generally concentrated in certain markets, but there are many other markets that have minimal new supply. We benefit from our highly diversified portfolio, which reduces the volatility of cyclical markets. Much of the new supply delivered early in the development cycle has had minimal or only temporary impact on our stores due to pent-up demand, and not one of our MSAs experienced negative revenue growth for the year. 
But our heads are not in the sand. We recognize that new supply may have greater impact as we get further into the development cycle and we have factored that into our guidance. 
Also, the development cycle has presented opportunities. We are adding new purpose-built assets in key markets. These stores are performing well and adding value to our portfolio. 
We are also managing many newly constructed assets on a third-party basis, which provide fee income, strengthen our brand and increase our scale. 
Second, demand is steady. Traffic to our stores, website and call center remains consistent, and our ability to capture customers is greater than that of the smaller operators. We expect 2017 same-store revenue growth and NOI growth in the 4% to 5% range, which we believe will be better than nearly all the other state sectors. 
Third, we have other tools that contribute to our FFO growth. We acquired almost $3 billion of assets in the last 2 years, and our CofO deals will add to our growth in the future. We will continue to acquire assets, but only if we can do so accretively given current capital and market conditions. We will expand our third-party management platform, and we will utilize the most advantageous forms of capital to grow the company and maintain a flexible balance sheet. This is the formula we have used to become the best returning REIT in the U.S. over the past 10 years, and we will continue to execute on this strategy in a disciplined and focused manner. 
Let's now turn the time over to Jeff to start our questions and answers session."

We've underwritten them conservatively. And performance to date has proven that out if you look at how our stores performed. We also have a target cap of 3% on the amount of dilution CofO stores will, in aggregate, contribute or detract from our performance, so we want to keep within that cap. And then the last thing I'd point out with respect to our appetite for CofO is we've executed a number of these deals in joint venture format, which both reduces the risk to us and increases our returns."

Our medium length of stay is 6 to 7 months, but our average length of stay is 14 months. So you have a group of units that are constantly churning to have a very short length of stay. So many of those customers never received a rate increase or received one rate increase, and some of those moved in below Street rates.

We executed at a high level and produced great results coming off 2015, the best year for storage. 
2016 same-store revenue increased 6.9%, and NOI grew 9.2%. FFO per share as adjusted increased by 23%. 
For the fourth quarter, same-store revenue growth was 5.2%, and we were able to decrease year-over-year expenses by 2.1%, resulting in NOI growth of 7.9%. 
FFO per share as adjusted increased by 18%. Our FFO growth was driven by property performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these tools to continue to grow shareholder value. 
As we expected, revenue growth moderated throughout 2016 as the benefit from growing occupancy went away and street rate growth trended from peak levels to more historically normal levels by year-end. Despite the moderation, the fundamentals of the storage sector remained positive. While we saw a deacceleration of revenue growth in certain markets, we are also encouraged to observe reacceleration in other MSAs, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We continue to enjoy the benefits of a well-balanced, diversified portfolio and operational scale.
In the fourth quarter, we acquired 27 wholly-owned stores for a total purchase price of $316 million. This includes the buyout of a joint venture partner's interest in 11 stores, which we announced on our last call. 
For the year, we invested $1.1 billion in acquisitions. The large majority of these transactions were not broadly marketed and came from joint ventures, our third-party managed portfolio or through other relationships.

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.05. The beat was the result of 3 factors: first, outperformance by our 2015 acquisitions including SmartStop and our CofO deals; second, timing of our Q4 2016 acquisitions that closed earlier than anticipated; and third, lower property and G&A expenses. 
For the year, FFO as adjusted was $3.85 per share, also exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.05. Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the year at 92%, an 80 basis point decrease from the end of 2015. This includes the impact of 6 expansion projects, which were completed during the quarter. Excluding the additional vacancy created in these 6 stores, our ending occupancy would have finished 20 basis points higher at 92.2%. 
During the quarter, we completed a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility. To date, we have drawn $662 million. The 5- and 7-year tranches have delayed draw features, and we will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt. The unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goals include having access to multiple types of capital, laddering our maturities and maintaining financial flexibility. This credit facility helps accomplish these goals.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2017. Our new same-store pool will increase by 168 stores for a new total of 732. We expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by an average of 50 basis points over the year.
For 2017, our acquisition guidance includes $325 million in wholly-owned stores. We also project $225 million in joint venture acquisitions with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. This results in total investment in 2017 of $400 million, approximately half of which is currently identified. 
Our guidance assumes the remaining balance be weighted to the back half of the year. Seller pricing expectations are still high, and we are committed to being disciplined in only transacting of prices that are accretive for shareholders. 
Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $4.15 to $4.24 per share. Our guidance includes $0.08 of dilution from our CofO stores and additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.16.

During 2016, there was significant focus on new supply and deacceleration of revenue growth. The effect these issues have on same-store NOI is an appropriate topic to focus on, but not to the exclusion of FFO growth and the overall health of the industry, but I will make a few comments on these areas of concern.
First, we are seeing new supply. This supply is generally concentrated in certain markets, but there are many other markets that have minimal new supply. We benefit from our highly diversified portfolio, which reduces the volatility of cyclical markets. Much of the new supply delivered early in the development cycle has had minimal or only temporary impact on our stores due to pent-up demand, and not one of our MSAs experienced negative revenue growth for the year. 
But our heads are not in the sand. We recognize that new supply may have greater impact as we get further into the development cycle and we have factored that into our guidance. 
Also, the development cycle has presented opportunities. We are adding new purpose-built assets in key markets. These stores are performing well and adding value to our portfolio. 
We are also managing many newly constructed assets on a third-party basis, which provide fee income, strengthen our brand and increase our scale. 
Second, demand is steady. Traffic to our stores, website and call center remains consistent, and our ability to capture customers is greater than that of the smaller operators. We expect 2017 same-store revenue growth and NOI growth in the 4% to 5% range, which we believe will be better than nearly all the other state sectors. 
Third, we have other tools that contribute to our FFO growth. We acquired almost $3 billion of assets in the last 2 years, and our CofO deals will add to our growth in the future. We will continue to acquire assets, but only if we can do so accretively given current capital and market conditions. We will expand our third-party management platform, and we will utilize the most advantageous forms of capital to grow the company and maintain a flexible balance sheet. This is the formula we have used to become the best returning REIT in the U.S. over the past 10 years, and we will continue to execute on this strategy in a disciplined and focused manner.

Now today's not the exact same market as that, but I would tell you I think it's going to take a pretty big event for everything to be negative for the year."

We executed at a high level and produced great results coming off 2015, the best year for storage. 
2016 same-store revenue increased 6.9%, and NOI grew 9.2%. FFO per share as adjusted increased by 23%. 
For the fourth quarter, same-store revenue growth was 5.2%, and we were able to decrease year-over-year expenses by 2.1%, resulting in NOI growth of 7.9%. 
FFO per share as adjusted increased by 18%. Our FFO growth was driven by property performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these tools to continue to grow shareholder value. 
As we expected, revenue growth moderated throughout 2016 as the benefit from growing occupancy went away and street rate growth trended from peak levels to more historically normal levels by year-end. Despite the moderation, the fundamentals of the storage sector remained positive. While we saw a de-acceleration of revenue growth in certain markets, we are also encouraged to observe re-acceleration in other MSAs, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We continue to enjoy the benefits of a well-balanced, diversified portfolio and operational scale.
In the fourth quarter, we acquired 27 wholly-owned stores for a total purchase price of $316 million. This includes the buyout of a joint venture partner's interest in 11 stores, which we announced on our last call. 
For the year, we invested $1.1 billion in acquisitions. The large majority of these transactions were not broadly marketed and came from joint ventures, our third-party managed portfolio or through other relationships.

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.05. The beat was the result of 3 factors: first, outperformance by our 2015 acquisitions, including SmartStop and our CofO deals; second, timing of our Q4 2016 acquisitions that closed earlier than anticipated; and third, lower property and G&A expenses. 
For the year, FFO as adjusted was $3.85 per share, also exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.05. Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the year at 92%, an 80 basis point decrease from the end of 2015. This includes the impact of 6 expansion projects, which were completed during the quarter. Excluding the additional vacancy created in these 6 stores, our ending occupancy would have finished 20 basis points higher at 92.2%. 
During the quarter, we completed a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility. To date, we have drawn $662 million. The 5- and 7-year tranches have delayed draw features, and we will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt. The unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goals include having access to multiple types of capital, laddering our maturities and maintaining financial flexibility. This credit facility helps accomplish these goals.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2017. Our new same-store pool will increase by 168 stores for a new total of 732. We expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by an average of 50 basis points over the year.
For 2017, our acquisition guidance includes $325 million in wholly-owned stores. We also project $225 million in joint venture acquisitions with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. This results in total investment in 2017 of $400 million, approximately half of which is currently identified. 
Our guidance assumes the remaining balance be weighted to the back half of the year. Seller pricing expectations are still high, and we are committed to being disciplined in only transacting of prices that are accretive for shareholders. 
Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $4.15 to $4.24 per share. Our guidance includes $0.08 of dilution from our CofO stores and additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.16.

During 2016, there was significant focus on new supply and de-acceleration of revenue growth. The effect these issues have on same-store NOI is an appropriate topic to focus on, but not to the exclusion of FFO growth and the overall heal",408,"Thank you, Scott. During 2016, there was significant focus on new supply and de-acceleration of revenue growth. The effect these issues have on same-store NOI is an appropriate topic to focus on, but not to the exclusion of FFO growth and the overall health of the industry, but I will make a few comments on these areas of concern.
First, we are seeing new supply. This supply is generally concentrated in certain markets, but there are many other markets that have minimal new supply. We benefit from our highly diversified portfolio, which reduces the volatility of cyclical markets. Much of the new supply delivered early in the development cycle has had minimal or only temporary impact on our stores due to pent-up demand, and not one of our MSAs experienced negative revenue growth for the year. 
But our heads are not in the sand. We recognize that new supply may have greater impact as we get further into the development cycle and we have factored that into our guidance. 
Also, the development cycle has presented opportunities. We are adding new purpose-built assets in key markets. These stores are performing well and adding value to our portfolio. 
We are also managing many newly constructed assets on a third-party basis, which provide fee income, strengthen our brand and increase our scale. 
Second, demand is steady. Traffic to our stores, website and call center remains consistent, and our ability to capture customers is greater than that of the smaller operators. We expect 2017 same-store revenue growth and NOI growth in the 4% to 5% range, which we believe will be better than nearly all the other state sectors. 
Third, we have other tools that contribute to our FFO growth. We acquired almost $3 billion of assets in the last 2 years, and our CofO deals will add to our growth in the future. We will continue to acquire assets, but only if we can do so accretively given current capital and market conditions. We will expand our third-party management platform, and we will utilize the most advantageous forms of capital to grow the company and maintain a flexible balance sheet. This is the formula we have used to become the best returning REIT in the U.S. over the past 10 years, and we will continue to execute on this strategy in a disciplined and focused manner.

I would think the pace of our investments in CofO deals will moderate probably significantly, but we're very comfortable with the deals we've had. We've done very full due diligence. We've underwritten them conservatively. And performance to date has proven that out if you look at how our stores performed. We also have a target cap of 3% on the amount of dilution CofO stores will, in aggregate, contribute or detract from our performance, so we want to keep within that cap. And then the last thing I'd point out with respect to our appetite for CofO is we've executed a number of these deals in joint venture format, which both reduces the risk to us and increases our returns."

Our median length of stay is 6 to 7 months, but our average length of stay is 14 months. So you have a group of units that are constantly churning that have a very short length of stay. So many of those customers never received a rate increase or received one rate increase and some of those moved in below street rates.

We executed at a high level and produced great results coming off 2015, the best year for storage. 
2016 same-store revenue increased 6.9%, and NOI grew 9.2%. FFO per share as adjusted increased by 23%. For the fourth quarter, same-store revenue growth was 5.2%, and we were able to decrease year-over-year expenses by 2.1%, resulting in NOI growth of 7.9%. FFO per share as adjusted increased by 18%. Our FFO growth was driven by property performance, accretive acquisitions, joint ventures, third-party management and an optimized balance sheet. We are focused on using all of these tools to continue to grow shareholder value. 
As we expected, revenue growth moderated throughout 2016 as the benefit from growing occupancy went away and street rate growth trended from peak levels to more historically normal levels by year-end. Despite the moderation, the fundamentals of the storage sector remained positive. While we saw a deacceleration of revenue growth in certain markets, we are also encouraged to observe reacceleration in other MSAs, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We continue to enjoy the benefits of a well-balanced, diversified portfolio and operational scale.
In the fourth quarter, we acquired 27 wholly-owned stores for a total purchase price of $316 million. This includes the buyout of a joint venture partner's interest in 11 stores, which we announced on our last call. 
For the year, we invested $1.1 billion in acquisitions. The large majority of these transactions were not broadly marketed and came from joint ventures, our third-party managed portfolio or through other relationships.

Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the year at 92%, an 80 basis point decrease from the end of 2015. This includes the impact of 6 expansion projects, which were completed during the quarter. Excluding the additional vacancy created in these 6 stores, our ending occupancy would have finished 20 basis points higher at 92.2%. 
During the quarter, we completed a $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility. To date, we have drawn $662 million. The 5- and 7-year tranches have delayed draw features, and we will access the remaining available term balances as needed to finance future acquisitions and to pay off debt. The unsecured facility further diversifies our capital structure and reduces our average interest rate. Our goals include having access to multiple types of capital, laddering our maturities and maintaining financial flexibility. This credit facility helps accomplish these goals.
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2017. Our new same-store pool will increase by 168 stores for a new total of 732. We expect the change in the same-store pool to positively impact our revenue growth by an average of 50 basis points over the year.
For 2017, our acquisition guidance includes $325 million in wholly-owned stores. We also project $225 million in joint venture acquisitions with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. This results in total investment in 2017 of $400 million, approximately half of which is currently identified. 
Our guidance assumes the remaining balance be weighted to the back half of the year. Seller pricing expectations are still high, and we are committed to being disciplined in only transacting of prices that are accretive for shareholders. 
Our full year FFO as adjusted is estimated to be $4.15 to $4.24 per share. Our guidance includes $0.08 of dilution from our CofO stores and additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.16.

During 2016, there was significant focus on new supply and deacceleration of revenue growth. The effect these issues have on same-store NOI is an appropriate topic to focus on, but not to the exclusion of FFO growth and the overall health of the industry, but I will make a few comments on these areas of concern.
First, we are seeing new supply. This supply is generally concentrated in certain markets, but there are many other markets that have minimal new supply. We benefit from our highly diversified portfolio, which reduces the volatility of cyclical markets. Much of the new supply delivered early in the development cycle has had minimal or only temporary impact on our stores due to pent-up demand, and not one of our MSAs experienced negative revenue growth for the year. 
But our heads are not in the sand. We recognize that new supply may have greater impact as we get further into the development cycle and we have factored that into our guidance. 
Also, the development cycle has presented opportunities. We are adding new purpose-built assets in key markets. These stores are performing well and adding value to our portfolio. 
We are also managing many newly constructed assets on a third-party basis, which provide fee income, strengthen our brand and increase our scale. 
Second, demand is steady. Traffic to our stores, website and call center remains consistent, and our ability to capture customers is greater than that of the smaller operators. We expect 2017 same-store revenue growth and NOI growth in the 4% to 5% range, which we believe will be better than nearly all the other state sectors. 
Third, we have other tools that contribute to our FFO growth. We acquired almost $3 billion of assets in the last 2 years, and our CofO deals will add to our growth in the future. We will continue to acquire assets, but only if we can do so accretively given current capital and market conditions. We will expand our third-party management platform, and we will utilize the most advantageous forms of capital to grow the company and maintain a flexible balance sheet. This is the formula we have used to become the best returning REIT in the U.S. over the past 10 years, and we will continue to execute on this strategy in a disciplined and focused manner. 
Let's now turn the time over to Jeff to start our questions and answers session."

Our median length of stay is 6 to 7 months, but our average length of stay is 14 months. So you have a group of units that are constantly churning that have a very short length of stay. So many of those customers never received a rate increase or received one rate increase and some of those moved in below street rates.

As a result, same-store NOI grew 9.2%, and FFO per share as adjusted increased by 20%. We saw positive year-over-year revenue growth in all MSAs. We also saw acceleration of revenue growth in several MSAs, including Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We are enjoying the benefits of a well-balanced, diversified portfolio, operational scale and the ability to achieve outsized growth from stores added to our platform. We continue to be disciplined on the acquisition front, and we are committed to transact only at prices that will provide long-term value for our shareholders. 
During the quarter, we added 2 wholly-owned storage and 2 joint venture storage for a total investment of $28 million. 
In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party platform, and we have a robust pipeline of additional storage, which we will manage under the Extra Space brand. These managed storage will provide us additional fee income, density in key markets, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities. Importantly, we are starting to see a more balanced mix of development and existing stores in our managed store pipeline.

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.04. Revenues were in line with expectations, and the beat was primarily driven by property operating expenses. Property taxes and payroll were lower than expected, and utilities and snow removal were below budget due to a mild winter. 
Our 2017 same-store pool increased by 168 stores for a total of 732. The change in the same-store pool added 110 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter, and we expect to benefit from the change in pool to average 50 basis points over the year. 
Same-store NOI benefited 220 basis points from the change in pool during the quarter. 
Beginning January 1, 2017, we have elected to exclude revenue and expenses related to connect reinsurance from our same-store numbers. This quarter, we are presenting the impact of this change in our Q1 supplemental financial information, which shows the results of our 2016 and 2017 same-store pools with and without [indiscernible] reinsurance. 
Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 92.2% with an 80 basis point year-over-year increase. We are -- we were able to push our rates to new customers approximately 3% to 4% during the quarter. We experienced positive net rentals each month and continue to see steady demand. 
In the first quarter, we did not access our ATM. Acquisitions and loan maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. At quarter end, we have drawn $300 million on the term loans with $350 million in remaining term debt available. The revolving portion of the credit facility had a balance of $337 million with $163 million available. Subsequent to quarter end, we swapped $300 million from fixed to variable -- from variable rate to fixed rate debt on a 5-year term tranche. 
We reaffirm our annual same-store revenue guidance of 4% to 5%. Due to the Q1 expense beat, we are lowering our annual expense guidance to 2.25% to 3.25%. As a result, we are increasing our annual NOI guidance to 4.25% to 5.75%. We also reaffirm our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million. The mix has changed slightly and now includes $325 million in wholly-owned stores and $190 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments, with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. Approximately $150 million is currently closed or identified. Our guidance assumes the remaining unidentified acquisitions will close in the third and fourth quarter. 
As a result of the Q1 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.21 to $4.29 per share. Our guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.15.

Revenue deacceleration from our core assets continues to flatten. We are seeing great performance from value-added acquisitions as they are integrated onto our platform. While we expect moderation in the back half of the year, we still expect stores to produce some of the best revenue growth in the real estate sector. We continue to monitor new supply in key markets to analyze its impact on our performance and to adjust operations at affected stores to minimize impact. While certain stores and markets have felt the impact of new development, it has not prevented us from experiencing positive revenue growth. Also, we are seeing reacceleration of revenue growth in some markets, including some that were on the front end of the development cycle. 
In addition to maximizing same-store operating performance, we continue to utilize other tools that enhance FFO. We are focused on building our third-party management portfolio and pursuing high-yielding redevelopment and expansion opportunities at our existing stores. Such efforts, together with our solid operations, should lead to another strong year of FFO growth.

We gained occupancy, grew street rates and increased same-store revenue by 5.8%. We demonstrated great expense control with a 2% decrease in same-store expenses. As a result, same-store NOI grew 9.2%, and FFO per share as adjusted increased by 20%. We saw positive year-over-year revenue growth in all MSAs. We also saw acceleration of revenue growth in several MSAs, including Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We are enjoying the benefits of a well-balanced, diversified portfolio, operational scale and the ability to achieve outsized growth from stores added to our platform. We continue to be disciplined on the acquisition front, and we are committed to transact only at prices that will provide long-term value for our shareholders.
During the quarter, we added 2 wholly-owned stores and 2 joint venture stores for a total investment of $28 million.
In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party platform, and we have a robust pipeline of additional stores, which we will manage under the Extra Space brand. These managed stores will provide us additional fee income, density in key markets, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities. Importantly, we are starting to see a more balanced mix of development and existing stores in our managed store pipeline.

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.04. Revenues were in line with expectations, and the beat was primarily driven by property operating expenses. Property taxes and payroll were lower than expected, and utilities and snow removal were below budget due to a mild winter.
Our 2017 same-store pool increased by 168 stores for a total of 732. The change in the same-store pool added 110 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter, and we expect to benefit from the change in pool to average 50 basis points over the year.
Same-store NOI benefited 220 basis points from the change in pool during the quarter.
Beginning January 1, 2017, we have elected to exclude revenue and expenses related to tenant reinsurance from our same-store numbers. This quarter, we are presenting the impact of this change in our Q1 supplemental financial information, which shows the results of our 2016 and 2017 same-store pools with and without tenant reinsurance.
Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 92.2% with an 80 basis point year-over-year increase. We were able to push our rates to new customers approximately 3% to 4% during the quarter. We experienced positive net rentals each month and continue to see steady demand.
In the first quarter, we did not access our ATM. Acquisitions and loan maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. At quarter end, we have drawn $300 million on the term loans with $350 million in remaining term debt available. The revolving portion of the credit facility had a balance of $337 million with $163 million available. Subsequent to quarter end, we swapped $300 million from fixed to variable -- from variable rate to fixed rate debt on a 5-year term tranche.
We reaffirm our annual same-store revenue guidance of 4% to 5%. Due to the Q1 expense beat, we are lowering our annual expense guidance to 2.25% to 3.25%. As a result, we are increasing our annual NOI guidance to 4.25% to 5.75%. We also reaffirm our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million. The mix has changed slightly and now includes $325 million in wholly-owned stores and $190 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments, with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. Approximately $150 million is currently closed or identified. Our guidance assumes the remaining unidentified acquisitions will close in the third and fourth quarter.
As a result of the Q1 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.21 to $4.29 per share. Our guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.15.

Revenue deceleration from our core assets continues to flatten. We are seeing great performance from value-added acquisitions as they are integrated onto our platform. While we expect moderation in the back half of the year, we still expect stores to produce some of the best revenue growth in the real estate sector. We continue to monitor new supply in key markets to analyze its impact on our performance and to adjust operations at affected stores to minimize impact. While certain stores and markets have felt the impact of new development, it has not prevented us from experiencing positive revenue growth. Also, we are seeing reacceleration of revenue growth in some markets, including some that were on the front end of the development cycle.
In addition to maximizing same-store operating performance, we continue to utilize other tools that enhance FFO. We are focused on building our third-party management portfolio and pursuing high-yielding redevelopment and expansion opportunities at our existing stores. Such efforts, together with our solid operations, should lead to another strong year of FFO growth.

It's about $175 million worth of projects, double-digit returns, and we'll continue to try to push more projects into that pipeline. The difficult part -- the difficult question to answer is timing because many of these involve getting some type of entitlements, and it's difficult to predict how long that will take in all the different jurisdictions."

We gained occupancy, grew street rates and increased same-store revenue by 5.8%. We demonstrated great expense control with a 2% decrease in same-store expenses. As a result, same-store NOI grew 9.2%, and FFO per share as adjusted increased by 20%. We saw positive year-over-year revenue growth in all MSAs. We also saw acceleration of revenue growth in several MSAs, including Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We are enjoying the benefits of a well-balanced, diversified portfolio, operational scale and the ability to achieve outsized growth from stores added to our platform. We continue to be disciplined on the acquisition front, and we are committed to transact only at prices that will provide long-term value for our shareholders.
During the quarter, we added 2 wholly-owned stores and 2 joint venture stores for a total investment of $28 million.
In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party platform, and we have a robust pipeline of additional stores, which we will manage under the Extra Space brand. These managed stores will provide us additional fee income, density in key markets, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities. Importantly, we are starting to see a more balanced mix of development and existing stores in our managed store pipeline.

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.04. Revenues were in line with expectations, and the beat was primarily driven by property operating expenses. Property taxes and payroll were lower than expected, and utilities and snow removal were below budget due to a mild winter.
Our 2017 same-store pool increased by 168 stores for a total of 732. The change in the same-store pool added 110 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter, and we expect a benefit from the change in pool to average 50 basis points over the year.
Same-store NOI benefited 220 basis points from the change in pool during the quarter.
Beginning January 1, 2017, we have elected to exclude revenue and expenses related to tenant reinsurance from our same-store numbers. This quarter, we are presenting the impact of this change in our Q1 supplemental financial information, which shows the results of our 2016 and 2017 same-store pools with and without tenant reinsurance.
Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 92.2% with an 80 basis point year-over-year increase. We were able to push our rates to new customers approximately 3% to 4% during the quarter. We experienced positive net rentals each month and continue to see steady demand.
In the first quarter, we did not access our ATM. Acquisitions and loan maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. At quarter end, we had drawn $300 million on the term loans with $350 million in remaining term debt available. The revolving portion of the credit facility had a balance of $337 million with $163 million available. Subsequent to quarter end, we swapped $300 million from fixed to variable -- from variable rate to fixed rate debt on the 5-year term tranche.
We reaffirm our annual same-store revenue guidance of 4% to 5%. Due to the Q1 expense beat, we are lowering our annual expense guidance to 2.25% to 3.25%. As a result, we are increasing our annual NOI guidance to 4.25% to 5.75%. We also reaffirm our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million. The mix has changed slightly and now includes $325 million in wholly-owned stores and $190 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments, with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. Approximately $150 million is currently closed or identified. Our guidance assumes the remaining unidentified acquisitions will close in the third and fourth quarter.
As a result of the Q1 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.21 to $4.29 per share. Our guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.15.
I'll now turn the time back to Joe."

We had a solid first quarter with growth in rates, rentals and occupancy, and we are well positioned heading into our busy season. Revenue deacceleration from our core assets continues to flatten, and we are seeing great performance from value-added acquisitions as they are integrated onto our platform. While we expect moderation in the back half of the year, we still expect stores to produce some of the best revenue growth in the real estate sector. We continue to monitor new supply in key markets to analyze its impact on our performance and to adjust operations at affected stores to minimize impact. While certain stores and markets have felt the impact of new development, it has not prevented us from experiencing positive revenue growth. Also, we are seeing reacceleration of revenue growth in some markets, including some that were on the front end of the development cycle.
In addition to maximizing same-store operating performance, we continue to utilize other tools that enhance FFO. We are focused on building our third-party management portfolio and pursuing high-yielding redevelopment and expansion opportunities at our existing stores. Such efforts, together with our solid operations, should lead to another strong year of FFO growth.

We gained occupancy, grew street rates and increased same-store revenue by 5.8%. We demonstrated great expense control with a 2% decrease in same-store expenses. As a result, same-store NOI grew 9.2%, and FFO per share as adjusted increased by 20%. We saw positive year-over-year revenue growth in all MSAs. We also saw acceleration of revenue growth in several MSAs, including Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia, demonstrating the cyclical nature of markets. We are enjoying the benefits of a well-balanced, diversified portfolio, operational scale and the ability to achieve outsized growth from stores added to our platform. We continue to be disciplined on the acquisition front, and we are committed to transact only at prices that will provide long-term value for our shareholders.
During the quarter, we added 2 wholly-owned stores and 2 joint venture stores for a total investment of $28 million.
In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party platform, and we have a robust pipeline of additional stores, which we will manage under the Extra Space brand. These managed stores will provide us additional fee income, density in key markets, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities. Importantly, we are starting to see a more balanced mix of development and existing stores in our managed store pipeline.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.04. Revenues were in line with expectations, and the beat was primarily driven by property operating expenses. Property taxes and payroll",468,"Thanks, Joe. Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.03 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.04. Revenues were in line with expectations, and the beat was primarily driven by property operating expenses. Property taxes and payroll were lower than expected, and utilities and snow removal were below budget due to a mild winter.
Our 2017 same-store pool increased by 168 stores for a total of 732. The change in the same-store pool added 110 basis points to revenue growth in the quarter, and we expect a benefit from the change in pool to average 50 basis points over the year.
Same-store NOI benefited 220 basis points from the change in pool during the quarter.
Beginning January 1, 2017, we have elected to exclude revenue and expenses related to tenant reinsurance from our same-store numbers. This quarter, we are presenting the impact of this change in our Q1 supplemental financial information, which shows the results of our 2016 and 2017 same-store pools with and without tenant reinsurance.
Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 92.2% with an 80 basis point year-over-year increase. We were able to push our rates to new customers approximately 3% to 4% during the quarter. We experienced positive net rentals each month and continue to see steady demand.
In the first quarter, we did not access our ATM. Acquisitions and loan maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. At quarter end, we had drawn $300 million on the term loans with $350 million in remaining term debt available. The revolving portion of the credit facility had a balance of $337 million with $163 million available. Subsequent to quarter end, we swapped $300 million from fixed to variable -- from variable rate to fixed rate debt on the 5-year term tranche.
We reaffirm our annual same-store revenue guidance of 4% to 5%. Due to the Q1 expense beat, we are lowering our annual expense guidance to 2.25% to 3.25%. As a result, we are increasing our annual NOI guidance to 4.25% to 5.75%. We also reaffirm our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million. The mix has changed slightly and now includes $325 million in wholly-owned stores and $190 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments, with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. Approximately $150 million is currently closed or identified. Our guidance assumes the remaining unidentified acquisitions will close in the third and fourth quarter.
As a result of the Q1 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.21 to $4.29 per share. Our guidance includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.15.
I'll now turn the time back to Joe."

We had a solid first quarter with growth in rates, rentals and occupancy, and we are well positioned heading into our busy season. Revenue deacceleration from our core assets continues to flatten, and we are seeing great performance from value-added acquisitions as they are integrated onto our platform. While we expect moderation in the back half of the year, we still expect stores to produce some of the best revenue growth in the real estate sector. We continue to monitor new supply in key markets to analyze its impact on our performance and to adjust operations at affected stores to minimize impact. While certain stores and markets have felt the impact of new development, it has not prevented us from experiencing positive revenue growth. Also, we are seeing reacceleration of revenue growth in some markets, including some that were on the front end of the development cycle.
In addition to maximizing same-store operating performance, we continue to utilize other tools that enhance FFO. We are focused on building our third-party management portfolio and pursuing high-yielding redevelopment and expansion opportunities at our existing stores. Such efforts, together with our solid operations, should lead to another strong year of FFO growth.

We had another solid quarter, we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year. In the quarter, we saw healthy demand steady [indiscernible] volume, which outpaced that of second quarter 2016. We maintained our same-store occupancy GAAP and ended the quarter at 94.4%, 70 basis points ahead of where we were 2016. We were also able to grow [, street rates ] which together with our occupancy gains, increased same-store revenue of 5.2%. We demonstrated great expense control with a 1.1% decrease in same-store expenses. As a result, same-store NOI grew 7.7%. We also saw growth outside of our same-store pool, which contributed to an increase of 16% in the FFO per share as adjusted.
All of our market share positive revenue growth, with the exception of Houston which was effectively flat. The markets in the western states continue to perform particularly well, [indiscernible] with revenue growth in high single-digit. Our top MSA's have been affected differently by the current development cycle, and we believe that we continue to benefit from our highly diversified portfolio.
In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party management platform, bringing the total additions to 54 for the year. These managed stores providers additional fee income, density in key markets, efficiencies in skill, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities.
We recently held our 2017 Partners Conference in Park City, Utah, where over 150 partners joined us for a few days of meetings. This is the best turnout in the history in our managed pipeline for the next 6 months is the largest it has ever been.
However, we were recently informed that one of our partners, Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, has decided to internalize management, and it's 94 stores will be needing Extra Space's assistance, effective October 1. While the loss of these stories unfortunate, we have over 100 properties scheduled to be added in the back half of 2017, the majority of which are in higher rent per square foot markets than the managed SmartStop properties.
For example, we added an 11-store portfolio in New York City just last week. We remain enthusiastic about our third-party management platform, and expect it to continue to be a valuable part of our growth strategy. I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.09 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.03. The [ beat ] was the result of property performance, tenant reinsurance and management fees. Repairs and maintenance, payroll and insurance have been lower than expected and contributed to the expense [. beat ] We also incurred a onetime $6 million loss, related to the write-down on 3 parcels of land, 2 of which are under contract for sale. Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 94.4%, a 70 basis points year-over-year increase. While occupancy is just 1 driver of revenue, we are encouraged by the strong rental activity and the peak occupancy levels we are seeing this summer. We were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single digits during the quarter, and discounts, while up year-over-year, remain at levels below historical norms. We continue our existing customer rent increase program without changes.
During the quarter, we did not access our ATM, acquisitions and loan maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. We also completed a 10 year $300 million Private placement at 3.95%. The notes have a delayed-draw feature, and it will be issued on August 24. The private placement proceeds will be used to finance acquisitions, loan maturities and to pay down revolving balances. These notes help us achieve our goals of increasing our average debt term, our fixed rate debt ratio and the size of our unsecured pool.
Based on the performance year-to-date, we raised the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 5%. We lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.75% to 2.5%. As a result, our annual NOI guidance increased to 4.75% to 6%. We reaffirmed our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million, comprised of 325 of wholly-owned stores and $200 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. Approximately $200 million is currently closed or under agreement. We are in discussions on several other acquisition opportunities and our guidance assumes the remaining $200 million will close late in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.
As a result of the Q2 beats, we're increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.25 to $4.32 per share. This includes the Q4 impact of losing that managed much SmartStop. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value add acquisitions for a total of $0.15. I'll now turn the time back over to Joe."

Coming in to 2017, we received many questions related to demand, new supply, external growth in our ability to increase revenue and FFO. We're more than halfway 2017, and to a very large extent, our predictions related to these topics have been accurate. First, the management's been steady, stable demand has led to positive growth the rates, rentals and occupancy, resulting in a solid revenue growth. The rate of our revenue growth is moderated since the beginning of the year, and as our guidance implies, will moderate further in the second half of the year. 
However, our systems have proved adept at adjusting rate occupancy discounts and marketing spend, to maximize revenue in the current environment. Despite headwinds and difficult comps, we still expect storage to produce some of the best revenue growth among weeks, and we expect to [ lead ] the path in this sector. 
Second, [, re-supply ] while present, has been manageable so far. Several markets have felt the impact of new development, while others have remained relatively immune. Most markets continue to see revenue growth, and our performance continues to meet solid due to our diversified portfolio. Construction pipelines have been pushed back, these projects are taking longer to get done, and the fallout rate of projects and planning remains significant.
Third, we will have both challenges and opportunities related to external growth. Pricing for marketed acquisition remains at elevated levels, deals volume is down significantly, and we have not seen sufficient long-term value to increase our bids and meet acquisitions. Most acquisitions have come from existing relationships rather than the open market. However, our predictions that we could see an increasing demand for third-party management has come to fruition, and we expect our pipeline to remain mobilized. 
Finally, we continue to produce outsized FFO growth. Our sector leading same-store performance together with accretive acquisitions, tenant insurance, third-party management and an efficient balance sheet have resulted in another strong quarter of FFO as adjusted growth of 16%. We are focused on being responsible stewards of our shareholders capital and providing the best long-term return on that capital in the sector. Let's now turn the time over to Jeff to start the question-and-answer session."

We had another solid quarter, and we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year. In the quarter, we saw healthy demand and steady rental volume, which outpaced that of second quarter 2016. We maintained our same-store occupancy GAAP and ended the quarter at 94.4%, 70 basis points ahead of where we were in 2016. We were also able to grow street rates, which together with our occupancy gains, increased same-store revenue 5.2%. We demonstrated great expense control with a 1.1% decrease in same-store expenses. As a result, same-store NOI grew 7.7%. We also saw growth outside of our same-store pool, which contributed to an increase of 16% in FFO per share as adjusted.
 
All of our market showed positive revenue growth with the exception of Houston, which was effectively flat. The markets in the western states continued to perform particularly well, many with revenue growth in the high single digit. Our top MSA's have been affected differently by the current development cycle, and we believe that we continue to benefit from our highly diversified portfolio.
 
In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party management platform, bringing the total additions to 54 for the year. These managed stores provide us additional fee income, density in key markets, efficiencies that come from scale, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities.
 
We recently held our 2017 Partners Conference in Park City, Utah, where over 150 partners joined us for 2 days of meetings. This is the best turnout in our history and our managed pipeline for the next 6 months is the largest it has ever been.
 
However, we were recently informed that one of our partners, Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, has decided to internalize management, and its 94 stores will be needing Extra Space's system effective October 1. While the loss of this storage is unfortunate, we have over 100 properties scheduled to be added in the back half of 2017, the majority of which are in higher rent per square foot markets than the managed SmartStop properties.
 
For example, we added an 11-store portfolio in New York City just last week. We remain enthusiastic about our third-party management platform, and expect it to continue to be a valuable part of our growth strategy. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

The beat was the result of property performance, tenant reinsurance and management fees. Repairs and maintenance, payroll and insurance have been lower than expected and contributed to the expense beat. We also incurred a onetime $6 million loss related to the write-down on 3 parcels of land, 2 of which are under contract for sale. Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 94.4%, a 70 basis point year-over-year increase. While occupancy is just 1 driver of revenue, we are encouraged by the strong rental activity and peak occupancy levels we are seeing this summer. We were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single digits during the quarter. And discounts, while up year-over-year, remained at levels below historical norms. We continue our existing customer rent increase program without changes.
 
During the quarter, we did not access our ATM. Acquisitions and loan maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. We also completed a 10-year $300 million private placement at 3.95%. The notes have a delayed draw feature, and dey will be issued on August 24. The private placement proceeds will be used to finance acquisitions, loan maturities and to pay down revolving balances. These notes help us achieve our goals of increasing our average term -- our average debt term, our fixed rate debt ratio and the size of our unsecured pool.
 
Based on the performance year-to-date, we raise the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 5%. We lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.75% to 2.5%. As a result, our annual NOI guidance increased to 4.75% to 6%. 
We reaffirm our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million, comprised of $325 million in wholly-owned stores and $200 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. Approximately $200 million is currently closed or under agreement. We are in discussions on several other acquisition opportunities and our guidance assumes the remaining $200 million will close late in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.
 
As a result of the Q2 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.25 to $4.32 per share. This includes the Q4 impact of losing the managed SmartStop stores. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.15.

Coming into 2017, we received many questions related to demand, new supply, external growth and our ability to increase revenue and FFO. We are more than halfway through 2017, and to a very large extent, our predictions related to these top",371,"Thanks, Scott. Coming into 2017, we received many questions related to demand, new supply, external growth and our ability to increase revenue and FFO. We are more than halfway through 2017, and to a very large extent, our predictions related to these topics have been accurate. 
First, the management has been steady. Stable demand has led to positive growth in rates, rentals and occupancy, resulting in a solid revenue growth. The rate of our revenue growth has moderated since the beginning of the year, and as our guidance implies, will moderate further in the second half of the year. 
 
However, our systems have proved adept at adjusting rate, occupancy, discounts and marketing spend to maximize revenue in the current environment. Despite headwinds and difficult comps, we still expect storage to produce some of the best revenue growth among REITs, and we expect to lead the pack in this sector. 
 
Second, new supply, while present, has been manageable so far. Several markets have felt the impact of new development, while others have remained relatively immune. Most markets continue to see revenue growth, and our performance continues to be solid due to our diversified portfolio. Construction pipelines have been pushed back as projects are taking longer to get done, and the fallout rate of projects and planning remains significant.
 
Third, we will have both challenges and opportunities related to external growth. Pricing for marketed acquisition remains at elevated levels, deals volume is down significantly, and we have not seen sufficient long-term value to increase our bids to meet seller expectations. Most acquisitions have come from existing relationships rather than on the open market. However, our prediction that we could see an increase in demand for third-party management has come to fruition, and we expect our pipeline to remain robust. 
 
Finaly, we continue to produce outsized FFO growth. Our sector-leading same-store performance together with accretive acquisitions, tenant insurance, third-party management and an efficient balance sheet have resulted in another strong quarter of FFO as adjusted growth of 16%. We are focused on being responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital and providing the best long-term return on that capital in the sector.

We had another solid quarter, and we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year. In the quarter, we saw healthy demand and steady rental volume, which outpaced that of second quarter 2016. We maintained our same-store occupancy GAAP and ended the quarter at 94.4%, 70 basis points ahead of where we were in 2016. We were also able to grow street rates, which together with our occupancy gains, increased same-store revenue 5.2%. We demonstrated great expense control with a 1.1% decrease in same-store expenses. As a result, same-store NOI grew 7.7%. We also saw growth outside of our same-store pool, which contributed to an increase of 16% in FFO per share as adjusted.
 
All of our markets showed positive revenue growth with the exception of Houston, which was effectively flat. The markets in the western states continued to perform particularly well, many with revenue growth in the high single digit. Our top MSA's have been affected differently by the current development cycle, and we believe that we continue to benefit from our highly diversified portfolio.
 
In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party management platform, bringing the total additions to 54 for the year. These managed stores provide us additional fee income, density in key markets, efficiencies that come from scale, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities.
 
We recently held our 2017 Partners Conference in Park City, Utah, where over 150 partners joined us for 2 days of meetings. This is the best turnout in our history and our managed pipeline for the next 6 months is the largest it has ever been.
 
However, we were recently informed that one of our partners, Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, has decided to internalize management, and its 94 stores will be leaving Extra Space's system effective October 1. While the loss of these stores is unfortunate, we have over 100 properties scheduled to be added in the back half of 2017, the majority of which are in higher rent per square foot markets than the managed SmartStop properties.
 
For example, we added an 11-store portfolio in New York City just last week. We remain enthusiastic about our third-party management platform, and expect it to continue to be a valuable part of our growth strategy. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

The beat was the result of property performance, tenant reinsurance and management fees. Repairs and maintenance, payroll and insurance have been lower than expected and contributed to the expense beat. We also incurred a onetime $6 million loss related to the write-down on 3 parcels of land, 2 of which are under contract for sale. Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 94.4%, a 70 basis point year-over-year increase. While occupancy is just 1 driver of revenue, we are encouraged by the strong rental activity and peak occupancy levels we are seeing this summer. We were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single digits during the quarter. And discounts, while up year-over-year, remained at levels below historical norms. We continue our existing customer rent increase program without changes.
 
During the quarter, we did not access our ATM. Acquisitions and loan maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. We also completed a 10-year $300 million private placement at 3.95%. The notes have a delayed draw feature, and they will be issued on August 24. The private placement proceeds will be used to finance acquisitions, loan maturities and to pay down revolving balances. These notes help us achieve our goals of increasing our average term -- our average debt term, our fixed rate debt ratio and the size of our unsecured pool.
 
Based on the performance year-to-date, we raise the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 5%. We lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.75% to 2.5%. As a result, our annual NOI guidance increased to 4.75% to 6%. 
We reaffirm our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million, comprised of $325 million in wholly-owned stores and $200 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. Approximately $200 million is currently closed or under agreement. We are in discussions on several other acquisition opportunities and our guidance assumes the remaining $200 million will close late in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.
 
As a result of the Q2 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.25 to $4.32 per share. This includes the Q4 impact of losing the managed SmartStop stores. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.15. 
I'll now turn the time back over to Joe."

Coming into 2017, we received many questions related to demand, new supply, external growth and our ability to increase revenue and FFO. We are more than halfway through 2017, and to a very large extent, our predictions related to these top",371,"Thanks, Scott. Coming into 2017, we received many questions related to demand, new supply, external growth and our ability to increase revenue and FFO. We are more than halfway through 2017, and to a very large extent, our predictions related to these topics have been accurate. 
First, the management has been steady. Stable demand has led to positive growth in rates, rentals and occupancy, resulting in a solid revenue growth. The rate of our revenue growth has moderated since the beginning of the year, and as our guidance implies, will moderate further in the second half of the year. 
 
However, our systems have proved adept at adjusting rate, occupancy, discounts and marketing spend to maximize revenue in the current environment. Despite headwinds and difficult comps, we still expect storage to produce some of the best revenue growth among REITs, and we expect to lead the pack in this sector. 
 
Second, new supply, while present, has been manageable so far. Several markets have felt the impact of new development, while others have remained relatively immune. Most markets continue to see revenue growth, and our performance continues to be solid due to our diversified portfolio. Construction pipelines have been pushed back as projects are taking longer to get done, and the fallout rate of projects and planning remains significant.
 
Third, we will have both challenges and opportunities related to external growth. Pricing for marketed acquisition remains at elevated levels, Sales volume is down significantly, and we have not seen sufficient long-term value to increase our bids to meet seller expectations. Most acquisitions have come from existing relationships rather than on the open market. However, our prediction that we could see an increase in demand for third-party management has come to fruition, and we expect our pipeline to remain robust. 
 
Finaly, we continue to produce outsized FFO growth. Our sector-leading same-store performance together with accretive acquisitions, tenant insurance, third-party management and an efficient balance sheet have resulted in another strong quarter of FFO as adjusted growth of 16%. We are focused on being responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital and providing the best long-term return on that capital in the sector.

We had another solid quarter, and we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year. In the quarter, we saw healthy demand and steady rental volume, which outpaced that of second quarter 2016. We maintained our same-store occupancy GAAP and ended the quarter at 94.4%, 70 basis points ahead of where we were in 2016. We were also able to grow street rates, which together with our occupancy gains, increased same-store revenue 5.2%. We demonstrated great expense control with a 1.1% decrease in same-store expenses. As a result, same-store NOI grew 7.7%. We also saw growth outside of our same-store pool, which contributed to an increase of 16% in FFO per share as adjusted.
 
All of our markets showed positive revenue growth with the exception of Houston, which was effectively flat. The markets in the western states continued to perform particularly well, many with revenue growth in the high single digit. Our top MSA's have been affected differently by the current development cycle, and we believe that we continue to benefit from our highly diversified portfolio.
 
In the quarter, we added 27 new properties to our third-party management platform, bringing the total additions to 54 for the year. These managed stores provide us additional fee income, density in key markets, efficiencies that come from scale, customer data and potential future acquisition opportunities.
 
We recently held our 2017 Partners Conference in Park City, Utah, where over 150 partners joined us for 2 days of meetings. This is the best turnout in our history and our managed pipeline for the next 6 months is the largest it has ever been.
 
However, we were recently informed that one of our partners, Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, has decided to internalize management, and its 94 stores will be leaving Extra Space's system effective October 1. While the loss of these stores is unfortunate, we have over 100 properties scheduled to be added in the back half of 2017, the majority of which are in higher rent per square foot markets than the managed SmartStop properties.
 
For example, we added an 11-store portfolio in New York City just last week. We remain enthusiastic about our third-party management platform, and expect it to continue to be a valuable part of our growth strategy. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

The beat was the result of property performance, tenant reinsurance and management fees. Repairs and maintenance, payroll and insurance have been lower than expected and contributed to the expense beat. We also incurred a onetime $6 million loss related to the write-down on 3 parcels of land, 2 of which are under contract for sale. Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 94.4%, a 70 basis point year-over-year increase. While occupancy is just 1 driver of revenue, we are encouraged by the strong rental activity and peak occupancy levels we are seeing this summer. We were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single digits during the quarter. And discounts, while up year-over-year, remained at levels below historical norms. We continue our existing customer rent increase program without changes.
 
During the quarter, we did not access our ATM. Acquisitions and loan maturities were funded by draws on our credit facility. We also completed a 10-year $300 million private placement at 3.95%. The notes have a delayed draw feature, and they will be issued on August 24. The private placement proceeds will be used to finance acquisitions, loan maturities and to pay down revolving balances. These notes help us achieve our goals of increasing our average term -- our average debt term, our fixed rate debt ratio and the size of our unsecured pool.
 
Based on the performance year-to-date, we raise the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 5%. We lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.75% to 2.5%. As a result, our annual NOI guidance increased to 4.75% to 6%. 
We reaffirm our original acquisition guidance of total investment of $400 million, comprised of $325 million in wholly-owned stores and $200 million in joint venture acquisitions and developments with approximately $75 million in capital to be contributed by Extra Space. Approximately $200 million is currently closed or under agreement. We are in discussions on several other acquisition opportunities and our guidance assumes the remaining $200 million will close late in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.
 
As a result of the Q2 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.25 to $4.32 per share. This includes the Q4 impact of losing the managed SmartStop stores. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CofO stores and an additional $0.08 from value-add acquisitions for a total of $0.15.

Coming into 2017, we received many questions related to demand, new supply, external growth and our ability to increase revenue and FFO. We are more than halfway through 2017, and to a very large extent, our predictions related to these top",371,"Thanks, Scott. Coming into 2017, we received many questions related to demand, new supply, external growth and our ability to increase revenue and FFO. We are more than halfway through 2017, and to a very large extent, our predictions related to these topics have been accurate. 
First, the management has been steady. Stable demand has led to positive growth in rates, rentals and occupancy, resulting in a solid revenue growth. The rate of our revenue growth has moderated since the beginning of the year, and as our guidance implies, will moderate further in the second half of the year. 
 
However, our systems have proved adept at adjusting rate, occupancy, discounts and marketing spend to maximize revenue in the current environment. Despite headwinds and difficult comps, we still expect storage to produce some of the best revenue growth among REITs, and we expect to lead the pack in this sector. 
 
Second, new supply, while present, has been manageable so far. Several markets have felt the impact of new development, while others have remained relatively immune. Most markets continue to see revenue growth, and our performance continues to be solid due to our diversified portfolio. Construction pipelines have been pushed back as projects are taking longer to get done, and the fallout rate of projects and planning remains significant.
 
Third, we will have both challenges and opportunities related to external growth. Pricing for marketed acquisition remains at elevated levels, Sales volume is down significantly, and we have not seen sufficient long-term value to increase our bids to meet seller expectations. Most acquisitions have come from existing relationships rather than on the open market. However, our prediction that we could see an increase in demand for third-party management has come to fruition, and we expect our pipeline to remain robust. 
 
Finally, we continue to produce outsized FFO growth. Our sector-leading same-store performance together with accretive acquisitions, tenant insurance, third-party management and an efficient balance sheet have resulted in another strong quarter of FFO as adjusted growth of 16%. We are focused on being responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital and providing the best long-term return on that capital in the sector.

And you compare that to Miami, where many more are in the development process than have been delivered. And so we kind of look at markets that way.

Before I begin my remarks, I just want to say how impressed and humbled I am by the sacrifices our teammates made in Florida and Houston and Puerto Rico. They went the extra effort to take care of our customers, to take care of our stores and most importantly, maybe to take care of each other as family. I am very proud to be associated with a company that has teammates like this. I want to say that all of our employees are safe and we do not have any injuries in any of our stores, and I'm very grateful for that. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to say that. I'll start my remarks.
Throughout the third quarter, we have strong execution and posted another solid result. Same store revenue growth was 4.8%, NOI growth was 5.5% and FFO as adjusted growth was 10.8%. If we exclude our properties in Houston and Florida from same-store totals, revenue growth for 640 stores not impacted by hurricanes actually improved 20 basis points to 5.0%, and NOI increased 40 basis points to 5.9%. So our outperformance this quarter was driven by strong operating results produced by our diversified portfolio, not by onetime events. Houston did grow occupancy and is well positioned for growth going forward, but there was no benefit to revenue and NOI in the third quarter. Florida received some benefit to occupancy and revenue growth in the quarter, but we don't expect the long-term benefit to be significant. We have provided additional details related to the performance of these markets in our supplemental financial information posted on the website.
On our last call, we announced that Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, decided to internalize management, and as planned, its 94 stores left Extra Space's system effective October 1. As of today, we've added 121 properties to our managed platform this year, and we expect to add approximately 30 more between now and year-end for a projected 2017 total of 151 stores. From a store count perspective, this offsets the loss of the Strategic Storage Trust properties. Further, I our 2018 pipeline is the largest we have had in our history, with over 100 stores approved to be added to the platform already. Third-party management will continue to be a growth driver for Extra Space.
Finally, I would like to provide an update on the 36 store portfolio that we have marketed for a joint venture recapitalization. The transaction is now under contract, debt financing has been arranged, and we plan to close by December 1, 2017. Proceeds will be reinvested in other properties through 10/31 exchanges, which we have under contract. We will be prepared to discuss additional details after this transaction closes.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.13 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property and tenant insurance results. We recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to property damage and cleanup from the hurricanes. We recorded an additional $2.3 million for tenant insurance claims for a total of $4.4 million related to the hurricane. These losses have been added back to FFO as adjusted to more accurately reflect our run rate.
Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 93.9%, a 140 basis point increase. The growth in occupancy wasn't just a result of the hurricanes, same-store occupancy growth in non-hurricane markets was up 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter, we were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single digits and we continue our existing customer rate increase program without changes.
During the third quarter and subsequent to the end of the quarter, a number of our acquisitions closed or went under contract. As of today, we have closed $140 million in wholly-owned acquisitions and invested another $15 million of stores held in joint ventures. We also bought out our joint venture partners interest in several other properties, adding another $20 million in investment for year-to-date investment of approximately $175 million. We have another $240 million under contract and scheduled to close by year-end. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We funded our acquisitions and loan maturities with draws on our credit facility and the closing of our 10 year $300 million private placement that we announced last quarter. The funding is part -- the funding of this private placement is part of our strategy to lengthen our average debt term, increase our fixed rate debt ratio and expand the size of our unsecured pool. Based on performance year-to-date, we raised the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.5% to 5%. Year-to-date, expenses have been below budget and we have lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.25% to 1.75%, increasing our annual NOI guidance to 5.75% to 6.5%.
As a result of the Q3 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.32 to $4.35 per share. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CFO stores and an additional $0.08 from value add acquisitions for a total of $0.15. we're accepting some short-term solution in exchange for outsized long-term value creation.
I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

With most of the year behind us, 2017 has shaped up well, and we are pleased that our sector leading performance has allowed us to increase guidance each quarter. The fundamentals in storage are healthy, demand has been steady resulting in growth in occupancy and rental rates. As expected, the rate of our revenue growth is moderated since the beginning of the year, but the rate of the moderation is flattening. We are confident that our systems are well equipped to maximize revenue in the current environment, and our team has demonstrated a track record of consistent execution.
We also have some headwinds, which are unchanged from the previous 2 quarters. I set our expectations continuing in this competitive acquisitions environment and several submarkets have felt the impact of new development. However, these challenges present opportunities. The competitive acquisition market allowed us to put our 36 property portfolio under contract at attractive pricing. Any the new development has led to the acquisition of purpose built assets that will create significant long-term value for our shareholders while enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio. New supply has also resulted in significant growth in our managed portfolio, which generates an income stream for us today, increases our footprint and provides a meaningful acquisition pipeline for the future.
Our three-pronged ownership structure positions us to continue to grow efficiently in a current or any other economic climate. This external growth platform, together with our sector leading same-store performance and our efficient balance sheet, all contribute to meaningful and consistent FFO growth into our ultimate goal of maximizing the long-term return on our investors capital.

Before I begin my remarks, I just want to say how impressed and humbled I am by the sacrifices our teammates made in Florida and Houston and Puerto Rico. They went the extra effort to take care of our customers, to take care of our stores and most importantly, maybe to take care of each other as a family. I am very proud to be associated with a company that has teammates like this. I want to say that all of our employees are safe and we do not have any injuries in any of our stores, and I'm very grateful for that. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to say that. I'll start my remarks.
Throughout the third quarter, we had strong execution and posted another solid result. Same-store revenue growth was 4.8%, NOI growth was 5.5% and FFO as adjusted growth was 10.8%. If we exclude our properties in Houston and Florida from same-store totals, revenue growth for the 640 stores not impacted by hurricanes actually improved 20 basis points to 5.0%, and NOI increased 40 basis points to 5.9%. So our outperformance this quarter was driven by strong operating results produced by our diversified portfolio, not by onetime events. Houston did grow occupancy and is well positioned for growth going forward, but there was no benefit to revenue and NOI in the third quarter. Florida received some benefit to occupancy and revenue growth in the quarter, but we don't expect the long-term benefit to be significant. We have provided additional details related to the performance of these markets in our supplemental financial information posted on the website.
On our last call, we announced that Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, decided to internalize management, and as planned, its 94 stores left Extra Space's system effective October 1. As of today, we've added 121 properties to our managed platform this year, and we expect to add approximately 30 more between now and year-end for a projected 2017 total of 151 stores. From a store count perspective, this offsets the loss of the Strategic Storage Trust properties. Further, our 2018 pipeline is the largest we have had in our history, with over 100 stores approved to be added to the platform already. Third-party management will continue to be a growth driver for Extra Space.
Finally, I would like to provide an update on the 36 store portfolio that we have marketed for a joint venture recapitalization. The transaction is now under contract, debt financing has been arranged, and we plan to close by December 1, 2017. Proceeds will be reinvested in other properties through 10/31 exchanges, which we have under contract. We will be prepared to discuss additional details after this transaction closes.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.13 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property and tenant insurance results. We recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to property damage and cleanup from the hurricanes. We recorded an additional $2.3 million for tenant insurance claims for a total of $4.4 million related to the hurricane. These losses have been added back to FFO as adjusted to more accurately reflect our run rate.
Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 93.9%, a 140 basis point increase. The growth in occupancy wasn't just the result of the hurricanes, same-store occupancy growth in non-hurricane markets was up 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter, we were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single digits and we continue our existing customer rate increase program without changes.
During the third quarter and subsequent to the end of the quarter, a number of our acquisitions closed or went under contract. As of today, we have closed [ $114 ] million in wholly-owned acquisitions and invested another $50 million in stores held in joint ventures. We also bought out our joint venture partners interest in several other properties, adding another $20 million in investment for year-to-date total investment of approximately $175 million. We have another $240 million under contract and scheduled to close by year-end. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We funded our acquisitions and loan maturities withdraws on our credit facility and the closing of our 10-year $300 million private placement that we announced last quarter. The funding is part -- the funding of this private placement is part of our strategy to lengthen our average debt term, increase our fixed rate debt ratio and expand the size of our unsecured pool. Based on performance year-to-date, we raised the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.5% to 5%. Year-to-date expenses have been below budget and we have lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.25% to 1.75%, increasing our annual NOI guidance to 5.75% to 6.5%.
As a result of the Q3 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.32 to $4.35 per share. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CFO stores and an additional $0.08 from value add acquisitions for a total of $0.15. We're accepting some short-term dilution in exchange for outsized long-term value creation.
I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

With most of the year behind us, 2017 has shaped up well, and we are pleased that our sector leading performance has allowed us to increase guidance each quarter. The fundamentals in storage are healthy, demand has been steady resulting in growth in occupancy and rental rates. As expected, the rate of our revenue growth is moderated since the beginning of the year, but the rate of the moderation is flattening. We are confident that our systems are well equipped to maximize revenue in the current environment, and our team has demonstrated a track record of consistent execution.
We also have some headwinds, which are unchanged from the previous 2 quarters. High [ stellar ] expectations continue in this competitive acquisitions environment and several submarkets have felt the impact of new development. However, these challenges present opportunities. The competitive acquisition market allowed us to put our 36 property portfolio under contract at attractive pricing. Any new development has led to the acquisition of purpose-built assets that will create significant long-term value for our shareholders while enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio. New supply has also resulted in significant growth in our managed portfolio, which generates an income stream for us today, increases our footprint and provides a meaningful acquisition pipeline for the future.
Our three-pronged ownership structure positions us to continue to grow efficiently in the current or any other economic climate. This external growth platform, together with our sector leading same-store performance and our efficient balance sheet, all contribute to meaningful and consistent FFO growth and to our ultimate goal of maximizing the long-term return on our investors capital.

Before I begin my remarks, I just want to say how impressed and humbled I am by the sacrifices our teammates made in Florida and Houston and Puerto Rico. They went the extra effort to take care of our customers, to take care of our stores and most importantly, maybe to take care of each other as family. I am very proud to be associated with a company that has teammates like this. I want to say that all of our employees are safe and we did not have any injuries in any of our stores, and I'm very grateful for that. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to say that. I'll start my remarks.
Throughout the third quarter, we had strong execution and posted another solid result. Same-store revenue growth was 4.8%, NOI growth was 5.5% and FFO as adjusted growth was 10.8%. If we exclude our properties in Houston and Florida from same-store totals, revenue growth for the 640 stores not impacted by hurricanes actually improved 20 basis points to 5.0%, and NOI increased 40 basis points to 5.9%. So our outperformance this quarter was driven by strong operating results produced by our diversified portfolio, not by onetime events. Houston did grow occupancy and is well positioned for growth going forward, but there was no benefit to revenue and NOI in the third quarter. Florida received some benefit to occupancy and revenue growth in the quarter, but we don't expect the long-term benefit to be significant. We have provided additional details related to the performance of these markets in our supplemental financial information posted on the website.
On our last call, we announced that Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, decided to internalize management, and as planned, its 94 stores left Extra Space's system effective October 1. As of today, we've added 121 properties to our managed platform this year, and we expect to add approximately 30 more between now and year-end for a projected 2017 total of 151 stores. From a store count perspective, this offsets the loss of the Strategic Storage Trust properties. Further, our 2018 pipeline is the largest we have had in our history, with over 100 stores approved to be added to the platform already. Third-party management will continue to be a growth driver for Extra Space.
Finally, I would like to provide an update on the 36 store portfolio that we have marketed for a joint venture recapitalization. The transaction is now under contract, debt financing has been arranged, and we plan to close by December 1, 2017. Proceeds will be reinvested in other properties through 10/31 exchanges, which we have under contract. We will be prepared to discuss additional details after this transaction closes.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.13 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property and tenant insurance results. We recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to property damage and cleanup from the hurricanes. We recorded an additional $2.3 million for tenant insurance claims for a total of $4.4 million related to the hurricane. These losses have been added back to FFO as adjusted to more accurately reflect our run rate.
Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 93.9%, a 140 basis point increase. The growth in occupancy wasn't just the result of the hurricanes, same-store occupancy growth in non-hurricane markets was up 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter, we were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single digits and we continue our existing customer rate increase program without changes.
During the third quarter and subsequent to the end of the quarter, a number of our acquisitions closed or went under contract. As of today, we have closed $140 million in wholly-owned acquisitions and invested another $50 million in stores held in joint ventures. We also bought out our joint venture partners interest in several other properties, adding another $20 million in investment for year-to-date total investment of approximately $175 million. We have another $240 million under contract and scheduled to close by year-end. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We funded our acquisitions and loan maturities with draws on our credit facility and the closing of our 10-year $300 million private placement that we announced last quarter. The funding is part -- the funding of this private placement is part of our strategy to lengthen our average debt term, increase our fixed rate debt ratio and expand the size of our unsecured pool. Based on performance year-to-date, we raised the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.5% to 5%. Year-to-date expenses have been below budget and we have lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.25% to 1.75%, increasing our annual NOI guidance to 5.75% to 6.5%.
As a result of the Q3 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.32 to $4.35 per share. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CFO stores and an additional $0.08 from value add acquisitions for a total of $0.15. We're accepting some short-term dilution in exchange for outsized long-term value creation.
I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

With most of the year behind us, 2017 has shaped up well, and we are pleased that our sector leading performance has allowed us to increase guidance each quarter. The fundamentals in storage are healthy, demand has been steady resulting in growth in occupancy and rental rates. As expected, the rate of our revenue growth is moderated since the beginning of the year, but the rate of the moderation is flattening. We are confident that our systems are well equipped to maximize revenue in the current environment, and our team has demonstrated a track record of consistent execution.
We also have some headwinds, which are unchanged from the previous 2 quarters. High seller expectations continue in this competitive acquisitions environment and several submarkets have felt the impact of new development. However, these challenges present opportunities. The competitive acquisition market allowed us to put our 36 property portfolio under contract at attractive pricing. And the new development has led to the acquisition of purpose-built assets that will create significant long-term value for our shareholders while enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio. New supply has also resulted in significant growth in our managed portfolio, which generates an income stream for us today, increases our footprint and provides a meaningful acquisition pipeline for the future.
Our three-pronged ownership structure positions us to continue to grow efficiently in the current or any other economic climate. This external growth platform, together with our sector leading same-store performance and our efficient balance sheet, all contribute to meaningful and consistent FFO growth and to our ultimate goal of maximizing the long-term return on our investors capital.

Before I begin my remarks, I just want to say how impressed and humbled I am by the sacrifices our teammates made in Florida and Houston and Puerto Rico. They went the extra effort to take care of our customers, to take care of our stores and most importantly, maybe to take care of each other as family. I am very proud to be associated with a company that has teammates like this. I want to say that all of our employees are safe and we did not have any injuries in any of our stores, and I'm very grateful for that. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to say that. I'll start my remarks.
Throughout the third quarter, we had strong execution and posted another solid result. Same-store revenue growth was 4.8%, NOI growth was 5.5% and FFO as adjusted growth was 10.8%. If we exclude our properties in Houston and Florida from same-store totals, revenue growth for the 640 stores not impacted by hurricanes actually improved 20 basis points to 5.0%, and NOI increased 40 basis points to 5.9%. So our outperformance this quarter was driven by strong operating results produced by our diversified portfolio, not by onetime events. Houston did grow occupancy and is well positioned for growth going forward, but there was no benefit to revenue and NOI in the third quarter. Florida received some benefit to occupancy and revenue growth in the quarter, but we don't expect the long-term benefit to be significant. We have provided additional details related to the performance of these markets in our supplemental financial information posted on the website.
On our last call, we announced that Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, decided to internalize management, and as planned, its 94 stores left Extra Space's system effective October 1. As of today, we've added 121 properties to our managed platform this year, and we expect to add approximately 30 more between now and year-end for a projected 2017 total of 151 stores. From a store count perspective, this offsets the loss of the Strategic Storage Trust properties. Further, our 2018 pipeline is the largest we have had in our history, with over 100 stores approved to be added to the platform already. Third-party management will continue to be a growth driver for Extra Space.
Finally, I would like to provide an update on the 36 store portfolio that we have marketed for a joint venture recapitalization. The transaction is now under contract, debt financing has been arranged, and we plan to close by December 1, 2017. Proceeds will be reinvested in other properties through 10/31 exchanges, which we have under contract. We will be prepared to discuss additional details after this transaction closes.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.13 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property and tenant insurance results. We recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to property damage and cleanup from the hurricanes. We recorded an additional $2.3 million for tenant insurance claims for a total of $4.4 million related to the hurricane. These losses have been added back to FFO as adjusted to more accurately reflect our run rate.
Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 93.9%, a 140 basis point increase. The growth in occupancy wasn't just the result of the hurricanes, same-store occupancy growth in non-hurricane markets was up 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter, we were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single digits and we continue our existing customer rate increase program without changes.
During the third quarter and subsequent to the end of the quarter, a number of our acquisitions closed or went under contract. As of today, we have closed $140 million in wholly-owned acquisitions and invested another $50 million in stores held in joint ventures. We also bought out our joint venture partners interest in several other properties, adding another $20 million in investment for year-to-date total investment of approximately $175 million. We have another $240 million under contract and scheduled to close by year-end. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We funded our acquisitions and loan maturities with draws on our credit facility and the closing of our 10-year $300 million private placement that we announced last quarter. The funding is part -- the funding of this private placement is part of our strategy to lengthen our average debt term, increase our fixed rate debt ratio and expand the size of our unsecured pool. Based on performance year-to-date, we raised the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.5% to 5%. Year-to-date expenses have been below budget and we have lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.25% to 1.75%, increasing our annual NOI guidance to 5.75% to 6.5%.
As a result of the Q3 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.32 to $4.35 per share. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CFO stores and an additional $0.08 from value add acquisitions for a total of $0.15. We're accepting some short-term dilution in exchange for outsized long-term value creation.
I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

With most of the year behind us, 2017 has shaped up well, and we are pleased that our sector leading performance has allowed us to increase guidance each quarter. The fundamentals in storage are healthy, demand has been steady resulting in growth in occupancy and rental rates. As expected, the rate of our revenue growth is moderated since the beginning of the year, but the rate of the moderation is flattening. We are confident that our systems are well equipped to maximize revenue in the current environment, and our team has demonstrated a track record of consistent execution.
We also have some headwinds, which are unchanged from the previous 2 quarters. High seller expectations continue in this competitive acquisitions environment and several submarkets have felt the impact of new development. However, these challenges present opportunities. The competitive acquisition market allowed us to put our 36 property portfolio under contract at attractive pricing. And the new development has led to the acquisition of purpose-built assets that will create significant long-term value for our shareholders while enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio. New supply has also resulted in significant growth in our managed portfolio, which generates an income stream for us today, increases our footprint and provides a meaningful acquisition pipeline for the future.
Our three-pronged ownership structure positions us to continue to grow efficiently in the current or any other economic climate. This external growth platform, together with our sector leading same-store performance and our efficient balance sheet, all contribute to meaningful and consistent FFO growth and to our ultimate goal of maximizing the long-term return on our investors capital.

Before I begin my remarks, I just want to say how impressed and humbled I am by the sacrifices our teammates made in Florida and Houston and Puerto Rico. They went the extra effort to take care of our customers, to take care of our stores and most importantly, maybe to take care of each other as family. I am very proud to be associated with a company that has teammates like this. I want to say that all of our employees are safe and we did not have any injuries in any of our stores, and I'm very grateful for that. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to say that. I'll start my remarks.
Throughout the third quarter, we had strong execution and posted another solid result. Same-store revenue growth was 4.8%, NOI growth was 5.5% and FFO as adjusted growth was 10.8%. If we exclude our properties in Houston and Florida from same-store totals, revenue growth for the 640 stores not impacted by hurricanes actually improved 20 basis points to 5.0%, and NOI increased 40 basis points to 5.9%. So our outperformance this quarter was driven by strong operating results produced by our diversified portfolio, not by onetime events. Houston did grow occupancy and is well positioned for growth going forward, but there was no benefit to revenue and NOI in the third quarter. Florida received some benefit to occupancy and revenue growth in the quarter, but we don't expect the long-term benefit to be significant. We have provided additional details related to the performance of these markets in our supplemental financial information posted on the website.
On our last call, we announced that Strategic Storage Trust, formerly known as SmartStop, decided to internalize management, and as planned, its 94 stores left Extra Space's system effective October 1. As of today, we've added 121 properties to our managed platform this year, and we expect to add approximately 30 more between now and year-end for a projected 2017 total of 151 stores. From a store count perspective, this offsets the loss of the Strategic Storage Trust properties. Further, our 2018 pipeline is the largest we have had in our history, with over 100 stores approved to be added to the platform already. Third-party management will continue to be a growth driver for Extra Space.
Finally, I would like to provide an update on the 36 store portfolio that we have marketed for a joint venture recapitalization. The transaction is now under contract, debt financing has been arranged, and we plan to close by December 1, 2017. Proceeds will be reinvested in other properties through 10/31 exchanges, which we have under contract. We will be prepared to discuss additional details after this transaction closes.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Last night, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.13 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily due to stronger-than-expected property and tenant insurance results. We recorded a net loss of $2.1 million related to property damage and cleanup from the hurricanes. We recorded an additional $2.3 million for tenant insurance claims for a total of $4.4 million related to the hurricane. These losses have been added back to FFO as adjusted to more accurately reflect our run rate.
Occupancy for the same-store pool ended the quarter at 93.9%, a 140 basis point increase. The growth in occupancy wasn't just the result of the hurricanes, same-store occupancy growth in non-hurricane markets was up 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter, we were able to increase rates to new customers in the low single digits and we continue our existing customer rate increase program without changes.
During the third quarter and subsequent to the end of the quarter, a number of our acquisitions closed or went under contract. As of today, we have closed $140 million in wholly-owned acquisitions and invested another $50 million in stores held in joint ventures. We also bought out our joint venture partners interest in several other properties, adding another $20 million in investment for year-to-date total investment of approximately $175 million. We have another $240 million under contract and scheduled to close by year-end. We remain focused on only acquiring properties that create long-term value for our shareholders.
We funded our acquisitions and loan maturities with draws on our credit facility and the closing of our 10-year $300 million private placement that we announced last quarter. The funding is part -- the funding of this private placement is part of our strategy to lengthen our average debt term, increase our fixed rate debt ratio and expand the size of our unsecured pool. Based on performance year-to-date, we raised the bottom end of our same-store revenue guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 4.5% to 5%. Year-to-date expenses have been below budget and we have lowered our annual expense guidance to 1.25% to 1.75%, increasing our annual NOI guidance to 5.75% to 6.5%.
As a result of the Q3 beat, we are increasing our full year FFO as adjusted guidance to $4.32 to $4.35 per share. Our guidance also includes $0.07 of dilution from our CFO stores and an additional $0.08 from value add acquisitions for a total of $0.15. We're accepting some short-term dilution in exchange for outsized long-term value creation.
I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

With most of the year behind us, 2017 has shaped up well, and we are pleased that our sector leading performance has allowed us to increase guidance each quarter. The fundamentals in storage are healthy, demand has been steady resulting in growth in occupancy and rental rates. As expected, the rate of our revenue growth is moderated since the beginning of the year, but the rate of the moderation is flattening. We are confident that our systems are well equipped to maximize revenue in the current environment, and our team has demonstrated a track record of consistent execution.
We also have some headwinds, which are unchanged from the previous 2 quarters. High seller expectations continue in this competitive acquisitions environment and several submarkets have felt the impact of new development. However, these challenges present opportunities. The competitive acquisition market allowed us to put our 36 property portfolio under contract at attractive pricing. And the new development has led to the acquisition of purpose-built assets that will create significant long-term value for our shareholders while enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio. New supply has also resulted in significant growth in our managed portfolio, which generates an income stream for us today, increases our footprint and provides a meaningful acquisition pipeline for the future.
Our three-pronged ownership structure positions us to continue to grow efficiently in the current or any other economic climate. This external growth platform, together with our sector leading same-store performance and our efficient balance sheet, all contribute to meaningful and consistent FFO growth and to our ultimate goal of maximizing the long-term return on our investors capital.
