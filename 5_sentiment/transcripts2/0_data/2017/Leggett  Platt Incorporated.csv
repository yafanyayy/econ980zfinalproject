We are pleased with our 2016 operational performance despite the challenging demand environment that persisted throughout the year in many of our markets. We thank our dedicated fel",1540,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter call. We are pleased with our 2016 operational performance despite the challenging demand environment that persisted throughout the year in many of our markets. We thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world. Their efforts during this past year were impactful and are very much appreciated. 
For 2017, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and further increases in earnings per share. Our businesses are extremely well-positioned for long-term profitable growth, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve the 2019 targets that we provided last September. 
Fourth quarter sales decreased 4% to $904 million, largely due to 4 small divestitures completed in the past 12 months. Unit volume was up slightly. 
Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.60, compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter last year. The current fourth quarter earnings included a $0.07 per share benefit from a divestiture gain and the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.07 per share reduction from a lump sum pension buyout and a litigation settlement. Excluding these unusual items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings decreased to $0.53 per share from $0.64 last year. This reduction was due in large part to rapid inflation in steel cost in late 2016 versus significant deflation in steel that was occurring in late 2015. The effects in both years were amplified by LIFO accounting. 
The commodity impact on earnings was partially offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate and a reduced share count. 
For the full year, sales decreased 4%, with 2% unit volume growth and small acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel costs and currency impact.
Full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.62 from $2.27 in 2015. Current year earnings included a $0.13 per share benefit, primarily from divestiture gains, and in the prior year, included a $0.09 per share reduction from unusual items. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.49 from $2.36 in 2015. This increase was largely due to lower effective tax rate related to a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and reduced share count. The earnings benefit from unit volume growth during the year was more than offset by recent steel inflation and the non-reocurrence of the pricing lag benefit that we experienced in late 2015. 
In 2015, steel costs deflated significantly, especially during the fourth quarter, and our earnings benefited from the normal lag we experienced in adjusting selling prices. This cost deflation ultimately led to lower selling prices, which impacted our sales growth throughout 2016. 
In recent months, steel costs have begun to rapidly inflate. We are implementing price increases to recover this recent inflation. 
Our commitment to portfolio management over the last several years has resulted in higher margins and returns and stronger strategic positioning for the company as a whole. 
During 2016, we completed 3 small acquisitions, including a manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies, a distributor of geosynthetic products and a South African innerspring manufacturer. We also purchased the remaining minority interest in a key automotive joint venture in China and continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities in automotive and bedding. 
During the year, we completed the divestiture of 4 small businesses with annual revenue of approximately $100 million. This included a wire products business sold in late December that resulted in a pretax gain of $16 million or $0.07 per share. 
In September, we have outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for long-term revenue growth of 6% to 9%. We believe the macro environment, driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue our focus on content gains and new program awards across our businesses, and therefore, expect to grow organically at a rate faster than our markets. 
Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth. Margin expansion and share repurchases should each contribute to long-term TSR, and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. 
In short, we remain fully committed to our long-standing goal of achieving total shareholder return that ranks in the top third of the S&P 500.
In November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to the management organizational structure in our segments. As a reminder, effective January 1, Perry Davis was promoted to Executive Vice President and is now President of Residential Products and Industrial Products segments. Also effective January 1, Mitch Dolloff was promoted to executive Vice President and is now President of the Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments. 
We continue to report under the prior management structure throughout the end of 2016, so all of the segment commentary that we make today is based upon the historical reporting format. 
In Residential Furnishings, fourth quarter same-location sales were down 7%. Unit volume decreased 5%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%. 
Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 4%; innerspring units decreased 5%; and boxspring unit volume was down 7%; Comfort Core units decreased 6% during the quarter; International Spring sales increased 3%; home furniture component sales were down slightly with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business down 2%; and motion hardware unit volume down 1%. 
Segment EBIT increased during the quarter as a result of lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these charges, EBIT decreased primarily from lower unit volume, partially offset by continued pricing discipline. 
Adjusted EBIT margin improved slightly, in part due to the lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales. For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 6%. Unit volume was down 3%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Commodity deflation and currency impacts also reduced sales by 3%. U.S. innerspring units were down 6%, and Comfort Core units were up 4% for the year. 
Full year segment EBIT increased as a result of a $7 million benefit from a litigation settlement and lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these items, EBIT for the year decreased slightly, with lower unit volume largely offset by pricing discipline. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 50 basis points to 10.7%, in part due to lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales.
In the commercial products segment, fourth quarter same-location sales were flat. Adjustable Bed units grew 4%, and Work Furniture sales were up slightly. But these increases were offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed. 
Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily from a favorable sales mix and a $1 million gain from a building sale. For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 1%. Adjustable Bed units were up slightly for the year. The segments' full year EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved 150 basis points to 8.3%, primarily from operational improvements, gains from building sales of $3 million and a favorable sales mix.
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales were down 4% from steel-related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel costs. Unit volume was essentially flat in the quarter. Total sales also decreased as a result of divestitures. The segment EBIT increased significantly in the quarter due to a $16 million gain from a sale of a wire products business and a non-recurrence from a $3 million loss from last year's divestiture of the steel tubing business. Excluding these unusual items, fourth quarter adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin decreased largely due to recent steel cost inflation that have not yet been recovered through selling price increases. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 25% from a combination of divestitures, steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume. The segment's full year EBIT increased due to the divestiture gain and the non-recurrence of a prior year impairment charge and divestiture loss. 
Excluding these unusual items, EBIT was down slightly, with the impact from lower sales largely offset by operational improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 290 basis points to 10.1%, in part from the divestiture of lower-margin businesses. 
In the Specialized Product segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased 4% with continued strength in automotive, partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in machinery and aerospace. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales grew 15%; machinery sales decreased 23%; and aerospace same-location sales were down 9% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved primarily from higher unit volume and currency impact. Full year total sales in the segment grew 6% with a 9% volume increase in a small acquisition, partially offset by divestitures and currency impact. 
Strong performance in our automotive business drove the majority of the sales growth. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales increased 13% for the full year. The segment's full year EBIT benefited from an $11 million divestiture gain, partially offset by a $4 million goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these unusual items, EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved, primarily from higher sales and currency impact. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

In 2016, we generated very strong operating cash flow of $553 million, which included $25 million of after-tax litigation settlement proceeds. Operating cash flow continues to benefit from a sharp focus on working capital management. 
We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 9.4%. In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represented a $0.02 per share or 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings, and we have been within that range each of the past 2 years. 
Looking forward, we would expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. 
At yesterday's closing price of $47.19, the current dividend yield is 2.9%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
We repurchased 400,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $47.10. For the full year, we repurchased 4.5 million shares at an average price of $46.52, and issued 2.4 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. 
During the year, we expanded the capacity under our revolver and commercial paper program from $600 million to $750 million, and extended the term by 2 years to 2021. We ended 2016 with over $550 million available under the commercial paper program, and our net debt to net capital ratio was at 34%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended 2016 with debt at 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2016, we generated compound annual TSR of 20% per year, and that performance placed us within the top 11% of the S&P 500.
As Karl mentioned earlier, we believe the macro environment should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. Even more importantly, we expect to grow organically at a faster pace than our markets as a result of content gains and new program awards. 
As we enter 2017 with renewed inflation, we also expect sales to increase from the pass-through of higher commodity costs although there will be lag in timing, which typically occurs when we adjust our own selling prices. 
With this collective backdrop for 2017, we are forecasting another year of strong performance. Sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion or up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid-single-digit unit volume growth from strength in automotive, bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Geo Components. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by small acquisitions, and as just mentioned, raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth.
We expect 2017 earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75. Bridging from our 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.49, we therefore expect earnings to grow from between 2% to 10%. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher unit volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we typically experience in recovering increased raw material costs. 
We expect the largest impact from the pricing lag to occur during the first quarter. We also anticipate a higher effective full year tax rate of approximately 26% this year. Of course, this tax rate estimate is assuming that current laws do not change in 2017.
Based upon this guidance, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 12.8% and 13.5%. Operating cash flow should exceed $450 million in 2017, with working capital increases attributable to sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. 
Dividends should require about $185 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $150 million for the year. 
As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized towards competitively advantaged acquisitions. 
Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisition come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. 
No specific repurchase commitment or time table has been established, however, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million to 4 million shares in 2017 and issue approximately 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
With those calls, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

Have a greater expectation for growth based on market drivers in the bedding industry, as an example in Asia and in Europe. So that becomes baseline. Then we have a high degree of confidence -- of content gains. In automotive, we continue to believe, based on awarded programs, that we'll grow at 1,000 basis points greater than global build. So call it 12% forecast there.

Think of unit volume growth as strengthening as the year progresses. Some of those new programs and products ramp up. Inflation is the other part of our forecast for sales. And I would also allow for inflation increasing, particularly in second quarter, third quarter. This is the impact on sales, of course, based on recent commodity trends. And then to kind of complete the view of all-in sales, completed divestitures and small acquisitions that we know about right now would effectively offset in the year. Now you usually go on to ask about a sort of segment level assumption around that midpoint sales growth, so I'll offer that up too with the comment around residential being, call it, mid-single digit; commercial, much stronger than that, more like mid-teens. And again, the growth that we've got in adjustables that also in Work Furniture will contribute to that. Industrial would be flat. We do have some carry-on impact from divestitures that have been completed in 2016, but we expect that to be offset by steel inflation and some higher volume. And then specialized as it's been doing, likely growing high single digits. So when you blend all that together, you get back to that midpoint, call it, 6.5%, 7% all-in sales growth for the full year."

And I thought he should answer the questions, and he thought I should answer the questions. And he's bigger than I am. So I guess I'll take a swing at it and Perry will interject at any time that he wants. You are right. It sort of appears to be the primary beneficiary. And announcement, they specifically cited an exclusive launch of the iSeries product line, which is a lot of our product in it. And iComfort, which to us, it's a foam product. There is some hybrid iComforts that are good for us. We'll get all of the foundations related to those products. As regards capacity, that's really a sort of a Simmons question. There's capacity in the market that there's always ability to flex shifts. I was told yesterday that a majority of the sort of facilities are running single shift. They can ramp those to a second shift. The majority of the Simmons facilities were running 2 shifts. But there is capacity. From our perspective, as Simmons historically gets busier, we've always been the beneficiary of the overflow in the demand. We also expect Mattress Firm to continue to heavyweight their private label programs. We're in exclusive supply agreements with those 2 vendors. And to go back though, we are, we continue to be very enthused about the silly introduction of Quantum Edge. We think -- we know that, that product was extremely well-received at retail. And we expect significant demand there as well. What I think is most notable about the announcements and the decisions, and I'm not going to get into why the decisions were made. That's none of our business. What had said and Mattress Firm has said and SSP sort of Simmons have said, is we are going to jointly or individually but from an industry perspective, have a significant impact by increased consumer-faced advertising spend. Frankly, Select Comfort has been on their own, investing in a lot of odd dollars over the last couple of years. Mattress Firm, certainly, participates in advertising. But with elections last year, you just didn't see a lot of ad spend. You would see significant ad spend by all of those players. That historically is really good for the bedding industry. It's what the industry has been lacking the last few years. While we use that baseline of 2% unit growth, I would probably bias it up based on these announcements because of that investment and consumer awareness. So we'll see how it all sorts out. I think it'll be good for the consumer. Perry, do you have anything?"

We are pleased with our 2016 operational performance despite the challenging demand environment that persisted throughout the year in many of our markets. We thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world. Their efforts during this past year were impactful and are very much appreciated. 
For 2017, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and further increases in earnings per share. Our businesses are extremely well-positioned for long-term profitable growth, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve the 2019 targets that we provided last September. 
Fourth quarter sales decreased 4% to $904 million, largely due to 4 small divestitures completed in the past 12 months. Unit volume was up slightly. 
Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.60, compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter last year. The current fourth quarter earnings included a $0.07 per share benefit from a divestiture gain and the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.07 per share reduction from a lump sum pension buyout and a litigation settlement. Excluding these unusual items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings decreased to $0.53 per share from $0.64 last year. This reduction was due in large part to rapid inflation in steel cost in late 2016 versus significant deflation in steel that was occurring in late 2015. The effects in both years were amplified by LIFO accounting. 
The commodity impact on earnings was partially offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate and a reduced share count. 
For the full year, sales decreased 4%, with 2% unit volume growth and small acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel costs and currency impact.
Full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.62 from $2.27 in 2015. Current year earnings included a $0.13 per share benefit, primarily from divestiture gains, and in the prior year, included a $0.09 per share reduction from unusual items. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.49 from $2.36 in 2015. This increase was largely due to lower effective tax rate related to a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and reduced share count. The earnings benefit from unit volume growth during the year was more than offset by recent steel inflation and the non-reocurrence of the pricing lag benefit that we experienced in late 2015. 
In 2015, steel costs deflated significantly, especially during the fourth quarter, and our earnings benefited from the normal lag we experienced in adjusting selling prices. This cost deflation ultimately led to lower selling prices, which impacted our sales growth throughout 2016. 
In recent months, steel costs have begun to rapidly inflate. We are implementing price increases to recover this recent inflation. 
Our commitment to portfolio management over the last several years has resulted in higher margins and returns and stronger strategic positioning for the company as a whole. 
During 2016, we completed 3 small acquisitions, including a manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies, a distributor of geosynthetic products and a South African innerspring manufacturer. We also purchased the remaining minority interest in a key automotive joint venture in China and continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities in Automotive and Bedding. 
During the year, we completed the divestiture of 4 small businesses with annual revenue of approximately $100 million. This included a wire products business sold in late December that resulted in a pretax gain of $16 million or $0.07 per share. 
In September, we have outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for long-term revenue growth of 6% to 9%. We believe the macro environment, driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue our focus on content gains and new program awards across our businesses, and therefore, expect to grow organically at a rate faster than our markets. 
Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth. Margin expansion and share repurchases should each contribute to long-term TSR, and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. 
In short, we remain fully committed to our long-standing goal of achieving total shareholder return that ranks in the top third of the S&P 500.
In November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to the management organizational structure in our segments. As a reminder, effective January 1, Perry Davis was promoted to Executive Vice President and is now President of Residential Products and Industrial Products segments. Also effective January 1, Mitch Dolloff was promoted to executive Vice President and is now President of the Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments. 
We continue to report under the prior management structure throughout the end of 2016, so all of the segment commentary that we make today is based upon the historical reporting format. 
In Residential Furnishings, fourth quarter same-location sales were down 7%. Unit volume decreased 5%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%. 
Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories, excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 4%; innerspring units decreased 5%; and boxspring unit volume was down 7%; Comfort Core units decreased 6% during the quarter; International Spring sales increased 3%; home furniture component sales were down slightly with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business down 2%; and motion hardware unit volume down 1%. 
Segment EBIT increased during the quarter as a result of lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these charges, EBIT decreased primarily from lower unit volume, partially offset by continued pricing discipline. 
Adjusted EBIT margin improved slightly, in part due to the lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales. For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 6%. Unit volume was down 3%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Commodity deflation and currency impacts also reduced sales by 3%. U.S. innerspring units were down 6%, and Comfort Core units were up 4% for the year. 
Full year segment EBIT increased as a result of a $7 million benefit from a litigation settlement and lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these items, EBIT for the year decreased slightly, with lower unit volume largely offset by pricing discipline. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 50 basis points to 10.7%, in part due to lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales.
In the commercial products segment, fourth quarter same-location sales were flat. Adjustable Bed units grew 4%, and Work Furniture sales were up slightly. But these increases were offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed. 
Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily from a favorable sales mix and a $1 million gain from a building sale. For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 1%. Adjustable Bed units were up slightly for the year. The segments' full year EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved 150 basis points to 8.3%, primarily from operational improvements, gains from building sales of $3 million and a favorable sales mix.
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales were down 4% from steel-related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel costs. Unit volume was essentially flat in the quarter. Total sales also decreased as a result of divestitures. The segment EBIT increased significantly in the quarter due to a $16 million gain from a sale of a wire products business and a non-recurrence from a $3 million loss from last year's divestiture of the steel tubing business. Excluding these unusual items, fourth quarter adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin decreased largely due to recent steel cost inflation that have not yet been recovered through selling price increases. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 25% from a combination of divestitures, steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume. The segment's full year EBIT increased due to the divestiture gain and the non-recurrence of a prior year impairment charge and divestiture loss. 
Excluding these unusual items, EBIT was down slightly, with the impact from lower sales largely offset by operational improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 290 basis points to 10.1%, in part from the divestiture of lower-margin businesses. 
In the Specialized Product segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased 4% with continued strength in Automotive, partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in Machinery and Aerospace. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 15%; Machinery sales decreased 23%; and Aerospace same-location sales were down 9% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved primarily from higher unit volume and currency impact. Full year total sales in the segment grew 6% with a 9% volume increase in a small acquisition, partially offset by divestitures and currency impact. 
Strong performance in our Automotive business drove the majority of the sales growth. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 13% for the full year. The segment's full year EBIT benefited from an $11 million divestiture gain, partially offset by a $4 million goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these unusual items, EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved, primarily from higher sales and currency impact. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

In 2016, we generated very strong operating cash flow of $553 million, which included $25 million of after-tax litigation settlement proceeds. Operating cash flow continues to benefit from a sharp focus on working capital management. 
We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 9.4%. In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represented a $0.02 per share or 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings, and we have been within that range each of the past 2 years. 
Looking forward, we would expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. 
At yesterday's closing price of $47.19, the current dividend yield is 2.9%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
We repurchased 400,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $47.10. For the full year, we repurchased 4.5 million shares at an average price of $46.52, and issued 2.4 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. 
During the year, we expanded the capacity under our revolver and commercial paper program from $600 million to $750 million, and extended the term by 2 years to 2021. We ended 2016 with over $550 million available under the commercial paper program, and our net debt to net capital ratio was at 34%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended 2016 with debt at 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2016, we generated compound annual TSR of 20% per year, and that performance placed us within the top 11% of the S&P 500.
As Karl mentioned earlier, we believe the macro environment should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. Even more importantly, we expect to grow organically at a faster pace than our markets as a result of content gains and new program awards. 
As we enter 2017 with renewed inflation, we also expect sales to increase from the pass-through of higher commodity costs although there will be lag in timing, which typically occurs when we adjust our own selling prices. 
With this collective backdrop for 2017, we are forecasting another year of strong performance. Sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion or up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid-single-digit unit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Geo Components. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by small acquisitions, and as just mentioned, raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth.
We expect 2017 earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75. Bridging from our 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.49, we therefore expect earnings to grow from between 2% to 10%. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher unit volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we typically experience in recovering increased raw material costs. 
We expect the largest impact from the pricing lag to occur during the first quarter. We also anticipate a higher effective full year tax rate of approximately 26% this year. Of course, this tax rate estimate is assuming that current laws do not change in 2017.
Based upon this guidance, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 12.8% and 13.5%. Operating cash flow should exceed $450 million in 2017, with working capital increases attributable to sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. 
Dividends should require about $185 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $150 million for the year. 
As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized towards competitively advantaged acquisitions. 
Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisition come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. 
No specific repurchase commitment or time table has been established, however, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million to 4 million shares in 2017 and issue approximately 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
With those calls, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

So to take that a step further and think about by quarter and then our total sales guidance, I would -- obviously, we've talked about mid-single unit volume growth. Think of unit volume growth as strengthening as the year progresses. Some of those new programs and products ramp up. Inflation is the other part of our forecast for sales. And I would also allow for inflation increasing, particularly in second quarter, third quarter. This is the impact on sales, of course, based on recent commodity trends. And then to kind of complete the view of all-in sales, completed divestitures and small acquisitions that we know about right now would effectively offset in the year. Now you usually go on to ask about a sort of segment level assumption around that midpoint sales growth, so I'll offer that up too with the comment around residential being, call it, mid-single digit; commercial, much stronger than that, more like mid-teens. And again, the growth that we've got in adjustables that also in Work Furniture will contribute to that. Industrial would be flat. We do have some carry-on impact from divestitures that have been completed in 2016, but we expect that to be offset by steel inflation and some higher volume. And then specialized as it's been doing, likely growing high single digits. So when you blend all that together, you get back to that midpoint, call it, 6.5%, 7% all-in sales growth for the full year."

And I thought he should answer the questions, and he thought I should answer the questions. And he's bigger than I am. So I guess, I'll take a swing at it and Perry will interject at any time that he wants, that you are right. Serta appears to be the primary beneficiary. In Mattress Firm's announcement, they specifically cited a exclusive launch of the iSeries product line, which has a lot of our product in it. And iComfort, which to us, it's a foam product. There are some hybrid iComforts that are good for us. We'll get all of the foundations related to those products. As regards capacity, that's really a sort of Simmons question. There's capacity in the market, there's always the ability to flex shifts. I was told yesterday that a majority of the Serta facilities are running single shift. They can ramp those to a second shift. The majority of the Simmons facilities were running 2 shifts, but there's capacity. From our perspective, as Simmons historically gets busier, we've always been the beneficiary of the overflow in the demand. We also expect Mattress Firm to continue to heavyweight their private label programs. We're in exclusive supply agreements with those 2 vendors. And to go back, though, we are, we continue to be very enthused about the Sealy introduction of Quantum Edge. We think that -- we know that, that product was extremely well-received at retail. And we expect significant demand there as well. What I think is most notable about the announcements and the decisions, and I'm not going to get into why the decisions were made, that's none of our business, but what Tempur Sealy has said and Mattress Firm has said and SSB, Serta Simmons, have said, is we are going to jointly or individually, but from an industry perspective, have a significant impact by increased consumer-faced advertising spend. Frankly, Select Comfort has been on their own, investing in a lot of odd dollars over the last couple of years. Mattress Firm certainly participates in advertising, but with elections last year, you just didn't see a lot of ad spend. You will see significant ad spend by all of those players. That historically is really good for the bedding industry. It's what the industry has been lacking the last few years. While we use that baseline of 2% unit growth, I would probably bias it up based on these announcements because of that investment and consumer awareness. So we'll see how it all sorts out. I think it'll be good for the consumer. Perry, do you have anything?"

We are pleased with our 2016 operational performance despite the challenging demand environment that persisted throughout the year in many of our markets. We thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world. Their efforts during this past year were impactful and are very much appreciated. 
For 2017, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and further increases in earnings per share. Our businesses are extremely well-positioned for long-term profitable growth, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve the 2019 targets that we provided last September. 
Fourth quarter sales decreased 4% to $904 million, largely due to 4 small divestitures completed in the past 12 months. Unit volume was up slightly. 
Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.60, compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter last year. The current fourth quarter earnings included a $0.07 per share benefit from a divestiture gain and the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.07 per share reduction from a lump sum pension buyout and a litigation settlement. Excluding these unusual items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings decreased to $0.53 per share from $0.64 last year. This reduction was due in large part to rapid inflation in steel cost in late 2016 versus significant deflation in steel that was occurring in late 2015. The effects in both years were amplified by LIFO accounting. 
The commodity impact on earnings was partially offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate and a reduced share count. 
For the full year, sales decreased 4%, with 2% unit volume growth and small acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel costs and currency impact.
Full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.62 from $2.27 in 2015. Current year earnings included a $0.13 per share benefit, primarily from divestiture gains, and in the prior year, included a $0.09 per share reduction from unusual items. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.49 from $2.36 in 2015. This increase was largely due to lower effective tax rate related to a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and reduced share count. The earnings benefit from unit volume growth during the year was more than offset by recent steel inflation and the non-reoccurrence of the pricing lag benefit that we experienced in late 2015. 
In 2015, steel costs deflated significantly, especially during the fourth quarter, and our earnings benefited from the normal lag we experienced in adjusting selling prices. This cost deflation ultimately led to lower selling prices, which impacted our sales growth throughout 2016. 
In recent months, steel costs have begun to rapidly inflate. We are implementing price increases to recover this recent inflation. 
Our commitment to portfolio management over the last several years has resulted in higher margins and returns and stronger strategic positioning for the company as a whole. 
During 2016, we completed 3 small acquisitions, including a manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies, a distributor of geosynthetic products and a South African innerspring manufacturer. We also purchased the remaining minority interest in a key automotive joint venture in China and continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities in Automotive and Bedding. 
During the year, we completed the divestiture of 4 small businesses with annual revenue of approximately $100 million. This included a wire products business sold in late December that resulted in a pretax gain of $16 million or $0.07 per share. 
In September, we outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for long-term revenue growth of 6% to 9%. We believe the macro environment, driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue our focus on content gains and new program awards across our businesses, and therefore, expect to grow organically at a rate faster than our markets. 
Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth. Margin expansion and share repurchases should each contribute to long-term TSR, and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. 
In short, we remain fully committed to our long-standing goal of achieving total shareholder return that ranks in the top third of the S&P 500.
In November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to the management organizational structure in our segments. As a reminder, effective January 1, Perry Davis was promoted to Executive Vice President and is now President of Residential Products and Industrial Products segments. Also effective January 1, Mitch Dolloff was promoted to executive Vice President and is now President of the Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments. 
We continue to report under the prior management structure throughout the end of 2016, so all of the segment commentary that we make today is based upon the historical reporting format. 
In Residential Furnishings, fourth quarter same-location sales were down 7%. Unit volume decreased 5%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%. 
Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 4%; innerspring units decreased 5%; and boxspring unit volume was down 7%; Comfort Core units decreased 6% during the quarter; International Spring sales increased 3%; home furniture component sales were down slightly with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business down 2%; and motion hardware unit volume down 1%. 
Segment EBIT increased during the quarter as a result of lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these charges, EBIT decreased primarily from lower unit volume, partially offset by continued pricing discipline. 
Adjusted EBIT margin improved slightly, in part due to the lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales. For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 6%. Unit volume was down 3%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Commodity deflation and currency impacts also reduced sales by 3%. U.S. innerspring units were down 6%, and Comfort Core units were up 4% for the year. 
Full year segment EBIT increased as a result of a $7 million benefit from a litigation settlement and lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these items, EBIT for the year decreased slightly, with lower unit volume largely offset by pricing discipline. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 50 basis points to 10.7%, in part due to lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales.
In the commercial products segment, fourth quarter same-location sales were flat. Adjustable Bed units grew 4%, and Work Furniture sales were up slightly. But these increases were offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed. Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily from a favorable sales mix and a $1 million gain from a building sale. For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 1%. Adjustable Bed units were up slightly for the year. The segment’s full year EBIT increased, and EBIT margin improved 150 basis points to 8.3%, primarily from operational improvements, gains from building sales of $3 million and a favorable sales mix.
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales were down 4% from steel-related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel costs. Unit volume was essentially flat in the quarter. Total sales also decreased as a result of divestitures. The segment EBIT increased significantly in the quarter due to a $16 million gain from the sale of a wire products business and a non-recurrence from a $3 million loss from last year's divestiture of the steel tubing business. Excluding these unusual items, fourth quarter adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin decreased largely due to recent steel cost inflation that have not yet been recovered through selling price increases. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 25% from a combination of divestitures, steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume. The segment's full year EBIT increased due to the divestiture gain and the non-recurrence of a prior year impairment charge and divestiture loss. 
Excluding these unusual items, EBIT was down slightly, with the impact from lower sales largely offset by operational improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 290 basis points to 10.1%, in part from the divestiture of lower-margin businesses. 
In the Specialized Product segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased 4% with continued strength in Automotive, partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in Machinery and Aerospace. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 15%; Machinery sales decreased 23%; and Aerospace same-location sales were down 9% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT grew, and EBIT margin improved primarily from higher unit volume and currency impact. Full year total sales in the segment grew 6% with a 9% volume increase and a small acquisition, partially offset by divestitures and currency impact. 
Strong performance in our Automotive business drove the majority of the sales growth. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 13% for the full year. The segment's full year EBIT benefited from an $11 million divestiture gain, partially offset by a $4 million goodwill impairment charge. Excluding these unusual items, EBIT grew and EBIT margin improved, primarily from higher sales and currency impact. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

In 2016, we generated very strong operating cash flow of $553 million, which included $25 million of after-tax litigation settlement proceeds. Operating cash flow continues to benefit from a sharp focus on working capital management. 
We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 9.4%. In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represented a $0.02 per share or 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings, and we have been within that range each of the past 2 years. 
Looking forward, we would expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. 
At yesterday's closing price of $47.19, the current dividend yield is 2.9%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
We repurchased 400,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $47.10. For the full year, we repurchased 4.5 million shares at an average price of $46.52 and issued 2.4 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. 
During the year, we expanded the capacity under our revolver and commercial paper program from $600 million to $750 million and extended the term by 2 years to 2021. We ended 2016 with over $550 million available under the commercial paper program, and our net debt to net capital ratio was at 34%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended 2016 with debt at 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2016, we generated compound annual TSR of 20% per year, and that performance placed us within the top 11% of the S&P 500.
As Karl mentioned earlier, we believe the macro environment should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. Even more importantly, we expect to grow organically at a faster pace than our markets as a result of content gains and new program awards. 
As we enter 2017 with renewed inflation, we also expect sales to increase from the pass-through of higher commodity costs although there will be lag in timing, which typically occurs when we adjust our own selling prices. 
With this collective backdrop for 2017, we are forecasting another year of strong performance. Sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion or up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid-single-digit unit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Geo Components. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by small acquisitions, and as just mentioned, raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth.
We expect 2017 earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75. Bridging from our 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.49, we therefore expect earnings to grow from between 2% to 10%. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher unit volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we typically experience in recovering increased raw material costs. 
We expect the largest impact from the pricing lag to occur during the first quarter. We also anticipate a higher effective full year tax rate of approximately 26% this year. Of course, this tax rate estimate is assuming that current laws do not change in 2017.
Based upon this guidance, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 12.8% and 13.5%. Operating cash flow should exceed $450 million in 2017, with working capital increases attributable to sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. 
Dividends should require about $185 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $150 million for the year. 
As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. 
Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisition come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. 
No specific repurchase commitment or time table has been established, however, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million to 4 million shares in 2017 and issue approximately 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
With those calls, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

So to take that a step further and think about by quarter and then our total sales guidance, I would -- obviously, we've talked about mid-single unit volume growth. Think of unit volume growth as strengthening as the year progresses. Some of those new programs and products ramp up. Inflation is the other part of our forecast for sales. And I would also allow for inflation increasing, particularly in second quarter, third quarter. This is the impact on sales, of course, based on recent commodity trends. And then to kind of complete the view of all-in sales, completed divestitures and small acquisitions that we know about right now would effectively offset in the year. Now you usually go on to ask about a sort of segment level assumption around that midpoint sales growth, so I'll offer that up, too, with the comment around residential being, call it, mid-single digit; commercial, much stronger than that, more like mid-teens. And again, the growth that we've got in adjustables but also in Work Furniture will contribute to that. Industrial would be flat. We do have some carry-on impact from divestitures that have been completed in 2016, but we’d expect that to be offset by steel inflation and some higher volume. And then specialized as it's been doing, likely growing high single digits. So when you blend all that together, you get back to that midpoint, call it, 6.5%, 7% all-in sales growth for the full year."

So that capital is the best money that we can spend and feel really good about that $150 million forecast. If there's a bias, it could be slightly higher. But it will all be steeped in every one of those programs having excellent returns for our shareholders. In the out-years, I would assume $150 million at this point. I don't have any better data."

And I thought he should answer the questions, and he thought I should answer the questions. And he's bigger than I am. So I guess, I'll take a swing at it and Perry will interject at any time that he wants, that you are right. Serta appears to be the primary beneficiary. In Mattress Firm's announcement, they specifically cited a exclusive launch of the iSeries product line, which has a lot of our product in it. And iComfort, which to us, it's a foam product. There are some hybrid iComforts that are good for us. We'll get all of the foundations related to those products. As regards capacity, that's really a sort of Simmons question. There's capacity in the market, there's always the ability to flex shifts. I was told yesterday that the majority of the Serta facilities are running single shift. They can ramp those to a second shift. The majority of the Simmons facilities were running 2 shifts, but there's capacity. From our perspective, as Simmons historically gets busier, we've always been the beneficiary of the overflow in the demand. We also expect Mattress Firm to continue to heavyweight their private label programs. We're in exclusive supply agreements with those 2 vendors. And to go back, though, we are, we continue to be very enthused about the Sealy introduction of Quantum Edge. We think that -- we know that, that product was extremely well-received at retail. And we expect significant demand there as well. What I think is most notable about the announcements and the decisions, and I'm not going to get into why the decisions were made, that's none of our business, but what Tempur Sealy has said and Mattress Firm has said and SSB, Serta Simmons have said, is we are going to jointly or individually, but from an industry perspective, have a significant impact by increased consumer-faced advertising spend. Frankly, Select Comfort has been on their own investing in a lot of ad dollars over the last couple of years. Mattress Firm certainly participates in advertising, but with elections last year, you just didn't see a lot of ad spend. You will see significant ad spend by all of those players. That historically is really good for the bedding industry. It's what the industry has been lacking the last few years. While we use that baseline of 2% unit growth, I would probably bias it up based on these announcements because of that investment and consumer awareness. So we'll see how it all sorts out. I think it'll be good for the consumer. Perry, do you have anything?"

On aerospace, I think a couple of factors at play, namely, we had some really aggressive pricing in our North America tube operations that I think cost us some market share. We've adjusted our pricing to be more competitive as appropriate there, and we think that we've stabilized. We also have experienced some year-over-year declines in the space business that we have in that area, and that business is inherently less steady. So it tends to come and go year-to-year. So I do think that we'll see some positive impact in 2017 in the Aerospace business. Our operations in Europe and our tube-forming operations continue to perform really well. So it's more an issue of getting our pricing correct in this North American tube market. On the Machineries side, the first half of the year was really strong and it started to slow down in the second half as some of our major bedding customers curtailed their capital spending.

We are pleased with our 2016 operational performance despite the challenging demand environment that persisted throughout the year in many of our markets. We thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world. Their efforts during this past year were impactful and are very much appreciated. 
For 2017, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and further increases in earnings per share. Our businesses are extremely well-positioned for long-term profitable growth, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve the 2019 targets that we provided last September. 
Fourth quarter sales decreased 4% to $904 million, largely due to 4 small divestitures completed in the past 12 months. Unit volume was up slightly. 
Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.60, compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter last year. The current fourth quarter earnings included a $0.07 per share benefit from a divestiture gain and the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.07 per share reduction from a lump sum pension buyout and a litigation settlement. Excluding these unusual items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings decreased to $0.53 per share from $0.64 last year. This reduction was due in large part to rapid inflation in steel cost in late 2016 versus significant deflation in steel that was occurring in late 2015. The effects in both years were amplified by LIFO accounting. 
The commodity impact on earnings was partially offset in the quarter by a lower effective tax rate and a reduced share count. 
For the full year, sales decreased 4%, with 2% unit volume growth and small acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel costs and currency impact.
Full year earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $2.62 from $2.27 in 2015. Current year earnings included a $0.13 per share benefit, primarily from divestiture gains, and in the prior year, included a $0.09 per share reduction from unusual items. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.49 from $2.36 in 2015. This increase was largely due to lower effective tax rate related to a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and reduced share count. The earnings benefit from unit volume growth during the year was more than offset by recent steel inflation and the non-reoccurrence of the pricing lag benefit that we experienced in late 2015. 
In 2015, steel costs deflated significantly, especially during the fourth quarter, and our earnings benefited from the normal lag we experienced in adjusting selling prices. This cost deflation ultimately led to lower selling prices, which impacted our sales growth throughout 2016. 
In recent months, steel costs have begun to rapidly inflate. We are implementing price increases to recover this recent inflation. 
Our commitment to portfolio management over the last several years has resulted in higher margins and returns and stronger strategic positioning for the company as a whole. 
During 2016, we completed 3 small acquisitions, including a manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies, a distributor of geosynthetic products and a South African innerspring manufacturer. We also purchased the remaining minority interest in a key automotive joint venture in China and continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities in Automotive and Bedding. 
During the year, we completed the divestiture of 4 small businesses with annual revenue of approximately $100 million. This included a wire products business sold in late December that resulted in a pretax gain of $16 million or $0.07 per share. 
In September, we outlined our TSR framework, including an expectation for long-term revenue growth of 6% to 9%. We believe the macro environment, driven by consumer confidence, housing, employment, wages and interest rates should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. In addition, we continue our focus on content gains and new program awards across our businesses, and therefore, expect to grow organically at a rate faster than our markets. 
Strategic acquisitions are also expected to add to long-term growth. Margin expansion and share repurchases should each contribute to long-term TSR, and our commitment to dividend growth is unwavering. 
In short, we remain fully committed to our long-standing goal of achieving total shareholder return that ranks in the top third of the S&P 500.
In November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to the management organizational structure in our segments. As a reminder, effective January 1, Perry Davis was promoted to Executive Vice President and is now President of Residential Products and Industrial Products segments. Also effective January 1, Mitch Dolloff was promoted to executive Vice President and is now President of the Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments. 
We continue to report under the prior management structure throughout the end of 2016, so all of the segment commentary that we make today is based upon the historical reporting format. 
In Residential Furnishings, fourth quarter same-location sales were down 7%. Unit volume decreased 5%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Raw material-related price deflation and currency reduced sales by 2%. 
Sales trends for the major businesses and product categories excluding deflation and currency were as follows: U.S. Spring component dollar sales decreased 4%; innerspring units decreased 5%; and boxspring unit volume was down 7%; Comfort Core units decreased 6% during the quarter; International Spring sales increased 3%; home furniture component sales were down slightly with sales in the seating and sofa sleeper business down 2%; and motion hardware unit volume down 1%. 
Segment EBIT increased during the quarter as a result of lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these charges, EBIT decreased primarily from lower unit volume, partially offset by continued pricing discipline. 
Adjusted EBIT margin improved slightly, in part due to the lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales. For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 6%. Unit volume was down 3%, about half of which resulted from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Commodity deflation and currency impacts also reduced sales by 3%. U.S. innerspring units were down 6%, and Comfort Core units were up 4% for the year. 
Full year segment EBIT increased as a result of a $7 million benefit from a litigation settlement and lower foam litigation expense. Excluding these items, EBIT for the year decreased slightly, with lower unit volume largely offset by pricing discipline. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 50 basis points to 10.7%, in part due to lower Adjustable Bed pass-through sales.
In the commercial products segment, fourth quarter same-location sales were flat. Adjustable Bed units grew 4%, and Work Furniture sales were up slightly. But these increases were offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed. Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily from a favorable sales mix and a $1 million gain from a building sale. For the full year, total sales in the segment grew 1%. Adjustable Bed units were up slightly for the year. The segment’s full year EBIT increased, and EBIT margin improved 150 basis points to 8.3%, primarily from operational improvements, gains from building sales of $3 million and a favorable sales mix.
In the Industrial Materials segment, fourth quarter same-location sales were down 4% from steel-related price decreases that had occurred before the recent spike in steel costs. Unit volume was essentially flat in the quarter. Total sales also decreased as a result of divestitures. The segment EBIT increased significantly in the quarter due to a $16 million gain from the sale of a wire products business and a non-recurrence from a $3 million loss from last year's divestiture of the steel tubing business. Excluding these unusual items, fourth quarter adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT margin decreased largely due to recent steel cost inflation that have not yet been recovered through selling price increases. 
For the full year, total sales in the segment decreased 25% from a combination of divestitures, steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume. The segment's full year EBIT increased due to the divestiture gain and the non-recurrence of a prior year impairment charge and divestiture loss. 
Excluding these unusual items, EBIT was down slightly, with the impact from lower sales largely offset by operational improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 290 basis points to 10.1%, in part from the divestiture of lower-margin businesses. 
In the Specialized Product segment, fourth quarter same-location sales increased 4% with continued strength in Automotive, partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in Machinery and Aerospace. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 15%; Machinery sales decreased 23%; and Aerospace same-location sales were down 9% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT grew, and EBIT margin improved primarily from higher unit volume and currency impact. Full year total sales in the segment grew 6% with a 9% volume increase and a small acquisition, partially offset by divestitures and currency impact. 
Strong performance in our Automotive business drove the majority of the sales growth. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales increased 13% for the full year. The segment's full year EBIT benefited from an $11 million divestiture gain, partially offset by a $4 million goodwill impairment charge.

In 2016, we generated very strong operating cash flow of $553 million, which included $25 million of after-tax litigation settlement proceeds.

In 2016, we generated very strong operating cash flow of $553 million, which included $25 million of after-tax litigation settlement proceeds. Operating cash flow continues to benefit from a sharp focus on working capital management. 
We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 9.4%. In November, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share, which represented a $0.02 per share or 6% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Our target range for dividend payout is 50% to 60% of net earnings, and we have been within that range each of the past 2 years. 
Looking forward, we would expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. 
At yesterday's closing price of $47.19, the current dividend yield is 2.9%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
We repurchased 400,000 shares of our stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $47.10. For the full year, we repurchased 4.5 million shares at an average price of $46.52 and issued 2.4 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
Our financial base remains very strong, and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. 
During the year, we expanded the capacity under our revolver and commercial paper program from $600 million to $750 million and extended the term by 2 years to 2021. We ended 2016 with over $550 million available under the commercial paper program, and our net debt to net capital ratio was at 34%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%. 
We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended 2016 with debt at 1.6x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. 
For the 3-year period that ended on December 31, 2016, we generated compound annual TSR of 20% per year, and that performance placed us within the top 11% of the S&P 500.
As Karl mentioned earlier, we believe the macro environment should support modest growth in our end markets over the next few years. Even more importantly, we expect to grow organically at a faster pace than our markets as a result of content gains and new program awards. 
As we enter 2017 with renewed inflation, we also expect sales to increase from the pass-through of higher commodity costs although there will be lag in timing, which typically occurs when we adjust our own selling prices. 
With this collective backdrop for 2017, we are forecasting another year of strong performance. Sales from continuing operations are expected to be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion or up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid-single-digit unit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Geo Components. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by small acquisitions, and as just mentioned, raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth.
We expect 2017 earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75. Bridging from our 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.49, we therefore expect earnings to grow from between 2% to 10%. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher unit volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we typically experience in recovering increased raw material costs. 
We expect the largest impact from the pricing lag to occur during the first quarter. We also anticipate a higher effective full year tax rate of approximately 26% this year. Of course, this tax rate estimate is assuming that current laws do not change in 2017.
Based upon this guidance, we currently expect a full year EBIT margin between 12.8% and 13.5%. Operating cash flow should exceed $450 million in 2017, with working capital increases attributable to sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. 
Dividends should require about $185 million of cash, and capital expenditures should approximate $150 million for the year. 
As has been our practice, after funding capital expenditures and dividends, remaining cash flow will be prioritized toward competitively advantaged acquisitions. 
Potential acquisitions must meet stringent strategic and financial criteria. Should no acquisition come to fruition and if excess cash flow is available, we have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. 
No specific repurchase commitment or time table has been established, however, we currently expect to repurchase between 3 million to 4 million shares in 2017 and issue approximately 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
With those calls, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

So to take that a step further and think about by quarter and then our total sales guidance, I would -- obviously, we've talked about mid-single unit volume growth. Think of unit volume growth as strengthening as the year progresses. Some of those new programs and products ramp up. Inflation is the other part of our forecast for sales. And I would also allow for inflation increasing, particularly in second quarter, third quarter. This is the impact on sales, of course, based on recent commodity trends. And then to kind of complete the view of all-in sales, completed divestitures and small acquisitions that we know about right now would effectively offset in the year. Now you usually go on to ask about a sort of segment level assumption around that midpoint sales growth, so I'll offer that up, too, with the comment around residential being, call it, mid-single digit; commercial, much stronger than that, more like mid-teens. And again, the growth that we've got in adjustables but also in Work Furniture will contribute to that. Industrial would be flat. We do have some carry-on impact from divestitures that have been completed in 2016, but we’d expect that to be offset by steel inflation and some higher volume. And then specialized as it's been doing, likely growing high single digits. So when you blend all that together, you get back to that midpoint, call it, 6.5%, 7% all-in sales growth for the full year."

And I thought he should answer the questions, and he thought I should answer the questions. And he's bigger than I am. So I guess, I'll take a swing at it and Perry will interject at any time that he wants, that you are right. Serta appears to be the primary beneficiary. In Mattress Firm's announcement, they specifically cited a exclusive launch of the iSeries product line, which has a lot of our product in it. And iComfort, which to us, it's a foam product. There are some hybrid iComforts that are good for us. We'll get all of the foundations related to those products. As regards capacity, that's really a sort of Simmons question. There's capacity in the market, there's always the ability to flex shifts. I was told yesterday that the majority of the Serta facilities are running single shift. They can ramp those to a second shift. The majority of the Simmons facilities were running 2 shifts, but there's capacity. From our perspective, as Simmons historically gets busier, we've always been the beneficiary of the overflow in the demand. We also expect Mattress Firm to continue to heavyweight their private label programs. We're in exclusive supply agreements with those 2 vendors. And to go back, though, we are, we continue to be very enthused about the Sealy introduction of Quantum Edge. We think that -- we know that, that product was extremely well-received at retail. And we expect significant demand there as well. What I think is most notable about the announcements and the decisions, and I'm not going to get into why the decisions were made, that's none of our business, but what Tempur Sealy has said and Mattress Firm has said and SSB, Serta Simmons have said, is we are going to jointly or individually, but from an industry perspective, have a significant impact by increased consumer-faced advertising spend. Frankly, Select Comfort has been on their own investing in a lot of ad dollars over the last couple of years. Mattress Firm certainly participates in advertising, but with elections last year, you just didn't see a lot of ad spend. You will see significant ad spend by all of those players. That historically is really good for the bedding industry. It's what the industry has been lacking the last few years. While we use that baseline of 2% unit growth, I would probably bias it up based on these announcements because of that investment and consumer awareness. So we'll see how it all sorts out. I think it'll be good for the consumer. Perry, do you have anything?"

So I do think that we'll see some positive impact in 2017 in the Aerospace business. Our operations in Europe and our tube-forming operations continue to perform really well. So it's more an issue of getting our pricing correct in this North American tube market.

Sales growth improved as the quarter progressed, and earnings were slightly ahead father forecast. For the full year, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and strong earnings. As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 2% to $960 million despite a 3% reduction from prior year divestitures. Organic sales grew 4%, primarily from continued strength in automotive. Acquisitions also added 1% to sales growth. 
First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.62, down slightly from $0.63 in the first quarter last year. The benefit from higher volume and a lower effective tax rate was more than offset by higher steel cost and several smaller factors. Steel cost began to inflate in late 2016, and we have implemented price increases to recover the higher cost. With our typical pricing lag, earnings and margins were compressed in the first quarter as expected but should improve over the remainder of the year. We completed 2 acquisitions during the quarter that should add combined annual revenue of approximately $15 million. The first is a distributor and installer of geosynthetic products and expands the geographic scope and capabilities of our Geo Components business. The second is a manufacturer of surface critical bent tube components supporting the private label finished strategy in our Work Furniture business. 
On April 10, we filed an 8-K discussing changes to our management structure and our segments that were effective January 1. Under the new segment structure, the Home Furnishings group was moved from Residential Products to Furniture Products, and the Machinery group was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products. In addition, LIFO impact will now be recognized within this segment to which it resides. We revised prior year data for comparison purposes.
In the Residential Products segment, first quarter total sales were flat with a 2% decrease in organic sales, offset by acquisitions. Volume grew 2% with demand improving late in the quarter.  However, this growth was offset by lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds, which reduced segment sales by 4%. We will begin to anniversary this headwind in the third quarter. U.S. spring component dollar sales were flat with 6% growth in Comfort Core units and other content gains, offsetting declines in total unit volume. Total innerspring units decreased 4% and boxspring unit volume was down 7% in the quarter. International Spring sales were strong with dollars up 10%. Machinery sales decreased significantly, offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment. Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily due to the absence of last year's FIFO inventory impact and a favorable sales mix in the current quarter. In the first quarter last year, EBIT was negatively impacted as we reduced selling prices while we were still consuming higher cost inventory. In the industrial product segment, first quarter total sales decreased 14%, largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were down 4% with lower volume partially offset by steel-related price increases. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to the lag associated with recovering higher steel cost and lower volume in both rod and wire. In the furniture product segment, first quarter sales were essentially flat. Adjustable Bed sales were 10% and Work Furniture sales also increased. But these improvements were offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed and home furniture. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased, primarily from steel inflation, costs associated with new program launches and a non-reoccurrence of a prior year gain from a building sale of $2 million. In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter organic sales increased 9% with continued strength in automotive and improvements in aerospace, partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in CVP. The prior year divestiture offset part of the organic sales growth. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales grew 14% and aerospace organic sales increased 6% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT was essentially flat and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from higher volume offset by costs associated with growth in automotive, absence of earnings from the prior year divestiture and other smaller items. I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $58 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $54 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. This increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth in new programs, increase in accounts receivables from strengthening sales late in the quarter and the inflation impact of both -- on both inventory and receivables. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.2%, in line with the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect our full year operating cash to exceed $450 million. In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share and extending our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years. The dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%. Therefore, we expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $53.59, the current yield is 2.5%, which is one of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $48.82, and issued 1 million shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. 
As you may recall, for the past few years, we have typically bought more shares of our stock in the first quarter than in each of the other 3 quarters of the year. For all of 2017, we now expect to repurchase a total of 3 million to 4 million shares and issue about 2 million primarily for employee benefit plans. Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital of 40%, at the high-end of our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment, our typically first quarter stock repurchases and increased acquisition activity. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA. And ended the quarter, with debt at 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assessed our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve a TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 14% per year. And that performance currently places us within the top 29% of the S&P 500. Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. Full year sales are anticipated to be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in automotive, bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be offset by acquisitions. We expect full year earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75 versus adjusted EPS of $2.49 in 2016. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we experienced in recovering higher raw material costs, most of which occurred in the first quarter. Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate a 2017 EBIT margin between 12.7% and 13.3%. As previously mentioned, operating cash flows should exceed $450 million in 2017, with both working capital investments supporting sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. Capital expenditures should approximate $150 million and dividends should require about $185 million of cash for the year. Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there are still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stock pile cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

The bedding increases range from 5% to 10%. That's probably a good number on home furnitures, especially in Asia. The steel industrial markets would be experiencing similar trend. And to Susan's earlier point, we don't know what's going to happen to steel going forward. Steel is inherently choppy. It's almost impossible to make an intelligent forecast us to what steel will do. As an example, we sit here late April, which are no scrap in May won't settle until middle of May. We don't know scraps going to do. We think it might fall off in that $10 range. But we just frankly don't know. But we have been successful at passing through the price increases as our people typically are."

Sales growth improved as the quarter progressed, and earnings were slightly ahead of our forecast. 
For the full year, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and strong earnings. As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 2% to $960 million despite a 3% reduction from prior year divestitures. Organic sales grew 4%, primarily from continued strength in automotive. Acquisitions also added 1% to sales growth. 
First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.62, down slightly from $0.63 in the first quarter of last year. The benefit from higher volume and a lower effective tax rate was more than offset by higher steel cost and several smaller factors. Steel cost began to inflate in late 2016, and we have implemented price increases to recover the higher cost. With our typical pricing lag, earnings and margins were compressed in the first quarter, as expected, but should improve over the remainder of the year. We completed 2 acquisitions during the quarter that should add combined annual revenue of approximately $50 million. The first is a distributor and installer of geosynthetic products and expands the geographic scope and capabilities of our Geo Components business. The second is a manufacturer of surface critical bent tube components, supporting the private label finished seating strategy in our Work Furniture business. 
On April 10, we filed an 8-K discussing changes to our management structure and our segments that were effective January 1. Under the new segment structure, the Home Furnishings group was moved from Residential Products to Furniture Products, and the Machinery group was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products. In addition, LIFO impact will now be recognized within this segment to which it resides. We revised prior year data for comparison purposes.
In the Residential Products segment, first quarter total sales were flat, with a 2% decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions. Volume grew 2%, with demand improving late in the quarter. However, this growth was offset by lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds, which reduced segment sales by 4%. We will begin to anniversary this headwind in the third quarter. U.S. Spring component dollar sales were flat, with 6% growth in Comfort Core units and other content gains, offsetting declines in total unit volume. Total innerspring units decreased 4%, and boxspring unit volume was down 7% in the quarter. International Spring sales were strong, with dollars up 10%. 
Machinery sales decreased significantly, offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment. Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily due to the absence of last year's FIFO inventory impact and a favorable sales mix in the current quarter. In the first quarter last year, EBIT was negatively impacted, as we reduced selling prices while we were still consuming higher-cost inventory. 
In the Industrial Products segment, first quarter total sales decreased 14%, largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were down 4%, with lower volume partially offset by steel-related price increases. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to the lag associated with recovering higher steel cost and lower volume in both Rod and Wire. 
In the Furniture Products segment, first quarter sales were essentially flat. Adjustable Bed sales grew 10% and Work Furniture sales also increased, but these improvements were offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased, primarily from steel inflation, costs associated with new program launches and a nonreoccurrence of a prior year gain from a building sale of $2 million. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter organic sales increased 9%, with continued strength in Automotive and improvements in Aerospace, partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in CVP. The prior year divestiture offset part of the organic sales growth. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 14%, and Aerospace organic sales increased 6% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT was essentially flat and EBIT margin decreased, with the benefit from higher volume offset by costs associated with growth in Automotive, absence of earnings from the prior year divestiture and other smaller items. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $58 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $54 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital.

Cash from operations was $58 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $54 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. This increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth and new programs, increased accounts receivables from strengthening sales late in the quarter and the inflation impact of both -- on both inventory and receivables. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.2%, in line with the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect our full year operating cash to exceed $450 million. 
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years. The dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%. Therefore, we expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $53.59, the current yield is 2.5%, which is 1of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $48.82, and issued 1 million shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
As you may recall, for the past few years, we have typically bought more shares of our stock in the first quarter than in each of the other 3 quarters of the year. For all of 2017, we now expect to repurchase a total of 3 million to 4 million shares and issue about 2 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital of 40%, at the high-end of our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment, our typically strong first quarter stock repurchases and increased acquisition activity. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 14% per year. And that performance currently places us within the top 29% of the S&P 500. 
Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. Full year sales are anticipated to be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be offset by acquisitions. We expect full year earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75 versus adjusted EPS of $2.49 in 2016. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we experienced in recovering higher raw material costs, most of which occurred in the first quarter. Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate a 2017 EBIT margin between 12.7% and 13.3%. As previously mentioned, operating cash flows should exceed $450 million in 2017, with both working capital investments supporting sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. Capital expenditures should approximate $150 million, and dividends should require about $185 million of cash for the year. 
Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stock pile cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

We did see a pretty good pick up after kind of a sluggish start at the beginning of the year. March was a good month for us. A lot of that you can attribute to the tax refunds, which by the way, were a little bit delayed from the prior year. Right now, in Bedding, the shipments in April are back under last year, about mid-single digits. April and October, historically, over the last few years, are a couple of the weaker months. We are seeing some positive developments, though, with regards to some of those introductions we saw early in the year at in Las Vegas. Those are beginning to filter in to the market now with floor samples being placed in readiness for the upcoming memorial selling, which typically is the -- is kickoff to our busier season on the Bedding side."

Sales growth improved as the quarter progressed, and earnings were slightly ahead of our forecast. 
For the full year, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and strong earnings. As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 2% to $960 million despite a 3% reduction from prior year divestitures. Organic sales grew 4%, primarily from continued strength in automotive. Acquisitions also added 1% to sales growth. 
First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.62, down slightly from $0.63 in the first quarter of last year. The benefit from higher volume and a lower effective tax rate was more than offset by higher steel costs and several smaller factors. Steel cost began to inflate in late 2016, and we have implemented price increases to recover the higher cost. With our typical pricing lag, earnings and margins were compressed in the first quarter, as expected, but should improve over the remainder of the year. We completed 2 acquisitions during the quarter that should add combined annual revenue of approximately $50 million. The first is a distributor and installer of geosynthetic products and expands the geographic scope and capabilities of our Geo Components business. The second is a manufacturer of surface critical bent tube components, supporting the private label finished seating strategy in our Work Furniture business. 
On April 10, we filed an 8-K discussing changes to our management structure and our segments that were effective January 1. Under the new segment structure, the Home Furnishings group was moved from Residential Products to Furniture Products, and the Machinery group was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products. In addition, LIFO impact will now be recognized within this segment to which it resides. We revised prior year data for comparison purposes.
In the Residential Products segment, first quarter total sales were flat, with a 2% decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions. Volume grew 2%, with demand improving late in the quarter. However, this growth was offset by lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds, which reduced segment sales by 4%. We will begin to anniversary this headwind in the third quarter. U.S. Spring component dollar sales were flat, with 6% growth in Comfort Core units and other content gains, offsetting declines in total unit volume. Total innerspring units decreased 4%, and box spring unit volume was down 7% in the quarter. International spring sales were strong, with dollars up 10%. 
Machinery sales decreased significantly, offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment. Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily due to the absence of last year's FIFO inventory impact and a favorable sales mix in the current quarter. In the first quarter last year, EBIT was negatively impacted, as we reduced selling prices while we were still consuming higher-cost inventory. 
In the Industrial Products segment, first quarter total sales decreased 14%, largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were down 4%, with lower volume partially offset by steel-related price increases. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to the lag associated with recovering higher steel cost and lower volume in both Rod and Wire. 
In the Furniture Products segment, first quarter sales were essentially flat. Adjustable Bed sales grew 10% and Work Furniture sales also increased, but these improvements were offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased, primarily from steel inflation, costs associated with new program launches and the nonreoccurrence of a prior year gain from a building sale of $2 million. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter organic sales increased 9%, with continued strength in Automotive and improvements in Aerospace, partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in CVP. The prior year divestiture offset part of the organic sales growth. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 14%, and Aerospace organic sales increased 6% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT was essentially flat and EBIT margin decreased, with the benefit from higher volume offset by costs associated with growth in Automotive, absence of earnings from a prior year divestiture and other smaller items. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $58 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $54 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. This increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth and new programs, increased accounts receivables from strengthening sales late in the quarter and the inflation impact of both -- on both inventory and receivables. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.2%, in line with the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect our full year operating cash to exceed $450 million. 
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years. The dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%. Therefore, we expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $53.59, the current yield is 2.5%, which is 1 of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $48.82, and issued 1 million shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
As you may recall, for the past few years, we have typically bought more shares of our stock in the first quarter than in each of the other 3 quarters of the year. For all of 2017, we now expect to repurchase a total of 3 million to 4 million shares and issue about 2 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital of 40%, at the high-end of our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment, our typically strong first quarter stock repurchases and increased acquisition activity. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 14% per year. And that performance currently places us within the top 29% of the S&P 500. 
Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. Full year sales are anticipated to be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be offset by acquisitions. We expect full year earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75 versus adjusted EPS of $2.49 in 2016. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we experience in recovering higher raw material costs, most of which occurred in the first quarter. Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate a 2017 EBIT margin between 12.7% and 13.3%. As previously mentioned, operating cash flows should exceed $450 million in 2017, with both working capital investments supporting sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. Capital expenditures should approximate $150 million, and dividends should require about $185 million of cash for the year. 
Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stock pile cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

There are businesses as you know that have grown more, and we're investing today to support all of the growth that they're getting out, as an example of that, but there's others too. And Bedding and parts of Bedding where we're growing, we're putting investments in place to support that. So, many businesses do still have spare capacity available.

Sales growth improved as the quarter progressed, and earnings were slightly ahead of our forecast. 
For the full year, we expect market improvement and Leggett initiatives to drive sales growth and strong earnings. As we reported yesterday, first quarter sales increased 2% to $960 million despite a 3% reduction from prior year divestitures. Organic sales grew 4%, primarily from continued strength in automotive. Acquisitions also added 1% to sales growth. 
First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.62, down slightly from $0.63 in the first quarter of last year. The benefit from higher volume and a lower effective tax rate was more than offset by higher steel costs and several smaller factors. Steel cost began to inflate in late 2016, and we have implemented price increases to recover the higher cost. With our typical pricing lag, earnings and margins were compressed in the first quarter, as expected, but should improve over the remainder of the year. We completed 2 acquisitions during the quarter that should add combined annual revenue of approximately $50 million. The first is a distributor and installer of geosynthetic products and expands the geographic scope and capabilities of our Geo Components business. The second is a manufacturer of surface critical bent tube components, supporting the private label finished seating strategy in our Work Furniture business. 
On April 10, we filed an 8-K discussing changes to our management structure and our segments that were effective January 1. Under the new segment structure, the Home Furnishings group was moved from Residential Products to Furniture Products, and the Machinery group was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products. In addition, LIFO impact will now be recognized within this segment to which it resides. We revised prior year data for comparison purposes.
In the Residential Products segment, first quarter total sales were flat, with a 2% decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions. Volume grew 2%, with demand improving late in the quarter. However, this growth was offset by lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds, which reduced segment sales by 4%. We will begin to anniversary this headwind in the third quarter. U.S. Spring component dollar sales were flat, with 6% growth in Comfort Core units and other content gains, offsetting declines in total unit volume. Total innerspring units decreased 4%, and box spring unit volume was down 7% in the quarter. International spring sales were strong, with dollars up 10%. 
Machinery sales decreased significantly, offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment. Segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily due to the absence of last year's FIFO inventory impact and a favorable sales mix in the current quarter. In the first quarter last year, EBIT was negatively impacted, as we reduced selling prices while we were still consuming higher-cost inventory. 
In the Industrial Products segment, first quarter total sales decreased 14%, largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were down 4%, with lower volume partially offset by steel-related price increases. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to the lag associated with recovering higher steel cost and lower volume in both Rod and Wire. 
In the Furniture Products segment, first quarter sales were essentially flat. Adjustable Bed sales grew 10% and Work Furniture sales also increased, but these improvements were offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased, primarily from steel inflation, costs associated with new program launches and the nonreoccurrence of a prior year gain from a building sale of $2 million. 
In the Specialized Products segment, first quarter organic sales increased 9%, with continued strength in Automotive and improvements in Aerospace, partially offset by currency impact and lower volume in CVP. The prior year divestiture offset part of the organic sales growth. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 14%, and Aerospace organic sales increased 6% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT was essentially flat and EBIT margin decreased, with the benefit from higher volume offset by costs associated with growth in Automotive, absence of earnings from a prior year divestiture and other smaller items. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $58 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $54 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital.

Cash from operations was $58 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $54 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased working capital. This increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth and new programs, increased accounts receivables from strengthening sales late in the quarter and the inflation impact of both -- on both inventory and receivables. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.2%, in line with the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect our full year operating cash to exceed $450 million. 
In February, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years. The dividend payout as a percentage of adjusted earnings is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%. Therefore, we expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $53.59, the current yield is 2.5%, which is 1 of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats. We repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock in the first quarter at an average price of $48.82, and issued 1 million shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises.
As you may recall, for the past few years, we have typically bought more shares of our stock in the first quarter than in each of the other 3 quarters of the year. For all of 2017, we now expect to repurchase a total of 3 million to 4 million shares and issue about 2 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
Our financial base remains very strong and this gives us considerable flexibility when making capital and investment decisions. We ended the quarter with net debt to net capital of 40%, at the high-end of our long-standing targeted range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment, our typically strong first quarter stock repurchases and increased acquisition activity. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 1.9x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 14% per year. And that performance currently places us within the top 29% of the S&P 500. 
Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. Full year sales are anticipated to be $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, up 5% to 8% versus 2016. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be offset by acquisitions. We expect full year earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.75 versus adjusted EPS of $2.49 in 2016. This guidance assumes that the benefit from higher volume will be partially offset by the pricing lag we experience in recovering higher raw material costs, most of which occurred in the first quarter. Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate a 2017 EBIT margin between 12.7% and 13.3%. As previously mentioned, operating cash flows should exceed $450 million in 2017, with both working capital investments supporting sales growth and inflation expected to be a use of cash. Capital expenditures should approximate $150 million, and dividends should require about $185 million of cash for the year. 
Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stock pile cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

So we feel good about our ability to continue to deliver that double-digit kind of growth that we have been.

Our best guess is it's under $100 million, and it is widely variable by business. There are businesses as you know that have grown more, and we're investing today to support all of the growth that they're getting out, as an example of that, but there's others too. And Bedding and parts of Bedding where we're growing, we're putting investments in place to support that. So, many businesses do still have spare capacity available. When volume does come back into those places, we see a nice benefit from incremental margins. But more broadly across the company, you're going to see relatively lower incrementals because of the costs that are being invested to support the growth. Still good, but not probably at quite that high of a range."

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of sales growth despite weak demand in several of our businesses. For the full year, we continue to expect sales growth and strong earnings. S",611,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our second quarter call. Yesterday, we reported another quarter of sales growth despite weak demand in several of our businesses. For the full year, we continue to expect sales growth and strong earnings. Second quarter sales increased 3% to $989 million. Organic sales grew 4% from continued strength in automotive and Adjustable Bed and raw material-related price inflation. Divestitures completed in the last 12 months reduced sales 2.2% while acquisitions added 1.8% to sales growth. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64 versus $0.72 in the second quarter 2016. Compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $0.66 in the second quarter, EPS declined $0.02. Adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus second quarter last year, primarily due to the pricing lag associated with passing along higher raw material costs. The second quarter EBIT margin of 12.4% is a 290 basis point decrease from second quarter 2016 reported EBIT, and a 140 basis point decreased from second quarter 2016 adjusted EBIT. Price increases went into effect during the quarter to recover higher steel costs. But we had not fully worked through our typical 90-day pricing lag. Earnings and margins continue to be compressed during the second quarter but should improve over the remainder of the year. Given our second quarter results and continued softness in some of our end markets, we have narrowed our full year EPS guidance on a 1% lower sales outlook. Matt will discuss our 2017 guidance in a few minutes.
Now to the segments. In Residential Products, second quarter sales were flat with 3% decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions. Lower pass-through sales of Adjustable Beds reduced segment sales by 4%. Volume decreased an additional 1%, offset by a 2% sales increase from raw material-related price inflation. As a reminder, the Adjustable Bed sales headwind will begin to anniversary in the third quarter.
U.S. spring component dollar sales were down 6%. Innerspring units were down 8%, with a 2% decrease in Comfort Core units. Boxspring unit volumes was down 6% in the quarter. International spring sales were strong with dollars up 11%. Machinery sales decreased significantly, primarily from a large sale in 2016 that did not repeat, offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment.
Setting aside last year's litigation gain, segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily due to the pass-through raw material cost increases in the second quarter and a favorable sales mix. In the Industrial Products segment, second quarter total sales decreased 7%, largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were up 1% with steel-related price increases offsetting lower volumes. The Industrial segment's EBIT and EBIT margin are more directly affected by raw material price increases and the lag in passing those increases along. The second quarter EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher raw material costs and lower volume. In the furniture product segments, second quarter sales increased 7%. Adjustable bed sales grew 29%. Work furniture and home furniture sales also increased. These gains were partially offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased primarily from an unfavorable sales mix and raw material cost increases. In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter organic sales increased 5% with continued strength in Automotive and Aerospace, partially offset by currency impacts and declines in CVP. Excluding currency changes, automotive sales grew 11% and aerospace organic sales increased 7% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin were down slightly, with the benefit from higher volume offset by growth-related costs in automotive, higher raw material cost and other smaller items. I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter, a decrease of $53 million versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. This working capital increase resulted",581,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter, a decrease of $53 million versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. This working capital increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth in new programs, increased accounts receivable and the inflation impact on both inventory and accounts receivables. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.8%. We expect our full year operating cash to approximate $450 million as use of cash for the full year, capital expenditures should approximate $160 million and dividends should require about $185 million. In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the second quarter of 2016. The dividend payout, as a percentage of adjusted earnings, is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%. And we continue to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $51.79, the current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's dividend aristocrats.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 200,000 shares of our stock and issued 20,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. For the full year, we currently expect to repurchase around 3 million shares and issue approximately 1.5 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. As always, our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there are still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the second quarter with net debt to net capital of 39%. Due to the high-end of our long-standing range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment and our typically large first quarter stock repurchases. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt of 2x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 11% per year. That performance places us within the top 39% of the S&P 500. As we announced yesterday, we've lowered our sales guidance for 2017. Full year sales are now anticipated to be $3.9 billion to $4.0 billion or up 4% to 7% versus 2016. 
We expect low to mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by acquisitions in 2017. We are narrowing our 2017 EPS guidance, and now expect full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 to $2.65 per share versus our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75, thereby, lowering the midpoint of our guidance by $0.10 to $2.60. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

So as a percentage of what we're shipping, it's still a relatively high percentage and growing. I think in the quarter, we shipped 36% of our shipments were in the Comfort Core category. But again, we saw the quarter get tougher as it went along. Now I would add to that though, in looking at the last 3 weeks during July now, we're encouraged by some stronger year-on-year numbers that we've seen. So hopefully,  we'll begin to see a little bit of the turmoil that's affected the industry over the first half of the year begin to settle out.

That's always been the case with steel commodities. But right now, it looks like things are relatively stable. We anticipate scrap rod pricing to be relatively stable, at least, through August. As you are aware, there are numerous things that have been going on behind the scenes in the steel market with the potential for the 2 32 action by the President. There is an ongoing anti-dumping case against 10 geographies that we will see commerce review in August. So there's some uncertainty out there. The 2 32 action now looks like it's been delayed on into the first part of next year. So don't really know what the effects of that will eventually be. But it looks like as of now, that's kind of been set back on the back burner a little bit. The dumping case, if it should go through, I think there's a reasonable chance of going forward if we see scrap fall slightly. We would probably see rod not move if scrap goes up, I believe, we'll see rod go up. Probably give a little bit more leverage to those rod producers in the marketplace."

But nonetheless, our DSOs out a little bit longer than what we would thought and our inventories are just a tad longer. So we feel very good about where our operating cash flow, obviously, is positioned, and again,  where the cash is going. You also notices relative to uses of cash, we bought back most of the shares already this year. We're earmarking about 3 million for the full pace of 2017 in order, about 2.4 million thereabouts as we sit here today. So no surprises in the operating cash flow story except that, again, working capital is a bit higher right now, but we'll make sure that's managed well."

And there's -- the pain has been a little bit spread across the board. There is no doubt that what happened in the last few months within the industry and the turmoil and the remixing of the ingredients it's not helped the situation. Now we talked about last quarter the fact that increased promotional activity in general should be good for us. And we believe it is and will be. But I don't believe it's been able, to this point, to offset the overall macro demand environment. As we go forward, and that promotional activity stays in the pace it is or probably even picks up as we get towards Labor Day weekend selling period, I think we'll begin to see the effects of that. There's no question our demand and the demand of our customers and retailers is directly correlated to the amount of promotional activity that goes on."

So really it's just working capital component really that is a little bit difficult to predict just because of the pieces involved there whether it's inventory what's happening in that asset category accounts receivable, obviously, and offset by payables. It is very clear, as you know, in our seasonality that in the third and fourth quarter, particularly in the fourth quarter is a significant time frame where we generate cash coming out of working capital. So if you look at the first 6 months of this year and having had working capital collectively bracketed about $110 million on our operating cash flow, that's higher than what we would expect it, probably $30 million higher than what we would have expected at this point in time. But then again, as we go to the back half of the year, we expect that to be a positive number bringing down that full year impact. And just my opinion, I think there's a bias that will do better than approximately $450 million. But we'll see. Again, some things in that mix are a bit harder to predict.

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of sales growth despite weak demand in several of our businesses. For the full year, we continue to expect sales growth and strong earnings. S",613,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our second quarter call. Yesterday, we reported another quarter of sales growth despite weak demand in several of our businesses. For the full year, we continue to expect sales growth and strong earnings. Second quarter sales increased 3% to $989 million. Organic sales grew 4% from continued strength in Automotive and Adjustable Bed and raw material-related price inflation. Divestitures completed in the last 12 months reduced sales 2.2% while acquisitions added 1.8% to sales growth. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64 versus $0.72 in the second quarter 2016. Compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $0.66 in the second quarter, EPS declined $0.02. Adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus second quarter last year, primarily due to the pricing lag associated with passing along higher raw material costs. The second quarter EBIT margin of 12.4% is a 290 basis point decrease from second quarter 2016 reported EBIT, and a 140 basis point decrease from second quarter 2016 adjusted EBIT. Price increases went into effect during the quarter to recover higher steel costs, but we had not fully worked through our typical 90-day pricing lag. Earnings and margins continue to be compressed during the second quarter but should improve over the remainder of the year. Given our second quarter results and continued softness in some of our end markets, we have narrowed our full year EPS guidance on a 1% lower sales outlook. Matt will discuss our 2017 guidance in a few minutes.
Now to the segments. In Residential Products, second quarter sales were flat with a 3% decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions. Lower pass-through sales of Adjustable Beds reduced segment sales by 4%. Volume decreased an additional 1%, offset by a 2% sales increase from raw material-related price inflation. As a reminder, the Adjustable Bed sales headwind will begin to anniversary in the third quarter.
U.S. Spring component dollar sales were down 6%. Innerspring units were down 8%, with a 2% decrease in Comfort Core units. Boxspring unit volume was down 6% in the quarter. International Spring sales were strong with dollars up 11%. Machinery sales decreased significantly, primarily from a large sale in 2016 that did not repeat, offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment.
Setting aside last year's litigation gain, segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily due to the pass-through of raw material cost increases in the second quarter and a favorable sales mix. 
In the Industrial Products segment, second quarter total sales decreased 7%, largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were up 1% with steel-related price increases offsetting lower volumes. The Industrial segment's EBIT and EBIT margin are more directly affected by raw material price increases and the lag in passing those increases along. The second quarter EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher raw material costs and lower volume. In the Furniture Products segment, second quarter sales increased 7%. Adjustable Bed sales grew 29%. Work furniture and home furniture sales also increased. These gains were partially offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased primarily from an unfavorable sales mix and raw material cost increases.
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter organic sales increased 5% with continued strength in Automotive and Aerospace, partially offset by currency impacts and declines in CVP. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 11% and Aerospace organic sales increased 7% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin were down slightly, with the benefit from higher volume offset by growth-related costs in automotive, higher raw material cost and other smaller items. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter, a decrease of $53 million versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. This working capital increase resulted",587,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter, a decrease of $53 million versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. This working capital increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth in new programs, increased accounts receivable and the inflation impact on both inventory and accounts receivables. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.8%. We expect our full year operating cash to approximate $450 million as use of cash for the full year, capital expenditures should approximate $160 million and dividends should require about $185 million.
In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the second quarter of 2016. The dividend payout, as a percentage of adjusted earnings, is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%. And we continue to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $51.79 (sic) [ $51.83 ], the current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 200,000 shares of our stock and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. For the full year, we currently expect to repurchase around 3 million shares and issue approximately 1.5 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
As always, our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there are still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the second quarter with net debt to net capital of 39%. Due to the high end of our long-standing target range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment and our typically large first quarter stock repurchases. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt of 2x our trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 11% per year. That performance places us within the top 39% of the S&P 500. As we announced yesterday, we've lowered our sales guidance for 2017. Full year sales are now anticipated to be $3.9 billion to $4.0 billion or up 4% to 7% versus 2016. 
We expect low to mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by acquisitions in 2017. We are narrowing our 2017 EPS guidance, and now expect full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 to $2.65 per share versus our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75, thereby, lowering the midpoint of our guidance by $0.10 to $2.60.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

So as a percentage of what we're shipping, it's still a relatively high percentage and growing. I think in the quarter, we shipped -- 36% of our shipments were in the Comfort Core category. But again, we saw the quarter get tougher as it went along. Now I would add to that though, in looking at the last 3 weeks during July now, we're encouraged by some stronger year-on-year numbers that we've seen. So hopefully, we'll begin to see a little bit of the turmoil that's affected the industry over the first half of the year begin to settle out. And hopefully, with all the 4 placements in place now that we can see a more normalized business rate as we go into the third quarter."

That's always the case with steel commodities. But right now, it looks like things are relatively stable. We anticipate scrap rod pricing to be relatively stable, at least, through August. As you are aware, there are numerous things that have been going on behind the scenes in the steel market with the potential for the 232 action by the President. There is an ongoing anti-dumping case against 10 geographies that we will see commerce review in August. So there's some uncertainty out there. The 232 action now looks like it's been delayed on into the first part of next year. So I don't really know what the effects of that will eventually be. But it looks like as of now, that's kind of been set back on the back burner a little bit. The dumping case, if it should go through, I think there's a reasonable chance of going forward. If we see scrap fall slightly, we would probably see rod not move. If scrap goes up, I believe, we'll see rod go up. Probably give a little bit more leverage to those rod producers in the marketplace."

Again, something we're excited about doing because those are supporting organic growth opportunities. But nonetheless, our DSO is out a little bit longer than what we would have thought and our inventories are just a tad longer. So we feel very good about where our operating cash flow, obviously, is positioned, and again, where that cash has been going. You will also notice, just relative to uses of cash, we bought back most of the shares already this year. We're earmarking about 3 million for the full pace of 2017 in order, about 2.4 million thereabouts as we sit here today. So no surprises in the operating cash flow story except that, again, working capital is a bit higher right now, but we'll make sure that's managed well."

So really it's just the working capital component really that is a little bit difficult to predict just because of the pieces involved there, whether it's inventory, what's happening in that asset category accounts receivable, obviously, and offset by payables. It is very clear, as you know, in our seasonality that in the third and fourth quarter, particularly, the fourth quarter has a significant time frame where we generate cash coming out of working capital. So if you look at the first 6 months of this year and having had working capital collectively bracketed about $110 million on our operating cash flow, that's higher than what we would have expected, probably about $30 million higher than what we would have expected at this point in time. But then again, as we go to the back half of the year, we expect that to be a positive number bringing down that full year impact.

But I would again, reiterate, just like Karl did on the capital spending side, that these dollars we feel really good about where they're going because they're underpinning our organic growth game plan in many of our business units."

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of sales growth despite weak demand in several of our businesses. For the full year, we continue to expect sales growth and strong earnings. S",613,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our second quarter call. Yesterday, we reported another quarter of sales growth despite weak demand in several of our businesses. For the full year, we continue to expect sales growth and strong earnings. Second quarter sales increased 3% to $989 million. Organic sales grew 4% from continued strength in Automotive and Adjustable Bed and raw material-related price inflation. Divestitures completed in the last 12 months reduced sales 2.2% while acquisitions added 1.8% to sales growth. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64 versus $0.72 in the second quarter 2016. Compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $0.66 in the second quarter, EPS declined $0.02. Adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus second quarter last year, primarily due to the pricing lag associated with passing along higher raw material cost. The second quarter EBIT margin of 12.4% is a 290 basis point decrease from second quarter 2016 reported EBIT, and a 140 basis point decrease from second quarter 2016 adjusted EBIT. Price increases went into effect during the quarter to recover higher steel cost, but we had not fully worked through our typical 90-day pricing lag. Earnings and margins continue to be compressed during the second quarter but should improve over the remainder of the year. Given our second quarter results and continued softness in some of our end markets, we have narrowed our full year EPS guidance on a 1% lower sales outlook. Matt will discuss our 2017 guidance in a few minutes.
Now to the segments. In Residential Products, second quarter sales were flat with a 3% decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions. Lower pass-through sales of Adjustable Beds reduced segment sales by 4%. Volume decreased an additional 1%, offset by a 2% sales increase from raw material-related price inflation. As a reminder, the Adjustable Bed sales headwind will begin to anniversary in the third quarter.
U.S. Spring component dollar sales were down 6%. Innerspring units were down 8%, with a 2% decrease in Comfort Core units. Boxspring unit volume was down 6% in the quarter. International Spring sales were strong with dollars up 11%. Machinery sales decreased significantly, primarily from a large sale in 2016 that did not repeat, offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment.
Setting aside last year's litigation gain, segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily due to the pass-through of raw material cost increases in the second quarter and a favorable sales mix. 
In the Industrial Products segment, second quarter total sales decreased 7%, largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were up 1% with steel-related price increases offsetting lower volumes. The Industrial segment's EBIT and EBIT margin are more directly affected by raw material price increases and the lag in passing those increases along. The second quarter EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher raw material costs and lower volume. In the Furniture Products segment, second quarter sales increased 7%. Adjustable Bed sales grew 29%. Work furniture and home furniture sales also increased. These gains were partially offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased primarily from an unfavorable sales mix and raw material cost increases.
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter organic sales increased 5% with continued strength in Automotive and Aerospace, partially offset by currency impacts and declines in CVP. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 11% and Aerospace organic sales increased 7% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin were down slightly, with the benefit from higher volume offset by growth-related costs in automotive, higher raw material cost and other smaller items. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter, a decrease of $53 million versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. This working capital increase resulted",587,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter, a decrease of $53 million versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. This working capital increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth in new programs, increased accounts receivable and the inflation impact on both inventory and accounts receivables. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.8%. We expect our full year operating cash to approximate $450 million as uses of cash for the full year, capital expenditures should approximate $160 million and dividends should require about $185 million.
In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the second quarter of 2016. The dividend payout, as a percentage of adjusted earnings, is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%. And we continue to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $51.79 (sic) [ $51.83 ], the current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 200,000 shares of our stock and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. For the full year, we currently expect to repurchase around 3 million shares and issue approximately 1.5 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
As always, our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there are still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the second quarter with net debt to net capital of 39%. Due to the high end of our long-standing target range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment and our typically large first quarter stock repurchases. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 2x our trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 11% per year. That performance places us within the top 39% of the S&P 500. As we announced yesterday, we've lowered our sales guidance for 2017. Full year sales are now anticipated to be $3.9 billion to $4.0 billion or up 4% to 7% versus 2016. 
We expect low to mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by acquisitions in 2017. We are narrowing our 2017 EPS guidance, and now expect full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 to $2.65 per share versus our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75, thereby, lowering the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 to $2.60.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

So as a percentage of what we're shipping, it's still a relatively high percentage and growing. I think in the quarter, we shipped -- 36% of our shipments were in the Comfort Core category. But again, we saw that the quarter get tougher as it went along. Now I would add to that though, in looking at the last 3 weeks during July now, we're encouraged by some stronger year-on-year numbers that we've seen. So hopefully, we'll begin to see a little bit of the turmoil that's affected the industry over the first half of the year begin to settle out.

That's always the case with steel commodities. But right now, it looks like things are relatively stable. We anticipate scrap rod pricing to be relatively stable, at least, through August. As you are aware, there are numerous things that have been going on behind the scenes in the steel market with the potential for the 232 action by the President. There is an ongoing anti-dumping case against 10 geographies that we will see commerce review in August. So there's some uncertainty out there. The 232 action now looks like it's been delayed on into the first part of next year. So I don't really know what the effects of that will eventually be. But it looks like as of now, that's kind of been set back on the back burner a little bit. The dumping case, if it should go through, I think there's a reasonable chance of going forward. If we see scrap fall slightly, we would probably see rod not move. If scrap goes up, I believe, we'll see rod go up. Probably give a little bit more leverage to those rod producers in the marketplace."

I mean, the operating cash flow now as of -- for the full year approximately $450 million is really representing a little bit higher investment in working capital than we would have anticipated through the first half of this year. Again, something we're excited about doing because those are supporting organic growth opportunities. But nonetheless, our DSO is out a little bit longer than what we would have thought and our inventories are just a tad longer. So we feel very good about where our operating cash flow, obviously, is positioned, and again, where that cash has been going. You will also notice, just relative to uses of cash, we bought back most of the shares already this year. We're earmarking about 3 million for the full pace of 2017 in order, about 2.4 million thereabouts as we sit here today. So no surprises in the operating cash flow story except that, again, working capital is a bit higher right now, but we'll make sure that's managed well."

There is no doubt that with what's happened over the last few months within the industry and the turmoil and the remixing of the ingredients, it's not helped the situation. Now we talked about last quarter the fact that increased promotional activity, in general, should be good for us. And we believe it is and will be. But I don't believe it's been able, to this point, to offset the overall macro demand environment. As we go forward, and that promotional activity stays at the pace it is or possibly even picks up as we get towards the Labor Day weekend selling period, I think we'll begin to see the effects of that. There's no question our demand and the demand of our customers and retailers is directly correlated to the amount of promotional activity that goes on."

But the third kind of leg of that stool is the continued penetration of both Quantum Edge and microcoils. So the adoption of that product category by a broader subset of U.S.-based manufacturers continues to grow. So to your question that it was just, then to Perry's point, it was just a bizarrely odd, unpredictable, nobody could have predicted the disruption in the bedding market in the second quarter.

There is strength in Europe, that's significant. But also South America and Mexico, we've had significant market share gains there as well. So there's pockets of demand.

In the first half of the year, we estimate should exceed $450 million. So really it's just the working capital component really that is a little bit difficult to predict just because of the pieces involved there, whether it's inventory, what's happening in that asset category, accounts receivable, obviously, and offset by payables. It is very clear, as you know, in our seasonality that in the third and fourth quarter, particularly, the fourth quarter is a significant time frame where we generate cash coming out of working capital. So if you look at the first 6 months of this year and having had working capital collectively bracketed about $110 million on our operating cash flow, that's higher than what we would have expected, probably about $30 million higher than what we would have expected at this point in time. But then again, as we go to the back half of the year, we expect that to be a positive number bringing down that full year impact. And just my opinion, but I think, certainly, there's a bias that we'll do better than approximately $450 million, but we'll see. Again, some things in that mix that are a bit harder to predict. But I would again, reiterate, just like Karl did on the capital spending side, that these dollars we feel really good about where they're going because they're underpinning our organic growth game plan in many of our business units."

Yesterday, we reported another quarter of sales growth despite weak demand in several of our businesses. For the full year, we continue to expect sales growth and strong earnings. S",613,"Good morning, and thank you for participating in our second quarter call. Yesterday, we reported another quarter of sales growth despite weak demand in several of our businesses. For the full year, we continue to expect sales growth and strong earnings. Second quarter sales increased 3% to $989 million. Organic sales grew 4% from continued strength in Automotive and Adjustable Bed and raw material-related price inflation. Divestitures completed in the last 12 months reduced sales 2.2% while acquisitions added 1.8% to sales growth. Second quarter earnings per share were $0.64 versus $0.72 in the second quarter 2016. Compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $0.66 in the second quarter, EPS declined $0.02. Adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus second quarter last year, primarily due to the pricing lag associated with passing along higher raw material cost. The second quarter EBIT margin of 12.4% is a 290 basis point decrease from second quarter 2016 reported EBIT, and a 140 basis point decrease from second quarter 2016 adjusted EBIT. Price increases went into effect during the quarter to recover higher steel cost, but we had not fully worked through our typical 90-day pricing lag. Earnings and margins continue to be compressed during the second quarter but should improve over the remainder of the year. Given our second quarter results and continued softness in some of our end markets, we have narrowed our full year EPS guidance on a 1% lower sales outlook. Matt will discuss our 2017 guidance in a few minutes.
Now to the segments. In Residential Products, second quarter sales were flat with a 3% decrease in organic sales offset by acquisitions. Lower pass-through sales of Adjustable Beds reduced segment sales by 4%. Volume decreased an additional 1%, offset by a 2% sales increase from raw material-related price inflation. As a reminder, the Adjustable Bed sales headwind will begin to anniversary in the third quarter.
U.S. Spring component dollar sales were down 6%. Innerspring units were down 8%, with a 2% decrease in Comfort Core units. Boxspring unit volume was down 6% in the quarter. International Spring sales were strong with dollars up 11%. Machinery sales decreased significantly, primarily from a large sale in 2016 that did not repeat, offsetting organic growth from the other parts of the segment.
Setting aside last year's litigation gain, segment EBIT increased and EBIT margin improved, primarily due to the pass-through of raw material cost increases in the second quarter and a favorable sales mix. 
In the Industrial Products segment, second quarter total sales decreased 7%, largely from divestitures completed during 2016. Organic sales were up 1% with steel-related price increases offsetting lower volumes. The Industrial segment's EBIT and EBIT margin are more directly affected by raw material price increases and the lag in passing those increases along. The second quarter EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher raw material costs and lower volume. In the Furniture Products segment, second quarter sales increased 7%. Adjustable Bed sales grew 29%. Work furniture and home furniture sales also increased. These gains were partially offset by lower sales in Fashion Bed. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased primarily from an unfavorable sales mix and raw material cost increases.
In the Specialized Products segment, second quarter organic sales increased 5% with continued strength in Automotive and Aerospace, partially offset by currency impacts and declines in CVP. Excluding currency changes, Automotive sales grew 11% and Aerospace organic sales increased 7% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin were down slightly, with the benefit from higher volume offset by growth-related costs in automotive, higher raw material cost and other smaller items. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter, a decrease of $53 million versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. This working capital increase resulted",587,"Thanks, Karl, and good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was $98 million in the quarter, a decrease of $53 million versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. This working capital increase resulted primarily from higher inventory to support sales growth in new programs, increased accounts receivable and the inflation impact on both inventory and accounts receivables. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.8%. We expect our full year operating cash to approximate $450 million as uses of cash for the full year, capital expenditures should approximate $160 million and dividends should require about $185 million.
In May, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the second quarter of 2016. The dividend payout, as a percentage of adjusted earnings, is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%. And we continue to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $51.79 (sic) [ $51.83 ], the current yield is 2.8%, which is one of the higher yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 200,000 shares of our stock and issued 200,000 shares, largely for employee benefit plans and option exercises. For the full year, we currently expect to repurchase around 3 million shares and issue approximately 1.5 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. 
As always, our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there are still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the second quarter with net debt to net capital of 39%. Due to the high end of our long-standing target range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment and our typically large first quarter stock repurchases. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 2x our trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 11% per year. That performance places us within the top 39% of the S&P 500. As we announced yesterday, we've lowered our sales guidance for 2017. Full year sales are now anticipated to be $3.9 billion to $4.0 billion or up 4% to 7% versus 2016. 
We expect low to mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases should also add to sales growth. The sales impact from divestitures completed during 2016 should be largely offset by acquisitions in 2017. We are narrowing our 2017 EPS guidance, and now expect full year earnings from continuing operations of $2.55 to $2.65 per share versus our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75, thereby, lowering the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 to $2.60.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to Dave DeSonier."

That's always the case with steel commodities. But right now, it looks like things are relatively stable. We anticipate scrap rod pricing to be relatively stable, at least, through August. As you are aware, there are numerous things that have been going on behind the scenes in the steel market with the potential for the 232 action by the President. There is an ongoing anti-dumping case against 10 geographies that we will see commerce review in August. So there's some uncertainty out there. The 232 action now looks like it's been delayed on into the first part of next year. So I don't really know what the effects of that will eventually be. But it looks like as of now, that's kind of been set back on the back burner a little bit. The dumping case, if it should go through, I think there's a reasonable chance of going forward. If we see scrap fall slightly, we would probably see rod not move. If scrap goes up, I believe, we'll see rod go up. Probably give a little bit more leverage to those rod producers in the marketplace."

Again, something we're excited about doing because those are supporting organic growth opportunities. But nonetheless, our DSO is out a little bit longer than what we would have thought and our inventories are just a tad longer. So we feel very good about where our operating cash flow, obviously, is positioned, and again, where that cash has been going. You will also notice, just relative to uses of cash, we bought back most of the shares already this year. We're earmarking about 3 million for the full pace of 2017 in order, about 2.4 million thereabouts as we sit here today. So no surprises in the operating cash flow story except that, again, working capital is a bit higher right now, but we'll make sure that's managed well."

In the first half of the year, we estimate should exceed $450 million. So really it's just the working capital component really that is a little bit difficult to predict just because of the pieces involved there, whether it's inventory, what's happening in that asset category, accounts receivable, obviously, and offset by payables. It is very clear, as you know, in our seasonality that in the third and fourth quarter, particularly, the fourth quarter is a significant time frame where we generate cash coming out of working capital. So if you look at the first 6 months of this year and having had working capital collectively bracketed about $110 million on our operating cash flow, that's higher than what we would have expected, probably about $30 million higher than what we would have expected at this point in time. But then again, as we go to the back half of the year, we expect that to be a positive number bringing down that full year impact. And just my opinion, but I think, certainly, there's a bias that we'll do better than approximately $450 million, but we'll see. Again, some things in that mix that are a bit harder to predict. But I would again, reiterate, just like Karl did on the capital spending side, that these dollars we feel really good about where they're going because they're underpinning our organic growth game plan in many of our business units."

Yesterday, we reported strong quarterly sales growth. Third quarter sales increased 6% to $1.01 billion, organic sales also grew 6% from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed and several other businesses, along with raw material related price inflation and currency impact. Acquisitions added 2% to sales growth, but were offset by divestitures, which reduced sales by 2% in the quarter. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61, down 9% versus $0.67 in third quarter 2016. As expected, the benefit from stronger sales was more than offset by higher steel costs, including LIFO expense and the timing lag associated with passing along those higher cost. 
In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation. As a result, adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus third quarter last year and adjusted EBIT margin declined 210 basis points to 11.6%. We have implemented price increases to recover most of this recent steel cost increases, but are experiencing the typical 90-day pricing lag. Assuming steel cost stabilize, market should improve early next year. During the quarter, we divested the last remaining business within our commercial vehicle products group. From this transaction, we will recognize a total $0.06 per share tax benefit, of which $0.04 was recognized in the third quarter and the remainder will be recognized in the fourth quarter. This third quarter tax benefit was offset by a $0.02 per share loss related to the CVP divestiture and a $0.02 per share impairment charge related to a small business. We acquired a producer of [ Rebond ] carpet underlay during the quarter with annual revenue of approximately $20 million. This business adds to the production capacity and geographic footprint of our Carpet Cushion business. 
Now on to the segments. In Residential Products, third quarter total sales increased 6%, with a 2% increase in organic sales and a 4% increase from acquisitions. Volume was flat, with growth in most businesses offset by a 2% sales decrease from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Raw material related price inflation and currency increased sales by 2%. We began to anniversary the Adjustable Bed headwind in the third quarter and the impact on sales will be decreased further over the next few quarters. U.S. Spring component dollar sales were flat with 8% growth and higher Comfort Core units offsetting a 3% decrease in total innerspring units and a 6% decline in boxspring units. 
International Spring sales continue to be very strong, with dollars up 15% in the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin improved, primarily from higher sales. In the Industrial Products segments, third quarter total sales decreased 7% due to divestitures completed in 2016 and a 3% reduction in organic sales. Volume declines were partially offset by steel related price increases. The Industrial segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher steel costs, including LIFO expense. The timing lag associated with passing along inflation, lower volume and a $5 million impairment of a small wire products operation. In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation in this segment. 
In the Furniture Products segment, third quarter sales increased 8%. Organic sales increased 7% to, primarily from growth in Adjustable Bed. A small Work Furniture acquisition completed earlier this year added 1% to sales growth. Adjustable Bed sales grew 35% in the third quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from sales growth in Adjustable Bed and Work Furniture more than offset by steel cost increases, including LIFO expense in Home Furniture. 
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter total sales increased 4%, organic sales increased 9% from continued strength in Automotive and a currency benefit. The CVP divestiture reduced sales by 5%. Excluding currency, Automotive sales grew 8% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from higher sales offset by growth-related costs, currency adjustments and a $3 million loss on the sale of our last remaining CVP business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $105 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million versus the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.6%. We expect our full year operating cash to approximate $425 million. Regarding uses of cash for the full year, capital expenditures should be near $160 million and a dividends should require about $185 million.
In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the third quarter of 2016. The dividend payout, as a percentage of adjusted earnings, is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%, and we can the to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $48.23, our current yield is 3%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of our stock and issued about 400,000 shares. For the first 3 quarters of 2017, we have repurchased 3.3 million shares and issued 1.6 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. As always, our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there's still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpiling cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, those specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with net debt to net capital of 38%, near the higher end of our long standing target range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment, stock repurchases and acquisitions. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 2.1x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 7% per year and that performance places us in the middle of the S&P 500. 
As we announced yesterday, we raised the low end of our sales and earnings guidance. Full year sales are now anticipated to be $3.95 billion to $4 billion or up 5% to 7% over the last year. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material related price increases should also add to sales growth. Divestitures should be largely offset by acquisitions. Full year guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations is now $2.49 to $2.54. These earnings include a net $0.04 per share benefit from several items, including a tax benefit from the CVP divestiture, a CVP divestiture loss and a small impairment charge, along with a real estate gain and an anticipated pension settlement charge, both of which will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Full year adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.45 to $2.50.  Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate the 2017 full year adjusted EBIT margin to approximate 12%. 
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to David."

But some of those continue today where we didn't see those in the last few years. I think in the long run, that's probably a positive thing as the OEMs ramped down production in an effort to balance vehicle inventories at the dealerships. I think that we see -- we're seeing that to be effective, the latest data I see shows that the vehicle inventories are, indeed, coming down from August. And then we see the fourth quarter forecast -- production forecast for North America has been down about 3% year-over-year. So definitely more paying in the third quarter than we see going forward. But that puts the full year year-over-year unit production down somewhere around 3.5%, 3.7%. And then, the longer term forecast is relatively flat. So the '18, the latest forecast shows that 2% unit increase, but -- so, but out during the longer term, probably relatively flat. But remember that, that's not a really high number of vehicles. So at 17.5 million vehicles produced a year in North America, we're happy with that. And then if you remember, we're very much a global business. So if we look across the industry as a whole, I think it still remains very healthy. We see good performance in Europe, in Asia as well. So for what we would consider our major developed markets, I think that long-term CAGR were around 1.5% looks pretty solid. And again, we continue to pledge and are determined to outperform the market. We continue to do so, not only from vehicle unit growth, but increased content gains and different product categories that we're participating in."

We did see strengthening of our business on year-to-year comps as we went through the quarter. As I talked about on the last call, in June, business was not good at all and we began to see just a little bit of improvement in July. And then August and September were considerably better, although still slightly down from last year. One of the big issues right now that many of our customers are dealing with is because of the increased chemical input cost, we're seeing a lot of rising foam cost. And that, in a way, could serve to help us with some of our content gains with regards to Quantum Edge and some of the things that we're doing with upholstery layers made out of springs as opposed to foam. But it will be interesting to see there, the foam cost, we've heard, for the year, for a lot of our customers, increased by 20% to 25%, and those are just simply cost increases that they can't absorb. So I would expect to see some of those costs be passed through to retail."

We did have growth related costs that impacted us in the third quarter year-over-year. Those are mainly investments in fixed overhead that we're making to support our future growth that we've been talking about so much this morning. Those include buildings, equipment, tooling and people. For example, we have ramping up a new plant in China, a new  one in Mexico or we have an expansion under way in Canada. All of those things are to support new programs that we won. We have to ramp up that capacity ahead of the start to production of those programs and then those programs ramp up and hit full volume over time. So it does get a little choppy some time. So yes, I think that the third quarter margin was a little bit lower than it has been historically and we expect to see that improve as those volumes ramp up and start to fill that capacity."

Home Furniture is a little different challenge in that there are -- there's an additional dynamic of steel inflation or deflation in China that is not connected to the timing of inflation or deflation in the U.S. And that industry has been a little bit soft from a demand perspective. So as Mitch said earlier, we certainly had a hard time passing through in the Asian operations a spike in inflation. Now that steel inflation has started to regress somewhat where we saw a 23% increase in flat steel in China over a 2-month period of July and August. Yet we've seen some of that pull back at the same time. We now have an ability to recover some of it from a pricing perspective. U.S. steel is flatter, if that makes sense, that there's been less movement in U.S. steel than there has been in Chinese steel inflation."

Yesterday, we reported strong quarterly sales growth. Third quarter sales increased 6% to $1.01 billion, organic sales also grew 6% from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed and several other businesses, along with raw material related price inflation and currency impact. Acquisitions added 2% to sales growth, but were offset by divestitures, which reduced sales by 2% in the quarter. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61, down 9% versus $0.67 in third quarter of 2016. As expected, the benefit from stronger sales was more than offset by higher steel cost, including LIFO expense and the timing lag associated with passing along those higher cost. 
In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation. As a result, adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus third quarter last year and adjusted EBIT margin declined 210 basis points to 11.6%. We have implemented price increases to recover most of this recent steel cost increases, but are experiencing the typical 90-day pricing lag. Assuming steel cost stabilize, market should improve early next year. During the quarter, we divested the last remaining business within our commercial vehicle products group. From this transaction, we will recognize a total $0.06 per share tax benefit, of which $0.04 was recognized in the third quarter and the remainder will be recognized in the fourth quarter. This third quarter tax benefit was offset by a $0.02 per share loss related to the CVP divestiture and a $0.02 per share impairment charge related to another small business. We acquired a producer of [ Rebond ] carpet underlay during the quarter with annual revenue of approximately $20 million. This business adds to the production capacity and geographic footprint of our Carpet Cushion business.
Now on to the segments. In Residential Products, third quarter total sales increased 6%, with a 2% increase in organic sales and a 4% increase from acquisitions. Volume was flat, with growth in most businesses offset by a 2% sales decrease from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Raw material related price inflation and currency increased sales by 2%. We began to anniversary the Adjustable Bed headwind in the third quarter and the impact on sales will be decreased further over the next few quarters. U.S. Spring component dollar sales were flat with 8% growth in higher content Comfort Core units offsetting a 3% decrease in total innerspring units and a 6% decline in boxspring units.
International Spring sales continue to be very strong, with dollars up 15% in the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin improved, primarily from higher sales. In the Industrial Products segments, third quarter total sales decreased 7% due to divestitures completed in 2016 and a 3% reduction in organic sales. Volume declines were partially offset by steel related price increases. The Industrial segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher steel costs, including LIFO expense. The timing lag associated with passing along inflation, lower volume and a $5 million impairment of a small wire products operation. In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation in the segment.
In the Furniture Products segment, third quarter sales increased 8%. Organic sales increased 7% to, primarily from growth in Adjustable Bed. A small Work Furniture acquisition completed earlier this year added 1% to sales growth. Adjustable Bed sales grew 35% in the third quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from sales growth in Adjustable Bed and Work Furniture more than offset by steel cost increases, including LIFO expense in Home Furniture.
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter total sales increased 4%, organic sales increased 9% from continued strength in Automotive and a currency benefit. The CVP divestiture reduced sales by 5%. Excluding currency, Automotive sales grew 8% in the quarter.

We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.6%. We",588,"Thanks, Karl. And good morning, everyone. Cash from operations was $105 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million versus the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.6%. We expect our full year operating cash to approximate $425 million. Regarding uses of cash for the full year, capital expenditures should be near $160 million and a dividends should require about $185 million.
In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the third quarter of 2016. The dividend payout, as a percentage of adjusted earnings, is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%, and we continue to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $48.23, our current yield is 3%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of our stock and issued about 400,000 shares. For the first 3 quarters of 2017, we have repurchased 3.3 million shares and issued 1.6 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. As always, our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there's still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpiling cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, those specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with net debt to net capital of 38%, near the higher end of our long standing target range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment, stock repurchases and acquisitions. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 2.1x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 7% per year and that performance places us in the middle of the S&P 500. 
As we announced yesterday, we raised the low end of our sales and earnings guidance. Full year sales are now anticipated to be $3.95 billion to $4 billion or up 5% to 7% over the last year. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material related price increases should also add to sales growth. Divestitures should be largely offset by acquisitions. Full year guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations is now $2.49 to $2.54. These earnings include a net $0.04 per share benefit from several items, including a tax benefit from the CVP divestiture, a CVP divestiture loss and a small impairment charge, along with a real estate gain and an anticipated pension settlement charge, both of which will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Full year adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.45 to $2.50.  Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate the 2017 full year adjusted EBIT margin to approximate 12%.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to David."

Definitely, we see some changes in North America for the third quarter. We think production in North America was off about 8% and the real change there is having plant shutdowns over the summer season. But some of those continue today where we didn't see those in the last few years. I think in the long run, that's probably a positive thing as the OEMs ramped down production in an effort to balance vehicle inventories at the dealerships. I think that we see -- we're seeing that to be effective, the latest data I see shows that the vehicle inventories are, indeed, coming down from August. And then we see the fourth quarter forecast -- production forecast for North America has been down about 3% year-over-year. So definitely more paying in the third quarter than we see going forward. But that puts the full year year-over-year unit production down somewhere around 3.5%, 3.7%. And then, the longer term forecast is relatively flat. So the '18, the latest forecast shows that 2% unit increase, but -- so, but out during the longer term, probably relatively flat. But remember that, that's at a really high number of vehicles. So at 17.5 million vehicles produced a year in North America, we're happy with that. And then if you remember, we're very much a global business. So if we look across the industry as a whole, I think it still remains very healthy. See good performance in Europe, in Asia as well. So for what we would consider our major developed markets, I think that long-term CAGR were around 1.5% looks pretty solid. And again, we continue to pledge and are determined to outperform in the market. We continue to do so, not only from vehicle unit growth, but increased content gains and different product categories that we're participating in."

We did see strengthening of our business on year-to-year comps as we went through the quarter. As I talked about on the last call, in June, business was not good at all and we began to see just a little bit of improvement in July. And then August and September were considerably better, although still slightly down from last year. One of the big issues right now that many of our customers are dealing with is because of the increased chemical input cost, we're seeing a lot of rising foam cost. And that, in a way, could serve to help us with some of our content gains with regards to Quantum Edge and some of the things that we're doing with upholstery layers made out of springs as opposed to foam. But it will be interesting to see there, the foam cost, we've heard, for the year, for a lot of our customers, increased by 20% to 25%, and those are just simply cost increases that they can't absorb. So I would expect to see some of those costs be passed through to retail."

They're produced to their specifications and a lot of that is innerspring, specifically Comfort Core. And while we're talking about that, Comfort Core obviously is a category that continues to grow for us year-on-year. But if you look at the quarter, we're up over about 36.5% of the units we sell our Comfort Core. But if you look a little deeper, in September, that was generally a 5-week period for us, 5-week month in our accounting system. Our share of innerspring represent by Comfort Core ramped up about 39% and that is just an indication to me of continued growth of the category, which is good for us. Curious with the higher average in the selling prices."

All of those things are to support new programs that we've won.

So as Mitch said earlier, we certainly had a hard time passing through in the Asian operations a spike in inflation. Now that steel inflation has started to regress somewhat where we saw a 23% increase in flat steel in China over a 2-month period of July and August. Yet we've seen some of that pull back at the same time. We now have an ability to recover some of it from a pricing perspective.

Yesterday, we reported strong quarterly sales growth. Third quarter sales increased 6% to $1.01 [billion], organic sales also grew 6% from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed and several other businesses, along with raw material related price inflation and currency impact. Acquisitions added 2% to sales growth, but were offset by divestitures, which reduced sales by 2% in the quarter. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61, down 9% versus $0.67 in third quarter of 2016. As expected, the benefit from stronger sales was more than offset by higher steel cost, including LIFO expense and the timing lag associated with passing along those higher costs. 
In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation. As a result, adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus third quarter last year and adjusted EBIT margin declined 210 basis points to 11.6%. We have implemented price increases to recover most of these recent steel cost increases, but are experiencing the typical 90-day pricing lag. Assuming steel costs stabilize, market should improve early next year. During the quarter, we divested the last remaining business within our commercial vehicle products group. From this transaction, we will recognize a total $0.06 per share tax benefit, of which $0.04 was recognized in the third quarter and the remainder will be recognized in the fourth quarter. This third quarter tax benefit was offset by a $0.02 per share loss related to the CVP divestiture and a $0.02 per share impairment charge related to another small business. We acquired a producer of rebonded carpet underlay during the quarter with annual revenue of approximately $20 million. This business adds to the production capacity and geographic footprint of our Carpet Cushion business.
Now on to the segments. In Residential Products, third quarter total sales increased 6%, with a 2% increase in organic sales and a 4% increase from acquisitions. Volume was flat, with growth in most businesses offset by a 2% sales decrease from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Raw material related price inflation and currency increased sales by 2%. We began to anniversary the Adjustable Bed headwind in the third quarter and the impact on sales will be decreased further over the next few quarters. U.S. Spring component dollar sales were flat with 8% growth in higher content Comfort Core units offsetting a 3% decrease in total innerspring units and a 6% decline in boxspring units.
International Spring sales continued to be very strong, with dollars up 15% in the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin improved, primarily from higher sales. In the Industrial Products segments, third quarter total sales decreased 7% due to divestitures completed in 2016 and a 3% reduction in organic sales. Volume declines were partially offset by steel related price increases. The Industrial segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher steel costs, including LIFO expense. The timing lag associated with passing along inflation, lower volume and a $5 million impairment of a small wire products operation. In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation in the segment.
In the Furniture Products segment, third quarter sales increased 8%. Organic sales increased 7% primarily from growth in Adjustable Bed. A small Work Furniture acquisition completed earlier this year added 1% to sales growth. Adjustable Bed sales grew 35% in the third quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from sales growth in Adjustable Bed and Work Furniture more than offset by steel cost increases, including LIFO expense in Home Furniture.
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter total sales increased 4%, organic sales increased 9% from continued strength in Automotive and a currency benefit. The CVP divestiture reduced sales by 5%. Excluding currency, Automotive sales grew 8% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from higher sales offset by growth-related costs, currency adjustments and a $3 million loss on the sale of our last remaining CVP business.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $105 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million versus the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.6%. We expect our full year operating cash to approximate $425 million. Regarding uses of cash for the full year, capital expenditures should be near $160 million and dividends should require about $185 million.
In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the third quarter of 2016. The dividend payout, as a percentage of adjusted earnings, is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%, and we continue to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $48.23, our current yield is 3%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of our stock and issued about 400,000 shares. For the first 3 quarters of 2017, we have repurchased 3.3 million shares and issued 1.6 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. As always, our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there's still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpiling cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with net debt to net capital of 38%, near the higher end of our long standing target range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment, stock repurchases and acquisitions. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 2.1x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 7% per year and that performance places us in the middle of the S&P 500. 
As we announced yesterday, we raised the low end of our sales and earnings guidance. Full year sales are now anticipated to be $3.95 billion to $4 billion or up 5% to 7% over the last year. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material related price increases should also add to sales growth. Divestitures should be largely offset by acquisitions. Full year guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations is now $2.49 to $2.54. These earnings include a net $0.04 per share benefit from several items, including a tax benefit from the CVP divestiture, a CVP divestiture loss and a small impairment charge, along with a real estate gain and an anticipated pension settlement charge, both of which will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Full year adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.45 to $2.50.  Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate the 2017 full year adjusted EBIT margin to approximate 12%.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to David."

Definitely, we see some changes in North America for the third quarter. We think production in North America was off about 8% and the real change there is having plant shutdowns over the summer season. But some of those continue today where we didn't see those in the last few years. I think in the long run, that's probably a positive thing as the OEMs ramped down production in an effort to balance vehicle inventories at the dealerships. I think that we see -- we're seeing that to be effective, the latest data I see shows that the vehicle inventories are, indeed, coming down from August. And then we see the fourth quarter forecast -- production forecast for North America being down about 3% year-over-year. So definitely more pain in the third quarter [than] we see going forward. But that puts the full year year-over-year unit production down somewhere around 3.5%, 3.7%. And then, the longer term forecast is relatively flat. So the '18, the latest forecast actually shows that 2% unit increase, but -- so, but out during the longer term, probably relatively flat. But remember that, that's at a really high number of vehicles. So at [17.5 million] vehicles produced a year in North America, we're happy with that. And then if you remember, we're very much a global business. So if we look across the industry as a whole, I think it still remains very healthy. See good performance in Europe, in Asia as well. So for what we would consider our major developed markets, I think that long-term CAGR were around 1.5% looks pretty solid. And again, we continue to pledge and are determined to outperform in the market. We continue to do so, not only from vehicle unit growth, but increased content gains and different product categories that we're participating in."

And in fact, we saw some decreases in scrap, but there were some already announced increases in the rod side of the business. So actually the scrap market right now, compared to the year, for the most part, looks to be relatively stable through the remainder of this year. However, as always, I put a caveat on that, that things can change quickly."

We did see strengthening of our business on year-to-year comps as we went through the quarter. As I talked about on the last call, in June, business was not good at all and we began to see just a little bit of improvement in July. And then August and September were considerably better, although still slightly down from last year. One of the big issues right now that many of our customers are dealing with is because of the increased chemical input cost, we're seeing a lot of rising foam cost. And that, in a way, could serve to help us with some of our content gains with regards to Quantum Edge and some of the things that we're doing with upholstery layers made out of springs as opposed to foam. But it will be interesting to see there, the foam cost, we've heard, for the year, for a lot of our customers, increased by 20% to 25%, and those are just simply cost increases that they can't absorb. So I would expect to see some of those costs be passed through to retail."

So we expect to see continued penetration of Quantum Edge in the category.

I would tell you that our third quarter adjusted tax rate, when you allow for the one-off things that we put in the table at the back of the press release was 24%. And based on what we know right now, an adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter would also be 24%. The change in our guidance from the September release is volume. It's not a change tax rate assumption, it's us getting more confident around kind of that upper half of the volume range and it's kind of a reassessment of where we sit from a steel perspective and confidence and to what -- to the extent that we can have confidence in the volatile steel market that kind of how the next 2 months might look."

By September 20th, we knew that scrap was going to soften some. And had no ability to forecast the softness that we've experienced in October. So the steel industry is very, very difficult to forecast. That as a U.S. steel manufacturer, it really is up to what global demand looks like and what China decides to do."

Yesterday, we reported strong quarterly sales growth. Third quarter sales increased 6% to $1.01 billion. Organic sales also grew 6% from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed and several other businesses, along with raw material related price inflation and currency impact. Acquisitions added 2% to sales growth, but were offset by divestitures, which reduced sales by 2% in the quarter. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61, down 9% versus $0.67 in third quarter of 2016. As expected, the benefit from stronger sales was more than offset by higher steel cost, including LIFO expense and the timing lag associated with passing along those higher costs. 
In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation. As a result, adjusted EBIT decreased in the quarter versus third quarter last year and adjusted EBIT margin declined 210 basis points to 11.6%. We have implemented price increases to recover most of these recent steel cost increases, but are experiencing the typical 90-day pricing lag. Assuming steel costs stabilize, market should improve early next year. During the quarter, we divested the last remaining business within our commercial vehicle products group. From this transaction, we will recognize a total $0.06 per share tax benefit, of which $0.04 was recognized in the third quarter and the remainder will be recognized in the fourth quarter. This third quarter tax benefit was offset by a $0.02 per share loss related to the CVP divestiture and a $0.02 per share impairment charge related to another small business. We acquired a producer of rebonded carpet underlay during the quarter with annual revenue of approximately $20 million. This business adds to the production capacity and geographic footprint of our Carpet Cushion business.
Now on to the segments. In Residential Products, third quarter total sales increased 6%, with a 2% increase in organic sales and a 4% increase from acquisitions. Volume was flat, with growth in most businesses offset by a 2% sales decrease from lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Raw material related price inflation and currency increased sales by 2%. We began to anniversary the Adjustable Bed headwind in the third quarter and the impact on sales will be decreased further over the next few quarters. U.S. Spring component dollar sales were flat with 8% growth in higher content Comfort Core units offsetting a 3% decrease in total innerspring units and a 6% decline in boxspring units.
International Spring sales continued to be very strong, with dollars up 15% in the quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin improved, primarily from higher sales. In the Industrial Products segments, third quarter total sales decreased 7% due to divestitures completed in 2016 and a 3% reduction in organic sales. Volume declines were partially offset by steel related price increases. The Industrial segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased due to higher steel costs, including LIFO expense. The timing lag associated with passing along inflation, lower volume and a $5 million impairment of a small wire products operation. In the third quarter last year, we were still benefiting from steel deflation in the segment.
In the Furniture Products segment, third quarter sales increased 8%. Organic sales increased 7% primarily from growth in Adjustable Bed. A small Work Furniture acquisition completed earlier this year added 1% to sales growth. Adjustable Bed sales grew 35% in the third quarter. Segment EBIT and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from sales growth in Adjustable Bed and Work Furniture more than offset by steel cost increases, including LIFO expense in Home Furniture.
In the Specialized Products segment, third quarter total sales increased 4%, organic sales increased 9% from continued strength in Automotive and a currency benefit. The CVP divestiture reduced sales by 5%. Excluding currency, Automotive sales grew 8% in the quarter. The segment's EBIT and EBIT margin decreased with the benefit from higher sales offset by growth-related costs, currency adjustments and a $3 million loss on the sale of our last remaining CVP business.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Cash from operations was $105 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $18 million versus the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of sales at 11.6%. We expect our full year operating cash to approximate $425 million. Regarding uses of cash for the full year, capital expenditures should be near $160 million and dividends should require about $185 million.
In August, we increased the quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.36 per share, a 5.9% increase versus the third quarter of 2016. The dividend payout, as a percentage of adjusted earnings, is within our targeted range of 50% to 60%, and we continue to expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth. At yesterday's closing price of $48.23, our current yield is 3%, which is one of the highest yields among the 51 companies that comprise the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of our stock and issued about 400,000 shares. For the first 3 quarters of 2017, we have repurchased 3.3 million shares and issued 1.6 million, primarily for employee benefit plans. As always, our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth, dividends and strategic acquisitions. After funding these priorities, if there's still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpiling cash. We have a standing authorization from the board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year. However, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established. 
Our financial base remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with net debt to net capital of 38%, near the higher end of our long standing target range of 30% to 40%, reflecting working capital investment, stock repurchases and acquisitions. We also monitor debt-to-EBITDA and ended the quarter with debt at 2.1x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. For the 3-year period that will end on December 31, 2017, we have so far generated compound annual TSR of 7% per year and that performance places us in the middle of the S&P 500. 
As we announced yesterday, we raised the low end of our sales and earnings guidance. Full year sales are now anticipated to be $3.95 billion to $4 billion or up 5% to 7% over the last year. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth from strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture and Geo Components. Raw material related price increases should also add to sales growth. Divestitures should be largely offset by acquisitions. Full year guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations is now $2.49 to $2.54. These earnings include a net $0.04 per share benefit from several items, including a tax benefit from the CVP divestiture, a CVP divestiture loss and a small impairment charge, along with a real estate gain and an anticipated pension settlement charge, both of which will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Full year adjusted EPS guidance is now $2.45 to $2.50. Based upon this guidance range, we anticipate the 2017 full year adjusted EBIT margin to approximate 12%.
With those comments, I'll now turn the call back over to David."

Definitely, we see some changes in North America for the third quarter. We think production in North America was off about 8% and the real change there is having plant shutdowns over the summer season. But some of those continue today where we didn't see those in the last few years. I think in the long run, that's probably a positive thing as the OEMs ramped down production in an effort to balance vehicle inventories at the dealerships. I think that we see -- we're seeing that to be effective, the latest data I see shows that the vehicle inventories are, indeed, coming down from August. And then we see the fourth quarter forecast -- production forecast for North America being down about 3% year-over-year. So definitely more pain in the third quarter than we see going forward. But that puts the full year year-over-year unit production down somewhere around 3.5%, 3.7%. And then, the longer term forecast is relatively flat. So the '18, the latest forecast actually shows that 2% unit increase, but -- so -- but out during the longer term, probably relatively flat. But remember that, that's at a really high number of vehicles. So at [ 17.5 million ] vehicles produced a year in North America, we're happy with that. And then if you remember, we're very much a global business. So if we look across the industry as a whole, I think it still remains very healthy. See good performance in Europe, in Asia as well. So for what we would consider our major developed markets, I think that long-term CAGR were around 1.5% looks pretty solid. And again, we continue to pledge and are determined to outperform in the market. We continue to do so, not only from vehicle unit growth, but increased content gains and different product categories that we're participating in."

As I talked about on the last call, in June, business was not good at all and we began to see just a little bit of improvement in July. And then August and September were considerably better, although still slightly down from last year. One of the big issues right now that many of our customers are dealing with is because of the increased chemical input cost, we're seeing a lot of rising foam cost. And that, in a way, could serve to help us with some of our content gains with regards to Quantum Edge and some of the things that we're doing with upholstery layers made out of springs as opposed to foam. But it will be interesting to see there, the foam cost, we've heard, for the year, for a lot of our customers, increased by 20% to 25%, and those are just simply cost increases that they can't absorb. So I would expect to see some of those costs be passed through to retail."

In Bedding, there's -- not to say there's never difficulty because it's always a conversation, but those -- the pricing pass-through is so program-specific that we do not have a hard time at all recovering inflation. Home Furniture is a little different challenge in that there are -- there's an additional dynamic of steel inflation or deflation in China that is not connected to the timing of inflation or deflation in the U.S. And that industry has been a little bit soft from a demand perspective. So as Mitch said earlier, we certainly had a hard time passing through in the Asian operations a spike in inflation. Now that steel inflation has started to regress somewhat where we saw a 23% increase in flat steel in China over a 2-month period of July and August. Yet we've seen some of that pull back at the same time. We now have an ability to recover some of it from a pricing perspective. U.S. steel is flatter, if that makes sense, that there's been less movement in U.S. steel than there has been in Chinese steel inflation."

So it's a bit noisy, of course, for some of the tax benefit activity that happened in the third quarter and prospectively in the fourth quarter. And this might be a little bit of help. As you look at 2018, as we sit here today, we're estimating our tax rate will be something around 25% to 26%. Who knows what happens with tax reform, but that's currently what we're ballparking for 2018 as we're thinking about the next 12 months."

We would have been about 24%, I think, it's the last second quarter for our full year assumed tax rate when we announced in early September, we've moved that down to about 23% given a couple more months of progression. I would tell you that our third quarter adjusted tax rate, when you allow for the one-off things that we put in the table at the back of the press release was 24%. And based on what we know right now, an adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter would also be 24%. The change in our guidance from the September release is volume. It's not a change tax rate assumption, it's us getting more confident around kind of that upper half of the volume range and it's kind of a reassessment of where we sit from a steel perspective and confidence and to what -- to the extent that we can have confidence in the volatile steel market that kind of how the next 2 months might look."

But it is volume, but understand, Perry made reference to the steel dynamics in our -- the assumptions that we made over steel inflation on September 6 versus what we experienced is very, very different in that we were expecting significant scrap inflation on September 6 by -- when we pre released. By September 20th, we knew that scrap was going to soften some. And had no ability to forecast the softness that we've experienced in October. So the steel industry is very, very difficult to forecast. That as a U.S. steel manufacturer, it really is up to what global demand looks like and what China decides to do."
