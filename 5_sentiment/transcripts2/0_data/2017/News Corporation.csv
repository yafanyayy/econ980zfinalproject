In the second quarter, we saw the efficacy of our strategic reinvestment and digital diversification. Both were evident in our increased operating profitability in the quarter, when the challenges in the advertising marketplace, which is in the midst of transition, were patent. 
We achieved 16% EBITDA growth year-over-year, driven by strong performance in our Digital Real Estate Services [ph] segment and robust revenues at HarperCollins [ph] , along with appropriate and ongoing management of the cost base at our news [ph].
As noted in the press release, reported earnings were significantly impacted by a noncash reduction in the carrying value of Foxtel [ph] and a noncash impairment charge related to our print properties in Australia, while they also benefit from a onetime gain as a result of the cash proceeds from the sale of REA's [ph] European business.
Revenues overall were relatively stable, adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations. And that came despite the obvious plus 3 [ph] headwinds in print advertising. As I mentioned, our results this quarter demonstrate the profound importance of becoming more diverse, more digital and more global.
Our core platform has been bolstered by our determined expansion in digital real estate, which is well under way to becoming the largest contributor to our profitability. This segment posted another strong quarter, with a 16% year-over-year revenue increase, improved EBITDA margins and sizable audience gains. We are now the largest digital property business in the world with a strong and growing presence in the U.S., Australia, India and East Asia. We're more global, as evidenced by the extension of our publishing footprint with the developments of the international platform we acquired with Harlequin [ph], which has given us greater access to authors and readers in a broader number of languages and regions.
Last month, we announced that we were assuming full ownership of HarperCollins Brazil [ph]. And we're more digital because of strategic investments in our news platforms as well as the influence of our innovative acquisitions, including Storyful, Unruly and Checkout 51 [ph]. 
Our digital focus has helped the News and Information Services [ph] segment garner 27% of its revenues through digital, up from 22% last year. We're also testing our own digital ad network, which will provide a measurable high-quality audience for advertisers, who are increasingly weary, and rightly so, about the murky tenebrous [ph] world of digital advertising.
Thanks to this strategy, we believe we are far better positioned than our perceived peers to weather the storms buffeting the media and publishing landscape. We continue to emphasize the importance of cost control and collaboration between and among our businesses who face similar challenges and are sharing expertise and insight. 
Our mastheads [ph] are committed to producing high-quality content, verified by a talented breed of fact-checkers called journalists. We are in an era in which integrity is priceless, yet digital distributors have long been a platform for the fake, the foe and the fallacious [ph], highlighting an issue which we have long stressed that they have eroded the integrity of content by undermining its  [indiscernibl. Put simply, content distributors are profiting at the expense of content creators and at the expense of veracity [ph].
There are clearly social as well as commercial consequences to this contradiction, and the issue is far from being resolved. A tweak to an algorithm or a fact-check here or there does not address the basic problem. Ad agencies and their programmatic networks are also at fault because they have sometimes artificially aggregated audiences, and these are then plied [ph] with content of dubious provenance. The agencies win, the fabricators of fake win and advertisers and society both lose.
Affinity and integrity are core elements of a sustainable relationship between advertiser and consumer, and yet affinity and integrity are far too often missing in the modern marketplace. Audiences are craving integrity, which is why so many of our mastheads have reported strong growth in readers and subscribers.
As an example, The Wall Street Journal [ph] experienced a significant increase in page, digital page, digital subscribers through the election, adding more than 110,000 in Q2 compared to Q1 and surpassing 1 million, now representing more than 50% of the total subscriber base. This reflects an increased appetite for quality journalism in an era of remarkable upheaval.
And in the ad market, there has been an awakening and there will surely be a reckoning. Advertisers want reassurance that their products are displayed in suitable surroundings. They don't want muddled [ph] metrics, and they don't want digital platforms and ad agencies arbitraging ambiguity. The dangers of Chief Marketing Officers chasing fashion rather than function was highlighted in The Times of London [ph] today. Some of the world's best-known, most prestigious brands are inadvertently funding extremists and hard-core [ph]. I suggest that you read The Times [ph]. It's a subscription site, but that should be no problem for all of you.
We are confident that our premium platforms and our great journalism will ultimately be beneficiaries of this reckoning.
Let us turn to our platforms and business in more detail. At Move [ph], home of realtor.com, we saw a 10% revenue growth, adjusted for the sale of TigerLead [ph] in November. Our headline revenue growth in the quarter was 7%. And as previously indicated, we expect that rate to rise in coming quarters. Importantly, as anticipated, Move contributed $10 million to the increase in segment EBITDA this quarter, and we are confident that contribution will expand in the second half and in years to come.
realtor.com continues to increase traffic versus the prior year and remains the strongest player in the industry in terms of audience engagement. That intensity has helped improve lead volume, always an important measure of potential income for this business. We are acutely conscious of the need to provide an incomparable service for our realtor clients. We are renovating the Move house whilst living in it. One example is the advanced launch of our Advantage product in December, harvesting real-time feedback about potential leads and providing more targeted prominence for realtors' properties.
We continued to develop and rolled out additional products, such as the launch last month of Science Net and Street Pea [ph], which use image recognition and augmented reality technologies to provide consumers with an enhanced experience on their smartphones. And we are driving traffic between realtor.com and our network of new sites, which provide a valuable flow of real estate analysis and intelligence.
In Australia, REA [ph] announced the sale of its European sites during Q2, which they believe lacks scale. The transaction extracted value for all shareholders and allows for a more intense focus on the Asian marketplace with its stronger growth potential.
In January, REA invested in PropTiger, which recently combined with housing.com to become India's largest digital real estate company. News Corp has an existing stake in PropTiger and remains the largest holder in this Indian portal, with a roughly 38% combined stake, reflecting our direct investment and REA's interest. 
For the quarter, REA reported 19% revenue growth, 14% excluding currency impact and continued to drive higher traffic and engagement despite lower listing volumes this quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2017, REA's audience in Australia has remained more than twice the size of its nearest competitor, and visitor spent 7.6 times more time on the site. 
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins experienced strong revenue growth in the quarter and a higher operating margin. As we saw the value of a broad roster of books that appealed to and explained the heartland of America, focusing on all Americans, not just in [indiscernible]. Occasion point is Hillbilly Elegy, with continuing good sales as well as a significant impact on the public discourse in the wake of President Trump's victory in November. 
We had particular success from the Christian Group, which has an empathetic insight into our animates and motivates many Americans that has been the source of several bestsellers in the most recent quarter. Among these is Magnolia Story, which performed well as did the Sarah Young books, Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. 
In the quarter, Megyn Kelly's Settle for More also generated significant revenue and much debate, though it was not a key driver of EBITDA growth. 
Looking ahead, we see other books with broad-based appeal in this fiscal year, including Hidden Figures, the book that is a basis for the eponymous Fox film and Veronica Roth's latest work, Carve The Mark, is also off to a good start. 
At Dow Jones, while advertising remains challenged, the business continues to drive higher circulation revenues through increased digital subscriptions and higher pricing. Work on the WSJ 2020 initiative continues as we accelerate changes to cost structure and management of the business to align it more closely with a digital and mobile future. 
As for print advertising, we are seeing signs of some moderation of declines in Q3. But the market is volatile, and it would be improper to make a firm prediction at this stage. At the New York Post, digital advertising revenues in the quarter exceeded those of print, and the post-digital network had an average monthly audience in the quarter of approximately 58 million, including over 76 million in November, a sign of obvious reader interest in the election and its aftermath. 
News American Marketing was a bright spot, with growing revenues as domestic in-store advertising showed improvement and highlighted the importance of a presence at the point-of-purchase. The positive numbers, despite the investment spending at Checkout 51, our digital app, which now has 12.5 million members and is well ahead of schedule and providing the entire company with a source of value actionable data. 
At News UK, The Times in print materially outperformed its peers based on market share, as evidenced by 9% volume growth year-over-year. The Times and The Sunday Times also expanded their digital subscriptions. The Sun's global digital audience reached approximately 61 million in December, representing more than 150% year-over-year increase, and The Sun expanded to 71 million in January. 
Group revenues grew in local currency versus the prior year on a stand-alone basis, driven by Talk Sport. We see Talk Sport as having a long term and profoundly positive effect on The Sun. These are clearly complementary platforms, and the cross-promotional power is formidable. 
News Corp Australia faced challenges in the quarter as we continue to consolidate operations where sensible and to emphasize the unique reach of our platforms in Australia. We saw the completion of the Sky News deal and the Australia regional media purchase, and we saw the Sunday Times in Perth and our stake in CarsGuide. Around the company, we are divesting where appropriate and investing where growth in profits beckon. 
Our digital market in Australia continued to grow and ended the quarter at 309,000 digital subscribers, a 21% increase year-over-year, adjusted for some divestitures. 
Fox Sports announced the extension of national soccer, that is football, right through 2022, further cementing its role, along with Foxtel, as the home of largest sports in Australia. We now have Aussie Rules, Rugby League and soccer sign-up for the next 5-or-so years, giving us an opportunity to build a franchise in each of these important sports. 
Even with increased competition from lesser-quality SVOD players, Foxtel's broadcast subscriptions in the quarter were relatively flat versus the prior year. Foxtel is focusing on enhanced IP offerings through Foxtel Play, which replaces Presto, to better capture the more affordable segment of the market. We want the new management team to focus on the Foxtel brand and functionality. There is no doubt that Foxtel has the most compelling content set, and the user interface should be as compelling. 
Although there were challenges in the quarter, we continue to believe Foxtel has a long-term potential to drive higher penetration, while improved broadband pricing should make a bundled offer more attractive. 
In conclusion, as evidenced by EBITDA growth this quarter, News Corp is in the midst of a positive transition that is far different to the fate befalling many of our peers. Throughout our businesses, we are enhancing our digital strengths and collaborating creatively across our businesses while astutely and resolutely cutting costs. We believe in the value of our trusted brands, the provenance of our content and the long-term profits that will flow for all our investors. 
And now for a deeper dive into the details, I defer to Bedi."
212741644,415982145,1128845,"News Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2017",2017-02-09,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert.

We reported fiscal 2017 second quarter total revenue of $2.1 billion, down around 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $53 million unfavorable impact to revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar more than offset by continued weakness in the pound sterling. Reported total segment EBITDA was $325 million compared to $280 million, up 16% versus the prior year. For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.50 compared to $0.15 in the prior year. Significant nonrecurring items impacting EPS in the current quarter include a pretax noncash impairment charge of $310 million, principally related to fixed assets at the Australian publishing business. 
In addition, equity earnings of affiliates include a pretax write-down of $227 million to reduce our carrying value of Foxtel. These were offset in part by a pretax gain of $120 million at REA from the sale of the European businesses and a significant improvement in our operating results. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.19 versus $0.20 in the prior year, and adjusted EPS exclude the items I just mentioned and the other items shown in the press release and reconciliation table. 
Turning to the individual operating segments. At News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter decreased 7% from the prior year to approximately $1.3 billion. And within segment revenues, advertising, which accounted for 53% of revenues this quarter, decreased around 9% or down 8% in local currencies, driven by weaker global print ad trends. 
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 5%, which rose 1% in local currency, driven by price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volume. News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $142 million, down from $158 million in the prior period or approximately 10% down, driven principally by lower print advertising revenue, partially offset by cost-saving initiatives and higher profit contribution at News America Marketing and at News UK versus the prior year. 
Looking now at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, total ad revenues declined around 20%. Similar to the prior quarter rate as The Wall Street Journal continued to face challenges in several ad categories, including business to consumer, finance and technology. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew 6%, driven by higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers. And professional information business revenues were relatively stable than the prior year, similar to last quarter. 
And as we mentioned last quarter, Dow Jones has begun the implementation of cost-savings initiatives under its WSJ 2020 plan, with a target of approximately 8% or $100 million in cost savings on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018. We continue to expect a pretax restructuring charge of $50 million to $60 million for this fiscal year, including $17 million that was reflected this quarter. 
At News Australia, advertising revenues remain challenged and for the quarter, declined 12% or approximately 15% in local currency, with continued weakness in retail, real estate and auto. Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 1%, but was slightly lower in local currency as cover price increases and higher paid digital subs were more than offset by print volume declines. 
On cost initiatives, as I mentioned last quarter, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half and continue to see additional cost reductions this year. 
As I mentioned earlier, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of $310 million, reflecting a write-down of the carrying value of our fixed assets in Australia. Following this impairment, the carrying value of the remaining long-lived assets at News Australia is approximately $420 million. 
At News UK, whilst its reported advertising revenue decreased 29%, ad revenues were down only in low teens in local currency due to print declines, a slight improvement from the prior quarter rate. Reported circulation revenues at News UK declined high teens versus the prior year quarter, but was flat in local currency as cover price increases were offset by single-copy volume declines. News UK benefited this quarter from a combination of cost-savings initiatives, including lower sports rates costs for The Sun, lower marketing and lower production costs. 
Wireless Group contributed about $25 million of reported revenues this quarter, representing low single-digit growth in local currency, driven by Fox Sports. The integration of the News UK is progressing well. Commercial efforts on our focus on extending News UK is rich, particularly in sport. All of the News UK brands and platforms are now involved in sharing content, talent and driving cross-promotion. 
At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well, with revenues up low single digits versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store promotions, which grew mid-teens, offsetting declines in freestanding inserts. We saw increased CPG spending from flagship brands, in part due to the addition of new retailers and operational enhancements. 
And at Checkout 51, as Robert mentioned, we achieved 12.5 million members during the quarter, ahead of schedule, while incurring $8 million in investment spending during this quarter. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. We had another very strong performance, with revenues of $456 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. This quarter benefited from the continued success of backlist titles, including Hillbilly Elegy by JD and Sarah Young's Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. Revenue growth also benefited from strong front list titles, including The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines, Patricia Cornwell's Chaos and The Midnight Gang by David Walliams. Megan Kelly's Settle for More also contributed to the growth in revenue this quarter. 
Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 16% of consumer revenues, with digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter for the first time in 2 years, driven principally by audiobooks. And segment EBITDA of $75 million improved by 32% versus the prior year, helped by higher revenue noted above and the mix benefit from the higher-margin backlist titles. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $34 million or 16% to $242 million, and adjusted revenues increased 10%. Reported segment EBITDA was $95 million, up $22 million or 30% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both Move and REA. 
REA's revenue grew 19% or approximately 14% in local currency due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue, benefiting from favorable product mix and higher prices, coupled with a modest revenue contribution from iProperty. This was partially offset by the impact from lower listing volumes. REA reported their first half results today and just concluded their conference call, which provided more detail. 
Move revenues, excluding the results of its TigerLead business, which was sold in November last year, rose approximately 10% to $91 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Co-Broke and higher lead volume. On a reported basis, revenues rose 7% to $93 million. TigerLead generated $17 million of revenues last year, but was declining and a lead generation source and had a very modest profit contribution. 
As Robert mentioned, realtor launched advantage in early December, a new market price product, targeted to listing agents and have some its Showcase product. While it's early in the rollout, we are pleased with the take-up rate and with the positive feedback from our customers. 
We continue to expect revenue growth to improve in the second half and to see increasing EBITDA contribution this fiscal year versus the prior year. For the quarter, Move contributed $10 million to segment EBITDA growth. And average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up mid-teens year-over-year at 44 million in the quarter. 
In Cable Network programming, revenues fell 2% to $104 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting lower subscription and advertising revenues, partially impacted by the absence of the Rugby World Cup in the prior year. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 31% to $51 million due to the absence of programming rights costs related to the Rugby World Cup and the English Premier League. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $238 million this quarter compared to positive $15 million last year. As noted earlier, this quarter includes $227 million pretax noncash adjustment to step down the carrying value of Foxtel as a result of the flow-through impact of lower EBITDA into projected future cash flows. And recall that prior to the separation of new News Corp in fiscal 2013, the company acquired an additional 25% stake in Foxtel through consolidated media holdings and had stepped up its carrying value and recognized a pretax noncash gain of $900 million at that time. As a result of this adjustment, the current carrying value of News Corp's 50% stake in Foxtel is now $1.2 billion, and we also hold a $325 million shareholder note view from Foxtel. And again, for clarity, all the amounts I just mentioned are all in U.S. dollars. 
Our equity last pickup for this quarter also included a $9 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in TEN network and a $2 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind down. We expect Foxtel to incur additional Presto shutdown costs in the third quarter in the range of $20 million to $25 million, with our share being at 50% [ph] of that range. 
Regarding its operational performance, Foxtel ended the quarter with more than 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing, cable and satellite subscribers flat compared to the prior year. In the second quarter, cable and satellite churn was at 15.6%, comparable to the first quarter, which was primarily related to customers under no contract offers as well as seasonal split disconnections. 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 1% to $602 million, but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 7% to $144 million, but was down 10% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and increases in programming costs, specifically in local production and sports, partially offset by lower transmission costs. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 4% to around AUD 86. 
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for the first half was at $108 million, lower than the $120 million in the prior year. And for the upcoming fiscal third quarter, just a few points to note. Whilst global print trends remain uncertain at our newspaper operations, we expect further cost-saving initiatives across our news mastheads. We also expect to see growth at News America Marketing, led by in-store promotions. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see increased EBITDA contribution and improved revenues at realtor.com, combined with continued growth at REA. Book Publishing should continue to benefit from a strong release slate. We're encouraged by the success of figures, and we'll also have the release of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark. 
And at Cable Network Programming, rights cost should be down modestly in local currency given the absence of EPL rights. 
So in summary, as we had expected, this quarter demonstrated the importance of digital real estate to our growth trajectory, the importance of a strong portfolio of content at HarperCollins and the ability to monetize global rights. And finally, our commitment to improving the cost structure at News and Information Services. 
And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A."

In the second quarter, we saw the efficacy of our strategic reinvestment and digital diversification. Both were evident in our increased operating profitability in the quarter, when the challenges in the advertising marketplace, which is in the midst of transition, were patent. 
We achieved 16% EBITDA growth year-over-year, driven by strong performance in our Digital Real Estate Services segment and robust revenues at HarperCollins, along with appropriate and ongoing management of the cost base at our news mastheads.
As noted in the press release, reported earnings were significantly impacted by a noncash reduction in the carrying value of Foxtel and a noncash impairment charge related to our print properties in Australia, while they also benefit from a onetime gain as a result of the cash proceeds from the sale of REA's European business.
Revenues overall were relatively stable, adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations. And that came despite the obvious plus 3 headwinds in print advertising. As I mentioned, our results this quarter demonstrate the profound importance of becoming more diverse, more digital and more global.
Our core platform has been bolstered by our determined expansion in digital real estate, which is well under way to becoming the largest contributor to our profitability. This segment posted another strong quarter, with a 16% year-over-year revenue increase, improved EBITDA margins and sizable audience gains. We are now the largest digital property business in the world with a strong and growing presence in the U.S., Australia, India and East Asia. We're more global, as evidenced by the extension of our publishing footprint with the developments of the international platform we acquired with Harlequin, which has given us greater access to authors and readers in a broader number of languages and regions.
Last month, we announced that we were assuming full ownership of HarperCollins Brazil. And we're more digital because of strategic investments in our news platforms as well as the influence of our innovative acquisitions, including Storyful, Unruly and Checkout 51. 
Our digital focus has helped the News and Information Services segment garner 27% of its revenues through digital, up from 22% last year. We're also testing our own digital ad network, which will provide a measurable high-quality audience for advertisers, who are increasingly weary, and rightly so, about the murky tenebrous world of digital advertising.
Thanks to this strategy, we believe we are far better positioned than our perceived peers to weather the storms buffeting the media and publishing landscape. We continue to emphasize the importance of cost control and collaboration between and among our businesses who face similar challenges and are sharing expertise and insight. 
Our mastheads are committed to producing high-quality content, verified by a talented breed of fact-checkers called journalists. We are in an era in which integrity is priceless, yet digital distributors have long been a platform for the fake, the foe and the fallacious, highlighting an issue which we have long stressed that they have eroded the integrity of content by undermining its  provenance. Put simply, content distributors are profiting at the expense of content creators and at the expense of veracity.
There are clearly social as well as commercial consequences to this contradiction, and the issue is far from being resolved. A tweak to an algorithm or a fact-check here or there does not address the basic problem. Ad agencies and their programmatic networks are also at fault because they have sometimes artificially aggregated audiences, and these are then plied with content of dubious provenance. The agencies win, the fabricators of fake win and advertisers and society both lose.
Affinity and integrity are core elements of a sustainable relationship between advertiser and consumer, and yet affinity and integrity are far too often missing in the modern marketplace. Audiences are craving integrity, which is why so many of our mastheads have reported strong growth in readers and subscribers.
As an example, The Wall Street Journal experienced a significant increase in page, digital page, digital subscribers through the election, adding more than 110,000 in Q2 compared to Q1 and surpassing 1 million, now representing more than 50% of the total subscriber base. This reflects an increased appetite for quality journalism in an era of remarkable upheaval.
And in the ad market, there has been an awakening and there will surely be a reckoning. Advertisers want reassurance that their products are displayed in suitable surroundings. They don't want muddled metrics, and they don't want digital platforms and ad agencies arbitraging ambiguity. The dangers of Chief Marketing Officers chasing fashion rather than function was highlighted in The Times of London today. Some of the world's best-known, most prestigious brands are inadvertently funding extremists and hard-core pornographers. I suggest that you read The Times. It's a subscription site, but that should be no problem for all of you.
We are confident that our premium platforms and our great journalism will ultimately be beneficiaries of this reckoning.
Let us turn to our platforms and business in more detail. At Move, home of realtor.com, we saw a 10% revenue growth, adjusted for the sale of TigerLead in November. Our headline revenue growth in the quarter was 7%. And as previously indicated, we expect that rate to rise in coming quarters. Importantly, as anticipated, Move contributed $10 million to the increase in segment EBITDA this quarter, and we are confident that contribution will expand in the second half and in years to come.
realtor.com continues to increase traffic versus the prior year and remains the strongest player in the industry in terms of audience engagement. That intensity has helped improve lead volume, always an important measure of potential income for this business. We are acutely conscious of the need to provide an incomparable service for our realtor clients. We are renovating the Move house whilst living in it. One example is the advanced launch of our Advantage product in December, harvesting real-time feedback about potential leads and providing more targeted prominence for realtors' properties.
We continued to develop and rolled out additional products, such as the launch last month of Science Net [ph] and Street Pea [ph], which use image recognition and augmented reality technologies to provide consumers with an enhanced experience on their smartphones. And we are driving traffic between realtor.com and our network of new sites, which provide a valuable flow of real estate analysis and intelligence.
In Australia, REA announced the sale of its European sites during Q2, which they believe lacks scale. The transaction extracted value for all shareholders and allows for a more intense focus on the Asian marketplace with its stronger growth potential.
In January, REA invested in PropTiger, which recently combined with Housing.com to become India's largest digital real estate company. News Corp has an existing stake in PropTiger and remains the largest holder in this Indian portal, with a roughly 38% combined stake, reflecting our direct investment and REA's interest.
For the quarter, REA reported 19% revenue growth, 14% excluding currency impact, and continued to drive higher traffic and engagement despite lower listing volume this quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2017, REA's audience in Australia has remained more than twice the size of its nearest competitor, and visitor spent 7.6x more time on the site.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins experienced strong revenue growth in the quarter and a higher operating margin as we saw the value of a broad roster of books that appealed to and explained the heartland of America, focusing on all Americans, and not just the narrow elite. Occasion point is Hillbilly Elegy, with continuing good sales as well as a significant impact on the public discourse in the wake of President Trump's victory in November.
We had particular success from the Christian Group, which has an empathetic insight into what animates and motivates many Americans and has been the source of several bestsellers in the most recent quarter. Among these is Magnolia Story, which performed well, as did the Sarah Young books, Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. 
In the quarter, Megyn Kelly's Settle for More also generated significant revenue and much debate, though it was not a key driver of EBITDA growth.
Looking ahead, we see other books with broad-based appeal in this fiscal year, including Hidden Figures, the book that is the basis for the eponymous Fox film, and Veronica Roth's latest work, Carve The Mark, is also off to a good start.
At Dow Jones, while advertising remains challenged, the business continues to drive higher circulation revenues through increased digital subscriptions and higher pricing. Work on the WSJ 2020 initiative continues as we accelerate changes to the cost structure and management of the business to align it more closely with the digital and mobile future.
As for print advertising, we are seeing signs of some moderation of declines in Q3. But the market is volatile, and it would be improper to make a firm prediction at this stage. At the New York Post, digital advertising revenues in the quarter exceeded those of print, and the post-digital network had an average monthly audience in the quarter of approximately 58 million, including over 76 million in November, a sign of obvious reader interest in the election and its aftermath. 
News America Marketing was a bright spot, with growing revenues as domestic in-store advertising showed improvement and highlighted the importance of a presence at the point-of-purchase. The positive numbers, despite the investment spending at Checkout 51, our digital app, which now has 12.5 million members and is well ahead of schedule and providing the entire company with a source of valuable actionable data.
At News UK, The Times in print materially outperformed its peers based on market share, as evidenced by 9% volume growth year-over-year. The Times and The Sunday Times also expanded their digital subscriptions. The Sun's global digital audience reached approximately 61 million in December, representing more than 150% year-over-year increase, and The Sun audience expanded to 71 million in January.
Wireless Group revenues grew in local currency versus the prior year on a stand-alone basis, driven by talkSPORT. We see Talk Sport as having a long term and profoundly positive effect on The Sun. These are clearly complementary platforms, and their cross-promotional power is formidable.
News Corp Australia faced challenges in the quarter as we continue to consolidate operations where sensible and to emphasize the unique reach of our platforms in Australia. We saw the completion of the Sky News deal and the Australia Regional Media purchase, and we sold The Sunday Times in Perth and our stake in CarsGuide. Around the company, we are divesting where appropriate and investing where growth in profits beckon.
Our digital markets in Australia continued to grow and ended the quarter at 309,000 digital subscribers, a 21% increase year-over-year, adjusted for some divestitures.
Fox Sports announced the extension of national soccer, that is football, right through 2022, further cementing its role, along with Foxtel, as the home of live sports in Australia. We now have Aussie Rules, Rugby League and soccer sign-up for the next 5-or-so years, giving us an opportunity to build a franchise in each of these important sports.
Even with increased competition from lesser-quality SVOD players, Foxtel's broadcast subscriptions in the quarter were relatively flat versus the prior year. Foxtel is focusing on enhanced IP offerings through Foxtel Play, which replaces Presto, to better capture the more affordable segment of the market. We want the new management team to focus on the Foxtel brand and functionality. There is no doubt that Foxtel has the most compelling content set, and the user interface should be as compelling. Although there were challenges in the quarter, we continue to believe Foxtel has a long-term potential to drive higher penetration, while improved broadband pricing should make a bundled offer more attractive.
In conclusion, as evidenced by EBITDA growth this quarter, News Corp is in the midst of a positive transition that is far different to the fate befalling many of our peers. Throughout our businesses, we are enhancing our digital strengths and collaborating creatively across our businesses while astutely and resolutely cutting costs. We believe in the value of our trusted brands, the provenance of our content and the long-term profits that will flow for all our investors.
And now for a deeper dive into the details, I defer to Bedi."

We reported fiscal 2017 second quarter total revenue of $2.1 billion, down around 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $53 million unfavorable impact to revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar more than offset by continued weakness in the pound sterling. Reported total segment EBITDA was $325 million compared to $280 million, up 16% versus the prior year. For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.50 compared to $0.15 in the prior year. Significant nonrecurring items impacting EPS in the current quarter include a pretax noncash impairment charge of $310 million, principally related to fixed assets at the Australian publishing business.
In addition, equity earnings of affiliates include a pretax write-down of $227 million to reduce our carrying value of Foxtel. These were offset in part by a pretax gain of $120 million at REA from the sale of their European businesses and a significant improvement in our operating results. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.19 versus $0.20 in the prior year, and adjusted EPS exclude the items I just mentioned and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table. 
Turning to the individual operating segments. At News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter decreased 7% from the prior year to approximately $1.3 billion. And within segment revenues, advertising, which accounted for 53% of revenues this quarter, decreased around 9% or down 8% in local currency, driven by weaker global print ad trends.
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 5%, but rose 1% in local currency, driven by price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volume. News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $142 million, down from $158 million in the prior period or approximately 10% down, driven principally by lower print advertising revenues, partially offset by cost-saving initiatives and higher profit contribution at News America Marketing and at News UK versus the prior year.
Looking now at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, total ad revenues declined around 20%, similar to the prior quarter rate as The Wall Street Journal continued to face challenges in several ad categories, including business to consumer, finance and technology. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew 6%, driven by higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers. And professional information business revenues were relatively stable than the prior year, similar to last quarter.
And as we mentioned last quarter, Dow Jones has begun the implementation of cost-savings initiatives under its WSJ 2020 plan, with a target of approximately 8% or $100 million in cost savings on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018. We continue to expect a pretax restructuring charge of $50 million to $60 million for this fiscal year, including $17 million that was reflected this quarter.
At News Australia, advertising revenues remained challenged and for the quarter declined 12% or approximately 15% in local currency, with continued weakness in retail, real estate and auto. Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 1%, but was slightly lower in local currency as cover price increases and higher paid digital subs were more than offset by print volume declines.
On cost initiatives, as I mentioned last quarter, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half and continue to seek additional cost reductions this year.
As I mentioned earlier, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of $310 million, reflecting a write-down of the carrying value of our fixed assets in Australia. Following this impairment, the carrying value of the remaining long-lived assets at News Australia is approximately $420 million.
At News UK, whilst reported advertising revenue decreased 29%, ad revenues were down only in low teens in local currency due to print declines, a slight improvement from the prior quarter rate. Reported circulation revenues at News UK declined high teens versus the prior year quarter, but was flat in local currency as cover price increases were offset by single-copy volume declines. News UK benefited this quarter from a combination of cost-savings initiatives, including lower sports rights costs for The Sun, lower marketing and lower production costs.
Wireless Group contributed about $25 million to reported revenues this quarter, representing low single-digit growth in local currency, driven by talkSPORT. The integration into News UK is progressing well. Commercial efforts are now focused on extending News UK's reach, particularly in sport. All of the News UK brands and platforms are now involved in sharing content, talent and driving cross-promotion.
At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well, with revenues up low single digits versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store promotions, which grew mid-teens, offsetting declines in freestanding inserts. We saw increased CPG spending from flagship brands, in part due to the addition of new retailers and operational enhancements.
And at Checkout 51, as Robert mentioned, we achieved 12.5 million members during the quarter, ahead of schedule, while incurring $8 million in investment spending during this quarter.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. We had another very strong performance, with revenues of $456 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. This quarter benefited from the continued success of backlist titles, including Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance and Sarah Young's Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. Revenue growth also benefited from strong front-list titles, including The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines, Patricia Cornwell's Chaos and The Midnight Gang by David Walliams. Megyn Kelly's Settle for More also contributed to the growth in revenue this quarter.
Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 16% of consumer revenues, with digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter for the first time in 2 years, driven principally by audiobooks. And segment EBITDA of $75 million improved by 32% versus the prior year, helped by higher revenue noted above and the mix benefit from the higher-margin backlist titles.
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $34 million or 16% to $242 million, and adjusted revenues increased 10%. Reported segment EBITDA was $95 million, up $22 million or 30% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both Move and REA.
REA's revenue grew 19% or approximately 14% in local currency due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue, benefiting from favorable product mix and higher prices, coupled with a modest revenue contribution from iProperty. This was partially offset by the impact from lower listing volumes. REA reported their first half results today and just concluded their conference call, which provided more detail.
Move revenues, excluding the results of its TigerLead business, which was sold in November last year, rose approximately 10% to $91 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Co-Broke and higher lead volume. On a reported basis, revenues rose 7% to $93 million. TigerLead generated $17 million of revenues last year, but was declining as a lead generation source and had a very modest profit contribution.
As Robert mentioned, realtor launched Advantage in early December, a new market-priced product, targeted to listing agents and has set its Showcase product. While it's early in the rollout, we are pleased with the take-up rate and with the positive feedback from our customers.
We continue to expect revenue growth to improve in the second half and to see increasing EBITDA contribution this fiscal year versus the prior year. For the quarter, Move contributed $10 million to segment EBITDA growth. And average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remained strong, up mid-teens year-over-year to 44 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues fell 2% to $104 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting lower subscription and advertising revenues, partially impacted by the absence of the Rugby World Cup in the prior year. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 31% to $51 million due to the absence of programming rights costs related to the Rugby World Cup and the English Premier League. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $238 million this quarter compared to positive $15 million last year. As noted earlier, this quarter includes a $227 million pretax noncash adjustment to step down the carrying value of Foxtel as a result of the flow-through impact of lower EBITDA into projected future cash flows. And recall that prior to the separation of new News Corp in fiscal 2013, the company acquired an additional 25% stake in Foxtel through Consolidated Media Holdings and had stepped up its carrying value and recognized a pretax noncash gain of $900 million at that time. As a result of this adjustment, the current carrying value of News Corp's 50% stake in Foxtel is now $1.2 billion, and we also hold a $325 million shareholder note new from Foxtel. And again, for clarity, all the amounts I just mentioned are all in U.S. dollars.
Our equity loss pickup for this quarter also included a $9 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in Ten Network and a $2 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind down. We expect Foxtel to incur additional Presto shutdown costs in the third quarter in the range of $20 million to $25 million, with our share being at 50% of that range.
Regarding its operational performance, Foxtel ended the quarter with more than 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing, cable and satellite subscribers flat compared to the prior year. In the second quarter, cable and satellite churn was at 15.6%, comparable to the first quarter, which was primarily related to customers under no contract offers as well as seasonal port disconnections.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 1% to $602 million, but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 7% to $144 million, but was down 10% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and increases in programming costs, specifically in local production and sports, partially offset by lower transmission costs. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 4% to around AUD 86.
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for the first half was at $108 million, lower than the $120 million in the prior year. And for the upcoming fiscal third quarter, just a few points to note. Whilst global print trends remain uncertain at our newspaper operations, we expect further cost-saving initiatives across our news mastheads. We also expect to see growth at News America Marketing, led by in-store promotions.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see increased EBITDA contribution and improved revenues at realtor.com, combined with continued growth at REA. Book Publishing should continue to benefit from a strong release slate. We're encouraged by the success of Margot Lee Shetterly's Hidden Figures, and we'll also have the release of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark.
And at Cable Network Programming, rights costs should be down modestly in local currency given the absence of EPL rights.
So in summary, as we had expected, this quarter demonstrated the importance of digital real estate to our growth trajectory, the importance of a strong portfolio of content at HarperCollins and the ability to monetize global rights and finally, our commitment to improving the cost structure at News and Information Services.
And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A."

The -- generally speaking at Dow Jones, as you said, the digital revenues are growing, both in terms of advertising. Circulation revenues up around 6%. And in terms of print this quarter, as I mentioned earlier, it's hard to give you a definite outlook for this quarter. But certainly, thus far, the decline is moderating."

In the second quarter, we saw the efficacy of our strategic reinvestment and digital diversification. Both were evident in our increased operating profitability in the quarter, when the challenges in the advertising marketplace, which is in the midst of transition, were patent. 
We achieved 16% EBITDA growth year-over-year, driven by strong performance in our Digital Real Estate Services segment and robust revenues at HarperCollins, along with appropriate and ongoing management of the cost base at our news mastheads.
As noted in the press release, reported earnings were significantly impacted by a noncash reduction in the carrying value of Foxtel and a noncash impairment charge related to our print properties in Australia, while they also benefit from a onetime gain as a result of the cash proceeds from the sale of REA's European business.
Revenues overall were relatively stable, adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations. And that came despite the obvious plus 3 headwinds in print advertising. As I mentioned, our results this quarter demonstrate the profound importance of becoming more diverse, more digital and more global.
Our core platform has been bolstered by our determined expansion in digital real estate, which is well under way to becoming the largest contributor to our profitability. This segment posted another strong quarter, with a 16% year-over-year revenue increase, improved EBITDA margins and sizable audience gains. We are now the largest digital property business in the world with a strong and growing presence in the U.S., Australia, India and East Asia. We're more global, as evidenced by the extension of our publishing footprint with the developments of the international platform we acquired with Harlequin, which has given us greater access to authors and readers in a broader number of languages and regions.
Last month, we announced that we were assuming full ownership of HarperCollins Brazil. And we're more digital because of strategic investments in our news platforms as well as the influence of our innovative acquisitions, including Storyful, Unruly and Checkout 51. 
Our digital focus has helped the News and Information Services segment garner 27% of its revenues through digital, up from 22% last year. We're also testing our own digital ad network, which will provide a measurable high-quality audience for advertisers, who are increasingly weary, and rightly so, about the murky tenebrous world of digital advertising.
Thanks to this strategy, we believe we are far better positioned than our perceived peers to weather the storms buffeting the media and publishing landscape. We continue to emphasize the importance of cost control and collaboration between and among our businesses who face similar challenges and are sharing expertise and insight. 
Our mastheads are committed to producing high-quality content, verified by a talented breed of fact-checkers called journalists. We are in an era in which integrity is priceless, yet digital distributors have long been a platform for the fake, the foe and the fallacious, highlighting an issue which we have long stressed that they have eroded the integrity of content by undermining its  provenance. Put simply, content distributors are profiting at the expense of content creators and at the expense of veracity.
There are clearly social as well as commercial consequences to this contradiction, and the issue is far from being resolved. A tweak to an algorithm or a fact-check here or there does not address the basic problem. Ad agencies and their programmatic networks are also at fault because they have sometimes artificially aggregated audiences, and these are then plied with content of dubious provenance. The agencies win, the fabricators of fake win and advertisers and society both lose.
Affinity and integrity are core elements of a sustainable relationship between advertiser and consumer, and yet affinity and integrity are far too often missing in the modern marketplace. Audiences are craving integrity, which is why so many of our mastheads have reported strong growth in readers and subscribers.
As an example, The Wall Street Journal experienced a significant increase in page, digital page, digital subscribers through the election, adding more than 110,000 in Q2 compared to Q1 and surpassing 1 million, now representing more than 50% of the total subscriber base. This reflects an increased appetite for quality journalism in an era of remarkable upheaval.
And in the ad market, there has been an awakening and there will surely be a reckoning. Advertisers want reassurance that their products are displayed in suitable surroundings. They don't want muddled metrics, and they don't want digital platforms and ad agencies arbitraging ambiguity. The dangers of Chief Marketing Officers chasing fashion rather than function was highlighted in The Times of London today. Some of the world's best-known, most prestigious brands are inadvertently funding extremists and hard-core pornographers. I suggest that you read The Times. It's a subscription site, but that should be no problem for all of you.
We are confident that our premium platforms and our great journalism will ultimately be beneficiaries of this reckoning.
Let us turn to our platforms and business in more detail. At Move, home of realtor.com, we saw a 10% revenue growth, adjusted for the sale of TigerLead in November. Our headline revenue growth in the quarter was 7%. And as previously indicated, we expect that rate to rise in coming quarters. Importantly, as anticipated, Move contributed $10 million to the increase in segment EBITDA this quarter, and we are confident that contribution will expand in the second half and in years to come.
realtor.com continues to increase traffic versus the prior year and remains the strongest player in the industry in terms of audience engagement. That intensity has helped improve lead volume, always an important measure of potential income for this business. We are acutely conscious of the need to provide an incomparable service for our realtor clients. We are renovating the Move house whilst living in it. One example is the advanced launch of our Advantage product in December, harvesting real-time feedback about potential leads and providing more targeted prominence for realtors' properties.
We continued to develop and rolled out additional products, such as the launch last month of Science Net and Street Pea [ph], which use image recognition and augmented reality technologies to provide consumers with an enhanced experience on their smartphones. And we are driving traffic between realtor.com and our network of new sites, which provide a valuable flow of real estate analysis and intelligence.
In Australia, REA announced the sale of its European sites during Q2, which they believe lacks scale. The transaction extracted value for all shareholders and allows for a more intense focus on the Asian marketplace with its stronger growth potential.
In January, REA invested in PropTiger, which recently combined with Housing.com to become India's largest digital real estate company. News Corp has an existing stake in PropTiger and remains the largest holder in this Indian portal, with a roughly 38% combined stake, reflecting our direct investment and REA's interest.
For the quarter, REA reported 19% revenue growth, 14% excluding currency impact, and continued to drive higher traffic and engagement despite lower listing volume this quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2017, REA's audience in Australia has remained more than twice the size of its nearest competitor, and visitor spent 7.6x more time on the site.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins experienced strong revenue growth in the quarter and a higher operating margin as we saw the value of a broad roster of books that appealed to and explained the heartland of America, focusing on all Americans, and not just the narrow elite. Occasion point is Hillbilly Elegy, with continuing good sales as well as a significant impact on the public discourse in the wake of President Trump's victory in November.
We had particular success from the Christian Group, which has an empathetic insight into what animates and motivates many Americans and has been the source of several bestsellers in the most recent quarter. Among these is Magnolia Story, which performed well, as did the Sarah Young books, Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. 
In the quarter, Megyn Kelly's Settle for More also generated significant revenue and much debate, though it was not a key driver of EBITDA growth.
Looking ahead, we see other books with broad-based appeal in this fiscal year, including Hidden Figures, the book that is the basis for the eponymous Fox film, and Veronica Roth's latest work, Carve The Mark, is also off to a good start.
At Dow Jones, while advertising remains challenged, the business continues to drive higher circulation revenues through increased digital subscriptions and higher pricing. Work on the WSJ 2020 initiative continues as we accelerate changes to the cost structure and management of the business to align it more closely with the digital and mobile future.
As for print advertising, we are seeing signs of some moderation of declines in Q3. But the market is volatile, and it would be improper to make a firm prediction at this stage. At the New York Post, digital advertising revenues in the quarter exceeded those of print, and the post-digital network had an average monthly audience in the quarter of approximately 58 million, including over 76 million in November, a sign of obvious reader interest in the election and its aftermath. 
News America Marketing was a bright spot, with growing revenues as domestic in-store advertising showed improvement and highlighted the importance of a presence at the point-of-purchase. The positive numbers, despite the investment spending at Checkout 51, our digital app, which now has 12.5 million members and is well ahead of schedule and providing the entire company with a source of valuable actionable data.
At News UK, The Times in print materially outperformed its peers based on market share, as evidenced by 9% volume growth year-over-year. The Times and The Sunday Times also expanded their digital subscriptions. The Sun's global digital audience reached approximately 61 million in December, representing more than 150% year-over-year increase, and The Sun audience expanded to 71 million in January.
Wireless Group revenues grew in local currency versus the prior year on a stand-alone basis, driven by talkSPORT. We see Talk Sport as having a long term and profoundly positive effect on The Sun. These are clearly complementary platforms, and their cross-promotional power is formidable.
News Corp Australia faced challenges in the quarter as we continue to consolidate operations where sensible and to emphasize the unique reach of our platforms in Australia. We saw the completion of the Sky News deal and the Australia Regional Media purchase, and we sold The Sunday Times in Perth and our stake in CarsGuide. Around the company, we are divesting where appropriate and investing where growth in profits beckon.
Our digital markets in Australia continued to grow and ended the quarter at 309,000 digital subscribers, a 21% increase year-over-year, adjusted for some divestitures.
Fox Sports announced the extension of national soccer, that is football, right through 2022, further cementing its role, along with Foxtel, as the home of live sports in Australia. We now have Aussie Rules, Rugby League and soccer sign-up for the next 5-or-so years, giving us an opportunity to build a franchise in each of these important sports.
Even with increased competition from lesser-quality SVOD players, Foxtel's broadcast subscriptions in the quarter were relatively flat versus the prior year. Foxtel is focusing on enhanced IP offerings through Foxtel Play, which replaces Presto, to better capture the more affordable segment of the market. We want the new management team to focus on the Foxtel brand and functionality. There is no doubt that Foxtel has the most compelling content set, and the user interface should be as compelling. Although there were challenges in the quarter, we continue to believe Foxtel has a long-term potential to drive higher penetration, while improved broadband pricing should make a bundled offer more attractive.
In conclusion, as evidenced by EBITDA growth this quarter, News Corp is in the midst of a positive transition that is far different to the fate befalling many of our peers. Throughout our businesses, we are enhancing our digital strengths and collaborating creatively across our businesses while astutely and resolutely cutting costs. We believe in the value of our trusted brands, the provenance of our content and the long-term profits that will flow for all our investors.
And now for a deeper dive into the details, I defer to Bedi."
212741644,415982145,1129173,"News Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2017",2017-02-09,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Robert.

We reported fiscal 2017 second quarter total revenue of $2.1 billion, down around 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $53 million unfavorable impact to revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar more than offset by continued weakness in the pound sterling. Reported total segment EBITDA was $325 million compared to $280 million, up 16% versus the prior year. For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.50 compared to $0.15 in the prior year. Significant nonrecurring items impacting EPS in the current quarter include a pretax noncash impairment charge of $310 million, principally related to fixed assets at the Australian publishing business.
In addition, equity earnings of affiliates include a pretax write-down of $227 million to reduce our carrying value of Foxtel. These were offset in part by a pretax gain of $120 million at REA from the sale of their European businesses and a significant improvement in our operating results. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.19 versus $0.20 in the prior year, and adjusted EPS exclude the items I just mentioned and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table. 
Turning to the individual operating segments. At News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter decreased 7% from the prior year to approximately $1.3 billion. And within segment revenues, advertising, which accounted for 53% of revenues this quarter, decreased around 9% or down 8% in local currency, driven by weaker global print ad trends.
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 5%, but rose 1% in local currency, driven by price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volume. News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $142 million, down from $158 million in the prior period or approximately 10% down, driven principally by lower print advertising revenues, partially offset by cost-saving initiatives and higher profit contribution at News America Marketing and at News UK versus the prior year.
Looking now at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, total ad revenues declined around 20%, similar to the prior quarter rate as The Wall Street Journal continued to face challenges in several ad categories, including business to consumer, finance and technology. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew 6%, driven by higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers. And professional information business revenues were relatively stable than the prior year, similar to last quarter.
And as we mentioned last quarter, Dow Jones has begun the implementation of cost-savings initiatives under its WSJ 2020 plan, with a target of approximately 8% or $100 million in cost savings on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018. We continue to expect a pretax restructuring charge of $50 million to $60 million for this fiscal year, including $17 million that was reflected this quarter.
At News Australia, advertising revenues remained challenged and for the quarter declined 12% or approximately 15% in local currency, with continued weakness in retail, real estate and auto. Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 1%, but was slightly lower in local currency as cover price increases and higher paid digital subs were more than offset by print volume declines.
On cost initiatives, as I mentioned last quarter, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half and continue to seek additional cost reductions this year.
As I mentioned earlier, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of $310 million, reflecting a write-down of the carrying value of our fixed assets in Australia. Following this impairment, the carrying value of the remaining long-lived assets at News Australia is approximately $420 million.
At News UK, whilst reported advertising revenue decreased 29%, ad revenues were down only in low teens in local currency due to print declines, a slight improvement from the prior quarter rate. Reported circulation revenues at News UK declined high teens versus the prior year quarter, but was flat in local currency as cover price increases were offset by single-copy volume declines. News UK benefited this quarter from a combination of cost-savings initiatives, including lower sports rights costs for The Sun, lower marketing and lower production costs.
Wireless Group contributed about $25 million to reported revenues this quarter, representing low single-digit growth in local currency, driven by talkSPORT. The integration into News UK is progressing well. Commercial efforts are now focused on extending News UK's reach, particularly in sport. All of the News UK brands and platforms are now involved in sharing content, talent and driving cross-promotion.
At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well, with revenues up low single digits versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store promotions, which grew mid-teens, offsetting declines in freestanding inserts. We saw increased CPG spending from flagship brands, in part due to the addition of new retailers and operational enhancements.
And at Checkout 51, as Robert mentioned, we achieved 12.5 million members during the quarter, ahead of schedule, while incurring $8 million in investment spending during this quarter.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. We had another very strong performance, with revenues of $456 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. This quarter benefited from the continued success of backlist titles, including Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance and Sarah Young's Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. Revenue growth also benefited from strong front-list titles, including The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines, Patricia Cornwell's Chaos and The Midnight Gang by David Walliams. Megyn Kelly's Settle for More also contributed to the growth in revenue this quarter.
Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 16% of consumer revenues, with digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter for the first time in 2 years, driven principally by audiobooks. And segment EBITDA of $75 million improved by 32% versus the prior year, helped by higher revenue noted above and the mix benefit from the higher-margin backlist titles.
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $34 million or 16% to $242 million, and adjusted revenues increased 10%. Reported segment EBITDA was $95 million, up $22 million or 30% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both Move and REA.
REA's revenue grew 19% or approximately 14% in local currency due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue, benefiting from favorable product mix and higher prices, coupled with a modest revenue contribution from iProperty. This was partially offset by the impact from lower listing volumes. REA reported their first half results today and just concluded their conference call, which provided more detail.
Move revenues, excluding the results of its TigerLead business, which was sold in November last year, rose approximately 10% to $91 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Co-Broke and higher lead volume. On a reported basis, revenues rose 7% to $93 million. TigerLead generated $17 million of revenues last year, but was declining as a lead generation source and had a very modest profit contribution.
As Robert mentioned, realtor launched Advantage in early December, a new market-priced product, targeted to listing agents and has some set its Showcase product. While it's early in the rollout, we are pleased with the take-up rate and with the positive feedback from our customers.
We continue to expect revenue growth to improve in the second half and to see increasing EBITDA contribution this fiscal year versus the prior year. For the quarter, Move contributed $10 million to segment EBITDA growth. And average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remained strong, up mid-teens year-over-year to 44 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues fell 2% to $104 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting lower subscription and advertising revenues, partially impacted by the absence of the Rugby World Cup in the prior year. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 31% to $51 million due to the absence of programming rights costs related to the Rugby World Cup and the English Premier League. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $238 million this quarter compared to positive $15 million last year. As noted earlier, this quarter includes a $227 million pretax noncash adjustment to step down the carrying value of Foxtel as a result of the flow-through impact of lower EBITDA into projected future cash flows. And recall that prior to the separation of new News Corp in fiscal 2013, the company acquired an additional 25% stake in Foxtel through Consolidated Media Holdings and had stepped up its carrying value and recognized a pretax noncash gain of $900 million at that time. As a result of this adjustment, the current carrying value of News Corp's 50% stake in Foxtel is now $1.2 billion, and we also hold a $325 million shareholder note new from Foxtel. And again, for clarity, all the amounts I just mentioned are all in U.S. dollars.
Our equity loss pickup for this quarter also included a $9 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in Ten Network and a $2 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind down. We expect Foxtel to incur additional Presto shutdown costs in the third quarter in the range of $20 million to $25 million, with our share being at 50% of that range.
Regarding its operational performance, Foxtel ended the quarter with more than 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing, cable and satellite subscribers flat compared to the prior year. In the second quarter, cable and satellite churn was at 15.6%, comparable to the first quarter, which was primarily related to customers under no contract offers as well as seasonal port disconnections.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 1% to $602 million, but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 7% to $144 million, but was down 10% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and increases in programming costs, specifically in local production and sports, partially offset by lower transmission costs. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 4% to around AUD 86.
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for the first half was at $108 million, lower than the $120 million in the prior year. And for the upcoming fiscal third quarter, just a few points to note. Whilst global print trends remain uncertain at our newspaper operations, we expect further cost-saving initiatives across our news mastheads. We also expect to see growth at News America Marketing, led by in-store promotions.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see increased EBITDA contribution and improved revenues at realtor.com, combined with continued growth at REA. Book Publishing should continue to benefit from a strong release slate. We're encouraged by the success of Margot Lee Shetterly's Hidden Figures, and we'll also have the release of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark.
And at Cable Network Programming, rights costs should be down modestly in local currency given the absence of EPL rights.
So in summary, as we had expected, this quarter demonstrated the importance of digital real estate to our growth trajectory, the importance of a strong portfolio of content at HarperCollins and the ability to monetize global rights and finally, our commitment to improving the cost structure at News and Information Services.
And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A."

In the second quarter, we saw the efficacy of our strategic reinvestment and digital diversification. Both were evident in our increased operating profitability in the quarter, when the challenges in the advertising marketplace, which is in the midst of transition, were patent. 
We achieved 16% EBITDA growth year-over-year, driven by strong performance in our Digital Real Estate Services segment and robust revenues at HarperCollins, along with appropriate and ongoing management of the cost base at our news mastheads.
As noted in the press release, reported earnings were significantly impacted by a noncash reduction in the carrying value of Foxtel and a noncash impairment charge related to our print properties in Australia, while they also benefit from a onetime gain as a result of the cash proceeds from the sale of REA's European business.
Revenues overall were relatively stable, adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations. And that came despite the obvious plus 3 headwinds in print advertising. As I mentioned, our results this quarter demonstrate the profound importance of becoming more diverse, more digital and more global.
Our core platform has been bolstered by our determined expansion in digital real estate, which is well under way to becoming the largest contributor to our profitability. This segment posted another strong quarter, with a 16% year-over-year revenue increase, improved EBITDA margins and sizable audience gains. We are now the largest digital property business in the world with a strong and growing presence in the U.S., Australia, India and East Asia. We're more global, as evidenced by the extension of our publishing footprint with the developments of the international platform we acquired with Harlequin, which has given us greater access to authors and readers in a broader number of languages and regions.
Last month, we announced that we were assuming full ownership of HarperCollins Brazil. And we're more digital because of strategic investments in our news platforms as well as the influence of our innovative acquisitions, including Storyful, Unruly and Checkout 51. 
Our digital focus has helped the News and Information Services segment garner 27% of its revenues through digital, up from 22% last year. We're also testing our own digital ad network, which will provide a measurable high-quality audience for advertisers, who are increasingly weary, and rightly so, about the murky tenebrous world of digital advertising.
Thanks to this strategy, we believe we are far better positioned than our perceived peers to weather the storms buffeting the media and publishing landscape. We continue to emphasize the importance of cost control and collaboration between and among our businesses who face similar challenges and are sharing expertise and insight. 
Our mastheads are committed to producing high-quality content, verified by a talented breed of fact-checkers called journalists. We are in an era in which integrity is priceless, yet digital distributors have long been a platform for the fake, the foe and the fallacious, highlighting an issue which we have long stressed that they have eroded the integrity of content by undermining its  provenance. Put simply, content distributors are profiting at the expense of content creators and at the expense of veracity.
There are clearly social as well as commercial consequences to this contradiction, and the issue is far from being resolved. A tweak to an algorithm or a fact-check here or there does not address the basic problem. Ad agencies and their programmatic networks are also at fault because they have sometimes artificially aggregated audiences, and these are then plied with content of dubious provenance. The agencies win, the fabricators of fake win and advertisers and society both lose.
Affinity and integrity are core elements of a sustainable relationship between advertiser and consumer, and yet affinity and integrity are far too often missing in the modern marketplace. Audiences are craving integrity, which is why so many of our mastheads have reported strong growth in readers and subscribers.
As an example, The Wall Street Journal experienced a significant increase in page, digital page, digital subscribers through the election, adding more than 110,000 in Q2 compared to Q1 and surpassing 1 million, now representing more than 50% of the total subscriber base. This reflects an increased appetite for quality journalism in an era of remarkable upheaval.
And in the ad market, there has been an awakening and there will surely be a reckoning. Advertisers want reassurance that their products are displayed in suitable surroundings. They don't want muddled metrics, and they don't want digital platforms and ad agencies arbitraging ambiguity. The dangers of Chief Marketing Officers chasing fashion rather than function was highlighted in The Times of London today. Some of the world's best-known, most prestigious brands are inadvertently funding extremists and hard-core pornographers. I suggest that you read The Times. It's a subscription site, but that should be no problem for all of you.
We are confident that our premium platforms and our great journalism will ultimately be beneficiaries of this reckoning.
Let us turn to our platforms and business in more detail. At Move, home of realtor.com, we saw a 10% revenue growth, adjusted for the sale of TigerLead in November. Our headline revenue growth in the quarter was 7%. And as previously indicated, we expect that rate to rise in coming quarters. Importantly, as anticipated, Move contributed $10 million to the increase in segment EBITDA this quarter, and we are confident that contribution will expand in the second half and in years to come.
realtor.com continues to increase traffic versus the prior year and remains the strongest player in the industry in terms of audience engagement. That intensity has helped improve lead volume, always an important measure of potential income for this business. We are acutely conscious of the need to provide an incomparable service for our realtor clients. We are renovating the Move house whilst living in it. One example is the advanced launch of our Advantage product in December, harvesting real-time feedback about potential leads and providing more targeted prominence for realtors' properties.
We continued to develop and rolled out additional products, such as the launch last month of Science Net and Street Pea [ph], which use image recognition and augmented reality technologies to provide consumers with an enhanced experience on their smartphones. And we are driving traffic between realtor.com and our network of new sites, which provide a valuable flow of real estate analysis and intelligence.
In Australia, REA announced the sale of its European sites during Q2, which they believe lacks scale. The transaction extracted value for all shareholders and allows for a more intense focus on the Asian marketplace with its stronger growth potential.
In January, REA invested in PropTiger, which recently combined with Housing.com to become India's largest digital real estate company. News Corp has an existing stake in PropTiger and remains the largest holder in this Indian portal, with a roughly 38% combined stake, reflecting our direct investment and REA's interest.
For the quarter, REA reported 19% revenue growth, 14% excluding currency impact, and continued to drive higher traffic and engagement despite lower listing volume this quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2017, REA's audience in Australia has remained more than twice the size of its nearest competitor, and visitor spent 7.6x more time on the site.
In Book Publishing, HarperCollins experienced strong revenue growth in the quarter and a higher operating margin as we saw the value of a broad roster of books that appealed to and explained the heartland of America, focusing on all Americans, and not just the narrow elite. Occasion point is Hillbilly Elegy, with continuing good sales as well as a significant impact on the public discourse in the wake of President Trump's victory in November.
We had particular success from the Christian Group, which has an empathetic insight into what animates and motivates many Americans and has been the source of several bestsellers in the most recent quarter. Among these is Magnolia Story, which performed well, as did the Sarah Young books, Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. 
In the quarter, Megyn Kelly's Settle for More also generated significant revenue and much debate, though it was not a key driver of EBITDA growth.
Looking ahead, we see other books with broad-based appeal in this fiscal year, including Hidden Figures, the book that is the basis for the eponymous Fox film, and Veronica Roth's latest work, Carve The Mark, is also off to a good start.
At Dow Jones, while advertising remains challenged, the business continues to drive higher circulation revenues through increased digital subscriptions and higher pricing. Work on the WSJ 2020 initiative continues as we accelerate changes to the cost structure and management of the business to align it more closely with the digital and mobile future.
As for print advertising, we are seeing signs of some moderation of declines in Q3. But the market is volatile, and it would be improper to make a firm prediction at this stage. At the New York Post, digital advertising revenues in the quarter exceeded those of print, and the post-digital network had an average monthly audience in the quarter of approximately 58 million, including over 76 million in November, a sign of obvious reader interest in the election and its aftermath. 
News America Marketing was a bright spot, with growing revenues as domestic in-store advertising showed improvement and highlighted the importance of a presence at the point-of-purchase. The positive numbers, despite the investment spending at Checkout 51, our digital app, which now has 12.5 million members and is well ahead of schedule and providing the entire company with a source of valuable actionable data.
At News UK, The Times in print materially outperformed its peers based on market share, as evidenced by 9% volume growth year-over-year. The Times and The Sunday Times also expanded their digital subscriptions. The Sun's global digital audience reached approximately 61 million in December, representing more than 150% year-over-year increase, and The Sun audience expanded to 71 million in January.
Wireless Group revenues grew in local currency versus the prior year on a stand-alone basis, driven by talkSPORT. We see Talk Sport as having a long term and profoundly positive effect on The Sun. These are clearly complementary platforms, and their cross-promotional power is formidable.
News Corp Australia faced challenges in the quarter as we continue to consolidate operations where sensible and to emphasize the unique reach of our platforms in Australia. We saw the completion of the Sky News deal and the Australia Regional Media purchase, and we sold The Sunday Times in Perth and our stake in CarsGuide. Around the company, we are divesting where appropriate and investing where growth in profits beckon.
Our digital markets in Australia continued to grow and ended the quarter at 309,000 digital subscribers, a 21% increase year-over-year, adjusted for some divestitures.
Fox Sports announced the extension of national soccer, that is football, right through 2022, further cementing its role, along with Foxtel, as the home of live sports in Australia. We now have Aussie Rules, Rugby League and soccer sign-up for the next 5-or-so years, giving us an opportunity to build a franchise in each of these important sports.
Even with increased competition from lesser-quality SVOD players, Foxtel's broadcast subscriptions in the quarter were relatively flat versus the prior year. Foxtel is focusing on enhanced IP offerings through Foxtel Play, which replaces Presto, to better capture the more affordable segment of the market. We want the new management team to focus on the Foxtel brand and functionality. There is no doubt that Foxtel has the most compelling content set, and the user interface should be as compelling. Although there were challenges in the quarter, we continue to believe Foxtel has a long-term potential to drive higher penetration, while improved broadband pricing should make a bundled offer more attractive.
In conclusion, as evidenced by EBITDA growth this quarter, News Corp is in the midst of a positive transition that is far different to the fate befalling many of our peers. Throughout our businesses, we are enhancing our digital strengths and collaborating creatively across our businesses while astutely and resolutely cutting costs. We believe in the value of our trusted brands, the provenance of our content and the long-term profits that will flow for all our investors.
And now for a deeper dive into the details, I defer to Bedi."

We reported fiscal 2017 second quarter total revenue of $2.1 billion, down around 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $53 million unfavorable impact to revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar more than offset by continued weakness in the pound sterling. Reported total segment EBITDA was $325 million compared to $280 million, up 16% versus the prior year. For the quarter, EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.50 compared to $0.15 in the prior year. Significant nonrecurring items impacting EPS in the current quarter include a pretax noncash impairment charge of $310 million, principally related to fixed assets at the Australian publishing business.
In addition, equity earnings of affiliates include a pretax write-down of $227 million to reduce our carrying value of Foxtel. These were offset in part by a pretax gain of $120 million at REA from the sale of their European businesses and a significant improvement in our operating results. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.19 versus $0.20 in the prior year, and adjusted EPS exclude the items I just mentioned and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table. 
Turning to the individual operating segments. At News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter decreased 7% from the prior year to approximately $1.3 billion. And within segment revenues, advertising, which accounted for 53% of revenues this quarter, decreased around 9% or down 8% in local currency, driven by weaker global print ad trends.
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 5%, but rose 1% in local currency, driven by price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volume. News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $142 million, down from $158 million in the prior period or approximately 10% down, driven principally by lower print advertising revenues, partially offset by cost-saving initiatives and higher profit contribution at News America Marketing and at News UK versus the prior year.
Looking now at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, total ad revenues declined around 20%, similar to the prior quarter rate as The Wall Street Journal continued to face challenges in several ad categories, including business to consumer, finance and technology. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew 6%, driven by higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers. And professional information business revenues were relatively stable than the prior year, similar to last quarter.
And as we mentioned last quarter, Dow Jones has begun the implementation of cost-savings initiatives under its WSJ 2020 plan, with a target of approximately 8% or $100 million in cost savings on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018. We continue to expect a pretax restructuring charge of $50 million to $60 million for this fiscal year, including $17 million that was reflected this quarter.
At News Australia, advertising revenues remained challenged and for the quarter declined 12% or approximately 15% in local currency, with continued weakness in retail, real estate and auto. Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 1%, but was slightly lower in local currency as cover price increases and higher paid digital subs were more than offset by print volume declines.
On cost initiatives, as I mentioned last quarter, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half and continue to seek additional cost reductions this year.
As I mentioned earlier, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of $310 million, reflecting a write-down of the carrying value of our fixed assets in Australia. Following this impairment, the carrying value of the remaining long-lived assets at News Australia is approximately $420 million.
At News UK, whilst reported advertising revenue decreased 29%, ad revenues were down only in low teens in local currency due to print declines, a slight improvement from the prior quarter rate. Reported circulation revenues at News UK declined high teens versus the prior year quarter, but was flat in local currency as cover price increases were offset by single-copy volume declines. News UK benefited this quarter from a combination of cost-savings initiatives, including lower sports rights costs for The Sun, lower marketing and lower production costs.
Wireless Group contributed about $25 million to reported revenues this quarter, representing low single-digit growth in local currency, driven by talkSPORT. The integration into News UK is progressing well. Commercial efforts are now focused on extending News UK's reach, particularly in sport. All of the News UK brands and platforms are now involved in sharing content, talent and driving cross-promotion.
At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well, with revenues up low single digits versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store promotions, which grew mid-teens, offsetting declines in freestanding inserts. We saw increased CPG spending from flagship brands, in part due to the addition of new retailers and operational enhancements.
And at Checkout 51, as Robert mentioned, we achieved 12.5 million members during the quarter, ahead of schedule, while incurring $8 million in investment spending during this quarter.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. We had another very strong performance, with revenues of $456 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. This quarter benefited from the continued success of backlist titles, including Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance and Sarah Young's Jesus Always and Jesus Calling. Revenue growth also benefited from strong front-list titles, including The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines, Patricia Cornwell's Chaos and The Midnight Gang by David Walliams. Megyn Kelly's Settle for More also contributed to the growth in revenue this quarter.
Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 16% of consumer revenues, with digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter for the first time in 2 years, driven principally by audiobooks. And segment EBITDA of $75 million improved by 32% versus the prior year, helped by higher revenue noted above and the mix benefit from the higher-margin backlist titles.
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $34 million or 16% to $242 million, and adjusted revenues increased 10%. Reported segment EBITDA was $95 million, up $22 million or 30% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both Move and REA.
REA's revenue grew 19% or approximately 14% in local currency due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue, benefiting from favorable product mix and higher prices, coupled with a modest revenue contribution from iProperty. This was partially offset by the impact from lower listing volumes. REA reported their first half results today and just concluded their conference call, which provided more detail.
Move revenues, excluding the results of its TigerLead business, which was sold in November last year, rose approximately 10% to $91 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Co-Broke and higher lead volume. On a reported basis, revenues rose 7% to $93 million. TigerLead generated $17 million of revenues last year, but was declining as a lead generation source and had a very modest profit contribution.
As Robert mentioned, realtor launched Advantage in early December, a new market-priced product, targeted to listing agents and has some set its Showcase product. While it's early in the rollout, we are pleased with the take-up rate and with the positive feedback from our customers.
We continue to expect revenue growth to improve in the second half and to see increasing EBITDA contribution this fiscal year versus the prior year. For the quarter, Move contributed $10 million to segment EBITDA growth. And average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remained strong, up mid-teens year-over-year to 44 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues fell 2% to $104 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting lower subscription and advertising revenues, partially impacted by the absence of the Rugby World Cup in the prior year. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 31% to $51 million due to the absence of programming rights costs related to the Rugby World Cup and the English Premier League. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $238 million this quarter compared to positive $15 million last year. As noted earlier, this quarter includes a $227 million pretax noncash adjustment to step down the carrying value of Foxtel as a result of the flow-through impact of lower EBITDA into projected future cash flows. And recall that prior to the separation of new News Corp in fiscal 2013, the company acquired an additional 25% stake in Foxtel through Consolidated Media Holdings and had stepped up its carrying value and recognized a pretax noncash gain of $900 million at that time. As a result of this adjustment, the current carrying value of News Corp's 50% stake in Foxtel is now $1.2 billion, and we also hold a $325 million shareholder note new from Foxtel. And again, for clarity, all the amounts I just mentioned are all in U.S. dollars.
Our equity loss pickup for this quarter also included a $9 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in Ten Network and a $2 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind down. We expect Foxtel to incur additional Presto shutdown costs in the third quarter in the range of $20 million to $25 million, with our share being at 50% of that range.
Regarding its operational performance, Foxtel ended the quarter with more than 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing, cable and satellite subscribers flat compared to the prior year. In the second quarter, cable and satellite churn was at 15.6%, comparable to the first quarter, which was primarily related to customers under no contract offers as well as seasonal port disconnections.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 1% to $602 million, but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 7% to $144 million, but was down 10% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and increases in programming costs, specifically in local production and sports, partially offset by lower transmission costs. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 4% to around AUD 86.
Capital expenditures from continuing operations for the first half was at $108 million, lower than the $120 million in the prior year. And for the upcoming fiscal third quarter, just a few points to note. Whilst global print trends remain uncertain at our newspaper operations, we expect further cost-saving initiatives across our news mastheads. We also expect to see growth at News America Marketing, led by in-store promotions.
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see increased EBITDA contribution and improved revenues at realtor.com, combined with continued growth at REA. Book Publishing should continue to benefit from a strong release slate. We're encouraged by the success of Margot Lee Shetterly's Hidden Figures, and we'll also have the release of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark.
And at Cable Network Programming, rights costs should be down modestly in local currency given the absence of EPL rights.
So in summary, as we had expected, this quarter demonstrated the importance of digital real estate to our growth trajectory, the importance of a strong portfolio of content at HarperCollins and the ability to monetize global rights and finally, our commitment to improving the cost structure at News and Information Services.
And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A."

The -- generally speaking at Dow Jones, as you said, the digital revenues are growing, both in terms of advertising. Circulation revenues up around 6%. And in terms of print this quarter, as I mentioned earlier, it's hard to give you a definite outlook for this quarter. But certainly, thus far, the decline is moderating."

But there -- look, there are offers out there with the phasing out of Presto and the focusing on Foxtel Play, and it's certainly up to our team in Australia to prove to customers what we all know to be a fact that the offering in sport and other programming by Foxtel is far superior to that of the competition."

212741644,427983057,1197567,"News Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, May 09, 2017",2017-05-09,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues",1968,"Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues and EBITDA, specifically a 5% rise in revenues to approximately $2 billion and total segment EBITDA of $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included the News America Marketing settlement charge. Excluding that charge, total segment EBITDA in the quarter would have increased 36% compared to the prior year.
We are pleased with the performance of many of our businesses including our Digital Real Estate Services segment, which continues to thrive. We had indicated that its EBITDA contribution [indiscernible] would improve and that revenue growth would accelerate. And I'm pleased to report both goals have been achieved this quarter, though we will certainly not allow complacency smugness to be characteristics of realtor.com. 
While print advertising remains challenging, we saw a moderation in declines across our mastheads this quarter. And notably, the News and Information segments was a source of growth this quarter both in revenues and EBITDA, driven by the muscular performance of in-store product revenues in News America Marketing, healthy circulation revenue gains at The Wall Street Journal and a thoughtful cost-reduction program.
Speaking of The Wall Street Journal, we continued to build on the momentum of digital sales, adding more than 300,000 subscribers year-over-year. Digital now accounts for 53% of total subscriptions, up from 44% last year and 38% 2 years ago. In fact, we added even more subs this quarter than in the second quarter, suggesting that the appetite for premium news and thoughtful commentary is undiminished. This success also is a result of innovation with our pay wall, including the elimination of Google's so-called First Click Free scheme, which is in need of serious scrutiny as it punishes premium users. But whiners are not winners, so I'm pleased to report we are making progress on our development of a new digital advertising platform focused initially on the U.S. market using the data, content and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have real reach and are not subject to guilt by association.
This initiative follows our News Connect offering at Australia, and we will provide more information about the emerging platform in the coming months. We have been among the strongest and most consistent voices in making clear that the digital duopoly has commodified content and has created an ecosystem that is dysfunctional and defiled. The consequences of commodification include fake news, rampant piracy and brands juxtaposed with jaundice on extremist websites.  The current content configuration is detrimental to consumers, to businesses and to societies. We are in discussion with Facebook and Google about premium content and brand-enhancing environments and hope that they will assist in fashioning a healthier ecosystem that rewards creators and content and not just the distributors, the pirates and the perfidious. At this stage, it is fair to say that Facebook is more responsive and responsible, but we will highlight these issues until there is meaningful movement. 
Let us talk to -- turn to our businesses in more detail. At move, realty.com, reported revenues increased by 15% in the quarter, accelerating from fiscal Q2 levels. Excluding the $4 million from TigerLead, which we have sold in November, growth was 20%. And the company contributed segment EBITDA growth consistent with our expectations.  Average monthly uniques increased some 44 million in Q2 to 55 million for the quarter, including a monthly record of 58 million in March.  And we saw improvements in page penetration and audience engagement, crucial for lead volume, which also improved in the quarter.
Overall according to ComScore, in March, Realtor.com led Zillow and Trulio on engagement by 30% based on minutes spent and has continued to gain share in the sector. The advantage products launched in December is performing in line with expectations, as we saw acceleration in growth in connections [indiscernible] product driven by higher lead volume and increased customer flow. 
We continued to fortify realtor.com with products like Science Net, street peak and enhanced 3D listings, which will move from beta to full release in the coming month. We added photography and local data to off-market listings, which helps drive engagement. And we focused on the speed and reliability of our products to ensure an optimal experience for users. 
Looking ahead, move is expecting to make further development for the software and development. This is an essential element of our crucial relationship with a community of realtors who are center to real estate transactions.
REA, which completed the sale of its European business in December 2016, posted strong revenue and expanded EBITDA contribution in its core Australian business, driven by product mix and the adoption of premium products.  REA achieved record visits in March and materially outperformed competition. The company provides a deeper content experience, complementing our markets in Australia and has strengthened its premium product offerings, launching FrontPage, allowing vendors to showcase properties on the homepage based on the user's previous search behavior. 
At News and Information Services, revenues grew almost 3%. And segment EBITDA, excluding the settlement charge at News America Marketing in the prior year, would have expanded more than 30%. As mentioned, the decline in print advertising moderated while whilst we implemented cost-reduction programs such as The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative, which is designed to reduce expenses, but imperatively create a contemporary flow of content for readers and clients.  We are clearly cost-conscious but the intent to bolster the quality of our unique content across our mastheads and across platforms across the world.  At Dow Jones, ad revenue trends improved relative to the prior quarter. 
Meanwhile, the risk and compliance business remains particularly healthy, with revenue growth over 20% and prospects certainly appearing positive. There is [ real ] and compliance is essential. As mentioned, there was robust digital subscriber growth at The Journal with a more than 30% increase versus the prior year, and the momentum has continued. In fact, not only did we have the 300,000 year-over-year increase, but this also set a record in digital subscriber growth since the launch of our sales and subscriber reporting metric. Overall, circulation revenues expanded in the mid-single-digit range. 
The New York Post digital network continues to make headway, and digital now accounts for more than 15% of its ad revenues. We were also pleased to report last month that Page Six TV has been adopted in 185 markets covering 90% of the country in advance of its launch this fall. That augurs well for the program and the brand.
In the U.K. at The Times, total print circulation volumes grew high single digits and market share improved again. In digital. The Times and The Sunday Times continued to grow subs and ARPU. While in print, the Times had the largest year-on-year growth among paid for national papers in the quarter. At The Sun, the number of monthly unique visitors boomed, reaching 80 million globally in March, doubling over the past year and up fivefold since the pay wall was removed in late 2015. The Sun has already surpassed The Mirror as the second most read news website in the U.K. and is working closely with Talk Sport to drive incremental traffic and revenues. Times for the U.K. economy remain positive, despite the fear mongering ahead of the Brexit vote and regardless of the inevitable uncertainty caused by the upcoming election.
Conditions for our mastheads in Australia remained challenging, although print ad declines moderated and circulation revenues were relatively stable, thanks to our lift in digital subscribers and price increases. Our team in Australia is focused on digital subscriptions, which generate 27% growth year-over-year including ARM to more than 330,000. Meanwhile, news.com.au retained its ranking as the leading news source in Australia. 
News America Marketing saw a marked growth in the in-store business, which is benefiting from product enhancements and an increase in [indiscernible]. Consumer goods companies and retail are increasingly recognizing [indiscernible] at the point of purchase. Checkout 51 also grew in the quarter and now has 13.4 million U.S. and Canadian members, more than double the total of last year. It has become a key part of NAM's integrated offering. In fact, Checkout 51, along with Storyful and Realty.com, are working closely with NAM on joint sales pitches with major brands to better leverage data and drive incremental revenue. 
The News and Information Services segment also benefited from the acquisition of Wireless Group in the U.K. and the Australian Regional Media business, both of which contributed  revenues in the quarter. 
Storyful and Unruly continued to expand their collaboration and are working more closely than ever with many of our businesses. Storyful recently announced a new partnership in Australia [indiscernible] it has expanded its work to assist companies with concerns of their brand safety and furnish vital intelligence on issues related to risk and compliance.
In Book Publishing, there was solid revenue growth at HarperCollins, which showed improvements in digital sales and the enduring success of Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. We also had to release Carve The Mark. We are looking forward with much anticipation to read new books in May, and note the continued strength of HarperCollins' Christian base . We are confident that the international footprint we acquired through Harlequin, combined with our expertise, should lead to increased business in Latin America where the evangelical movement is particularly influential. 
At Fox Sports, advertising remains strong compared to a relatively subdued TV marketplace in Australia. Ratings were 6% higher in March year-over-year, thanks in part to the successful launch of the Fox League channel, its dedicated rugby league offering. Fox Sports also launched the first overseas over-the-top partnership with IFL. Now people around the world can watch the world's most captivating contact sport. 
At our 50%-owned Foxtel, the company continues to invest in top-tier sports and local content, further differentiating its unique package from lower quality players. Foxtel Play will have an upgraded user interface and additional HD options, as Foxtel seeks to provide a compelling offering for customers. 
Having acquired the popular Sky News, we have added to our portfolio cable networks in Australia, and we'll be able to consolidate costs and share digital and video learnings across our platforms. We have just announced the transfer of Fox Sports News to Sky News, which will allow us to maximize synergies and scale. 
Looking once again at the quarter as a whole, we see the value of our content, the power of our platform, the benefits of cost constraint and the manifold ways our businesses are combining and complementing each other and crucially creating long-term value for all our shareholders. 
we were pleased to announce the addition of former U.S. Senator, [indiscernible] to our board, following the departure of [indiscernible, who became the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the new administration. We wish her well in her profoundly important role.
And I would finally like to say a word of thanks to the new News Corp's first CFO, the venerable Bedi Singh, who did much to assist in launching the company. And I'm very proud and delighted to introduce our new CFO, Susan Panuccio, a longtime colleague at News Corp.  Susan brings to this important task a savvy strategic sensibility and a rigorous attention to both detail and the larger landscape. She has experience in both the U.K. and Australia as well as insight into the importance of digital transformation of the news and property business. For all these reasons and more, I have great confidence not only in her, but in the prospects for this business and its value to our shareholders.  Thank you for your support. And so please welcome Susan."
212741644,427983057,1197567,"News Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, May 09, 2017",2017-05-09,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you for those kind words, Robert. I'm delighted to be here today and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the near future. This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm real",2140,"Thank you for those kind words, Robert. I'm delighted to be here today and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the near future. 
This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm really excited to have taken a broader role across the company. While I'm very new to this role, there are a few observations I would like to make. We are a company that has global scale, customers and data sets that could be better monetized. As Robert mentioned, one near term initiative will be the launch of our global digital advertising platform in the coming months. But there is a lot more we can do including more effectively showing resources, standardizing subscription strategies and better leveraging our content across the mastheads in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. 
There is more we can do and are doing on costs. While we need to make sure we continue to invest in digital initiatives, I also think there is plenty of room to improve efficiencies and remove legacy costs across the business, and much of that is underway.
Revenues from printed and news mastheads remains a very important source of revenue. However, we do need to be focused on driving incremental and higher-margin revenue streams ranging from custom content to higher-margin brand extensions, such as Sun [indiscernible] in the U.K.  And finally, I will be open to new ideas and new ways that will drive higher growth and value per share in the long term. 
With that as an introduction, I'll now turn to the operating results for this quarter. We reported fiscal 2017 third quarter total revenues of around $2 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $21 million negative impact on revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar outweighed by weakness in the pound. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included a onetime settlement charge of $280 million at News America Marketing. Excluding the charge in the prior year, segment EBITDA would have risen [ 36% ]. 
For the quarter, loss per share from continuing operations was $0.01 versus a loss of $0.26 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.07 versus $0.04 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 3% to approximately $1.3 billion versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising rose around 4%, or 5% in local currency, driven by News America Marketing and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by print advertising declines, although the rates of advertising decline moderated this quarter across all territories. 
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 1%, yet rose 3% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of Australia Regional Media or ARM, price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volume. 
News and Information Services EBITDA this quarter was $123 million, up from $93 million in the prior period, excluding $280 million News America Marketing settlement last year. We saw strong EBITDA contribution at News America Marketing, led by in-store product and modest year-over-year improvement at Dow Jones and U.K, offset by declines in the Australian business. 
We also had an adjustment to the third consideration for Unruly, which positively impacted EBITDA by around $12 million this quarter. 
Looking at performance across our key units. At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well, with revenues up 13% versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store products, which more than offset declines in freestanding inserts products. Some of the growth was timing-related, but we continue to see strong growth due to the increased number of retailers and higher brand spending. To give you a sense of the timing-related difference, we estimate that approximately $15 million, less than half of News America's revenue growth this quarter, was timing-related which will unwind in fiscal Q4. Checkout 51 continues to expand, now reaching over [ 13 ] million members at quarter end and continues to increase visibility and gain traction with our CPG clients. 
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenues declined around 12% due to print advertising, which was a marked improvement from the fiscal Q2 performance which saw advertising down over 20%. Pleasingly, the mix of advertising is changing. In fact in fiscal Q3, approximately 15% of total advertising at Dow Jones is what I would call emerging or nontraditional advertising revenue. This includes custom content conferences and of course programmatic advertising, and this is will remain a big focus going forward. 
As Robert mentioned, we are continuing to see strong paid volume growth in digital at The Wall Street Journal, where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.2 million, a 12% year-over-year increase driven by higher digital-only sales, which rose over 30% versus the prior year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew mid-single digits due to both volume gains and higher subscription pricing led by The Wall Street Journal which grew high single digits. Professional information business revenues remained relatively stable with the prior year, similar to last quarter as we continued to see very strong growth at risk and compliance together with a strong pipeline for new business. 
At News Australia, advertising revenues rose $8 million or 5% and were down 1% in local currency. The increase in advertising revenues was driven by the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $20 million in the quarter. Advertising revenues at our other Australian mastheads remain challenged, but showed a sequential improvement, partly due to the moderation in the real estate and employment categories, particularly at the low advertising level. Circulation revenues at News Australia increased $7 million or 8% and were up slightly in local currency, primarily due to the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $6 million. Cover price increases, including one take in Weekday Australia in February and higher paid digital subscriptions largely offset print volume declines at our existing mastheads, which were up 7%. 
On cost initiatives within the Australian business, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2017 and continue to seek additional cost reduction, although some of that savings being reinvested to accelerate our digital transition, given that the Australian business has the highest proportion of print advertising across our markets as a percentage of overall revenue. 
At News U.K. while reported advertising revenues decreased 18% in local currency, it was closer to a high single-digit decline, also a modest sequential improvement from the low teens last quarter. Reported circulation revenues at News U.K. [indiscernible] 10% versus the prior year quarter but rose 4% in local currency, as cover price increases more than offset single copy volume declines at The Sun. 
At Wireless Group, revenue was flat as growth in Talk Sport was offset by the absence of revenues from Sport Magazine, which was closed in February 2017. We continue to make good progress on the integration of Wireless into the News U.K. group. 
Turning to the Book publishing segment, revenues were $374 million, up 4% compared to prior year. We saw strong contribution this quarter from titles including Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. Revenues also benefited from the release of Veronica Roth Carve The Mark. However, sales of these were off to a slow start than anticipated. Segment EBITDA rose 3% to $37 million as the revenue growth was offset by an unfavorable cost of sales this quarter. Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 22% of consumer revenues, digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter driven principally by audiobooks. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $25 million or 13% to $219 million and adjusted revenues increased 15%, which excludes the impact from the divestitures of REA's European and New's sale of TigerLead last quarter as well as currency impacts and acquisitions.
Reported segment EBITDA was $75 million, up $36 million or 92% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both move and REA, including legal costs of move. Adjusted segment EBITDA gained 68%. 
REA's revenues grew 10% due to an increase in Australian residential revenue, resulting from favorable product mix and higher prices and a $6 million impact from favorable foreign currency fluctuation. The growth was partially offset by a $9 million or 9% decline in revenue resulting from the divestiture of the European business. It's important to note that the REA Group report results, but present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a bigger variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Please refer to REA's earnings release for more details on this. 
As expected, REA results showed strong growth in EBITDA contribution, strong operating margin for the Australian business. Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $100 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Connections for buyers and higher nonlisting media revenue. TigerLead, which was sold in November, contributed $4 million in the prior period. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up high single digits year-over-year to 55 million in the quarter and 58 million in March. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues rose 14% to $122 million compared to the prior year quarter from the inclusion of $9 million related to the acquisition of Sky News and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenue growth was 1%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat at $34 million and up modestly on an adjusted basis. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $23 million this quarter compared to positive $2 million last year. Our equity loss this quarter included a $7 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network and a further $10 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down consistent with our expectation. Both numbers reflect our 50% share. 
Regarding its operating performance. Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers down 1% compared to the prior year, but saw small subscriber gains from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn was 16.1% compared to 14.3% in the prior year, but encouragingly showed improvement late in the quarter with the beginning of winter sports and the launch of the FOX lead channels. 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $591 million, but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 9% to $131 million and was down 13% in local currency due to the increase in revenue and increases in programming costs, principally in sports. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86. 
And finally for Q3, capital expenditures for the continuing operations year-to-date were $168 million, lower than $180 million in the prior year. 
I would like to now turn to the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter. You may recall that the prior year included a 53rd week, which contributed $112 million in revenues last year. In addition, we also recognized a gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Absent those items, I have a few more observations. 
In the News and Information Services segment, overall advertising trends at this point are relatively similar to fiscal third quarter for our key mastheads. As I noted, News America Marketing had a timing benefit this quarter, which will reverse in Q4, of around $15 million. And we will also be lapping a price increase of The Sun Monday to Friday in the prior year. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see improved revenues and continued strong EBITDA contribution at realtor.com. REA expects phasing of costs to be higher in the fourth quarter versus a year ago in the third quarter due to increased investment in product innovation and associated marketing expenses. REA will discuss this in more detail during their quarterly conference call shortly after ours.
At Book Publishing, the environment remains relatively healthy in the fourth quarter. However, we will have fewer front-list titles in the prior year. Notable releases for Q4 are due in late May. 
In summary, the quarter demonstrated a few things: We are a company that is evolving with a unique mix of assets that is continuing our push towards digital. Digital real estate continues to expand. contributions to EBITDA is now solidly positive, as we had anticipated, and the segment is helping to reshape News Corp's long-term growth trajectory. We are taking action to stabilize the News and Information Services segment. We're still facing an uncertain print market, and we must be diligent on costs and accelerate digital as quickly and aggressively as we can. 
With that, let me hand over to the operator for Q&A."

In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues",1968,"Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues and EBITDA, specifically a 5% rise in revenues to approximately $2 billion and total segment EBITDA of $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included the News America Marketing settlement charge. Excluding that charge, total segment EBITDA in the quarter would have increased 36% compared to the prior year.
We are pleased with the performance of many of our businesses including our Digital Real Estate Services segment, which continues to thrive. We had indicated that its EBITDA contribution [indiscernible] would improve and that revenue growth would accelerate. And I'm pleased to report both goals have been achieved this quarter, though we will certainly not allow complacency smugness to be characteristics of realtor.com. 
While print advertising remains challenging, we saw a moderation in declines across our mastheads this quarter. And notably, the News and Information segments was a source of growth this quarter both in revenues and EBITDA, driven by the muscular performance of in-store product revenues in News America Marketing, healthy circulation revenue gains at The Wall Street Journal and a thoughtful cost-reduction program.
Speaking of The Wall Street Journal, we continued to build on the momentum of digital sales, adding more than 300,000 subscribers year-over-year. Digital now accounts for 53% of total subscriptions, up from 44% last year and 38% 2 years ago. In fact, we added even more subs this quarter than in the second quarter, suggesting that the appetite for premium news and thoughtful commentary is undiminished. This success also is a result of innovation with our pay wall, including the elimination of Google's so-called First Click Free scheme, which is in need of serious scrutiny as it punishes premium users. But whiners are not winners, so I'm pleased to report we are making progress on our development of a new digital advertising platform focused initially on the U.S. market using the data, content and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have real reach and are not subject to guilt by association.
This initiative follows our News Connect offering at Australia, and we will provide more information about the emerging platform in the coming months. We have been among the strongest and most consistent voices in making clear that the digital duopoly has commodified content and has created an ecosystem that is dysfunctional and defiled. The consequences of commodification include fake news, rampant piracy and brands juxtaposed with jaundice on extremist websites.  The current content configuration is detrimental to consumers, to businesses and to societies. We are in discussion with Facebook and Google about premium content and brand-enhancing environments and hope that they will assist in fashioning a healthier ecosystem that rewards creators and content and not just the distributors, the pirates and the perfidious. At this stage, it is fair to say that Facebook is more responsive and responsible, but we will highlight these issues until there is meaningful movement. 
Let us talk to -- turn to our businesses in more detail. At move, realty.com, reported revenues increased by 15% in the quarter, accelerating from fiscal Q2 levels. Excluding the $4 million from TigerLead, which we have sold in November, growth was 20%. And the company contributed segment EBITDA growth consistent with our expectations.  Average monthly uniques increased some 44 million in Q2 to 55 million for the quarter, including a monthly record of 58 million in March.  And we saw improvements in page penetration and audience engagement, crucial for lead volume, which also improved in the quarter.
Overall according to ComScore, in March, Realtor.com led Zillow and Trulio on engagement by 30% based on minutes spent and has continued to gain share in the sector. The advantage products launched in December is performing in line with expectations, as we saw acceleration in growth in connections [indiscernible] product driven by higher lead volume and increased customer flow. 
We continued to fortify realtor.com with products like Science Net, street peak and enhanced 3D listings, which will move from beta to full release in the coming month. We added photography and local data to off-market listings, which helps drive engagement. And we focused on the speed and reliability of our products to ensure an optimal experience for users. 
Looking ahead, move is expecting to make further development for the software and development. This is an essential element of our crucial relationship with a community of realtors who are center to real estate transactions.
REA, which completed the sale of its European business in December 2016, posted strong revenue and expanded EBITDA contribution in its core Australian business, driven by product mix and the adoption of premium products.  REA achieved record visits in March and materially outperformed competition. The company provides a deeper content experience, complementing our markets in Australia and has strengthened its premium product offerings, launching FrontPage, allowing vendors to showcase properties on the homepage based on the user's previous search behavior. 
At News and Information Services, revenues grew almost 3%. And segment EBITDA, excluding the settlement charge at News America Marketing in the prior year, would have expanded more than 30%. As mentioned, the decline in print advertising moderated while whilst we implemented cost-reduction programs such as The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative, which is designed to reduce expenses, but imperatively create a contemporary flow of content for readers and clients.  We are clearly cost-conscious but the intent to bolster the quality of our unique content across our mastheads and across platforms across the world.  At Dow Jones, ad revenue trends improved relative to the prior quarter. 
Meanwhile, the risk and compliance business remains particularly healthy, with revenue growth over 20% and prospects certainly appearing positive. There is [ real ] and compliance is essential. As mentioned, there was robust digital subscriber growth at The Journal with a more than 30% increase versus the prior year, and the momentum has continued. In fact, not only did we have the 300,000 year-over-year increase, but this also set a record in digital subscriber growth since the launch of our sales and subscriber reporting metric. Overall, circulation revenues expanded in the mid-single-digit range. 
The New York Post digital network continues to make headway, and digital now accounts for more than 15% of its ad revenues. We were also pleased to report last month that Page Six TV has been adopted in 185 markets covering 90% of the country in advance of its launch this fall. That augurs well for the program and the brand.
In the U.K. at The Times, total print circulation volumes grew high single digits and market share improved again. In digital. The Times and The Sunday Times continued to grow subs and ARPU. While in print, the Times had the largest year-on-year growth among paid for national papers in the quarter. At The Sun, the number of monthly unique visitors boomed, reaching 80 million globally in March, doubling over the past year and up fivefold since the pay wall was removed in late 2015. The Sun has already surpassed The Mirror as the second most read news website in the U.K. and is working closely with Talk Sport to drive incremental traffic and revenues. Times for the U.K. economy remain positive, despite the fear mongering ahead of the Brexit vote and regardless of the inevitable uncertainty caused by the upcoming election.
Conditions for our mastheads in Australia remained challenging, although print ad declines moderated and circulation revenues were relatively stable, thanks to our lift in digital subscribers and price increases. Our team in Australia is focused on digital subscriptions, which generate 27% growth year-over-year including ARM to more than 330,000. Meanwhile, news.com.au retained its ranking as the leading news source in Australia. 
News America Marketing saw a marked growth in the in-store business, which is benefiting from product enhancements and an increase in [indiscernible]. Consumer goods companies and retail are increasingly recognizing [indiscernible] at the point of purchase. Checkout 51 also grew in the quarter and now has 13.4 million U.S. and Canadian members, more than double the total of last year. It has become a key part of NAM's integrated offering. In fact, Checkout 51, along with Storyful and Realty.com, are working closely with NAM on joint sales pitches with major brands to better leverage data and drive incremental revenue. 
The News and Information Services segment also benefited from the acquisition of Wireless Group in the U.K. and the Australian Regional Media business, both of which contributed  revenues in the quarter. 
Storyful and Unruly continued to expand their collaboration and are working more closely than ever with many of our businesses. Storyful recently announced a new partnership in Australia [indiscernible] it has expanded its work to assist companies with concerns of their brand safety and furnish vital intelligence on issues related to risk and compliance.
In Book Publishing, there was solid revenue growth at HarperCollins, which showed improvements in digital sales and the enduring success of Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. We also had to release Carve The Mark. We are looking forward with much anticipation to read new books in May, and note the continued strength of HarperCollins' Christian base . We are confident that the international footprint we acquired through Harlequin, combined with our expertise, should lead to increased business in Latin America where the evangelical movement is particularly influential. 
At Fox Sports, advertising remains strong compared to a relatively subdued TV marketplace in Australia. Ratings were 6% higher in March year-over-year, thanks in part to the successful launch of the Fox League channel, its dedicated rugby league offering. Fox Sports also launched the first overseas over-the-top partnership with IFL. Now people around the world can watch the world's most captivating contact sport. 
At our 50%-owned Foxtel, the company continues to invest in top-tier sports and local content, further differentiating its unique package from lower quality players. Foxtel Play will have an upgraded user interface and additional HD options, as Foxtel seeks to provide a compelling offering for customers. 
Having acquired the popular Sky News, we have added to our portfolio cable networks in Australia, and we'll be able to consolidate costs and share digital and video learnings across our platforms. We have just announced the transfer of Fox Sports News to Sky News, which will allow us to maximize synergies and scale. 
Looking once again at the quarter as a whole, we see the value of our content, the power of our platform, the benefits of cost constraint and the manifold ways our businesses are combining and complementing each other and crucially creating long-term value for all our shareholders. 
we were pleased to announce the addition of former U.S. Senator, [indiscernible] to our board, following the departure of [indiscernible, who became the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the new administration. We wish her well in her profoundly important role.
And I would finally like to say a word of thanks to the new News Corp's first CFO, the venerable Bedi Singh, who did much to assist in launching the company. And I'm very proud and delighted to introduce our new CFO, Susan Panuccio, a longtime colleague at News Corp.  Susan brings to this important task a savvy strategic sensibility and a rigorous attention to both detail and the larger landscape. She has experience in both the U.K. and Australia as well as insight into the importance of digital transformation of the news and property business. For all these reasons and more, I have great confidence not only in her, but in the prospects for this business and its value to our shareholders.  Thank you for your support. And so please welcome Susan."

This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm real",2140,"Thank you for those kind words, Robert. I'm delighted to be here today and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the near future. 
This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm really excited to have taken a broader role across the company. While I'm very new to this role, there are a few observations I would like to make. We are a company that has global scale, customers and data sets that could be better monetized. As Robert mentioned, one near term initiative will be the launch of our global digital advertising platform in the coming months. But there is a lot more we can do including more effectively showing resources, standardizing subscription strategies and better leveraging our content across the mastheads in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. 
There is more we can do and are doing on costs. While we need to make sure we continue to invest in digital initiatives, I also think there is plenty of room to improve efficiencies and remove legacy costs across the business, and much of that is underway.
Revenues from printed and news mastheads remains a very important source of revenue. However, we do need to be focused on driving incremental and higher-margin revenue streams ranging from custom content to higher-margin brand extensions, such as Sun [indiscernible] in the U.K.  And finally, I will be open to new ideas and new ways that will drive higher growth and value per share in the long term. 
With that as an introduction, I'll now turn to the operating results for this quarter. We reported fiscal 2017 third quarter total revenues of around $2 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $21 million negative impact on revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar outweighed by weakness in the pound. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included a onetime settlement charge of $280 million at News America Marketing. Excluding the charge in the prior year, segment EBITDA would have risen [ 36% ]. 
For the quarter, loss per share from continuing operations was $0.01 versus a loss of $0.26 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.07 versus $0.04 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 3% to approximately $1.3 billion versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising rose around 4%, or 5% in local currency, driven by News America Marketing and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by print advertising declines, although the rates of advertising decline moderated this quarter across all territories. 
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 1%, yet rose 3% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of Australia Regional Media or ARM, price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volume. 
News and Information Services EBITDA this quarter was $123 million, up from $93 million in the prior period, excluding $280 million News America Marketing settlement last year. We saw strong EBITDA contribution at News America Marketing, led by in-store product and modest year-over-year improvement at Dow Jones and U.K, offset by declines in the Australian business. 
We also had an adjustment to the third consideration for Unruly, which positively impacted EBITDA by around $12 million this quarter. 
Looking at performance across our key units. At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well, with revenues up 13% versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store products, which more than offset declines in freestanding inserts products. Some of the growth was timing-related, but we continue to see strong growth due to the increased number of retailers and higher brand spending. To give you a sense of the timing-related difference, we estimate that approximately $15 million, less than half of News America's revenue growth this quarter, was timing-related which will unwind in fiscal Q4. Checkout 51 continues to expand, now reaching over [ 13 ] million members at quarter end and continues to increase visibility and gain traction with our CPG clients. 
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenues declined around 12% due to print advertising, which was a marked improvement from the fiscal Q2 performance which saw advertising down over 20%. Pleasingly, the mix of advertising is changing. In fact in fiscal Q3, approximately 15% of total advertising at Dow Jones is what I would call emerging or nontraditional advertising revenue. This includes custom content conferences and of course programmatic advertising, and this is will remain a big focus going forward. 
As Robert mentioned, we are continuing to see strong paid volume growth in digital at The Wall Street Journal, where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.2 million, a 12% year-over-year increase driven by higher digital-only sales, which rose over 30% versus the prior year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew mid-single digits due to both volume gains and higher subscription pricing led by The Wall Street Journal which grew high single digits. Professional information business revenues remained relatively stable with the prior year, similar to last quarter as we continued to see very strong growth at risk and compliance together with a strong pipeline for new business. 
At News Australia, advertising revenues rose $8 million or 5% and were down 1% in local currency. The increase in advertising revenues was driven by the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $20 million in the quarter. Advertising revenues at our other Australian mastheads remain challenged, but showed a sequential improvement, partly due to the moderation in the real estate and employment categories, particularly at the low advertising level. Circulation revenues at News Australia increased $7 million or 8% and were up slightly in local currency, primarily due to the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $6 million. Cover price increases, including one take in Weekday Australia in February and higher paid digital subscriptions largely offset print volume declines at our existing mastheads, which were up 7%. 
On cost initiatives within the Australian business, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2017 and continue to seek additional cost reduction, although some of that savings being reinvested to accelerate our digital transition, given that the Australian business has the highest proportion of print advertising across our markets as a percentage of overall revenue. 
At News U.K. while reported advertising revenues decreased 18% in local currency, it was closer to a high single-digit decline, also a modest sequential improvement from the low teens last quarter. Reported circulation revenues at News U.K. [indiscernible] 10% versus the prior year quarter but rose 4% in local currency, as cover price increases more than offset single copy volume declines at The Sun. 
At Wireless Group, revenue was flat as growth in Talk Sport was offset by the absence of revenues from Sport Magazine, which was closed in February 2017. We continue to make good progress on the integration of Wireless into the News U.K. group. 
Turning to the Book publishing segment, revenues were $374 million, up 4% compared to prior year. We saw strong contribution this quarter from titles including Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. Revenues also benefited from the release of Veronica Roth Carve The Mark. However, sales of these were off to a slow start than anticipated. Segment EBITDA rose 3% to $37 million as the revenue growth was offset by an unfavorable cost of sales this quarter. Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 22% of consumer revenues, digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter driven principally by audiobooks. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $25 million or 13% to $219 million and adjusted revenues increased 15%, which excludes the impact from the divestitures of REA's European and New's sale of TigerLead last quarter as well as currency impacts and acquisitions.
Reported segment EBITDA was $75 million, up $36 million or 92% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both move and REA, including legal costs of move. Adjusted segment EBITDA gained 68%. 
REA's revenues grew 10% due to an increase in Australian residential revenue, resulting from favorable product mix and higher prices and a $6 million impact from favorable foreign currency fluctuation. The growth was partially offset by a $9 million or 9% decline in revenue resulting from the divestiture of the European business. It's important to note that the REA Group report results, but present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a bigger variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Please refer to REA's earnings release for more details on this. 
As expected, REA results showed strong growth in EBITDA contribution, strong operating margin for the Australian business. Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $100 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Connections for buyers and higher nonlisting media revenue. TigerLead, which was sold in November, contributed $4 million in the prior period. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up high single digits year-over-year to 55 million in the quarter and 58 million in March. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues rose 14% to $122 million compared to the prior year quarter from the inclusion of $9 million related to the acquisition of Sky News and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenue growth was 1%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat at $34 million and up modestly on an adjusted basis. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $23 million this quarter compared to positive $2 million last year. Our equity loss this quarter included a $7 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network and a further $10 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down consistent with our expectation. Both numbers reflect our 50% share. 
Regarding its operating performance. Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers down 1% compared to the prior year, but saw small subscriber gains from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn was 16.1% compared to 14.3% in the prior year, but encouragingly showed improvement late in the quarter with the beginning of winter sports and the launch of the FOX lead channels. 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $591 million, but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 9% to $131 million and was down 13% in local currency due to the increase in revenue and increases in programming costs, principally in sports. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86. 
And finally for Q3, capital expenditures for the continuing operations year-to-date were $168 million, lower than $180 million in the prior year. 
I would like to now turn to the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter. You may recall that the prior year included a 53rd week, which contributed $112 million in revenues last year. In addition, we also recognized a gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Absent those items, I have a few more observations. 
In the News and Information Services segment, overall advertising trends at this point are relatively similar to fiscal third quarter for our key mastheads. As I noted, News America Marketing had a timing benefit this quarter, which will reverse in Q4, of around $15 million. And we will also be lapping a price increase of The Sun Monday to Friday in the prior year. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see improved revenues and continued strong EBITDA contribution at realtor.com. REA expects phasing of costs to be higher in the fourth quarter versus a year ago in the third quarter due to increased investment in product innovation and associated marketing expenses. REA will discuss this in more detail during their quarterly conference call shortly after ours.
At Book Publishing, the environment remains relatively healthy in the fourth quarter. However, we will have fewer front-list titles in the prior year. Notable releases for Q4 are due in late May. 
In summary, the quarter demonstrated a few things: We are a company that is evolving with a unique mix of assets that is continuing our push towards digital. Digital real estate continues to expand. contributions to EBITDA is now solidly positive, as we had anticipated, and the segment is helping to reshape News Corp's long-term growth trajectory. We are taking action to stabilize the News and Information Services segment. We're still facing an uncertain print market, and we must be diligent on costs and accelerate digital as quickly and aggressively as we can. 
With that, let me hand over to the operator for Q&A."

In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues",1968,"Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues and EBITDA, specifically a 5% rise in revenues to approximately $2 billion and total segment EBITDA of $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included the News America Marketing settlement charge. Excluding that charge, total segment EBITDA in the quarter would have increased 36% compared to the prior year.
We are pleased with the performance of many of our businesses including our Digital Real Estate Services segment, which continues to thrive. We had indicated that its EBITDA contribution [indiscernible] would improve and that revenue growth would accelerate. And I'm pleased to report both goals have been achieved this quarter, though we will certainly not allow complacency smugness to be characteristics of realtor.com. 
While print advertising remains challenging, we saw a moderation in declines across our mastheads this quarter. And notably, the News and Information segments was a source of growth this quarter both in revenues and EBITDA, driven by the muscular performance of in-store product revenues in News America Marketing, healthy circulation revenue gains at The Wall Street Journal and a thoughtful cost-reduction program.
Speaking of The Wall Street Journal, we continued to build on the momentum of digital sales, adding more than 300,000 subscribers year-over-year. Digital now accounts for 53% of total subscriptions, up from 44% last year and 38% 2 years ago. In fact, we added even more subs this quarter than in the second quarter, suggesting that the appetite for premium news and thoughtful commentary is undiminished. This success also is a result of innovation with our pay wall, including the elimination of Google's so-called First Click Free scheme, which is in need of serious scrutiny as it punishes premium users. But whiners are not winners, so I'm pleased to report we are making progress on our development of a new digital advertising platform focused initially on the U.S. market using the data, content and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have real reach and are not subject to guilt by association.
This initiative follows our News Connect offering at Australia, and we will provide more information about the emerging platform in the coming months. We have been among the strongest and most consistent voices in making clear that the digital duopoly has commodified content and has created an ecosystem that is dysfunctional and defiled. The consequences of commodification include fake news, rampant piracy and brands juxtaposed with jaundice on extremist websites.  The current content configuration is detrimental to consumers, to businesses and to societies. We are in discussion with Facebook and Google about premium content and brand-enhancing environments and hope that they will assist in fashioning a healthier ecosystem that rewards creators and content and not just the distributors, the pirates and the perfidious. At this stage, it is fair to say that Facebook is more responsive and responsible, but we will highlight these issues until there is meaningful movement. 
Let us talk to -- turn to our businesses in more detail. At move, realty.com, reported revenues increased by 15% in the quarter, accelerating from fiscal Q2 levels. Excluding the $4 million from TigerLead, which we have sold in November, growth was 20%. And the company contributed segment EBITDA growth consistent with our expectations.  Average monthly uniques increased some 44 million in Q2 to 55 million for the quarter, including a monthly record of 58 million in March.  And we saw improvements in page penetration and audience engagement, crucial for lead volume, which also improved in the quarter.
Overall according to ComScore, in March, Realtor.com led Zillow and Trulio on engagement by 30% based on minutes spent and has continued to gain share in the sector. The advantage products launched in December is performing in line with expectations, as we saw acceleration in growth in connections [indiscernible] product driven by higher lead volume and increased customer flow. 
We continued to fortify realtor.com with products like Science Net, street peak and enhanced 3D listings, which will move from beta to full release in the coming month. We added photography and local data to off-market listings, which helps drive engagement. And we focused on the speed and reliability of our products to ensure an optimal experience for users. 
Looking ahead, move is expecting to make further development for the software and development. This is an essential element of our crucial relationship with a community of realtors who are center to real estate transactions.
REA, which completed the sale of its European business in December 2016, posted strong revenue and expanded EBITDA contribution in its core Australian business, driven by product mix and the adoption of premium products.  REA achieved record visits in March and materially outperformed competition. The company provides a deeper content experience, complementing our markets in Australia and has strengthened its premium product offerings, launching FrontPage, allowing vendors to showcase properties on the homepage based on the user's previous search behavior. 
At News and Information Services, revenues grew almost 3%. And segment EBITDA, excluding the settlement charge at News America Marketing in the prior year, would have expanded more than 30%. As mentioned, the decline in print advertising moderated while whilst we implemented cost-reduction programs such as The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative, which is designed to reduce expenses, but imperatively create a contemporary flow of content for readers and clients.  We are clearly cost-conscious but the intent to bolster the quality of our unique content across our mastheads and across platforms across the world.  At Dow Jones, ad revenue trends improved relative to the prior quarter. 
Meanwhile, the risk and compliance business remains particularly healthy, with revenue growth over 20% and prospects certainly appearing positive. There is [ real ] and compliance is essential. As mentioned, there was robust digital subscriber growth at The Journal with a more than 30% increase versus the prior year, and the momentum has continued. In fact, not only did we have the 300,000 year-over-year increase, but this also set a record in digital subscriber growth since the launch of our sales and subscriber reporting metric. Overall, circulation revenues expanded in the mid-single-digit range. 
The New York Post digital network continues to make headway, and digital now accounts for more than 15% of its ad revenues. We were also pleased to report last month that Page Six TV has been adopted in 185 markets covering 90% of the country in advance of its launch this fall. That augurs well for the program and the brand.
In the U.K. at The Times, total print circulation volumes grew high single digits and market share improved again. In digital. The Times and The Sunday Times continued to grow subs and ARPU. While in print, the Times had the largest year-on-year growth among paid for national papers in the quarter. At The Sun, the number of monthly unique visitors boomed, reaching 80 million globally in March, doubling over the past year and up fivefold since the pay wall was removed in late 2015. The Sun has already surpassed The Mirror as the second most read news website in the U.K. and is working closely with Talk Sport to drive incremental traffic and revenues. Times for the U.K. economy remain positive, despite the fear mongering ahead of the Brexit vote and regardless of the inevitable uncertainty caused by the upcoming election.
Conditions for our mastheads in Australia remained challenging, although print ad declines moderated and circulation revenues were relatively stable, thanks to our lift in digital subscribers and price increases. Our team in Australia is focused on digital subscriptions, which generate 27% growth year-over-year including ARM to more than 330,000. Meanwhile, news.com.au retained its ranking as the leading news source in Australia. 
News America Marketing saw a marked growth in the in-store business, which is benefiting from product enhancements and an increase in [indiscernible]. Consumer goods companies and retail are increasingly recognizing [indiscernible] at the point of purchase. Checkout 51 also grew in the quarter and now has 13.4 million U.S. and Canadian members, more than double the total of last year. It has become a key part of NAM's integrated offering. In fact, Checkout 51, along with Storyful and Realty.com, are working closely with NAM on joint sales pitches with major brands to better leverage data and drive incremental revenue. 
The News and Information Services segment also benefited from the acquisition of Wireless Group in the U.K. and the Australian Regional Media business, both of which contributed  revenues in the quarter. 
Storyful and Unruly continued to expand their collaboration and are working more closely than ever with many of our businesses. Storyful recently announced a new partnership in Australia [indiscernible] it has expanded its work to assist companies with concerns of their brand safety and furnish vital intelligence on issues related to risk and compliance.
In Book Publishing, there was solid revenue growth at HarperCollins, which showed improvements in digital sales and the enduring success of Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. We also had to release Carve The Mark. We are looking forward with much anticipation to read new books in May, and note the continued strength of HarperCollins' Christian base . We are confident that the international footprint we acquired through Harlequin, combined with our expertise, should lead to increased business in Latin America where the evangelical movement is particularly influential. 
At Fox Sports, advertising remains strong compared to a relatively subdued TV marketplace in Australia. Ratings were 6% higher in March year-over-year, thanks in part to the successful launch of the Fox League channel, its dedicated rugby league offering. Fox Sports also launched the first overseas over-the-top partnership with IFL. Now people around the world can watch the world's most captivating contact sport. 
At our 50%-owned Foxtel, the company continues to invest in top-tier sports and local content, further differentiating its unique package from lower quality players. Foxtel Play will have an upgraded user interface and additional HD options, as Foxtel seeks to provide a compelling offering for customers. 
Having acquired the popular Sky News, we have added to our portfolio cable networks in Australia, and we'll be able to consolidate costs and share digital and video learnings across our platforms. We have just announced the transfer of Fox Sports News to Sky News, which will allow us to maximize synergies and scale. 
Looking once again at the quarter as a whole, we see the value of our content, the power of our platform, the benefits of cost constraint and the manifold ways our businesses are combining and complementing each other and crucially creating long-term value for all our shareholders. 
we were pleased to announce the addition of former U.S. Senator, [indiscernible] to our board, following the departure of [indiscernible, who became the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the new administration. We wish her well in her profoundly important role.
And I would finally like to say a word of thanks to the new News Corp's first CFO, the venerable Bedi Singh, who did much to assist in launching the company. And I'm very proud and delighted to introduce our new CFO, Susan Panuccio, a longtime colleague at News Corp.  Susan brings to this important task a savvy strategic sensibility and a rigorous attention to both detail and the larger landscape. She has experience in both the U.K. and Australia as well as insight into the importance of digital transformation of the news and property business. For all these reasons and more, I have great confidence not only in her, but in the prospects for this business and its value to our shareholders.  Thank you for your support. And so please welcome Susan."

I'm delighted to be here today and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the near future. This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm real",2142,"Thank you for those kind words, Robert. I'm delighted to be here today and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the near future. 
This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm really excited to have taken a broader role across the company. While I'm very new to this role, there are a few observations I would like to make. We are a company that has global scale, customers and data sets that could be better monetized. As Robert mentioned, one near term initiative will be the launch of our global digital advertising platform in the coming months. But there is a lot more we can do including more effectively showing resources, standardizing subscription strategies and better leveraging our content across the mastheads in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. 
There is more we can do and are doing on costs. While we need to make sure we continue to invest in digital initiatives, I also think there is plenty of room to improve efficiencies and remove legacy costs across the business, and much of that is underway.
Revenues from printed and news mastheads remains a very important source of revenue. However, we do need to be focused on driving incremental and higher-margin revenue streams ranging from custom content to higher-margin brand extensions, such as Sun [indiscernible] in the U.K.  And finally, I will be open to new ideas and new ways that will drive higher growth and value per share in the long term. 
With that as an introduction, I'll now turn to the operating results for this quarter. We reported fiscal 2017 third quarter total revenues of around $2 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $21 million negative impact on revenues, with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar outweighed by weakness in the pound. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included a onetime settlement charge of $280 million at News America Marketing. Excluding the charge in the prior year, segment EBITDA would have risen [ 36% ]. 
For the quarter, loss per share from continuing operations was $0.01 versus a loss of $0.26 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.07 versus $0.04 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 3% to approximately $1.3 billion versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising rose around 4%, or 5% in local currency, driven by News America Marketing and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by print advertising declines, although the rates of advertising decline moderated this quarter across all territories. 
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 1%, yet rose 3% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of Australia Regional Media or ARM, price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volume. 
News and Information Services EBITDA this quarter was $123 million, up from $93 million in the prior period, excluding $280 million News America Marketing settlement last year. We saw strong EBITDA contribution at News America Marketing, led by in-store product and modest year-over-year improvement at Dow Jones and U.K, offset by declines in the Australian business. 
We also had an adjustment to the third consideration for Unruly, which positively impacted EBITDA by around $12 million this quarter. 
Looking at performance across our key units. At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well, with revenues up 13% versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store products, which more than offset declines in freestanding inserts products. Some of the growth was timing-related, but we continue to see strong growth due to the increased number of retailers and higher brand spending. To give you a sense of the timing-related difference, we estimate that approximately $15 million, less than half of News America's revenue growth this quarter, was timing-related which will unwind in fiscal Q4. Checkout 51 continues to expand, now reaching over [ 13 ] million members at quarter end and continues to increase visibility and gain traction with our CPG clients. 
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenues declined around 12% due to print advertising, which was a marked improvement from the fiscal Q2 performance which saw advertising down over 20%. Pleasingly, the mix of advertising is changing. In fact in fiscal Q3, approximately 15% of total advertising at Dow Jones is what I would call emerging or nontraditional advertising revenue. This includes custom content conferences and of course programmatic advertising, and this is will remain a big focus going forward. 
As Robert mentioned, we are continuing to see strong paid volume growth in digital at The Wall Street Journal, where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.2 million, a 12% year-over-year increase driven by higher digital-only sales, which rose over 30% versus the prior year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew mid-single digits due to both volume gains and higher subscription pricing led by The Wall Street Journal which grew high single digits. Professional information business revenues remained relatively stable with the prior year, similar to last quarter as we continued to see very strong growth at risk and compliance together with a strong pipeline for new business. 
At News Australia, advertising revenues rose $8 million or 5% and were down 1% in local currency. The increase in advertising revenues was driven by the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $20 million in the quarter. Advertising revenues at our other Australian mastheads remain challenged, but showed a sequential improvement, partly due to the moderation in the real estate and employment categories, particularly at the low advertising level. Circulation revenues at News Australia increased $7 million or 8% and were up slightly in local currency, primarily due to the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $6 million. Cover price increases, including one take in Weekday Australia in February and higher paid digital subscriptions largely offset print volume declines at our existing mastheads, which were up 7%. 
On cost initiatives within the Australian business, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2017 and continue to seek additional cost reduction, although some of that savings being reinvested to accelerate our digital transition, given that the Australian business has the highest proportion of print advertising across our markets as a percentage of overall revenue. 
At News U.K. while reported advertising revenues decreased 18% in local currency, it was closer to a high single-digit decline, also a modest sequential improvement from the low teens last quarter. Reported circulation revenues at News U.K. [indiscernible] 10% versus the prior year quarter but rose 4% in local currency, as cover price increases more than offset single copy volume declines at The Sun. 
At Wireless Group, revenue was flat as growth in Talk Sport was offset by the absence of revenues from Sport Magazine, which was closed in February 2017. We continue to make good progress on the integration of Wireless into the News U.K. group. 
Turning to the Book publishing segment, revenues were $374 million, up 4% compared to prior year. We saw strong contribution this quarter from titles including Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. Revenues also benefited from the release of Veronica Roth Carve The Mark. However, sales of these were off to a slow start than anticipated. Segment EBITDA rose 3% to $37 million as the revenue growth was offset by an unfavorable cost of sales this quarter. Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 22% of consumer revenues, digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter driven principally by audiobooks. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $25 million or 13% to $219 million and adjusted revenues increased 15%, which excludes the impact from the divestitures of REA's European and New's sale of TigerLead last quarter as well as currency impacts and acquisitions.
Reported segment EBITDA was $75 million, up $36 million or 92% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both move and REA, including legal costs of move. Adjusted segment EBITDA gained 68%. 
REA's revenues grew 10% due to an increase in Australian residential revenue, resulting from favorable product mix and higher prices and a $6 million impact from favorable foreign currency fluctuation. The growth was partially offset by a $9 million or 9% decline in revenue resulting from the divestiture of the European business. It's important to note that the REA Group report results, but present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a bigger variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Please refer to REA's earnings release for more details on this. 
As expected, REA results showed strong growth in EBITDA contribution, strong operating margin for the Australian business. Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $100 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Connections for buyers and higher nonlisting media revenue. TigerLead, which was sold in November, contributed $4 million in the prior period. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up high single digits year-over-year to 55 million in the quarter and 58 million in March. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues rose 14% to $122 million compared to the prior year quarter from the inclusion of $9 million related to the acquisition of Sky News and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenue growth was 1%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat at $34 million and up modestly on an adjusted basis. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $23 million this quarter compared to positive $2 million last year. Our equity loss this quarter included a $7 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network and a further $10 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down consistent with our expectation. Both numbers reflect our 50% share. 
Regarding its operating performance. Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers down 1% compared to the prior year, but saw small subscriber gains from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn was 16.1% compared to 14.3% in the prior year, but encouragingly showed improvement late in the quarter with the beginning of winter sports and the launch of the FOX lead channels. 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $591 million, but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 9% to $131 million and was down 13% in local currency due to the increase in revenue and increases in programming costs, principally in sports. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86. 
And finally for Q3, capital expenditures for the continuing operations year-to-date were $168 million, lower than $180 million in the prior year. 
I would like to now turn to the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter. You may recall that the prior year included a 53rd week, which contributed $112 million in revenues last year. In addition, we also recognized a gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Absent those items, I have a few more observations. 
In the News and Information Services segment, overall advertising trends at this point are relatively similar to fiscal third quarter for our key mastheads. As I noted, News America Marketing had a timing benefit this quarter, which will reverse in Q4, of around $15 million. And we will also be lapping a price increase of The Sun Monday to Friday in the prior year. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see improved revenues and continued strong EBITDA contribution at realtor.com. REA expects phasing of costs to be higher in the fourth quarter versus a year ago in the third quarter due to increased investment in product innovation and associated marketing expenses. REA will discuss this in more detail during their quarterly conference call shortly after ours.
At Book Publishing, the environment remains relatively healthy in the fourth quarter. However, we will have fewer front-list titles than the prior year. Notable releases for Q4 [ are due in late May ]. 
In summary, the quarter demonstrated a few things: We are a company that is evolving with a unique mix of assets that is continuing our push towards digital. Digital real estate continues to expand. contributions to EBITDA is now solidly positive, as we had anticipated, and the segment is helping to reshape News Corp's long-term growth trajectory. We are taking action to stabilize the News and Information Services segment. We're still facing an uncertain print market, and we must be diligent on costs and accelerate digital as quickly and aggressively as we can. 
With that, let me hand over to the operator for Q&A."

In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly [ global ], digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth",2002,"Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly [ global ], digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues and EBITDA, specifically a 5% rise in revenues to approximately $2 billion and total segment EBITDA of $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included the News America Marketing settlement charge. Excluding that charge, total segment EBITDA in the quarter would have increased 36% compared to the prior year.
We are pleased with the performance of many of our businesses, including our Digital Real Estate Services segment, which continues to thrive. We had indicated that the EBITDA contribution at Move would improve and that revenue growth would accelerate. And I'm pleased to report both goals have been achieved this quarter, though we will certainly not allow complacency or smugness to be characteristics of realtor.com.
While print advertising remains challenging, we saw some moderation in declines across our mastheads this quarter. And notably, the News and Information Services segment was a source of growth this quarter both in revenues and EBITDA, driven by the muscular performance of in-store product revenues in News America Marketing, healthy circulation revenue gains at The Wall Street Journal and a thoughtful cost-reduction program.
Speaking of The Wall Street Journal, we continued to build on the momentum of digital sales, adding more than 300,000 subscribers year-over-year. Digital now accounts for 53% of total subscriptions, up from 44% last year and 38% 2 years ago. In fact, we added even more subs this quarter than in the second quarter, suggesting that the appetite for premium news and thoughtful commentary is undiminished. This success also is a result of innovation with our paywall, including the elimination of Google's so-called First Click Free scheme, which is in need of serious scrutiny as it punishes premium users. But whiners are not winners, so I'm pleased to report we are making progress on our development of a new digital advertising platform focused initially on the U.S. market using the data, content and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have real reach and are not subject to guilt by association. This initiative follows our News Connect offering in Australia, and we will provide more information about the emerging platform in the coming months.
We have been among the strongest and most consistent voices in making clear that the digital duopoly has commodified content and has created an ecosystem that is dysfunctional and defiled. The consequences of commoditification include fake news, rampant piracy and brands juxtaposed with jaundice on extremist websites.  The current content configuration is detrimental to consumers, to businesses and to societies. We are in discussion with Facebook and Google about premium content and brand-enhancing environments, and hope that they will assist in fashioning a healthier ecosystem that rewards creators and content and not just the distributors, the pirates and the perfidious. At this stage, it is fair to say that Facebook is more responsive and responsible, but we will highlight these issues until there is meaningful movement.
Let us talk to -- turn to our businesses in more detail. At Move, home to realtor.com, reported revenues increased by 15% in the quarter, accelerating from fiscal Q2 levels. Excluding the $4 million from TigerLead, which we sold in November, growth was 20%, and the company contributed segment EBITDA growth consistent with our expectations. Average monthly uniques increased from 44 million in Q2 to 55 million for the quarter, including a monthly record of 58 million in March.  And we saw improvements in page penetration and audience engagement, both crucial for lead volume, which also improved in the quarter.
Overall, according to comScore, in March, realtor.com led by Zillow and Trulia are in engagement by 30% based on minutes spent and has continued to gain share in the sector. The new Advantage product launched in December is performing in line with expectations, and we saw acceleration in growth in the Connections for buyers products driven by higher lead volume and increased customer flow.
We continued to fortify realtor.com with products like Sign Snap, Street Peak and enhanced 3D listings, which will move from beta to full release in the coming months. We added photography and local data to off-market listings, which helps drive engagement. And we focused on the speed and reliability of our products to ensure an optimum experience for users.
Looking ahead, Move is expecting to make further developments in the software and services business, an essential element of our crucial relationship with a community of realtors who are center to real estate transactions.
REA, which completed the sale of its European businesses in December 2016, posted strong revenue and expanded EBITDA contribution in its core Australian business, driven by product mix and the adoption of premium products. REA achieved record visits in March and materially outperformed the competition. The company provides a deeper content experience, complementing our mastheads in Australia, and has strengthened its premium product offerings, launching Front Page, allowing vendors to showcase properties on the homepage based on the user's previous search behavior.
At News and Information Services, revenues grew almost 3%, and segment EBITDA, excluding the settlement charge at News America Marketing in the prior year, would have expanded more than 30%. As mentioned, the decline in print advertising moderated, while we implemented cost-reduction programs such as The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative, which is designed to reduce expenses but imperatively create a contemporary flow of content for readers and clients. We are clearly cost-conscious but intent to bolster the quality of our unique content across our mastheads and across platforms around the world.
At Dow Jones, ad revenue trends improved relative to the prior quarter. Meanwhile, the risk and compliance business remains particularly healthy with revenue growth over 20% and prospects certainly appearing positive. The risks are real, and compliance is essential.
As mentioned, there was robust digital subscriber growth at The Journal with a more than 30% increase versus the prior year. And the momentum has continued. In fact, not only did we have the 300,000 year-over-year increase, but this also set a record in digital subscriber growth since the launch of our sales and subscriber reporting metric. Overall, circulation revenues expanded in the mid-single-digit range.
The New York Post digital network continues to make headway, and digital now accounts for more than 15% of its ad revenues. We were also pleased to report last month that Page Six TV has been adopted in 185 markets, covering 90% of the country, in advance of its launch this fall. That augurs well for the program and the brand.
In the U.K. at The Times, total print circulation volumes grew high single digits, and market share improved once again. In digital, The Times and The Sunday Times continued to grow subs and ARPU. While in print, The Times had the largest year-on-year growth among paid for national papers in the quarter.
At The Sun, the number of monthly unique visitors burgeoned, reaching 80 million globally in March, doubling over the past year and up fivefold since the paywall was removed in late 2015. The Sun has already surpassed the Mirror as the second most read news website in the U.K. and is working closely with talkSPORT to drive incremental traffic and revenues. Times for the U.K. economy remain positive despite the fear mongering ahead of the Brexit vote and regardless of the inevitable uncertainty caused by the upcoming election.
Conditions for our mastheads in Australia remained challenging, although print ad declines moderated and circulation revenues were relatively stable, thanks to our lift in digital subscribers and price increases. Our team in Australia is focused on digital subscriptions, which generate 27% growth year-over-year, including ARM, to more than 330,000. Meanwhile, news.com.au retained its ranking as the preeminent news site in Australia.
News America Marketing saw marked growth in the in-store business, which is benefiting from product enhancements and an increase in new CPG campaigns. Consumer goods companies and retail as they're increasingly recognizing NAM's prowess at the point of purchase. Checkout 51 also grew in the quarter and now has 13.4 million U.S. and Canadian members, more than double the total of last year. It has become a key part of NAM's integrated digital offering. In fact, Checkout 51, along with Storyful and realtor.com, are working closely with NAM on joint sales pitches with major brands to better leverage data and drive incremental revenue.
The News and Information Services segment also benefited from the acquisition of Wireless Group in the U.K. and the Australian Regional Media business, both of which contributed  revenues in the quarter.
Storyful and Unruly continued to expand their collaboration and are working more closely than ever with many of our businesses. Storyful recently announced the new partnership with Weber Shandwick, illustrating how it has expanded its work to assist companies with concerns over brand safety and furnish vital intelligence on issues related to risk and compliance.
In Book Publishing, there was solid revenue growth at HarperCollins, which showed improvements in digital sales and the enduring success of Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. We also had the release of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark. We are looking forward with much anticipation to read some new books by Michael Crichton, and David Walliams in May, and note the continuing strength of HarperCollins' Christian base in Nashville. We are confident that the international footprint we acquired through Harlequin, combined with our evangelical expertise, should lead to increased business in Latin America where the evangelical movement is particularly influential.
At Fox Sports, advertising remains strong compared to a relatively subdued TV marketplace in Australia. Ratings were 6% higher in March year-over-year, thanks in part to the successful launch of the FOX LEAGUE channel, its dedicated rugby league offering. Fox Sports also launched the first overseas over-the-top partnership with IFL, so people around the world can watch the world's most captivating contact sport.
At our 50%-owned Foxtel, the company continues to invest in top-tier sports and local content, further differentiating its unique package from lower-quality [ irresponsible ] players. Foxtel Play will have an upgraded user interface and additional HD options as Foxtel seeks to provide a compelling offering for customers.
Having acquired the popular Sky News, we have added to our portfolio of cable networks in Australia, and we'll be able to consolidate costs and share digital and video learnings across our platforms. We have just announced the transfer of FOX SPORTS News to Sky News, which will allow us to maximize synergies and scale.
Looking once again at the quarter as a whole, we see the enduring value of our content, the power of our platform, the benefits of residuous cost constraint and the manifold ways our businesses are combining and complementing each other and crucially creating long-term value for all our investors.
Covenantally, we were pleased to announce the addition of former U.S. Senator, Kelly Ayotte, to our board, following the departure of Elaine Chao who became the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the new administration. We wish her well in her profoundly important role.
And I would finally like to say a word of thanks to the new News Corp's first CFO, the venerable Bedi Singh, who did much to assist in launching the company. And I'm very proud and delighted to introduce our new CFO, Susan Panuccio, a longtime colleague at News Corp. Susan brings to this important task a savvy strategic sensibility and a rigorous attention to both detail and the larger landscape. She has experience in both the U.K. and Australia as well as insight in the importance of digital transformation of the news and property businesses. For all these reasons and more, I have great confidence not only in her but in the prospects for this business and its value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your support. And so please welcome Susan."

I'm delighted to be here today, and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the very near future.This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm",2170,"Thank you for those kind words, Robert. I'm delighted to be here today, and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the very near future.
This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm really excited to have taken a broader role across the company. While I'm very new to this role, there are a few observations I would like to make. We are a company that has global scale, customers and data sets that could be better monetized. As Robert mentioned, one near-term initiative will be the launch of our global digital advertising platform in the coming months. But there is a lot more we can do, including more effectively showing resources, standardizing subscription strategies and better leveraging our content across the mastheads in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia.
There is more we can do and are doing on costs. While we need to make sure we continue to invest in digital initiatives, I also think there is plenty of room to improve efficiencies and remove legacy costs across the business, and much of that is underway.
Revenues from printed and news mastheads remains a very important source of revenues. However, we do need to be focused on driving incremental and higher-margin revenue streams ranging from custom content to higher-margin brand extensions, such as Sun Bets in the U.K.
And finally, I will be open to new ideas and new ways that will drive higher growth and value per share in the long term.
With that as an introduction, I'll now turn to the operating results for this quarter. We reported fiscal 2017 third quarter total revenues of around $2 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $21 million negative impact on revenues with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar outweighed by weakness in the pound.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included a onetime settlement charge of $280 million at News America Marketing. Excluding the charge in the prior year, segment EBITDA would have risen 36%. 
For the quarter, loss per share from continuing operations was $0.01 versus a loss of $0.26 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.07 versus $0.04 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 3% to approximately $1.3 billion versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising rose around 4%, or 5% in local currency, driven by News America Marketing and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by print advertising declines, although the rates of advertising decline moderated this quarter across all territories.
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 1% yet rose 3% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of Australia Regional Media, or ARM, price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volumes.
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $123 million, up from $93 million in the prior period, excluding the $280 million News America Marketing settlement last year. We saw strong EBITDA contribution at News America Marketing led by in-store product and modest year-over-year improvement at Dow Jones and U.K., offset by declines in the Australian business.
We also had an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly, which positively impacted EBITDA by around $12 million this quarter.
Looking at performance across our key units. At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well with revenues up 13% versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store products, which more than offset declines in freestanding insert products. Some of the growth was timing-related, but we continue to see strong growth due to the increased number of retailers and higher brand spending. To give you a sense of the timing-related difference, we estimate that approximately $15 million, less than half of News America's revenue growth this quarter, was timing-related, which will unwind in fiscal Q4.
Checkout 51 continues to expand, now reaching over 13 million members at quarter end and continues to increase visibility and gain traction with our CPG clients.
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenues declined around 12% due to print advertising, which was a marked improvement from the fiscal Q2 performance, which saw advertising down over 20%. Pleasingly, the mix of advertising is changing. In fact, fiscal Q3, approximately 15% of total advertising at Dow Jones is what I would call emerging or nontraditional advertising revenue. This includes custom content conferences and, of course, programmatic advertising, and this is will remain a big focus going forward.
As Robert mentioned, we are continuing to see strong paid volume growth in digital at The Wall Street Journal where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.2 million, a 12% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital-only sales, which rose over 30% versus the prior year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew mid-single digits due to both volume gains and higher subscription pricing led by The Wall Street Journal, which grew high single digits. Professional information business revenues remained relatively stable with the prior year, similar to last quarter, as we continue to see very strong growth in risk and compliance, together with a strong pipeline for new business.
At News Australia, advertising revenues rose $8 million or 5% and were down 1% in local currency. The increase in advertising revenues was driven by the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $20 million in the quarter.
Advertising revenues at our other Australian mastheads remain challenged but showed a sequential improvement, partly due to the moderation in the real estate and employment categories, particularly at the local advertising level.
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased $7 million or 8% and were up slightly in local currency, primarily due to the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $6 million.
Cover price increases, including one taken for the weekday Australia in February and higher paid digital subscriptions, largely offset print volume declines at our existing mastheads at around 7%. 
On cost initiatives within the Australian business, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2017 and continue to seek additional cost reduction, although some of that saving is being reinvested to accelerate our digital transition, given that the Australian business has the highest proportion of print advertising across our mastheads as a percentage of overall revenue.
At News UK, while reported advertising revenues decreased 18%, in local currency, it was closer to a high single-digit decline, also a modest sequential improvement from the low teens last quarter. Reported circulation revenues at News UK fell 10% versus the prior year quarter but rose 4% in local currency as cover price increases more than offset single-copy volume declines at The Sun.
At Wireless Group, revenue was flat as growth in talkSPORT was offset by the absence of revenues from Sport magazine, which was closed in February 2017. We continue to make good progress on the integration of Wireless into the News UK group. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenues were $374 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. We saw strong contribution this quarter from titles, including Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. Revenues also benefited from the release in January of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark. However, sales of this title were off to a slower start than anticipated. 
Segment EBITDA rose 3% to $37 million as the revenue growth was offset by an unfavorable cost of sales mix this quarter. Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 22% of consumer revenues, with digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter driven principally by audiobooks.
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $25 million or 13% to $219 million, and adjusted revenues increased 15%, which excludes the impact from the divestitures of REA's European Real Estate [ portals ] and New's sale of TigerLead last quarter as well as currency impacts and acquisitions.
Reported segment EBITDA was $75 million, up $36 million or 92% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both Move and REA, including lower legal costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA gained 68%.
REA's revenues grew 10% due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue, resulting from favorable product mix and higher prices and a $6 million impact from favorable foreign currency fluctuations. The growth was partially offset by a $9 million or 9% decline in revenue resulting from the divestiture of the European business. It's important to note that the REA Group will report results that present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a bigger variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Please refer to REA's earnings release for more detail on this.
As expected, REA results showed strong growth in EBITDA contribution and strong operating margin for the Australian business.
Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $100 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Connection for buyers and higher nonlisting media revenue.
TigerLead, which was divested in November, contributed $4 million in the prior period.
Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up high single digits year-over-year to 55 million in the quarter with 58 million in March.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues rose 14% to $122 million compared to the prior year quarter from the inclusion of $9 million related to the acquisition of Sky News and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenue growth was 1%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat at $34 million and up modestly on an adjusted basis.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $23 million this quarter compared to positive $2 million last year. Our equity loss pickup this quarter included a $7 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network and a further $10 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down, consistent with our expectations. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.
Regarding its operating performance, Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers down 1% compared to the prior year, but saw small subscriber gains from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn was 16.1% compared to 14.3% in the prior year, but encouragingly showed improvement late in the quarter with the beginning of winter sports and the launch of the FOX LEAGUE channel.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $591 million but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 9% to $131 million and was down 13% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and increases in programming costs, principally in sports. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86.
And finally for Q3, capital expenditures from continuing operations year-to-date were $168 million, lower than $188 million -- $180 million in the prior year.
I would like to now turn to the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter. You may recall that the prior year included a 53rd week, which contributed $112 million in revenues last year. In addition, we also recognized a gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement.
Absent those items, I have a few more observations. In the News and Information Services segment, overall advertising trends at this point are relatively similar to the fiscal third quarter for our key mastheads. As I noted, News America Marketing had a timing benefit this quarter, which will reverse in Q4 of around $15 million. And we will also be lapping a price increase of The Sun, Monday to Friday in the prior year. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see improved revenues and continued strong EBITDA contribution at realtor.com. REA expects phasing of costs to be higher in the fourth quarter versus a year ago and the third quarter due to increased investment in product innovation and associated marketing expenses. REA will discuss this in more detail during their quarterly conference call shortly after ours.
At Book Publishing, the environment remains relatively healthy in the fourth quarter. However, we will have fewer front-list titles in the prior year. Notable releases for Q4 will include Dragon Teeth from Michael Crichton and David Walliams' World's Worst Children 2 due in late May.
In summary, the quarter demonstrated a few things: We are a company that is evolving with a unique mix of assets that is continuing our push towards digital. Digital real estate continues to expand. News contribution to EBITDA is now solidly positive, as we had anticipated, and the segment is helping to reshape News Corp's long-term growth trajectory. We are taking action to stabilize the News and Information Services segment. We're still facing an uncertain print market, and we must be diligent on costs and accelerate digital as quickly and as aggressively as we can.
With that, let me hand over to the operator for Q&A."

We continue to expect EBITDA growth and revenue growth in Q4 without giving a detailed forecast. What we're seeing is that the traditional products like Co-Broke, which is up 34% year-on-year, are doing well. The newer products are also taking off as well as our experience in advertising, in traditional media is enabling us to get better-quality yields that Move. So there was a 33% growth in nonlisting media revenues. So all in all, that ability that we have to learn from our experience at REA, our ability to generate audience through our masthead platforms, which gives us a marketing edge, and our ability to create a site that's not just a listing site for realtors and vendors but also a site that is holistic real estate experience with more news, more analysis than any other, means that we certainly have a comparative advantage going forward."

In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly global, digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders.

In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly global, digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues and EBITDA, specifically a 5% rise in revenues to approximately $2 billion and total segment EBITDA of $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included the News America Marketing settlement charge. Excluding that charge, total segment EBITDA in the quarter would have increased 36% compared to the prior year.
We are pleased with the performance of many of our businesses, including our Digital Real Estate Services segment, which continues to thrive. We had indicated that the EBITDA contribution at Move would improve and that revenue growth would accelerate. And I'm pleased to report both goals have been achieved this quarter, though we will certainly not allow complacency or smugness to be characteristics of realtor.com.
While print advertising remains challenging, we saw some moderation in declines across our mastheads this quarter. And notably, the News and Information Services segment was a source of growth this quarter both in revenues and EBITDA, driven by the muscular performance of in-store product revenues in News America Marketing, healthy circulation revenue gains at The Wall Street Journal and a thoughtful cost-reduction program.
Speaking of The Wall Street Journal, we continued to build on the momentum of digital sales, adding more than 300,000 subscribers year-over-year. Digital now accounts for 53% of total subscriptions, up from 44% last year and 38% 2 years ago. In fact, we added even more subs this quarter than in the second quarter, suggesting that the appetite for premium news and thoughtful commentary is undiminished. This success also is a result of innovation with our paywall, including the elimination of Google's so-called First Click Free scheme, which is in need of serious scrutiny as it punishes premium users. But whiners are not winners, so I'm pleased to report we are making progress on our development of a new digital advertising platform focused initially on the U.S. market using the data, content and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have real reach and are not subject to guilt by association. This initiative follows our News Connect offering in Australia, and we will provide more information about the emerging platform in the coming months.
We have been among the strongest and most consistent voices in making clear that the digital duopoly has commodified content and has created an ecosystem that is dysfunctional and defiled. The consequences of commodification include fake news, rampant piracy and brands juxtaposed with jaundice on extremist websites.  The current content configuration is detrimental to consumers, to businesses and to societies. We are in discussion with Facebook and Google about premium content and brand-enhancing environments, and hope that they will assist in fashioning a healthier ecosystem that rewards creators and content and not just the distributors, the pirates and the perfidious. At this stage, it is fair to say that Facebook is more responsive and responsible, but we will highlight these issues until there is meaningful movement.
Let us talk to -- turn to our businesses in more detail. At Move, home to realtor.com, reported revenues increased by 15% in the quarter, accelerating from fiscal Q2 levels. Excluding the $4 million from TigerLead, which we sold in November, growth was 20%, and the company contributed segment EBITDA growth consistent with our expectations. Average monthly uniques increased from 44 million in Q2 to 55 million for the quarter, including a monthly record of 58 million in March.  And we saw improvements in page penetration and audience engagement, both crucial for lead volume, which also improved in the quarter.
Overall, according to comScore, in March, realtor.com led by Zillow and Trulia are in engagement by 30% based on minutes spent and has continued to gain share in the sector. The new Advantage product, launched in December, is performing in line with expectations and we saw acceleration in growth in the Connections for Buyers products driven by higher lead volume and increased customer flow.
We continue to fortify realtor.com with products like Sign Snap, Street Peak and enhanced 3D listings, which will move from beta to full release in the coming months. We added photography and local data to off-market listings, which helps drive engagement. And we focused on the speed and reliability of our products to ensure an optimum experience for users.
Looking ahead, Move is expecting to make further developments in the software and services business, an essential element of our crucial relationship with the community of realtors who are center to real estate transactions.
REA, which completed the sale of its European businesses in December 2016, posted strong revenue and expanded EBITDA contribution in its core Australian business, driven by product mix and the adoption of premium products. REA achieved record visits in March and materially outperformed the competition. The company provides a deeper content experience, complementing our mastheads in Australia and has strengthened its premium product offerings, launching Front Page, allowing vendors to showcase properties on the homepage based on the user's previous search behavior.
At News and Information Services, revenues grew almost 3% and segment EBITDA, excluding the settlement charge at News America Marketing in the prior year, would have expanded more than 30%. As mentioned, the decline in print advertising moderated, while we implemented cost-reduction programs such as The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative, which is designed to reduce expenses but imperatively create a contemporary flow of content for readers and clients. We are clearly cost-conscious but intend to bolster the quality of our unique content across our mastheads and across platforms around the world.
At Dow Jones, ad revenue trends improved relative to the prior quarter. Meanwhile, the risk and compliance business remains particularly healthy with revenue growth over 20% and prospects certainly appearing positive. The risks are real and compliance is essential.
As mentioned, there was robust digital subscriber growth at The Journal with a more than 30% increase versus the prior year. And the momentum has continued. In fact, not only did we have the 300,000 year-over-year increase, but this also set a record in digital subscriber growth since the launch of our sales and subscriber reporting metric. Overall, circulation revenues expanded in the mid-single-digit range.
The New York Post digital network continues to make headway and digital now accounts for more than 15% of its ad revenues. We were also pleased to report last month that Page Six TV has been adopted in 185 markets, covering 90% of the country, in advance of its launch this fall. That augurs well for the program and the brand.
In the U.K. at The Times, total print circulation volumes grew high single digits, and market share improved once again. In digital, The Times and The Sunday Times continued to grow subs and ARPU. While in print, The Times had the largest year-on-year growth among paid for national papers in the quarter.
At The Sun, the number of monthly unique visitors burgeoned, reaching 80 million globally in March, doubling over the past year and up fivefold since the paywall was removed in late 2015. The Sun has already surpassed the Mirror as the second most-read news website in the U.K. and is working closely with talkSPORT to drive incremental traffic and revenues. Times for the U.K. economy remain positive, despite the fear mongering ahead of the Brexit vote and regardless of the inevitable uncertainty caused by the upcoming election.
Conditions for our mastheads in Australia remained challenging, although print ad declines moderated and circulation revenues were relatively stable, thanks to a lift in digital subscribers and price increases. Our team in Australia is focused on digital subscriptions, which generated 27% growth year-over-year, including ARM, to more than 330,000. Meanwhile, news.com.au retained its ranking as the preeminent news site in Australia.
News America Marketing saw marked growth in the in-store business, which is benefiting from product enhancements and an increase in new CPG campaigns, consumer goods companies and retail as they're increasingly recognizing NAM's prowess at the point of purchase. Checkout 51 also grew in the quarter and now has 13.4 million U.S. and Canadian members, more than double the total of last year. It has become a key part of NAM's integrated digital offering. In fact, Checkout 51, along with Storyful and realtor.com, are working closely with NAM on joint sales pitches with major brands to better leverage data and drive incremental revenue.
The News and Information Services segment also benefited from the acquisition of Wireless Group in the U.K. and the Australian Regional Media business, both of which contributed revenues in the quarter.
Storyful and Unruly continued to expand their collaboration and are working more closely than ever with many of our businesses. Storyful recently announced a new partnership with Weber Shandwick, illustrating how it has expanded its work to assist companies with concerns over brand safety and furnish vital intelligence on issues related to risk and compliance.
In Book Publishing, there was solid revenue growth at HarperCollins, which showed improvements in digital sales and the enduring success of Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. We also had the release of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark. We are looking forward with much anticipation to read some new books by Michael Crichton, and David Walliams in May, and note the continuing strength of HarperCollins' Christian base in Nashville. We are confident that the international footprint we acquired through Harlequin, combined with our evangelical expertise, should lead to increased business in Latin America where the evangelical movement is particularly influential.
At Fox Sports, advertising remains strong compared to a relatively subdued TV marketplace in Australia. Ratings were 6% higher in March year-over-year, thanks in part to the successful launch of the FOX LEAGUE channel, its dedicated rugby league offering. Fox Sports also launched the first overseas over-the-top partnership with IFL, so people around the world can watch the world's most captivating contact sport.
At our 50%-owned Foxtel, the company continues to invest in top-tier sports and local content, further differentiating its unique package from lower-quality [ sports content ] players. Foxtel Play will have an upgraded user interface and additional HD options, as Foxtel seeks to provide a compelling offering for customers.
Having acquired the popular Sky News, we have added to our portfolio of cable networks in Australia, and we'll be able to consolidate costs and share digital and video learnings across our platforms. We have just announced the transfer of FOX SPORTS News to Sky News, which will allow us to maximize synergies and scale.
Looking once again at the quarter as a whole, we see the enduring value of our content, the power of our platforms, the benefits of assiduous cost constraint and the many-fold ways our businesses are combining and complementing each other, and crucially creating long-term value for all our investors.
Covenantally, we were pleased to announce the addition of former U.S. Senator, Kelly Ayotte to our Board, following the departure of Elaine Chao who became the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the new Administration. We wish her well in her profoundly important role.
And I would finally like to say a word of thanks to the new News Corp's first CFO, the venerable Bedi Singh, who did much to assist in launching the company. And I'm very proud and delighted to introduce our new CFO, Susan Panuccio, a longtime colleague at News Corp. Susan brings to this important task a savvy strategic sensibility and a rigorous attention to both detail and the larger landscape. She has experience in both the U.K. and Australia, as well as insight into the importance of digital transformation of the news and property businesses. For all these reasons and more, I have great confidence not only in her, but in the prospects for this business and its value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your support. And so please welcome Susan."

I'm delighted to be here today, and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the very near future.
This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm really excited to have taken a broader role across the company. While I'm very new to this role, there are a few observations I would like to make. We are a company that has global scale, customers and data sets that could be better monetized. As Robert mentioned, one near-term initiative will be the launch of our global digital advertising platform in the coming months. But there is a lot more we can do, including more effectively sharing resources, standardizing subscription strategies and better leveraging our content across the mastheads in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia.
There is more we can do, and are doing, on costs. While we need to make sure we continue to invest in digital initiatives, I also think there is plenty of room to improve efficiencies and remove legacy costs across the business, and much of that is underway.
Revenues from printed and news mastheads remain a very important source of revenues. However, we do need to be focused on driving incremental and higher-margin revenue streams ranging from custom content to higher-margin brand extensions, such as Sun Bets in the U.K.
And finally, I will be open to new ideas and new ways that will drive higher growth and value per share in the long term.
With that as an introduction, I'll now turn to the operating results for this quarter. We reported fiscal 2017 third quarter total revenues of around $2 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $21 million negative impact on revenues with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar, outweighed by weakness in the pound.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included a onetime settlement charge of $280 million at News America Marketing. Excluding the charge in the prior year, segment EBITDA would have risen 36%. 
For the quarter, loss per share from continuing operations was $0.01 versus a loss of $0.26 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.07 versus $0.04 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 3% to approximately $1.3 billion versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising rose around 4%, or 5% in local currency, driven by News America Marketing and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by print advertising declines, although the rate of advertising decline moderated this quarter across all territories.
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 1% yet rose 3% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of Australia Regional Media, or ARM, price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volumes.
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $123 million, up from $93 million in the prior period, excluding the $280 million News America Marketing settlement last year. We saw strong EBITDA contribution at News America Marketing led by in-store product and modest year-over-year improvement at Dow Jones and U.K., offset by declines in the Australian business.
We also had an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly, which positively impacted EBITDA by around $12 million this quarter.
Looking at performance across our key units. At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well with revenues up 13% versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store products, which more than offset declines in freestanding insert products. Some of the growth was timing-related but we continue to see strong growth due to the increased number of retailers and higher brand spending. To give you a sense of the timing-related difference, we estimate that approximately $15 million, less than half of News America's revenue growth this quarter, was timing-related which will unwind in fiscal Q4.
Checkout 51 continues to expand, now reaching over 13 million members at quarter end and continues to increase visibility and gain traction with our CPG clients.
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenues declined around 12% due to print advertising, which was a marked improvement from the fiscal Q2 performance which saw advertising down over 20%. Pleasingly, the mix of advertising is changing. In fact, fiscal Q3, approximately 15% of total advertising at Dow Jones is what I would call emerging or nontraditional advertising revenue. This includes custom content conferences and, of course, programmatic advertising, and these will remain a big focus going forward.
As Robert mentioned, we are continuing to see strong paid volume growth in digital at The Wall Street Journal where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.2 million, a 12% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital-only sales, which rose over 30% versus prior year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew mid-single digits due to both volume gains and higher subscription pricing led by The Wall Street Journal, which grew high single digits. Professional information business revenues remained relatively stable with the prior year, similar to last quarter, as we continue to see very strong growth in risk and compliance, together with a strong pipeline for new business.
At News Australia, advertising revenues rose $8 million or 5% and were down 1% in local currency. The increase in advertising revenues was driven by the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $20 million in the quarter.
Advertising revenues at our other Australian mastheads remain challenged but showed a sequential improvement, partly due to the moderation in the real estate and employment categories, particularly at the local advertising level.
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased $7 million or 8% and were up slightly in local currency, primarily due to the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $6 million.
Cover price increases, including one taken for the weekday Australia in February and higher paid digital subscriptions, largely offset print volume declines at our existing mastheads at around 7%. 
On cost initiatives within the Australian business, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2017 and continue to seek additional cost reductions, although some of that saving is being reinvested to accelerate our digital transition, given that the Australian business has the highest proportion of print advertising across our mastheads as a percentage of overall revenue.
At News UK, while reported advertising revenues decreased 18%, in local currency, it was closer to a high single-digit decline, also a modest sequential improvement from the low teens last quarter. Reported circulation revenues at News UK fell 10% versus the prior year quarter but rose 4% in local currency, as cover price increases more than offset single-copy volume declines at The Sun.
At Wireless Group, revenue was flat as growth in talkSPORT was offset by the absence of revenues from Sport magazine, which was closed in February 2017. We continue to make good progress on the integration of Wireless into the News UK group. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenues were $374 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. We saw strong contribution this quarter from titles, including Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. Revenues also benefited from the release in January of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark. However, sales of this title were off to a slower start than anticipated. 
Segment EBITDA rose 3% to $37 million, as the revenue growth was offset by an unfavorable cost of sales mix this quarter. Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 22% of consumer revenues, with digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter driven principally by audiobooks.
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $25 million or 13% to $219 million, and adjusted revenues increased 15%, which excludes the impact from the divestitures of REA's European Real Estate portals and News' sale of TigerLead last quarter as well as currency impacts and acquisitions.
Reported segment EBITDA was $75 million, up $36 million or 92% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both Move and REA, including lower legal costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA gained 68%.
REA's revenues grew 10% due to an increase in Australian residential [ depth ] revenue, resulting from favorable product mix and higher prices and a $6 million impact from favorable foreign currency fluctuations. The growth was partially offset by a $9 million or 9% decline in revenue resulting from the divestiture of the European business. It's important to note that the REA Group will report results that present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a bigger variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Please refer to REA's earnings release for more detail on this.
As expected, REA results showed strong growth in EBITDA contribution and strong operating margin for the Australian business.
Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $100 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Connection for Buyers and higher non-listing media revenue.
TigerLead, which was divested in November, contributed $4 million in the prior period.
Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up high single digits year-over-year to $55 million in the quarter with $58 million in March.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues rose 14% to $122 million compared to the prior year quarter from the inclusion of $9 million related to the acquisition of Sky News and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenue growth was 1%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat at $34 million and up modestly on an adjusted basis.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $23 million this quarter compared to positive $2 million last year. Our equity loss pickup this quarter included a $7 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network and a further $10 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down, consistent with our expectations. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.
Regarding its operating performance, Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers down 1% compared to the prior year, but saw small subscriber gains from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn was 16.1% compared to 14.3% in the prior year, but encouragingly showed improvement late in the quarter with the beginning of winter sports and the launch of the FOX LEAGUE channel.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $591 million but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 9% to $131 million and was down 13% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and increases in programming costs, principally in sports. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86.
And finally for Q3, capital expenditures from continuing operations year-to-date were $168 million, lower than $188 million -- $180 million in the prior year.
I would like to now turn to the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter. You may recall that the prior year included a 53rd week, which contributed $112 million in revenues last year. In addition, we also recognized a gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement.
Absent those items, I have a few more observations. In the News and Information Services segment, overall advertising trends at this point are relatively similar to the fiscal third quarter for our key mastheads. As I noted, News America Marketing had a timing benefit this quarter, which will reverse in Q4 of around $15 million. And we will also be lapping a price increase of The Sun, Monday to Friday in the prior year. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see improved revenues and continued strong EBITDA contribution at realtor.com. REA expects phasing of costs to be higher in the fourth quarter versus a year ago and the third quarter, due to increased investment in product innovation and associated marketing expenses. REA will discuss this in more detail during their quarterly conference call shortly after ours.
At Book Publishing, the environment remains relatively healthy in the fourth quarter. However, we will have fewer front-list titles than the prior year. Notable releases for Q4 will include Dragon Teeth from Michael Crichton and David Walliams' The World's Worst Children 2 due in late May.
In summary, the quarter demonstrated a few things: We are a company that is evolving with a unique mix of assets that is continuing our push towards digital; digital real estate continues to expand. News contribution to EBITDA is now solidly positive, as we had anticipated, and the segment is helping to reshape News Corp's long-term growth trajectory. We are taking action to stabilize the News and Information Services segment. We're still facing an uncertain print market, and we must be diligent on costs and accelerate digital as quickly and as aggressively as we can.
With that, let me hand over to the operator for Q&A."

There's no doubt that the -- if you netted out the $600 million we invested in realtor, that fundamentally transformed the company, and as you can see, given the increasing growth in both revenue and EBITDA at our real estate digital businesses in general. And the ability that Harlequin has given HarperCollins to move from 1 language to 17 languages is quite profound. And that has also increased our digital footprint.

In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly global, digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in",2000,"Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly global, digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues and EBITDA, specifically a 5% rise in revenues to approximately $2 billion and total segment EBITDA of $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included the News America Marketing settlement charge. Excluding that charge, total segment EBITDA in the quarter would have increased 36% compared to the prior year.
We are pleased with the performance of many of our businesses, including our Digital Real Estate Services segment, which continues to thrive. We had indicated that the EBITDA contribution at Move would improve and that revenue growth would accelerate. And I'm pleased to report both goals have been achieved this quarter, though we will certainly not allow complacency or smugness to be characteristics of realtor.com.
While print advertising remains challenging, we saw some moderation in declines across our mastheads this quarter. And notably, the News and Information Services segment was a source of growth this quarter both in revenues and EBITDA, driven by the muscular performance of in-store product revenues in News America Marketing, healthy circulation revenue gains at The Wall Street Journal and a thoughtful cost-reduction program.
Speaking of The Wall Street Journal, we continued to build on the momentum of digital sales, adding more than 300,000 subscribers year-over-year. Digital now accounts for 53% of total subscriptions, up from 44% last year and 38% 2 years ago. In fact, we added even more subs this quarter than in the second quarter, suggesting that the appetite for premium news and thoughtful commentary is undiminished. This success also is a result of innovation with our paywall, including the elimination of Google's so-called First Click Free scheme, which is in need of serious scrutiny as it punishes premium users. But whiners are not winners, so I'm pleased to report we are making progress on our development of a new digital advertising platform focused initially on the U.S. market using the data, content and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have real reach and are not subject to guilt by association. This initiative follows our News Connect offering in Australia, and we will provide more information about the emerging platform in the coming months.
We have been among the strongest and most consistent voices in making clear that the digital duopoly has commodified content and has created an ecosystem that is dysfunctional and defiled. The consequences of commodification include fake news, rampant piracy and brands juxtaposed with jaundice on extremist websites.  The current content configuration is detrimental to consumers, to businesses and to societies. We are in discussion with Facebook and Google about premium content and brand-enhancing environments, and hope that they will assist in fashioning a healthier ecosystem that rewards creators and content and not just the distributors, the pirates and the perfidious. At this stage, it is fair to say that Facebook is more responsive and responsible, but we will highlight these issues until there is meaningful movement.
Let us talk to -- turn to our businesses in more detail. At Move, home to realtor.com, reported revenues increased by 15% in the quarter, accelerating from fiscal Q2 levels. Excluding the $4 million from TigerLead, which we sold in November, growth was 20%, and the company contributed segment EBITDA growth consistent with our expectations. Average monthly uniques increased from 44 million in Q2 to 55 million for the quarter, including a monthly record of 58 million in March.  And we saw improvements in page penetration and audience engagement, both crucial for lead volume, which also improved in the quarter.
Overall, according to comScore, in March, realtor.com led by Zillow and Trulia are in engagement by 30% based on minutes spent and has continued to gain share in the sector. The new Advantage product, launched in December, is performing in line with expectations and we saw acceleration in growth in the Connections for Buyers products driven by higher lead volume and increased customer flow.
We continue to fortify realtor.com with products like Sign Snap, Street Peak and enhanced 3D listings, which will move from beta to full release in the coming months. We added photography and local data to off-market listings, which helps drive engagement. And we focused on the speed and reliability of our products to ensure an optimum experience for users.
Looking ahead, Move is expecting to make further developments in the software and services business, an essential element of our crucial relationship with the community of realtors who are center to real estate transactions.
REA, which completed the sale of its European businesses in December 2016, posted strong revenue and expanded EBITDA contribution in its core Australian business, driven by product mix and the adoption of premium products. REA achieved record visits in March and materially outperformed the competition. The company provides a deeper content experience, complementing our mastheads in Australia and has strengthened its premium product offerings, launching Front Page, allowing vendors to showcase properties on the homepage based on the user's previous search behavior.
At News and Information Services, revenues grew almost 3% and segment EBITDA, excluding the settlement charge at News America Marketing in the prior year, would have expanded more than 30%. As mentioned, the decline in print advertising moderated, while we implemented cost-reduction programs such as The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative, which is designed to reduce expenses but imperatively create a contemporary flow of content for readers and clients. We are clearly cost-conscious but intend to bolster the quality of our unique content across our mastheads and across platforms around the world.
At Dow Jones, ad revenue trends improved relative to the prior quarter. Meanwhile, the risk and compliance business remains particularly healthy with revenue growth over 20% and prospects certainly appearing positive. The risks are real and compliance is essential.
As mentioned, there was robust digital subscriber growth at The Journal with a more than 30% increase versus the prior year. And the momentum has continued. In fact, not only did we have the 300,000 year-over-year increase, but this also set a record in digital subscriber growth since the launch of our sales and subscriber reporting metric. Overall, circulation revenues expanded in the mid-single-digit range.
The New York Post digital network continues to make headway and digital now accounts for more than 15% of its ad revenues. We were also pleased to report last month that Page Six TV has been adopted in 185 markets, covering 90% of the country, in advance of its launch this fall. That augurs well for the program and the brand.
In the U.K. at The Times, total print circulation volumes grew high single digits, and market share improved once again. In digital, The Times and The Sunday Times continued to grow subs and ARPU. While in print, The Times had the largest year-on-year growth among paid for national papers in the quarter.
At The Sun, the number of monthly unique visitors burgeoned, reaching 80 million globally in March, doubling over the past year and up fivefold since the paywall was removed in late 2015. The Sun has already surpassed the Mirror as the second most-read news website in the U.K. and is working closely with talkSPORT to drive incremental traffic and revenues. Times for the U.K. economy remain positive, despite the fear mongering ahead of the Brexit vote and regardless of the inevitable uncertainty caused by the upcoming election.
Conditions for our mastheads in Australia remained challenging, although print ad declines moderated and circulation revenues were relatively stable, thanks to a lift in digital subscribers and price increases. Our team in Australia is focused on digital subscriptions, which generated 27% growth year-over-year, including ARM, to more than 330,000. Meanwhile, news.com.au retained its ranking as the preeminent news site in Australia.
News America Marketing saw marked growth in the in-store business, which is benefiting from product enhancements and an increase in new CPG campaigns, consumer goods companies and retail as they're increasingly recognizing NAM's prowess at the point of purchase. Checkout 51 also grew in the quarter and now has 13.4 million U.S. and Canadian members, more than double the total of last year. It has become a key part of NAM's integrated digital offering. In fact, Checkout 51, along with Storyful and realtor.com, are working closely with NAM on joint sales pitches with major brands to better leverage data and drive incremental revenue.
The News and Information Services segment also benefited from the acquisition of Wireless Group in the U.K. and the Australian Regional Media business, both of which contributed revenues in the quarter.
Storyful and Unruly continued to expand their collaboration and are working more closely than ever with many of our businesses. Storyful recently announced a new partnership with Weber Shandwick, illustrating how it has expanded its work to assist companies with concerns over brand safety and furnish vital intelligence on issues related to risk and compliance.
In Book Publishing, there was solid revenue growth at HarperCollins, which showed improvements in digital sales and the enduring success of Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. We also had the release of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark. We are looking forward with much anticipation to read some new books by Michael Crichton, and David Walliams in May, and note the continuing strength of HarperCollins' Christian base in Nashville. We are confident that the international footprint we acquired through Harlequin, combined with our evangelical expertise, should lead to increased business in Latin America where the evangelical movement is particularly influential.
At Fox Sports, advertising remains strong compared to a relatively subdued TV marketplace in Australia. Ratings were 6% higher in March year-over-year, thanks in part to the successful launch of the FOX LEAGUE channel, its dedicated rugby league offering. Fox Sports also launched the first overseas over-the-top partnership with IFL, so people around the world can watch the world's most captivating contact sport.
At our 50%-owned Foxtel, the company continues to invest in top-tier sports and local content, further differentiating its unique package from lower-quality [ sports content ] players. Foxtel Play will have an upgraded user interface and additional HD options, as Foxtel seeks to provide a compelling offering for customers.
Having acquired the popular Sky News, we have added to our portfolio of cable networks in Australia, and we'll be able to consolidate costs and share digital and video learnings across our platforms. We have just announced the transfer of FOX SPORTS News to Sky News, which will allow us to maximize synergies and scale.
Looking once again at the quarter as a whole, we see the enduring value of our content, the power of our platforms, the benefits of assiduous cost constraint and the many-fold ways our businesses are combining and complementing each other, and crucially creating long-term value for all our investors.
Covenantally, we were pleased to announce the addition of former U.S. Senator, Kelly Ayotte to our Board, following the departure of Elaine Chao who became the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the new Administration. We wish her well in her profoundly important role.
And I would finally like to say a word of thanks to the new News Corp's first CFO, the venerable Bedi Singh, who did much to assist in launching the company. And I'm very proud and delighted to introduce our new CFO, Susan Panuccio, a longtime colleague at News Corp. Susan brings to this important task a savvy strategic sensibility and a rigorous attention to both detail and the larger landscape. She has experience in both the U.K. and Australia, as well as insight into the importance of digital transformation of the news and property businesses. For all these reasons and more, I have great confidence not only in her, but in the prospects for this business and its value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your support. And so please welcome Susan."

I'm delighted to be here today, and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the very near future.
This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm really excited to have taken a broader role across the company. While I'm very new to this role, there are a few observations I would like to make. We are a company that has global scale, customers and data sets that could be better monetized. As Robert mentioned, one near-term initiative will be the launch of our global digital advertising platform in the coming months. But there is a lot more we can do, including more effectively sharing resources, standardizing subscription strategies and better leveraging our content across the mastheads in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia.
There is more we can do, and are doing, on costs. While we need to make sure we continue to invest in digital initiatives, I also think there is plenty of room to improve efficiencies and remove legacy costs across the business, and much of that is underway.
Revenues from printed and news mastheads remain a very important source of revenues. However, we do need to be focused on driving incremental and higher-margin revenue streams ranging from custom content to higher-margin brand extensions, such as Sun Bets in the U.K.
And finally, I will be open to new ideas and new ways that will drive higher growth and value per share in the long term.
With that as an introduction, I'll now turn to the operating results for this quarter. We reported fiscal 2017 third quarter total revenues of around $2 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $21 million negative impact on revenues with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar, outweighed by weakness in the pound.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included a onetime settlement charge of $280 million at News America Marketing. Excluding the charge in the prior year, segment EBITDA would have risen 36%. 
For the quarter, loss per share from continuing operations was $0.01 versus a loss of $0.26 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.07 versus $0.04 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 3% to approximately $1.3 billion versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising rose around 4%, or 5% in local currency, driven by News America Marketing and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by print advertising declines, although the rate of advertising decline moderated this quarter across all territories.
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 1% yet rose 3% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of Australia Regional Media, or ARM, price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volumes.
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $123 million, up from $93 million in the prior period, excluding the $280 million News America Marketing settlement last year. We saw strong EBITDA contribution at News America Marketing led by in-store product and modest year-over-year improvement at Dow Jones and U.K., offset by declines in the Australian business.
We also had an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly, which positively impacted EBITDA by around $12 million this quarter.
Looking at performance across our key units. At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well with revenues up 13% versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store products, which more than offset declines in freestanding insert products. Some of the growth was timing-related but we continue to see strong growth due to the increased number of retailers and higher brand spending. To give you a sense of the timing-related difference, we estimate that approximately $15 million, less than half of News America's revenue growth this quarter, was timing-related which will unwind in fiscal Q4.
Checkout 51 continues to expand, now reaching over 13 million members at quarter end and continues to increase visibility and gain traction with our CPG clients.
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenues declined around 12% due to print advertising, which was a marked improvement from the fiscal Q2 performance which saw advertising down over 20%. Pleasingly, the mix of advertising is changing. In fact, fiscal Q3, approximately 15% of total advertising at Dow Jones is what I would call emerging or nontraditional advertising revenue. This includes custom content conferences and, of course, programmatic advertising, and these will remain a big focus going forward.
As Robert mentioned, we are continuing to see strong paid volume growth in digital at The Wall Street Journal where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.2 million, a 12% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital-only sales, which rose over 30% versus prior year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew mid-single digits due to both volume gains and higher subscription pricing led by The Wall Street Journal, which grew high single digits. Professional information business revenues remained relatively stable with the prior year, similar to last quarter, as we continue to see very strong growth in risk and compliance, together with a strong pipeline for new business.
At News Australia, advertising revenues rose $8 million or 5% and were down 1% in local currency. The increase in advertising revenues was driven by the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $20 million in the quarter.
Advertising revenues at our other Australian mastheads remain challenged but showed a sequential improvement, partly due to the moderation in the real estate and employment categories, particularly at the local advertising level.
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased $7 million or 8% and were up slightly in local currency, primarily due to the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $6 million.
Cover price increases, including one taken for the weekday Australia in February and higher paid digital subscriptions, largely offset print volume declines at our existing mastheads at around 7%. 
On cost initiatives within the Australian business, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2017 and continue to seek additional cost reductions, although some of that saving is being reinvested to accelerate our digital transition, given that the Australian business has the highest proportion of print advertising across our mastheads as a percentage of overall revenue.
At News UK, while reported advertising revenues decreased 18%, in local currency, it was closer to a high single-digit decline, also a modest sequential improvement from the low teens last quarter. Reported circulation revenues at News UK fell 10% versus the prior year quarter but rose 4% in local currency, as cover price increases more than offset single-copy volume declines at The Sun.
At Wireless Group, revenue was flat as growth in talkSPORT was offset by the absence of revenues from Sport magazine, which was closed in February 2017. We continue to make good progress on the integration of Wireless into the News UK group. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenues were $374 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. We saw strong contribution this quarter from titles, including Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. Revenues also benefited from the release in January of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark. However, sales of this title were off to a slower start than anticipated. 
Segment EBITDA rose 3% to $37 million, as the revenue growth was offset by an unfavorable cost of sales mix this quarter. Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 22% of consumer revenues, with digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter driven principally by audiobooks.
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $25 million or 13% to $219 million, and adjusted revenues increased 15%, which excludes the impact from the divestitures of REA's European Real Estate portals and News' sale of TigerLead last quarter as well as currency impacts and acquisitions.
Reported segment EBITDA was $75 million, up $36 million or 92% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both Move and REA, including lower legal costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA gained 68%.
REA's revenues grew 10% due to an increase in Australian residential [ depth ] revenue, resulting from favorable product mix and higher prices and a $6 million impact from favorable foreign currency fluctuations. The growth was partially offset by a $9 million or 9% decline in revenue resulting from the divestiture of the European business. It's important to note that the REA Group will report results that present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a bigger variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Please refer to REA's earnings release for more detail on this.
As expected, REA results showed strong growth in EBITDA contribution and strong operating margin for the Australian business.
Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $100 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Connection for Buyers and higher non-listing media revenue.
TigerLead, which was divested in November, contributed $4 million in the prior period.
Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up high single digits year-over-year to $55 million in the quarter with $58 million in March.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues rose 14% to $122 million compared to the prior year quarter from the inclusion of $9 million related to the acquisition of Sky News and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenue growth was 1%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat at $34 million and up modestly on an adjusted basis.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $23 million this quarter compared to positive $2 million last year. Our equity loss pickup this quarter included a $7 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network and a further $10 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down, consistent with our expectations. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.
Regarding its operating performance, Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers down 1% compared to the prior year, but saw small subscriber gains from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn was 16.1% compared to 14.3% in the prior year, but encouragingly showed improvement late in the quarter with the beginning of winter sports and the launch of the FOX LEAGUE channel.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $591 million but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 9% to $131 million and was down 13% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and increases in programming costs, principally in sports. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86.
And finally for Q3, capital expenditures from continuing operations year-to-date were $168 million, lower than $188 million -- $180 million in the prior year.
I would like to now turn to the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter. You may recall that the prior year included a 53rd week, which contributed $112 million in revenues last year. In addition, we also recognized a gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement.
Absent those items, I have a few more observations. In the News and Information Services segment, overall advertising trends at this point are relatively similar to the fiscal third quarter for our key mastheads. As I noted, News America Marketing had a timing benefit this quarter, which will reverse in Q4 of around $15 million. And we will also be lapping a price increase of The Sun, Monday to Friday in the prior year. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see improved revenues and continued strong EBITDA contribution at realtor.com. REA expects phasing of costs to be higher in the fourth quarter versus a year ago and the third quarter, due to increased investment in product innovation and associated marketing expenses. REA will discuss this in more detail during their quarterly conference call shortly after ours.
At Book Publishing, the environment remains relatively healthy in the fourth quarter. However, we will have fewer front-list titles than the prior year. Notable releases for Q4 will include Dragon Teeth from Michael Crichton and David Walliams' The World's Worst Children 2 due in late May.
In summary, the quarter demonstrated a few things: We are a company that is evolving with a unique mix of assets that is continuing our push towards digital; digital real estate continues to expand. News contribution to EBITDA is now solidly positive, as we had anticipated, and the segment is helping to reshape News Corp's long-term growth trajectory. We are taking action to stabilize the News and Information Services segment. We're still facing an uncertain print market, and we must be diligent on costs and accelerate digital as quickly and as aggressively as we can.
With that, let me hand over to the operator for Q&A."

And if you look at the 3 main investments we have made, which is realtor.com via Move, Harlequin and Wireless Group, you would have to agree that they've played crucial role in transforming our business. There's no doubt that the -- if you netted out the $600 million we invested in realtor, that fundamentally transformed the company, and as you can see, given the increasing growth in both revenue and EBITDA at our real estate digital businesses in general. And the ability that Harlequin has given HarperCollins to move from 1 language to 17 languages is quite profound. And that has also increased our digital footprint. And you can see the early signs in the U.K. of the value of the Wireless Group. So we will continue to be opportunistic, but we'll continue to have the situation under review."

In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly global, digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in",2000,"Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly global, digital and diversified, to be resolutely cost-conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders. There was robust growth in revenues and EBITDA, specifically a 5% rise in revenues to approximately $2 billion and total segment EBITDA of $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included the News America Marketing settlement charge. Excluding that charge, total segment EBITDA in the quarter would have increased 36% compared to the prior year.
We are pleased with the performance of many of our businesses, including our Digital Real Estate Services segment, which continues to thrive. We had indicated that the EBITDA contribution at Move would improve and that revenue growth would accelerate. And I'm pleased to report both goals have been achieved this quarter, though we will certainly not allow complacency or smugness to be characteristics of realtor.com.
While print advertising remains challenging, we saw some moderation in declines across our mastheads this quarter. And notably, the News and Information Services segment was a source of growth this quarter both in revenues and EBITDA, driven by the muscular performance of in-store product revenues in News America Marketing, healthy circulation revenue gains at The Wall Street Journal and a thoughtful cost-reduction program.
Speaking of The Wall Street Journal, we continued to build on the momentum of digital sales, adding more than 300,000 subscribers year-over-year. Digital now accounts for 53% of total subscriptions, up from 44% last year and 38% 2 years ago. In fact, we added even more subs this quarter than in the second quarter, suggesting that the appetite for premium news and thoughtful commentary is undiminished. This success also is a result of innovation with our paywall, including the elimination of Google's so-called First Click Free scheme, which is in need of serious scrutiny as it punishes premium users. But whiners are not winners, so I'm pleased to report we are making progress on our development of a new digital advertising platform focused initially on the U.S. market using the data, content and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have real reach and are not subject to guilt by association. This initiative follows our News Connect offering in Australia, and we will provide more information about the emerging platform in the coming months.
We have been among the strongest and most consistent voices in making clear that the digital duopoly has commodified content and has created an ecosystem that is dysfunctional and defiled. The consequences of commodification include fake news, rampant piracy and brands juxtaposed with jaundice on extremist websites.  The current content configuration is detrimental to consumers, to businesses and to societies. We are in discussion with Facebook and Google about premium content and brand-enhancing environments, and hope that they will assist in fashioning a healthier ecosystem that rewards creators and content and not just the distributors, the pirates and the perfidious. At this stage, it is fair to say that Facebook is more responsive and responsible, but we will highlight these issues until there is meaningful movement.
Let us talk to -- turn to our businesses in more detail. At Move, home to realtor.com, reported revenues increased by 15% in the quarter, accelerating from fiscal Q2 levels. Excluding the $4 million from TigerLead, which we sold in November, growth was 20%, and the company contributed segment EBITDA growth consistent with our expectations. Average monthly uniques increased from 44 million in Q2 to 55 million for the quarter, including a monthly record of 58 million in March.  And we saw improvements in page penetration and audience engagement, both crucial for lead volume, which also improved in the quarter.
Overall, according to comScore, in March, realtor.com led by Zillow and Trulia are in engagement by 30% based on minutes spent and has continued to gain share in the sector. The new Advantage product, launched in December, is performing in line with expectations and we saw acceleration in growth in the Connections for Buyers products driven by higher lead volume and increased customer flow.
We continue to fortify realtor.com with products like Sign Snap, Street Peak and enhanced 3D listings, which will move from beta to full release in the coming months. We added photography and local data to off-market listings, which helps drive engagement. And we focused on the speed and reliability of our products to ensure an optimum experience for users.
Looking ahead, Move is expecting to make further developments in the software and services business, an essential element of our crucial relationship with the community of realtors who are center to real estate transactions.
REA, which completed the sale of its European businesses in December 2016, posted strong revenue and expanded EBITDA contribution in its core Australian business, driven by product mix and the adoption of premium products. REA achieved record visits in March and materially outperformed the competition. The company provides a deeper content experience, complementing our mastheads in Australia and has strengthened its premium product offerings, launching Front Page, allowing vendors to showcase properties on the homepage based on the user's previous search behavior.
At News and Information Services, revenues grew almost 3% and segment EBITDA, excluding the settlement charge at News America Marketing in the prior year, would have expanded more than 30%. As mentioned, the decline in print advertising moderated, while we implemented cost-reduction programs such as The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative, which is designed to reduce expenses but imperatively create a contemporary flow of content for readers and clients. We are clearly cost-conscious but intend to bolster the quality of our unique content across our mastheads and across platforms around the world.
At Dow Jones, ad revenue trends improved relative to the prior quarter. Meanwhile, the risk and compliance business remains particularly healthy with revenue growth over 20% and prospects certainly appearing positive. The risks are real and compliance is essential.
As mentioned, there was robust digital subscriber growth at The Journal with a more than 30% increase versus the prior year. And the momentum has continued. In fact, not only did we have the 300,000 year-over-year increase, but this also set a record in digital subscriber growth since the launch of our sales and subscriber reporting metric. Overall, circulation revenues expanded in the mid-single-digit rate.
The New York Post digital network continues to make headway and digital now accounts for more than 15% of its ad revenues. We were also pleased to report last month that Page Six TV has been adopted in 185 markets, covering 90% of the country, in advance of its launch this fall. That augurs well for the program and the brand.
In the U.K. at The Times, total print circulation volumes grew high single digits, and market share improved once again. In digital, The Times and The Sunday Times continued to grow subs and ARPU. While in print, The Times had the largest year-on-year growth among paid for national papers in the quarter.
At The Sun, the number of monthly unique visitors burgeoned, reaching 80 million globally in March, doubling over the past year and up fivefold since the paywall was removed in late 2015. The Sun has already surpassed the Mirror as the second most-read news website in the U.K. and is working closely with talkSPORT to drive incremental traffic and revenues. Times for the U.K. economy remain positive, despite the fear mongering ahead of the Brexit vote and regardless of the inevitable uncertainty caused by the upcoming election.
Conditions for our mastheads in Australia remained challenging, although print ad declines moderated and circulation revenues were relatively stable, thanks to a lift in digital subscribers and price increases. Our team in Australia is focused on digital subscriptions, which generated 27% growth year-over-year, including ARM, to more than 330,000. Meanwhile, news.com.au retained its ranking as the preeminent news site in Australia.
News America Marketing saw marked growth in the in-store business, which is benefiting from product enhancements and an increase in new CPG campaigns, consumer goods companies and retail as they're increasingly recognizing NAM's prowess at the point of purchase. Checkout 51 also grew in the quarter and now has 13.4 million U.S. and Canadian members, more than double the total of last year. It has become a key part of NAM's integrated digital offering. In fact, Checkout 51, along with Storyful and realtor.com, are working closely with NAM on joint sales pitches with major brands to better leverage data and drive incremental revenue.
The News and Information Services segment also benefited from the acquisition of Wireless Group in the U.K. and the Australian Regional Media business, both of which contributed revenues in the quarter.
Storyful and Unruly continued to expand their collaboration and are working more closely than ever with many of our businesses. Storyful recently announced a new partnership with Weber Shandwick, illustrating how it has expanded its work to assist companies with concerns over brand safety and furnish vital intelligence on issues related to risk and compliance.
In Book Publishing, there was solid revenue growth at HarperCollins, which showed improvements in digital sales and the enduring success of Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. We also had the release of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark. We are looking forward with much anticipation to read some new books by Michael Crichton, and David Walliams in May, and note the continuing strength of HarperCollins' Christian base in Nashville. We are confident that the international footprint we acquired through Harlequin, combined with our evangelical expertise, should lead to increased business in Latin America where the evangelical movement is particularly influential.
At Fox Sports, advertising remains strong compared to a relatively subdued TV marketplace in Australia. Ratings were 6% higher in March year-over-year, thanks in part to the successful launch of the FOX LEAGUE channel, its dedicated rugby league offering. Fox Sports also launched the first overseas over-the-top partnership with IFL, so people around the world can watch the world's most captivating contact sport.
At our 50%-owned Foxtel, the company continues to invest in top-tier sports and local content, further differentiating its unique package from lower-quality [ sports content ] players. Foxtel Play will have an upgraded user interface and additional HD options, as Foxtel seeks to provide a compelling offering for customers.
Having acquired the popular Sky News, we have added to our portfolio of cable networks in Australia, and we'll be able to consolidate costs and share digital and video learnings across our platforms. We have just announced the transfer of FOX SPORTS News to Sky News, which will allow us to maximize synergies and scale.
Looking once again at the quarter as a whole, we see the enduring value of our content, the power of our platforms, the benefits of assiduous cost constraint and the many-fold ways our businesses are combining and complementing each other, and crucially creating long-term value for all our investors.
Covenantally, we were pleased to announce the addition of former U.S. Senator, Kelly Ayotte to our Board, following the departure of Elaine Chao who became the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the new Administration. We wish her well in her profoundly important role.
And I would finally like to say a word of thanks to the new News Corp's first CFO, the venerable Bedi Singh, who did much to assist in launching the company. And I'm very proud and delighted to introduce our new CFO, Susan Panuccio, a longtime colleague at News Corp. Susan brings to this important task a savvy strategic sensibility and a rigorous attention to both detail and the larger landscape. She has experience in both the U.K. and Australia, as well as insight into the importance of digital transformation of the news and property businesses. For all these reasons and more, I have great confidence not only in her, but in the prospects for this business and its value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your support. And so please welcome Susan."

I'm delighted to be here today, and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the very near future.This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm",2173,"Thank you for those kind words, Robert. I'm delighted to be here today, and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the very near future.
This is a unique time for the company as we continue the transformation to a digital-first company, and I'm really excited to have taken a broader role across the company. While I'm very new to this role, there are a few observations I would like to make. We are a company that has global scale, customers and data sets that could be better monetized. As Robert mentioned, one near-term initiative will be the launch of our global digital advertising platform in the coming months. But there is a lot more we can do, including more effectively sharing resources, standardizing subscription strategies and better leveraging our content across the mastheads in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia.
There is more we can do, and are doing, on costs. While we need to make sure we continue to invest in digital initiatives, I also think there is plenty of room to improve efficiencies and remove legacy costs across the business, and much of that is underway.
Revenues from printed and news mastheads remain a very important source of revenues. However, we do need to be focused on driving incremental and higher-margin revenue streams ranging from custom content to higher-margin brand extensions, such as Sun Bets in the U.K.
And finally, I will be open to new ideas and new ways that will drive higher growth and value per share in the long term.
With that as an introduction, I'll now turn to the operating results for this quarter. We reported fiscal 2017 third quarter total revenues of around $2 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $21 million negative impact on revenues with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar, outweighed by weakness in the pound.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year, which included a onetime settlement charge of $280 million at News America Marketing. Excluding the charge in the prior year, segment EBITDA would have risen 36%. 
For the quarter, loss per share from continuing operations was $0.01 versus a loss of $0.26 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.07 versus $0.04 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter rose 3% to approximately $1.3 billion versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising rose around 4%, or 5% in local currency, driven by News America Marketing and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by print advertising declines, although the rate of advertising decline moderated this quarter across all territories.
Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 1% yet rose 3% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of Australia Regional Media, or ARM, price increases and higher paid digital volume, offset by lower print volumes.
News and Information Services segment EBITDA this quarter was $123 million, up from $93 million in the prior period, excluding the $280 million News America Marketing settlement last year. We saw strong EBITDA contribution at News America Marketing led by in-store product and modest year-over-year improvement at Dow Jones and U.K., offset by declines in the Australian business.
We also had an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly, which positively impacted EBITDA by around $12 million this quarter.
Looking at performance across our key units. At News America Marketing, the business continues to perform well with revenues up 13% versus the prior year, driven by the strength of in-store products, which more than offset declines in freestanding insert (sic) [ in-store ] products. Some of the growth was timing-related but we continue to see strong growth due to the increased number of retailers and higher brand spending. To give you a sense of the timing-related difference, we estimate that approximately $15 million, less than half of News America's revenue growth this quarter, was timing-related which will unwind in fiscal Q4.
Checkout 51 continues to expand, now reaching over 13 million members at quarter end and continues to increase visibility and gain traction with our CPG clients.
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenues declined around 12% due to print advertising, which was a marked improvement from the fiscal Q2 performance which saw advertising down over 20%. Pleasingly, the mix of advertising is changing. In fact, fiscal Q3, approximately 15% of total advertising at Dow Jones is what I would call emerging or nontraditional advertising revenue. This includes custom content conferences and, of course, programmatic advertising, and these will remain a big focus going forward.
As Robert mentioned, we are continuing to see strong paid volume growth in digital at The Wall Street Journal where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.2 million, a 12% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital-only sales, which rose over 30% versus prior year. Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew mid-single digits due to both volume gains and higher subscription pricing led by The Wall Street Journal, which grew high single digits. Professional information business revenues remained relatively stable with the prior year, similar to last quarter, as we continue to see very strong growth in risk and compliance, together with a strong pipeline for new business.
At News Australia, advertising revenues rose $8 million or 5% and were down 1% in local currency. The increase in advertising revenues was driven by the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $20 million in the quarter.
Advertising revenues at our other Australian mastheads remain challenged but showed a sequential improvement, partly due to the moderation in the real estate and employment categories, particularly at the local advertising level.
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased $7 million or 8% and were up slightly in local currency, primarily due to the acquisition of ARM, which contributed $6 million.
Cover price increases, including one taken for the weekday Australia in February and higher paid digital subscriptions, largely offset print volume declines at our existing mastheads at around 7%. 
On cost initiatives within the Australian business, we are on track for an additional AUD 40 million in cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2017 and continue to seek additional cost reductions, although some of that saving is being reinvested to accelerate our digital transition, given that the Australian business has the highest proportion of print advertising across our mastheads as a percentage of overall revenue.
At News UK, while reported advertising revenues decreased 18%, in local currency, it was closer to a high single-digit decline, also a modest sequential improvement from the low teens last quarter. Reported circulation revenues at News UK fell 10% versus the prior year quarter but rose 4% in local currency, as cover price increases more than offset single-copy volume declines at The Sun.
At Wireless Group, revenue was flat as growth in talkSPORT was offset by the absence of revenues from Sport magazine, which was closed in February 2017. We continue to make good progress on the integration of Wireless into the News UK group. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenues were $374 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. We saw strong contribution this quarter from titles, including Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. Revenues also benefited from the release in January of Veronica Roth's Carve The Mark. However, sales of this title were off to a slower start than anticipated. 
Segment EBITDA rose 3% to $37 million, as the revenue growth was offset by an unfavorable cost of sales mix this quarter. Total digital revenues, which include audiobooks, were approximately 22% of consumer revenues, with digital sales rising modestly over the prior year quarter driven principally by audiobooks.
In Digital Real Estate Services, reported revenues for the segment increased $25 million or 13% to $219 million, and adjusted revenues increased 15%, which excludes the impact from the divestitures of REA's European Real Estate portals and News' sale of TigerLead last quarter as well as currency impacts and acquisitions.
Reported segment EBITDA was $75 million, up $36 million or 92% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both Move and REA, including lower legal costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA gained 68%.
REA's revenues grew 10% due to an increase in Australian residential [ depth ] revenue, resulting from favorable product mix and higher prices and a $6 million impact from favorable foreign currency fluctuations. The growth was partially offset by a $9 million or 9% decline in revenue resulting from the divestiture of the European business. It's important to note that the REA Group will report results that present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a bigger variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Please refer to REA's earnings release for more detail on this.
As expected, REA results showed strong growth in EBITDA contribution and strong operating margin for the Australian business.
Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $100 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from Connection for Buyers and higher non-listing media revenue.
TigerLead, which was divested in November, contributed $4 million in the prior period.
Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up high single digits year-over-year to $55 million in the quarter with $58 million in March.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues rose 14% to $122 million compared to the prior year quarter from the inclusion of $9 million related to the acquisition of Sky News and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenue growth was 1%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat at $34 million and up modestly on an adjusted basis.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $23 million this quarter compared to positive $2 million last year. Our equity loss pickup this quarter included a $7 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network and a further $10 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down, consistent with our expectations. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.
Regarding its operating performance, Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, with closing cable and satellite subscribers down 1% compared to the prior year, but saw small subscriber gains from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn was 16.1% compared to 14.3% in the prior year, but encouragingly showed improvement late in the quarter with the beginning of winter sports and the launch of the FOX LEAGUE channel.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $591 million but were down 3% in local currency. And EBITDA decreased 9% to $131 million and was down 13% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and increases in programming costs, principally in sports. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86.
And finally for Q3, capital expenditures from continuing operations year-to-date were $168 million, lower than $188 million -- $180 million in the prior year.
I would like to now turn to the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter. You may recall that the prior year included a 53rd week, which contributed $112 million in revenues last year. In addition, we also recognized a gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement.
Absent those items, I have a few more observations. In the News and Information Services segment, overall advertising trends at this point are relatively similar to the fiscal third quarter for our key mastheads. As I noted, News America Marketing had a timing benefit this quarter, which will reverse in Q4 of around $15 million. And we will also be lapping a price increase of The Sun, Monday to Friday in the prior year. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, we expect to see improved revenues and continued strong EBITDA contribution at realtor.com. REA expects phasing of costs to be higher in the fourth quarter versus a year ago and the third quarter, due to increased investment in product innovation and associated marketing expenses. REA will discuss this in more detail during their quarterly conference call shortly after ours.
At Book Publishing, the environment remains relatively healthy in the fourth quarter. However, we will have fewer front-list titles than the prior year. Notable releases for Q4 will include Dragon Teeth from Michael Crichton and David Walliams' The World's Worst Children 2 due in late May.
In summary, the quarter demonstrated a few things: We are a company that is evolving with a unique mix of assets that is continuing our push towards digital; digital real estate continues to expand. News contribution to EBITDA is now solidly positive, as we had anticipated, and the segment is helping to reshape News Corp's long-term growth trajectory. We are taking action to stabilize the News and Information Services segment. We're still facing an uncertain print market, and we must be diligent on costs and accelerate digital as quickly and as aggressively as we can.
With that, let me hand over to the operator for Q&A."

There's no doubt that the -- if you netted out the $600 million we invested in realtor, that fundamentally transformed the company, and as you can see, given the increasing growth in both revenue and EBITDA at our real estate digital businesses in general. And the ability that Harlequin has given HarperCollins to move from 1 language to 17 languages is quite profound. And that has also increased our digital footprint.

Fiscal 2017 was an important year for News Corp as we posted tangible improvements in profitability powered by the fast-growing Digital Real Estate Services segment. And we monetized premium content, while continuing our commitment to increase operating efficiencies. 
Since our reincarnation, we have been assertive and have led the global debate on the value of content by word and by deed at a time of profound change in our markets and in society. That strategy continues to pay off as evidenced by our full year operating results and by the broadening debate for which News Corp had been a catalyst. We are more than the sum of our parts. Our acquisitions in digital development have changed the composition of the company, but enhanced the personality and principles that have defined us since the conception of the original News Corp. 
Revenues were relatively stable this year at over $8.1 billion despite lost print, advertising headwinds and an extra week in the prior year. But importantly, total segment EBITDA improved to $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year, which included litigation settlement charges and gains. Even absent those settlements and other items, adjusted total segment EBITDA expanded 5%.  For the quarter, we took significant impairments as we recognized the challenges facing print and oriented the company towards the future. Susan will provide you with further details. 
In the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the Zillow settlement, digital real estate continued to deliver on its potential, not only as a strong source of growth, but also in its rapidly expanding contribution to overall adjusted EBITDA. At both REA and Move, we were pleased to see increased traffic, improved engagement and continuing revenue growth, particularly at realtor.com where Move is making positive contributions to segment EBITDA. From a lagging #3 player in the U.S. market, realtor.com has become the most engaged with audiences and the most important source of leads for realtors. 
We are still far from satisfied with our progress as we firmly believe that U.S. digital property market is still in an early phase of its evolution and expect many more years of strong audience in revenue growth. In December, Realtor rolled out Advantage, a state-of-the-art listing agent product, capturing real-time feedback about potential leads and providing more targeted ad prominence for properties. The company also unveiled new technological advances with its use of image recognition and augmented reality to highlight listing details on smartphones via its Sign Snap and Street Peek products. We are very conscious of the key role of realtors and do not seek to disintermediate them as is clearly the aspiration of some companies in the sector.  Just this week, realtor.com was pleased to enter an agreement with the Real Estate Board of New York to provide a direct syndicated feed of listings from more than 600 brokerage firms in New York City, further expanding our presence in that important market. 
REA continues to outperform the competition in Australia. In June, achieving a record market share of 74% against domain and 7.8 times higher time spent on the site. REA is also enhancing engagement through new products as well as through creation of compelling content relevant to buyers, sellers and agents. 
During the year, we divested REA's European operations, renewing our focus on core markets in Australia and East Asia. And we recently expanded into the complementary mortgage business with the acquisition of Smart Line. That acquisition, along with a strategic partnership with NAB, allows REA to tap into a $400 billion a year home loan market. 
Also in fiscal 2017, News Corp's standing as the world's largest real estate business was bolstered through the merger of Housing.com and [indiscernible], creating India's most comprehensive digital real estate platform. That market is at an early stage of its development, but we see an important role in ensuring that all families in India have access to accurate listings and insightful information when making such a crucial investment. 
Some of the highlights excluding the impact of the extra week last year were: The Wall Street Journal saw strong digital growth, ending with nearly 1.3 million digital subscribers, representing 56% of The Journal's total paid subscribers, up almost 70% in past 2 years. In fact at Dow Jones, we saw 10% circulation revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the largest in its experience since fiscal 2011. Meanwhile, the teams streamlined print costs and reinvested in digital through the implementation of our WSJ 2020 strategy. In total, digital accounted for 55% of Dow Jones' full year revenues. 
Our professional information business has gained in strength with risk and compliance delivering a strong performance and a healthy sales pipeline. For the year, risk and compliance revenues rose over 20% with close to 30% growth year-on-year in Q4, and we expect even higher growth in fiscal '18. 
At the New York Post, digital ad revenue more than offset declines in print advertising for 2 straight fiscal years. The Post has also had success in monetizing mobile with 41% of digital ad revenue coming from mobile in fiscal 2017. We are sharing lessons about mobile successes and techniques around the entire company with far greater alacrity. 
While print advertising remains challenged across the newspaper industry, our emerging digital advertising platform, News IQ, will help us meet the needs of advertisers through precise and permission-ed customer data from our monthly unique U.S. audience of over 110 million people.  We strongly believe that for advertisers, our ability to deliver premium content in a procedure environment will set us apart from the polluted platforms and commodified content. We will have more details for you about the formal launch of News IQ in coming months. 
On the other side of the globe, we saw particular success at The Australian, where readership [indiscernible] to nearly 0.5 million a day as of May, resulting in higher revenues and EBITDA. The blossoming of The Australian reflects the immense value of excellent journalism and the importance of strong editorial leadership. Meanwhile, news.com.au is the #1 news brand in Australia according to Nielsen, and taste.com.au is Australia's foremost food site. Overall, News Corp Australia remains the country's largest print and digital publisher and, including REA, reaches more than 16.1 million Australians each month. 
In the U.K., The Times was the only national newspaper to show print circulation growth in the fourth quarter. In fact, subscription to The Times and The Sunday Times reached an all-time high of nearly 0.5 million as of June 30. And on the digital front, The Times and The Sunday Times are hosting over 200,000 digital-only subscribers, representing 45% of its paid subscriber base and growth of 10% for the quarter versus the prior year. Digitally, The Sun is closing the gap with The Mail in the U.K., more than doubling our global monthly unique visitors in the past year to reach a record 85 million in June. The integration of Wireless Group, which connected The Sun sports devotees with its flagship station, talkSPORT, is proceeding, and the complementarity between the platforms is already clear. This year, talkSPORT won the radio rights for the English Football League, making it the biggest holder of exclusive English football rights among U.K. broadcasters. And we will also deploy Wireless Group's expertise to improve the quality of our audio products around the company.
News America Marketing stabilized its business this year, thanks to the impressive performance of its in-store products. There is no doubt retailers are under pressure from digital competition, and providing an enhanced in-store experience is an imperative. Meanwhile, Checkout 51 comfortably surpassed its goal of reaching 10 million users during this year. At year-end, the company posted a valuable digital membership base of over 14 million strong and growing. That is triple the number of members at acquisition on July 2015. 
Book Publishing has flourished  as HarperCollins showed its understanding the American heartland, underscored by best-selling titles such as The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines. We also saw digital audio sales increase by 47% year-over-year and expanded our foreign language footprint, an important driver for long-term growth as we seek to exploit our bestsellers across languages and borders. The rise of audiobooks is a particularly notable trend, highlighted by the success of Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving [an expletive], which has audio sales of over 470,000 and print of over 490,000, showing the power of savvy self-help books and of the audio genre.
Returning to Australia. Fox Sports Australia secured its market-leading position through the extension of A league soccer rights and successfully launched the FOX LEAGUE channel, its dedicated Rugby offering. Foxtel has undergone a major brand refresh, which has coincided with the rollout of Foxtel Go, a streaming service with premium content and multiple price points. Foxtel will complement that with the launch of a dedicated, low-cost IP box in the coming months, while the improved IQ3 state-of-the-art set-top box is showing encouraging results. In the fourth quarter, total subscribers at Foxtel Go including IP improved slightly from the third quarter. And we saw an improvement in cable satellite churn. 
One other area I would like to mention in this review of fiscal 2017 is the global impact of our principled stand on intellectual property and the responsibility of the digital duopoly. It is crucial that algorithms are not used to discriminate against quality journalism and that societies have an informed debate about potential algorithmic abuse. As a result of our efforts, we have begun working with Facebook and Google on a subscription [mechanic], one which could help bring more readers to our mastheads and fundamentally change the ecosystem. 
In conclusion reflecting on the quarter and the year, we are more confident than ever on the power of content that connectivity. Whether it is the news of the day, match of the week, the book of the year or the home of a lifetime, we are dedicated to informing and inspiring our readers and our partners. And in an age of digital opacity, we are committed to making markets more transparent and more lucrative for our advertisers and our allies. Our newer businesses have brought much innovation and energy to the company. And our ability to drive growth is patent and potent. Even so, we are not complacent. We will continuously drive our digital businesses and build our brands. As custodians of the company with the proudest of histories, we know that the past is a platform for the future. For these reasons and more, we're looking forward for the coming year with much confidence in the prospects for shareholders and for our partners. 
And with that, I'll pass it to our CFO, Susan Panuccio."

Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight a few themes from this past year and the quarter. 
News Corp's expansion into digital real estate is poised to reshape our long-term growth. We posted very strong operating results this quarter at both REA and at Move. In this quarter, the segment accounted for 40% of total segment EBITDA even while investing in developing markets. And as a point of reference, revenue in this segment have nearly tripled since separation and is approaching $1 billion annually. We think there is a good long-term tailwind to the segment and [indiscernible] the revenue opportunity behind the core property search. 
We are making progress transitioning News and Information Services to digital. We have seen increased evidence that our quality newspapers: The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London and The Australian have a clear digital path. All 3 now have digital paid subscribers that are approaching, or are in the case of The Wall Street Journal, beyond 50% of total subscribers. And they are showing solid growth in paid volumes and improving circulation revenues. 
We are continuing to rightsize the cost base by removing legacy costs at News and Information Services. However, I believe there is more we can do as I mentioned last quarter, which I will discuss shortly. 
With that, I would like to now discuss our financial results.  For the full year fiscal 2017, total revenues were $8.1 billion, a 2% decline compared to the prior year. You will recall that the prior year had a 53rd week, which positively impacted fiscal 2016 revenues by $112 million.
Reported total segment EBITDA for the year was $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year. As a reminder, the prior year included a onetime charge of $280 million for the settlement at News America Marketing and the onetime gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the settlement, the impact of currency, the legal costs related to the U.K. newspaper matters as well as acquisitions and divestments, rose 5%. 
During the full year, we had significant nonrecurring items impacting earnings per share. These included pretax noncash impairment charges of $785 million, principally related to the fixed asset write-down at The Australian and the U.K. publishing businesses. In addition, equity earnings in affiliates included a pretax write-down of $227 million through [indiscernible] carrying value of Foxtel. These were offset in part by a pretax gain of $107 million at REA from the sale of their European businesses and an improvement in the full year operating results. As a result of these items, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $1.27 compared to $0.28 in the prior year. Again as a reminder, earnings per share in the prior year benefited from a lower tax expense due in large part to the release of U.S. tax asset valuation allowances associated with the divestment Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.36 versus $0.40 in the prior year. 
And now for the quarterly financial details. We reported fiscal 2017 fourth quarter total revenue of $2.1 billion, down approximately 7% versus the prior year. Again, prior year revenues included $112 million impact from the 53rd week. 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to $361 million in the prior year, which included the $122 million gain related to the Zillow settlement and the benefit of the extra week. Excluding the Zillow settlement gains, last year's EBITDA would have been $239 million. 
For the quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $0.74 compared to $0.16 in the prior year, with the prior year benefiting from the Zillow settlement gain. Results this quarter included a noncash impairment charge of $464 million primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets at the U.K. newspaper group. Taking these into account, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.11 versus $0.10 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined 10% compared to the prior year to $1.3 billion. Over half of the revenue shortfall this quarter of $77 million was related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 12%, or down 11% in local currency. The 53rd week impacted advertising by $33 million. Excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, advertising fell 6%.  Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 9%, or 6% in local currency. The 53rd week contributed $39 million and accounted for the vast majority of decline this quarter. Excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, circulation revenues rose 1%. 
News and Information Services' reported segment EBITDA this quarter was $103 million, down 36% versus the prior period. The decline was primarily driven by lower print advertising revenues, a timing shift at News America Marketing between Q3 and Q4 of this year, which I highlighted last quarter, and the impact of the 53rd week. 
I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operating divisions and excluding the 53rd week.  
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenue declined 14% versus the prior year period, fairly similar to the third quarter rate, but better than the first half rate. Digital accounted for approximately 37% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter. We again saw strong paid volume growth at the Wall Street Journal where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.3 million, a 12% year-over-year increase driven by higher digital-only subscriptions, which rose 34% versus the prior year. 
Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones accelerated to 10%, up from mid-single digits last quarter, driven by volume gains and higher subscription pricing at The Wall Street Journal. Importantly, the growth rate this quarter was the highest level achieved since fiscal 2011.  In July, The Wall Street Journal increased subscription prices to new customers by $2 to $5 per month depending on the bundle, and also increased cover prices by $1 for both the Monday to Friday and the weekend edition. 
Professional information business revenues were flat in the fourth quarter, but grew modestly excluding foreign currency, as the year-over-year growth at risk and compliance accelerated to around 30%. Importantly, the pipelines of new business at the professional information business is encouraging, giving us increased confidence that growth can be sustained into fiscal 2018. 
On cost initiatives, Dow Jones realized about $60 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 related to The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative and is on track to achieve at least $100 million in underlying cost savings on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018. Cost reductions [in operations advertising the] newsroom, which is being streamlined to be digital and mobile-first. 
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 1%, or 2% in local currency, helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding that and the sale of The Sunday Times in Perth, advertising declined approximately 10% in local currency, similar to the prior quarter.  Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 1%, or flat in local currency, as the acquisition of ARM, cover price increases and higher paid digital subscribers were offset by print volume declines and the sale of The Sunday Times.  
We are making progress with digital subscriptions in Australia as well.  Robert mentioned the turnaround at The Australian, partly due to the success of its digital subscription offering, which now has over 95,000 subscribers. Across the News Australia marketers, we now have approximately 360,000 paid subscribers including the ARM properties, over 30% higher from the prior year. 
We are continuing our assessment of the cost structure at News Australia. While we achieved approximately $40 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017, it is clear that more work needs to be done, particularly given our reliance on print in that market. We expect ongoing cost reductions in fiscal 2018, while continuing to drive our digital transition. Additionally, with the integration of ARM, we continue to look at our broader regional community newspapers to ensure the optimal operational and cost structure exists. 
At News U.K., advertising revenue trends are similar to last quarter as the results were likely impacted by the general election and the Euro championships last year. Circulation revenues at News U.K. were down 14%, or modestly year-over-year in local currency, primarily due to the lower print volume and no newsstand price increase at The Sun this year compared to the prior year, partially offset by growth at The Times.  Trends at The Times remained positive with print volumes up low single digits this quarter. As Robert mentioned, digital subscribers at The Times and The Sunday Times is up over 10% this quarter versus last year to 201,000.  At The Sun, the average monthly unique users reached 81 million in the fourth quarter, more than doubling versus the prior year and hitting a record of 85 million in June as we continue to build audience to drive and improve monetization. 
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were down 8%, partially related to the shift in timing of in-store products, as mentioned last quarter, and 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year. 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues for the quarter decreased 6% to $407 million, mostly due to the 53rd week negative impact from currency fluctuations and declines in the children's division, which faces difficult prior year comparatives. Segment EBITDA decreased 22% to $39 million due to lower revenues, higher compensation expense and write-offs related to a few new releases this year. Titles to highlight this quarter include Michael Crichton's as well as carryover sales from J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young's Jesus Always. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 20% of consumer revenues compared to 19% in the prior year due to strength in digital audio. 
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenue increased $22 million or 10% to $251 million. And adjusted revenues increased 16%, which excludes the impact from divestment of REA's European business and move [indiscernible] as well as currency impacts and acquisition. Total reported segment EBITDA was $87 million versus $175 million last year, with last year reflecting the gain from the settlement with Zillow. Excluding the Zillow settlement, acquisition, divestments and currency movements adjusted segment EBITDA growth was 67%. 
REA Group revenues grew 7% due to improved product mix including higher penetration from Premier All and higher yields. The growth was partially offset by a $10 million or 8% decline in revenue resulting from the divestment of the European businesses. 
Similar to last quarter, REA will report results that present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a larger-than-usual variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Their call will commence shortly after the conclusion of this call. 
REA recently acquired a majority stake in Smart Line, one of the leading mortgage brokers in Australia, and entered into a strategic partnership with National Australia Bank. Part of REA's strategy is to integrate property and finance search to better capture value for lead volume. 
Move revenues rose approximately 10% to $108 million versus the prior year, again driven by very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher lead volume and improved pricing optimization and higher nonlisting media revenues. TigerLead, which was divested in November, contributed $4 million in the prior year and the 53rd revenue contribution was $6 million. Excluding those items, revenue growth would have been approximately 23%. 
We also grew customers and yields while also posting accelerated lead volume. As expected, Realtor contributed to segment EBITDA this quarter and for the full year, and we expect to build on that momentum in fiscal 2018. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong at 9% year-over-year to 58 million in the quarter. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased $7 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter, due to the $10 million impact in the 53rd week in the prior year and lower subscriber revenues, mostly offset by the addition of the Australian News Channel, the operator of Australia's Sky News networks, and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 4% to $24 million driven by lower programming costs. 
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $19 million this quarter compared to equity income of $5 million last year. Our equity loss tick-up this quarter included an $11 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of 
Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network, which has moved into voluntary administration, and a $3 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.  Foxtel revenues for the quarter declined 3% to $600 million. EBITDA decreased 9% to $150 million and was down 10% in local currency, due to the decrease in revenue and higher programming costs, principally related to the new AFL contract. 
Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel entered the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, which was lower than the prior year, primarily due to the shutdown of Presto. In the fourth quarter, Foxtel Play was relaunched s Foxtel Now, which was supported by a new marketing campaign alongside the relaunch of the Foxtel brand. Including Foxtel Now, total subscribers increased modestly [indiscernible] the third quarter. In the coming months, Foxtel plans to launch an IP dedicated box, which will include access free to air along with enhanced [indiscernible] space. 
In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 13.3% from 14% last year, the first year-over-year improvement since the second quarter of last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% to around AUD 86. 
And finally for the full year fiscal 2017, capital expenditures from continuing operations were flat at $256 million. 
Heading into the new fiscal year, there are a few points that I would like to note. At News and Information Services, overall ad trends at this point for key mastheads remained stable with the fourth quarter, although we had seen a slight improvement at Dow Jones. The first quarter should benefit from the increased subscription prices at Dow Jones that I mentioned earlier as well as increased cover prices in the U.K. and Australia. -- We assume continued print declines into fiscal 2018, but we'll aggressively seek out cost reductions. Dow Jones will continue with their 2020 program. And the Australian business continues to transform its cost base as it [indiscernible] digital growth. 
Fox Sports Australian will face an incremental AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million in higher rights costs, mostly related to our new NRL contract. We expect to offset much of that from operating efficiencies and a higher affiliates revenue.
On Book Publishing, overall trends were favorable with digital contribution relatively stable. The pipeline for the year looks strong with key offers. 
Digital Real Estate Services, we continue to expect strong revenue and EBITDA contribution from both REA and Move. At move, we are pleased with the progress at realtor.com, particularly the revenue improvement in the second half of fiscal 2017 and want to build on that momentum this year. We will continue to roll out our Advantage product, our listing agent offering, to the balance of our customers in the first half of the year and remain focused on further site enhancements to drive audience growth. REA should benefit from higher pricing, continued penetration of listing products and increased revenue from the expansion in mortgage brokering, for which the company has provided some guidance. Given these trends, we expect to see improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Fiscal 2017 was an important year for News Corp as we posted tangible improvement in profitability powered by the fast-growing Digital Real Estate Services segment. And we monetized premium content while continuing our commitment to increase operating efficiencies.
Since our reincarnation, we have been assertively digital and have led the global debate on the value of content by word and by deed at a time of profound change in our markets and in society. That strategy continues to pay off as evidenced by our full year operating results and by the broadening debate for which News Corp has been a catalyst. We are more than sum of our parts. Our acquisitions in digital development have changed the composition of the company but enhanced the personality and principles that have defined us since the conception of the original News Corporation.
Revenues were relatively stable this year at over $8.1 billion despite the lost free print advertising headwinds and an extra week in the prior year. But importantly, total segment EBITDA improved to $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year, which included litigation settlement charges and gains. Even absent those settlements and other items, adjusted total segment EBITDA expanded 5%.  For the quarter, we took significant impairments, as we recognized the challenges facing print and oriented the company towards the future. Susan will provide you with further details.
In the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the Zillow settlement, digital real estate continued to deliver on its potential not only as a strong source of growth but also in its rapidly expanding contribution to overall adjusted EBITDA. At both REA and Move, we are pleased to see increased traffic, improved engagement and continuing revenue growth, particularly at realtor.com, where Move is making positive contributions to segment EBITDA. From a lagging #3 player in the U.S. market, realtor.com has become the most engaged with audiences and the most important source of leads for realtors.
We are still far from satisfied with our progress, as we firmly believe that the U.S. digital property market is still in an early phase of its evolution and expect many more years of strong audience and revenue growth. In December, realtor rolled out Advantage, a state-of-the-art listing agent product, capturing real-time feedback about potential leads and providing more-targeted ad prominence for properties. The company also unveiled new technological advances with its use of image recognition and augmented reality to highlight listing details on smartphones via its Sign Snap and Street Peek products. We are very conscious of the key role of realtors and do not seek to disintermediate them as is clearly the aspiration of some companies in the sector.  Just this week, realtor.com was pleased to enter an agreement with the Real Estate Board of New York to provide a direct syndicated feed of listings from more than 600 brokerage form -- firms in New York City, further expanding our presence in that important market.
REA continues to outperform the competition in Australia. In June, achieving a record market share of 74% against domain and 7.8x higher time spent on the site. REA is also enhancing engagement through new products as well as through the creation of compelling content relevant to buyers, sellers and agents.
During the year, we divested REA's European operations, renewing our focus on core markets in Australia and East Asia. And we recently expanded into the complementary mortgage business with the acquisition of Smartline. That acquisition along with a strategic partnership with NAB allows REA to tap into a $400 billion a year home loan market.
Also in fiscal 2017, News Corp's standing as the world's largest digital real estate business was bolstered through the merger of Housing.com and PropTiger.com, creating India's most comprehensive digital real estate platform. That market is at an early stage of its development. So we see an important role in ensuring that all families in India have access to accurate listings and insightful information when making such a crucial investment.
Some of the highlights excluding the impact of the extra week last year were: The Wall Street Journal saw strong digital growth, ending with nearly 1.3 million digital subscribers, representing 56% of the journal's total paid subscribers, up almost 70% in the past 2 years. In fact at Dow Jones, we saw 10% circulation revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the largest in it has experienced since fiscal 2011. Meanwhile, the teams streamlined print costs and reinvested in digital through the implementation of our WSJ 2020 strategy. In total, digital accounted for 55% of Dow Jones' full year revenues.
Our professional information business has gained in strength with risk and compliance delivering a strong performance and a healthy sales pipeline. For the year, risk and compliance revenues rose over 20% with close to 30% growth year-on-year in Q4, and we expect even higher growth in fiscal '18.
At the New York Post, digital ad revenue more than offset declines in print advertising for 2 straight fiscal years. The Post has also had success in monetizing mobile with 41% of digital ad revenue coming from mobile in fiscal 2017. We are sharing lessons about mobile successes and techniques around the entire company with far greater rapidity and alacrity.
While print advertising remains challenged across the newspaper industry, our emerging digital advertising platform, News IQ, will help us meet the needs of advertisers through precise and permissioned customer data from our monthly unique U.S. audience of over 110 million people.  We strongly believe that for advertisers, our ability to deliver premium content in a prestige environment will set us apart from the polluted platforms and commodified content. We will have more details for you about the formal launch of News IQ in coming months.
On the other side of the globe, we saw particular success at The Australian, where readership virgined to nearly 0.5 million a day as of May, resulting in higher revenues and EBITDA. The blossoming of The Australian reflects the immense value of excellent journalism and the importance of strong editorial leadership. Meanwhile, news.com.au is the #1 news brand in Australia according to Nielsen. And taste.com.au is Australia's foremost food site. Overall, News Corp Australia remains the country's largest print and digital publisher and, including REA, reaches more than 16.1 million Australians each month.
In the U.K., The Times was the only national newspaper to show print circulation growth in the fourth quarter. In fact, subscriptions to those Times and The Sunday Times reached an all-time high of nearly 0.5 million as of June 30. And on the digital front, The Times and The Sunday Times are hosting over 200,000 digital-only subscribers representing 45% of its paid subscriber base and growth of 10% for the quarter versus the prior year. Digitally, The Sun is fast closing the gap with The Mail in the U.K., more than doubling our global monthly unique visitors in the past year to reach a record 85 million in June. The integration of Wireless Group, which connected The Sun sports devotees with its flagship station, talkSPORT, is proceeding, and the complementarity between the platforms is already clear. This year, talkSPORT won the radio rights for the English Football League, making it the biggest holder of exclusive English football rights among U.K. broadcasters. And we'll also deploy Wireless Group's expertise to improve the quality of our audio products around the company.
News America Marketing stabilized its business this year, thanks to the impressive performance of its in-store products. There is no doubt, retailers are under pressure from digital competition. And providing an enhanced in-store experience is an imperative. Meanwhile, Checkout 51 comfortably surpassed its goal of reaching 10 million users during this year. At year-end, the company boasted a valuable digital membership base of over 14 million strong and growing. That is triple the number of members at acquisition in July 2015.
Book Publishing has flourished, as HarperCollins showed its understanding of the American heartland, underscored by best-selling titles such as The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines and J.D Wance's Hillbilly Elegy. We also saw digital audio sales increase by 47% year-over-year and expanded our foreign language footprint, an important driver for long-term growth, as we seek to exploit our bestsellers across languages and borders. The rise of audiobooks is a particularly notable trend highlighted by the success of Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a (Expletive), which has audio sales of over 470,000 and print of over 490,000, showing the power of savvy, self-help books and of the audio genre.
Returning to Australia. Fox Sports Australia secured its market-leading position through the extension of A-League soccer rights and successfully launched the FOX LEAGUE channel, its dedicated Rugby league offering. Foxtel has undergone a major brand refresh, which has coincided with the rollout of Foxtel Now, a streaming service with premium content and multiple price points. Foxtel will complement that with the launch of a dedicated, low-cost IP box in the coming months, while the improved iQ3 state-of-the-art set-top box is showing encouraging results. In the fourth quarter, total subscribers at Foxtel including IP improved slightly from the third quarter. And we saw an improvement in cable satellite churn.
One other area I would like to mention in this review of fiscal 2017 is the global impact of our principled stand on intellectual property and the responsibility of the digital duopoly. It is crucial that algorithms are not used to discriminate against quality journalism, and that societies have an informed debate about potential algorithmic abuse. As a result of our efforts, we have begun working with Facebook and Google on a subscription mechanic, one which could help bring more readers to our mastheads and fundamentally change the content ecosystem.
In conclusion, reflecting on the quarter and the year, we are more confident than ever in the power of content and connectivity. Whether it's the news of the day, the match of the week, the book of the year or the home of a lifetime, we are dedicated to informing and inspiring our readers and our partners. And in an age of digital opacity, we are committed to making markets more transparent and more lucrative for our advertisers and allies. Our newer businesses have brought much innovation and energy to the company. And our ability to drive growth is patent and potent. Even so, we are not complacent. We will continuously drive our digital businesses and build our brands. As custodians of the company with the proudest of histories, we know that the past is a platform for the future. For these reasons and more, we're looking forward to the coming year with much confidence in the prospects for shareholders and for our partners.
And with that, I'll pass it to our CFO, Susan Panuccio."

We posted very strong operating re",2662,"Thank you, Robert. Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight a few themes from this past year and the quarter.
News Corp's expansion into digital real estate is poised to reshape our long-term growth. We posted very strong operating results this quarter at both REA and at Move. In this quarter, the segment accounted for 40% of total segment EBITDA even while investing in developing markets. And as a point of reference, our revenue in this segment has nearly tripled since separation and is approaching $1 billion annually. We think there is a good long-term tailwind to the segment and see revenue opportunity beyond the core property search.
We are making progress transitioning News and Information Services to digital. We have seen increased evidence that our quality newspapers, the Wall Street Journal, The Times of London and The Australian have a clear digital path. All 3 now have digital paid subscribers that are approaching or are, in the case of The Wall Street Journal, beyond 50% of total subscribers. And they're showing solid growth in paid volumes and improving circulation revenues.
We are continuing to right size the cost base by removing legacy costs at News and Information Services. However, I believe this is more we can do as I mentioned last quarter, which I'll discuss shortly.
With that, I would like to now discuss our financial results.  For the full year fiscal 2017, total revenues were $8.1 billion, a 2% decline compared to the prior year. You will recall that the prior year had a 53rd week, which positively impacted fiscal 2016 revenues by $112 million.
Reported total segment EBITDA for the year was $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year. As a reminder, the prior year included a one-time charge of $280 million for the settlement at News America Marketing and the one-time gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the settlement, the impact of currency, the legal costs related to the U.K. newspaper matters as well as acquisitions and divestments, rose 5%.
During the full year, we had significant non-recurring items impacting earnings per share. These included pretax noncash impairment charges of $785 million, principally related to the fixed asset write-down at The Australian and the U.K. publishing businesses. In addition, equity earnings of affiliates included a pretax write-down of $227 million to reduce our carrying value of Foxtel. These were offset in part by a pretax gain of $107 million at REA from the sale of their European businesses and an improvement in the full year operating results. As a result of these items, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $1.27 compared to $0.28 in the prior year. Again, as a reminder, earnings per share in the prior year benefited from a lower tax expense due in large part the release of U.S. tax asset valuation allowances associated with the divestment of Amplify. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.36 versus $0.40 in the prior year. 
And now for the quarterly financial detail. We reported fiscal 2017 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, down approximately 7% versus the prior year. Again, prior year revenues included $112 million impact from the 53rd week.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to $361 million in the prior year, which included $122 million gain related to the Zillow settlement and the benefit of the extra week. Excluding the Zillow settlement gain, last year's EBITDA would have been $239 million.
For the quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $0.74 compared to $0.16 in the prior year, with the prior year benefiting from the Zillow settlement gain. Results this quarter included a noncash impairment charge of $464 million primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets of the U.K. newspaper group. Taking these into account, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.11 versus $0.10 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined 10% compared to the prior year to $1.3 billion. Over half of the revenue shortfall, this quarter of $77 million was related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Within the segment revenues, advertising declined around 12% or down 11% in local currency. The 53rd week impacted advertising by $33 million, excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, advertising fell 6%.  Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 9% or 6% in local currency. The 53rd week contributed $39 million and accounted for the vast majority of decline this quarter. Excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, circulation revenues rose 1%.
News and Information Services' reported segment EBITDA this quarter was $103 million, down 36% versus the prior period. The decline was primarily driven by lower print advertising revenues, a timing shift at News America Marketing between Q3 and Q4 of this year, which I highlighted last quarter, and the impact of the 53rd week.
I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operating divisions and excluding the 53rd week.
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenue declined 14% versus the prior year period, fairly similar to the third quarter rate but better than the first half rate. Digital accounted for approximately 37% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter. We again saw strong paid volume growth at the Wall Street Journal where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.3 million, a 12% year-over-year increase driven by higher digital-only subscriptions, which rose 34% versus the prior year.
Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones accelerated to 10%, up from mid-single digits last quarter, driven by volume gains and higher subscription pricing at The Wall Street Journal. Importantly, the growth rate this quarter was the highest level achieved since fiscal 2011.  In July, The Wall Street Journal increased subscription prices to new customers by $2 to $5 per month depending on the bundle and also increased cover prices by $1 for both the Monday to Friday and the weekend edition.
Professional information business revenues were flat in the fourth quarter but grew modestly excluding foreign currency, as the year-over-year growth at risk and compliance accelerated to around 30%. Importantly, the pipelines for new business at the professional information business is encouraging, giving us increased confidence that growth can be sustained into fiscal 2018.
On cost initiatives, Dow Jones realized about $60 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 related to The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative and is on track to achieve at least $100 million in underlying cost savings on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018. Cost reductions are across operations, advertising and the newsroom, which is being streamlined to be digital and mobile-first.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 1% or 2% in local currency helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding that and the sale of The Sunday Times in Perth, advertising declined approximately 10% in local currency, similar to the prior quarter.  Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 1% or were flat in local currency as the acquisition of ARM, cover price increases and higher-paid digital subscribers were offset by print volume declines and the sale of The Sunday Times.
We are making progress with digital subscriptions in Australia as well.  Robert mentioned the turnaround at The Australian partly due to the success of its digital subscription offering, which now has over 95,000 subscribers. Across the News Australia masthead, we now have approximately 360,000 paid subscribers including the ARM properties, over 30% higher from the prior year.
We are continuing our assessment of the cost structure at News Australia. While we achieved approximately $40 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017, it is clear that more work needs to be done particularly given our reliance on print in that market. We expect ongoing cost reductions in fiscal 2018 while continuing to drive our digital transition. Additionally, with the integration of ARM, we continue to look at our broader regional community newspapers to ensure the optimal operational and cost structure exists.
At News U.K., advertising revenue trends are similar to last quarter as the results were likely impacted by the general election and the Euro championships last year. Circulation revenues at News U.K. were down 14% or modestly year-over-year in local currency, primarily due to the lower print volume and no newsstand price increase at The Sun this year as compared to the prior year, partially offset by growth at The Times.  Trends at The Times remained positive with print volumes up low single digits this quarter. As Robert mentioned, digital subscribers at The Times and The Sunday Times is up over 10% this quarter versus the last year to 201,000.  At The Sun, the average monthly unique users reached 81 million in the fourth quarter, more than doubling versus the prior year and hitting a record of 85 million in June, as we continue to build audience to drive and improve monetization.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were down 8%, partially related to the shift in timing of in-store products, as mentioned last quarter, and 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues for the quarter decreased 6% to $407 million, mostly due to the 53rd-week negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and declines in the children's division, which faced a difficult prior year comparative. Segment EBITDA decreased 22% to $39 million due to lower revenues, higher compensation expense and write-off related to a few new releases this year. Titles to highlight this quarter include Michael Crichton's Dragon Teeth as well as carryover sales from J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young's Jesus Always. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 20% of consumer revenues compared to 19% in the prior year due to strength in digital audio.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $22 million or 10% to $251 million. And adjusted revenues increased 16%, which excludes the impact from divestment of REA's European business and Move's TigerLead as well as currency impacts and acquisitions. Total reported segment EBITDA was $87 million versus $175 million last year with last year reflecting the gain from the settlement of Zillow. Excluding the Zillow settlement, acquisitions, divestments and currency movements, adjusted segment EBITDA growth was 67%. 
REA Group revenue grew 7% due to improved product mix including higher penetration for [ Premier All ] and higher yield. The growth was partially offset by a $10 million or 8% decline in revenue resulting from the divestment of the European businesses.
Similar to last quarter, REA will report results that present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a larger-than-usual variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Their call will commence shortly after the conclusion of this call.
REA recently acquired a majority stake in Smartline, one of the leading mortgage brokers in Australia, and entered into a strategic partnership with the National Australia Bank. Part of REA's strategy is to integrate property and finance search to better capture value for lead volume.
Move revenues rose approximately 10% to $108 million versus the prior year, again driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher lead volume and improved pricing optimization and higher non-listing Media revenues. TigerLead, which was divested in November, contributed $4 million in the prior year, and the 53rd revenue contribution was $6 million. Excluding those items, revenue growth would have been approximately 23%.
We also grew customers and yields while also posting accelerated lead volume. As expected, realtor contributed to segment EBITDA this quarter and for the full year. And we expect to build on that momentum in fiscal 2018. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong at 9% year-over-year to 58 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased $7 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter due to the $10 million impact from the 53rd week in the prior year and lower subscriber revenues, mostly offset by the addition of the Australian News channel, the operator of Australia's Sky News networks, and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 4% to $24 million driven by lower programming costs.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $19 million this quarter compared to equity income of $5 million last year. Our equity loss pickup this quarter included an $11 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of 
Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network, which has moved into voluntary administration and a further $3 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.  Foxtel revenues for the quarter declined 3% to $600 million. EBITDA decreased 9% to $150 million and was down 10% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and higher programming costs, principally related to the new AFL contract.
Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, which was lower than the prior year primarily due to the shutdown of Presto. In the fourth quarter, Foxtel Play was relaunched as Foxtel Now, which was supported by a new marketing campaign alongside the relaunch of the Foxtel brand. Including Foxtel Now, total subscribers increased modestly versus the third quarter. In the coming months, Foxtel plans to launch an IP dedicated box, which will include a tuner for access to free to air along with enhanced guided user interface. 
In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 13.3% from 14% last year, the first year-over-year improvement since the second quarter of last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% to around AUD 86.
And finally, for the full year fiscal 2017, capital expenditures from continuing operations were flat at $256 million.
Heading into the new fiscal year, there are a few points that I would like to note. At News and Information Services, overall ad trends at this point for our key mastheads remained stable with the fourth quarter, although we had seen a slight improvement at Dow Jones. The first quarter should benefit from the increased subscription prices at Dow Jones that I mentioned earlier as well as increased cover prices in the U.K. and Australia. We assume continued print declines into fiscal 2018, but we'll aggressively seek out cost reductions. Dow Jones will continue with their 2020 program. And the Australian business continues to transform its cost base as it reinvests the digital growth.
Fox Sports Australian will face an incremental AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million in higher rights costs mostly related to the new NRL contract. We expect to offset much of that from operating efficiencies and a higher affiliates' revenue --
-- on Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution relatively stable. The pipeline for the year looks strong with releases from key authors such as Ree Drummond, Daniel Silva, Karin Slaughter, Chip and Joanna Gaines, Bernard Cornwell, Victoria Aveyard, Erin Hunter, and Donna Hay.
At Digital Real Estate Services, we continue to expect strong revenue and EBITDA contribution from both REA and Move. At Move, we are pleased with the progress at realtor.com, particularly the revenue improvement in the second half of fiscal 2017 and want to build on that momentum this year. We will continue to roll out our Advantage product, our listing agent offering, to the balance of our customers in the first half of the year and remain focused on further site enhancements to drive audience growth. REA should benefit from higher pricing, continued penetration of listing products and increased revenue from the expansion into mortgage brokering for which the company has provided some guidance. Given these trends, we expect to see improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And so that is continuing well. I think it's fair to say on the digital advertising front that in the last half of the fiscal, we didn't see the growth that we wanted.

And therefore, we firmly believe that premium products and premium audiences will be important, almost regardless of the media. What -- well, what we're certainly seeing across most of our properties is, Wall Street Journal aside as I mentioned earlier, an increase in digital ad growth and the potential, for example, in the U.K. with The Sun where you had a -- an exponential increase in its digital audience. And now we're improving engagement models, it is obviously real. But that shouldn't take away from the potential of some of what is referred to as the traditional print products. For example, the WSJ magazine spring edition this autumn will have a record amount of advertising in it. So that itself shows the importance of print as a platform.

Fiscal 2017 was an important year for News Corp as we posted tangible improvement in profitability powered by the fast-growing Digital Real Estate Services segment. And we monetized premium content while continuing our commitment to increase operating efficiencies.
Since our reincarnation, we have been assertively digital and have led the global debate on the value of content by word and by deed at a time of profound change in our markets and in society. That strategy continues to pay off as evidenced by our full year operating results and by the broadening debate for which News Corp has been a catalyst. We are more than sum of our parts. Our acquisitions in digital development have changed the composition of the company but enhanced the personality and principles that have defined us since the conception of the original News Corporation.
Revenues were relatively stable this year at over $8.1 billion despite the lost free print advertising headwinds and an extra week in the prior year. But importantly, total segment EBITDA improved to $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year, which included litigation settlement charges and gains. Even absent those settlements and other items, adjusted total segment EBITDA expanded 5%.  For the quarter, we took significant impairments, as we recognized the challenges facing print and oriented the company towards the future. Susan will provide you with further details.
In the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the Zillow settlement, digital real estate continued to deliver on its potential not only as a strong source of growth but also in its rapidly expanding contribution to overall adjusted EBITDA. At both REA and Move, we are pleased to see increased traffic, improved engagement and continuing revenue growth, particularly at realtor.com, where Move is making positive contributions to segment EBITDA. From a lagging #3 player in the U.S. market, realtor.com has become the most engaged with audiences and the most important source of leads for realtors.
We are still far from satisfied with our progress, as we firmly believe that the U.S. digital property market is still in an early phase of its evolution and expect many more years of strong audience and revenue growth. In December, realtor rolled out Advantage, a state-of-the-art listing agent product, capturing real-time feedback about potential leads and providing more-targeted ad prominence for properties. The company also unveiled new technological advances with its use of image recognition and augmented reality to highlight listing details on smartphones via its Sign Snap and Street Peek products. We are very conscious of the key role of realtors and do not seek to disintermediate them as is clearly the aspiration of some companies in the sector.  Just this week, realtor.com was pleased to enter an agreement with the Real Estate Board of New York to provide a direct syndicated feed of listings from more than 600 brokerage form -- firms in New York City, further expanding our presence in that important market.
REA continues to outperform the competition in Australia. In June, achieving a record market share of 74% against domain and 7.8x higher time spent on the site. REA is also enhancing engagement through new products as well as through the creation of compelling content relevant to buyers, sellers and agents.
During the year, we divested REA's European operations, renewing our focus on core markets in Australia and East Asia. And we recently expanded into the complementary mortgage business with the acquisition of Smartline. That acquisition along with a strategic partnership with NAB allows REA to tap into a $400 billion a year home loan market.
Also in fiscal 2017, News Corp's standing as the world's largest digital real estate business was bolstered through the merger of Housing.com and PropTiger.com, creating India's most comprehensive digital real estate platform. That market is at an early stage of its development. So we see an important role in ensuring that all families in India have access to accurate listings and insightful information when making such a crucial investment.
Some of the highlights excluding the impact of the extra week last year were: The Wall Street Journal saw strong digital growth, ending with nearly 1.3 million digital subscribers, representing 56% of the journal's total paid subscribers, up almost 70% in the past 2 years. In fact at Dow Jones, we saw 10% circulation revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the largest in it has experienced since fiscal 2011. Meanwhile, the teams streamlined print costs and reinvested in digital through the implementation of our WSJ 2020 strategy. In total, digital accounted for 65% of Dow Jones' full year revenues.
Our professional information business has gained in strength with risk and compliance delivering a strong performance and a healthy sales pipeline. For the year, risk and compliance revenues rose over 20% with close to 30% growth year-on-year in Q4, and we expect even higher growth in fiscal '18.
At the New York Post, digital ad revenue more than offset declines in print advertising for 2 straight fiscal years. The Post has also had success in monetizing mobile with 41% of digital ad revenue coming from mobile in fiscal 2017. We are sharing lessons about mobile successes and techniques around the entire company with far greater rapidity and alacrity.
While print advertising remains challenged across the newspaper industry, our emerging digital advertising platform, News IQ, will help us meet the needs of advertisers through precise and permissioned customer data from our monthly unique U.S. audience of over 110 million people.  We strongly believe that for advertisers, our ability to deliver premium content in a prestige environment will set us apart from the polluted platforms and commodified content. We will have more details for you about the formal launch of News IQ in coming months.
On the other side of the globe, we saw particular success at The Australian, where readership virgined to nearly 0.5 million a day as of May, resulting in higher revenues and EBITDA. The blossoming of The Australian reflects the immense value of excellent journalism and the importance of strong editorial leadership. Meanwhile, news.com.au is the #1 news brand in Australia according to Nielsen. And taste.com.au is Australia's foremost food site. Overall, News Corp Australia remains the country's largest print and digital publisher and, including REA, reaches more than 16.1 million Australians each month.
In the U.K., The Times was the only national newspaper to show print circulation growth in the fourth quarter. In fact, subscriptions to those Times and The Sunday Times reached an all-time high of nearly 0.5 million as of June 30. And on the digital front, The Times and The Sunday Times are hosting over 200,000 digital-only subscribers representing 45% of its paid subscriber base and growth of 10% for the quarter versus the prior year. Digitally, The Sun is fast closing the gap with The Mail in the U.K., more than doubling our global monthly unique visitors in the past year to reach a record 85 million in June. The integration of Wireless Group, which connected The Sun sports devotees with its flagship station, talkSPORT, is proceeding, and the complementarity between the platforms is already clear. This year, talkSPORT won the radio rights for the English Football League, making it the biggest holder of exclusive English football rights among U.K. broadcasters. And we'll also deploy Wireless Group's expertise to improve the quality of our audio products around the company.
News America Marketing stabilized its business this year, thanks to the impressive performance of its in-store products. There is no doubt, retailers are under pressure from digital competition. And providing an enhanced in-store experience is an imperative. Meanwhile, Checkout 51 comfortably surpassed its goal of reaching 10 million users during this year. At year-end, the company boasted a valuable digital membership base of over 14 million strong and growing. That is triple the number of members at acquisition in July 2015.
Book Publishing has flourished, as HarperCollins showed its understanding of the American heartland, underscored by best-selling titles such as The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines and J.D Vance's Hillbilly Elegy. We also saw digital audio sales increase by 47% year-over-year and expanded our foreign language footprint, an important driver for long-term growth, as we seek to exploit our bestsellers across languages and borders. The rise of audiobooks is a particularly notable trend highlighted by the success of Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a (Expletive), which has audio sales of over 470,000 and print of over 490,000, showing the power of savvy, self-help books and of the audio genre.
Returning to Australia. Fox Sports Australia secured its market-leading position through the extension of A-League soccer rights and successfully launched the FOX LEAGUE channel, its dedicated Rugby league offering. Foxtel has undergone a major brand refresh, which has coincided with the rollout of Foxtel Now, a streaming service with premium content and multiple price points. Foxtel will complement that with the launch of a dedicated, low-cost IP box in the coming months, while the improved iQ3 state-of-the-art set-top box is showing encouraging results. In the fourth quarter, total subscribers at Foxtel including IP improved slightly from the third quarter. And we saw an improvement in cable satellite churn.
One other area I would like to mention in this review of fiscal 2017 is the global impact of our principled stand on intellectual property and the responsibility of the digital duopoly. It is crucial that algorithms are not used to discriminate against quality journalism, and that societies have an informed debate about potential algorithmic abuse. As a result of our efforts, we have begun working with Facebook and Google on a subscription mechanic, one which could help bring more readers to our mastheads and fundamentally change the content ecosystem.
In conclusion, reflecting on the quarter and the year, we are more confident than ever in the power of content and connectivity. Whether it's the news of the day, the match of the week, the book of the year or the home of a lifetime, we are dedicated to informing and inspiring our readers and our partners. And in an age of digital opacity, we are committed to making markets more transparent and more lucrative for our advertisers and allies. Our newer businesses have brought much innovation and energy to the company. And our ability to drive growth is patent and potent. Even so, we are not complacent. We will continuously drive our digital businesses and build our brands. As custodians of the company with the proudest of histories, we know that the past is a platform for the future. For these reasons and more, we're looking forward to the coming year with much confidence in the prospects for shareholders and for our partners.
And with that, I'll pass it to our CFO, Susan Panuccio."
212741644,530180861,1277897,"News Corporation, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2017",2017-08-10,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert.

We posted very strong operating re",2662,"Thank you, Robert. Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight a few themes from this past year and the quarter.
News Corp's expansion into digital real estate is poised to reshape our long-term growth. We posted very strong operating results this quarter at both REA and at Move. In this quarter, the segment accounted for 40% of total segment EBITDA even while investing in developing markets. And as a point of reference, our revenue in this segment has nearly tripled since separation and is approaching $1 billion annually. We think there is a good long-term tailwind to the segment and see further revenue opportunity beyond the core property search.
We are making progress transitioning News and Information Services to digital. We have seen increased evidence that our quality newspapers, the Wall Street Journal, The Times of London and The Australian have a clear digital path. All 3 now have digital paid subscribers that are approaching or are, in the case of The Wall Street Journal, beyond 50% of total subscribers. And they're showing solid growth in paid volumes and improving circulation revenues.
We are continuing to right size the cost base by removing legacy costs at News and Information Services. However, I believe this is more we can do as I mentioned last quarter, which I'll discuss shortly.
With that, I would like to now discuss our financial results.  For the full year fiscal 2017, total revenues were $8.1 billion, a 2% decline compared to the prior year. You will recall that the prior year had a 53rd week, which positively impacted fiscal 2016 revenues by $112 million.
Reported total segment EBITDA for the year was $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year. As a reminder, the prior year included a one-time charge of $280 million for the settlement at News America Marketing and the one-time gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the settlement, the impact of currency, the legal costs related to the U.K. newspaper matters as well as acquisitions and divestments, rose 5%.
During the full year, we had significant non-recurring items impacting earnings per share. These included pretax noncash impairment charges of $785 million, principally related to the fixed asset write-down at The Australian and the U.K. publishing businesses. In addition, equity earnings of affiliates included a pretax write-down of $227 million to reduce our carrying value of Foxtel. These were offset in part by a pretax gain of $107 million at REA from the sale of their European businesses and an improvement in the full year operating results. As a result of these items, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $1.27 compared to $0.28 in the prior year. Again, as a reminder, earnings per share in the prior year benefited from a lower tax expense due in large part the release of U.S. tax asset valuation allowances associated with the divestment of Amplify. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.36 versus $0.40 in the prior year. 
And now for the quarterly financial detail. We reported fiscal 2017 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, down approximately 7% versus the prior year. Again, prior year revenues included $112 million impact from the 53rd week.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to $361 million in the prior year, which included $122 million gain related to the Zillow settlement and the benefit of the extra week. Excluding the Zillow settlement gain, last year's EBITDA would have been $239 million.
For the quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $0.74 compared to $0.16 in the prior year, with the prior year benefiting from the Zillow settlement gain. Results this quarter include a noncash impairment charge of $464 million primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets of the U.K. newspaper group. Taking these into account, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.11 versus $0.10 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined 10% compared to the prior year to $1.3 billion. Over half of the revenue shortfall, this quarter of $77 million was related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Within the segment revenues, advertising declined around 12% or down 11% in local currency. The 53rd week impacted advertising by $33 million, excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, advertising fell 6%.  Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 9% or 6% in local currency. The 53rd week contributed $39 million and accounted for the vast majority of decline this quarter. Excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, circulation revenues rose 1%.
News and Information Services' reported segment EBITDA this quarter was $103 million, down 36% versus the prior period. The decline was primarily driven by lower print advertising revenues, a timing shift at News America Marketing between Q3 and Q4 of this year, which I highlighted last quarter, and the impact of the 53rd week.
I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operating divisions and excluding the 53rd week.
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenue declined 14% versus the prior year period, fairly similar to the third quarter rate but better than the first half rate. Digital accounted for approximately 37% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter. We again saw strong paid volume growth at the Wall Street Journal where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.3 million, a 12% year-over-year increase driven by higher digital-only subscriptions, which rose 34% versus the prior year.
Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones accelerated to 10%, up from mid-single digits last quarter, driven by volume gains and higher subscription pricing at The Wall Street Journal. Importantly, the growth rate this quarter was the highest level achieved since fiscal 2011.  In July, The Wall Street Journal increased subscription prices to new customers by $2 to $5 per month depending on the bundle and also increased cover prices by $1 for both the Monday to Friday and the weekend edition.
Professional information business revenues were flat in the fourth quarter but grew modestly excluding foreign currency, as the year-over-year growth at risk and compliance accelerated to around 30%. Importantly, the pipelines for new business at the professional information business is encouraging, giving us increased confidence that growth can be sustained into fiscal 2018.
On cost initiatives, Dow Jones realized about $60 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 related to The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative and is on track to achieve at least $100 million in underlying cost savings on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018. Cost reductions are across operations, advertising and the newsroom, which is being streamlined to be digital and mobile-first.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 1% or 2% in local currency helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding that and the sale of The Sunday Times in Perth, advertising declined approximately 10% in local currency, similar to the prior quarter.  Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 1% or were flat in local currency as the acquisition of ARM, cover price increases and higher-paid digital subscribers were offset by print volume declines and the sale of The Sunday Times.
We are making progress with digital subscriptions in Australia as well.  Robert mentioned the turnaround at The Australian partly due to the success of its digital subscription offering, which now has over 95,000 subscribers. Across the News Australia masthead, we now have approximately 360,000 paid subscribers including the ARM properties, over 30% higher from the prior year.
We are continuing our assessment of the cost structure at News Australia. While we achieved approximately $40 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017, it is clear that more work needs to be done particularly given our reliance on print in that market. We expect ongoing cost reductions in fiscal 2018 while continuing to drive our digital transition. Additionally, with the integration of ARM, we continue to look at our broader regional community newspapers to ensure the optimal operational and cost structure exists.
At News U.K., advertising revenue trends are similar to last quarter as the results were likely impacted by the general election and the Euro championships last year. Circulation revenues at News U.K. were down 14% or modestly year-over-year in local currency, primarily due to the lower print volume and no newsstand price increase at The Sun this year as compared to the prior year, partially offset by growth at The Times.  Trends at The Times remained positive with print volumes up low single digits this quarter. As Robert mentioned, digital subscribers at The Times and The Sunday Times is up over 10% this quarter versus the last year to 201,000.  At The Sun, the average monthly unique users reached 81 million in the fourth quarter, more than doubling versus the prior year and hitting a record of 85 million in June, as we continue to build audience to drive and improve monetization.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were down 8%, partially related to the shift in timing of in-store products, as mentioned last quarter, and 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues for the quarter decreased 6% to $407 million, mostly due to the 53rd-week negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and declines in the children's division, which faced a difficult prior year comparative. Segment EBITDA decreased 22% to $39 million due to lower revenues, higher compensation expense and write-off related to a few new releases this year. Titles to highlight this quarter include Michael Crichton's Dragon Teeth as well as carryover sales from J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young's Jesus Always. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 20% of consumer revenues compared to 19% in the prior year due to strength in digital audio.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $22 million or 10% to $251 million. And adjusted revenues increased 16%, which excludes the impact from divestment of REA's European business and Move's TigerLead as well as currency impacts and acquisitions. Total reported segment EBITDA was $87 million versus $175 million last year with last year reflecting the gain from the settlement of Zillow. Excluding the Zillow settlement, acquisitions, divestments and currency movements, adjusted segment EBITDA growth was 67%. 
REA Group revenue grew 7% due to improved product mix including higher penetration for [ Premier All ] and higher yield. The growth was partially offset by a $10 million or 8% decline in revenue resulting from the divestment of the European businesses.
Similar to last quarter, REA will report results that present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a larger-than-usual variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Their call will commence shortly after the conclusion of this call.
REA recently acquired a majority stake in Smartline, one of the leading mortgage brokers in Australia, and entered into a strategic partnership with the National Australia Bank. Part of REA's strategy is to integrate property and finance search to better capture value for lead volume.
Move revenues rose approximately 10% to $108 million versus the prior year, again driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher lead volume and improved pricing optimization and higher non-listing Media revenues. TigerLead, which was divested in November, contributed $4 million in the prior year, and the 53rd revenue contribution was $6 million. Excluding those items, revenue growth would have been approximately 23%.
We also grew customers and yields while also posting accelerated lead volume. As expected, realtor contributed to segment EBITDA this quarter and for the full year. And we expect to build on that momentum in fiscal 2018. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong up 9% year-over-year to 58 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased $7 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter due to the $10 million impact from the 53rd week in the prior year and lower subscriber revenues, mostly offset by the addition of the Australian News channel, the operator of Australia's Sky News networks, and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 4% to $24 million driven by lower programming costs.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $19 million this quarter compared to equity income of $5 million last year. Our equity loss pickup this quarter included an $11 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of 
Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network, which has moved into voluntary administration and a further $3 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.  Foxtel revenues for the quarter declined 3% to $600 million. EBITDA decreased 9% to $150 million and was down 10% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and higher programming costs, principally related to the new AFL contract.
Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, which was lower than the prior year primarily due to the shutdown of Presto. In the fourth quarter, Foxtel Play was relaunched as Foxtel Now, which was supported by a new marketing campaign alongside the relaunch of the Foxtel brand. Including Foxtel Now, total subscribers increased modestly versus the third quarter. In the coming months, Foxtel plans to launch an IP dedicated box, which will include a tuner for access to free to air along with enhanced guided user interface. 
In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 13.3% from 14% last year, the first year-over-year improvement since the second quarter of last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% to around AUD 86.
And finally, for the full year fiscal 2017, capital expenditures from continuing operations were flat at $256 million.
Heading into the new fiscal year, there are a few points that I would like to note. At News and Information Services, overall ad trends at this point for our key mastheads remained stable with the fourth quarter, although we had seen a slight improvement at Dow Jones. The first quarter should benefit from the increased subscription prices at Dow Jones that I mentioned earlier as well as increased cover prices in the U.K. and Australia. We assume continued print declines into fiscal 2018, that will aggressively seek out cost reductions. Dow Jones will continue with their 2020 program. And the Australian business continues to transform its cost base as it reinvests the digital growth.
Fox Sports Australia will face an incremental AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million in higher rights costs mostly related to the new NRL contract. We expect to offset much of that from operating efficiencies and a higher affiliates' revenue.
On Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution relatively stable. The pipeline for the year looks strong with releases from key authors such as Ree Drummond, Daniel Silva, Karin Slaughter, Chip and Joanna Gaines, Bernard Cornwell, Victoria Aveyard, Erin Hunter, and Donna Hay.
At Digital Real Estate Services, we continue to expect strong revenue and EBITDA contribution from both REA and Move. At Move, we are pleased with the progress at realtor.com, particularly the revenue improvement in the second half of fiscal 2017 and want to build on that momentum this year. We will continue to roll out our Advantage product, our listing agent offering, to the balance of our customers in the first half of the year and remain focused on further site enhancements to drive audience growth. REA should benefit from higher pricing, continued penetration of listing [indiscernible] products and increased revenue from the expansion into mortgage brokering for which the company has provided some guidance. Given these trends, we expect to see improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And so that is continuing well. I think it's fair to say on the digital advertising front that in the last half of the fiscal, we didn't see the growth that we wanted.

They -- it's not just about accounting, it's also about accountability. So we will continue to push for a subscription mechanic that makes sense for them but certainly makes sense for newspaper masthead's. And that would frankly benefit us.

Fiscal 2017 was an important year for News Corp as we posted tangible improvement in profitability powered by the fast-growing Digital Real Estate Services segment. And we monetized premium content while continuing our commitment to increase operating efficiencies.
Since our reincarnation, we have been assertively digital and have led the global debate on the value of content by word and by deed at a time of profound change in our markets and in society. That strategy continues to pay off as evidenced by our full year operating results and by the broadening debate for which News Corp has been a catalyst. We are more than sum of our parts. Our acquisitions in digital development have changed the composition of the company but enhanced the personality and principles that have defined us since the conception of the original News Corporation.
Revenues were relatively stable this year at over $8.1 billion despite the lost free print advertising headwinds and an extra week in the prior year. But importantly, total segment EBITDA improved to $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year, which included litigation settlement charges and gains. Even absent those settlements and other items, adjusted total segment EBITDA expanded 5%.  For the quarter, we took significant impairments, as we recognized the challenges facing print and oriented the company towards the future. Susan will provide you with further details.
In the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the Zillow settlement, digital real estate continued to deliver on its potential not only as a strong source of growth but also in its rapidly expanding contribution to overall adjusted EBITDA. At both REA and Move, we are pleased to see increased traffic, improved engagement and continuing revenue growth, particularly at realtor.com, where Move is making positive contributions to segment EBITDA. From a lagging #3 player in the U.S. market, realtor.com has become the most engaged with audiences and the most important source of leads for realtors.
We are still far from satisfied with our progress, as we firmly believe that the U.S. digital property market is still in an early phase of its evolution and expect many more years of strong audience and revenue growth. In December, realtor rolled out Advantage, a state-of-the-art listing agent product, capturing real-time feedback about potential leads and providing more-targeted ad prominence for properties. The company also unveiled new technological advances with its use of image recognition and augmented reality to highlight listing details on smartphones via its Sign Snap and Street Peek products. We are very conscious of the key role of realtors and do not seek to disintermediate them as is clearly the aspiration of some companies in the sector.  Just this week, realtor.com was pleased to enter an agreement with the Real Estate Board of New York to provide a direct syndicated feed of listings from more than 600 brokerage form -- firms in New York City, further expanding our presence in that important market.
REA continues to outperform the competition in Australia. In June, achieving a record market share of 74% against domain and 7.8x higher time spent on the site. REA is also enhancing engagement through new products as well as through the creation of compelling content relevant to buyers, sellers and agents.
During the year, we divested REA's European operations, renewing our focus on core markets in Australia and East Asia. And we recently expanded into the complementary mortgage business with the acquisition of Smartline. That acquisition along with a strategic partnership with NAB allows REA to tap into a $400 billion a year home loan market.
Also in fiscal 2017, News Corp's standing as the world's largest digital real estate business was bolstered through the merger of Housing.com and PropTiger.com, creating India's most comprehensive digital real estate platform. That market is at an early stage of its development. So we see an important role in ensuring that all families in India have access to accurate listings and insightful information when making such a crucial investment.
Some of the highlights excluding the impact of the extra week last year were: The Wall Street Journal saw strong digital growth, ending with nearly 1.3 million digital subscribers, representing 56% of the journal's total paid subscribers, up almost 70% in the past 2 years. In fact at Dow Jones, we saw 10% circulation revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the largest in it has experienced since fiscal 2011. Meanwhile, the teams streamlined print costs and reinvested in digital through the implementation of our WSJ 2020 strategy. In total, digital accounted for 65% of Dow Jones' full year revenues.
Our professional information business has gained in strength with risk and compliance delivering a strong performance and a healthy sales pipeline. For the year, risk and compliance revenues rose over 20% with close to 30% growth year-on-year in Q4, and we expect even higher growth in fiscal '18.
At the New York Post, digital ad revenue more than offset declines in print advertising for 2 straight fiscal years. The Post has also had success in monetizing mobile with 41% of digital ad revenue coming from mobile in fiscal 2017. We are sharing lessons about mobile successes and techniques around the entire company with far greater rapidity and alacrity.
While print advertising remains challenged across the newspaper industry, our emerging digital advertising platform, News IQ, will help us meet the needs of advertisers through precise and permissioned customer data from our monthly unique U.S. audience of over 110 million people.  We strongly believe that for advertisers, our ability to deliver premium content in a prestige environment will set us apart from the polluted platforms and commodified content. We will have more details for you about the formal launch of News IQ in coming months.
On the other side of the globe, we saw particular success at The Australian, where readership virgined to nearly 0.5 million a day as of May, resulting in higher revenues and EBITDA. The blossoming of The Australian reflects the immense value of excellent journalism and the importance of strong editorial leadership. Meanwhile, news.com.au is the #1 news brand in Australia according to Nielsen. And taste.com.au is Australia's foremost food site. Overall, News Corp Australia remains the country's largest print and digital publisher and, including REA, reaches more than 16.1 million Australians each month.
In the U.K., The Times was the only national newspaper to show print circulation growth in the fourth quarter. In fact, subscriptions to those Times and The Sunday Times reached an all-time high of nearly 0.5 million as of June 30. And on the digital front, The Times and The Sunday Times are hosting over 200,000 digital-only subscribers representing 45% of its paid subscriber base and growth of 10% for the quarter versus the prior year. Digitally, The Sun is fast closing the gap with The Mail in the U.K., more than doubling our global monthly unique visitors in the past year to reach a record 85 million in June. The integration of Wireless Group, which connected The Sun sports devotees with its flagship station, talkSPORT, is proceeding, and the complementarity between the platforms is already clear. This year, talkSPORT won the radio rights for the English Football League, making it the biggest holder of exclusive English football rights among U.K. broadcasters. And we'll also deploy Wireless Group's expertise to improve the quality of our audio products around the company.
News America Marketing stabilized its business this year, thanks to the impressive performance of its in-store products. There is no doubt, retailers are under pressure from digital competition. And providing an enhanced in-store experience is an imperative. Meanwhile, Checkout 51 comfortably surpassed its goal of reaching 10 million users during this year. At year-end, the company boasted a valuable digital membership base of over 14 million strong and growing. That is triple the number of members at acquisition in July 2015.
Book Publishing has flourished, as HarperCollins showed its understanding of the American heartland, underscored by best-selling titles such as The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines and J.D Vance's Hillbilly Elegy. We also saw digital audio sales increase by 47% year-over-year and expanded our foreign language footprint, an important driver for long-term growth, as we seek to exploit our bestsellers across languages and borders. The rise of audiobooks is a particularly notable trend highlighted by the success of Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a (Expletive), which has audio sales of over 470,000 and print of over 490,000, showing the power of savvy, self-help books and of the audio genre.
Returning to Australia. Fox Sports Australia secured its market-leading position through the extension of A-League soccer rights and successfully launched the FOX LEAGUE channel, its dedicated Rugby league offering. Foxtel has undergone a major brand refresh, which has coincided with the rollout of Foxtel Now, a streaming service with premium content and multiple price points. Foxtel will complement that with the launch of a dedicated, low-cost IP box in the coming months, while the improved iQ3 state-of-the-art set-top box is showing encouraging results. In the fourth quarter, total subscribers at Foxtel including IP improved slightly from the third quarter. And we saw an improvement in cable satellite churn.
One other area I would like to mention in this review of fiscal 2017 is the global impact of our principled stand on intellectual property and the responsibility of the digital duopoly. It is crucial that algorithms are not used to discriminate against quality journalism, and that societies have an informed debate about potential algorithmic abuse. As a result of our efforts, we have begun working with Facebook and Google on a subscription mechanic, one which could help bring more readers to our mastheads and fundamentally change the content ecosystem.
In conclusion, reflecting on the quarter and the year, we are more confident than ever in the power of content and connectivity. Whether it's the news of the day, the match of the week, the book of the year or the home of a lifetime, we are dedicated to informing and inspiring our readers and our partners. And in an age of digital opacity, we are committed to making markets more transparent and more lucrative for our advertisers and allies. Our newer businesses have brought much innovation and energy to the company. And our ability to drive growth is patent and potent. Even so, we are not complacent. We will continuously drive our digital businesses and build our brands. As custodians of the company with the proudest of histories, we know that the past is a platform for the future. For these reasons and more, we're looking forward to the coming year with much confidence in the prospects for shareholders and for our partners.
And with that, I'll pass it to our CFO, Susan Panuccio."

News Corp's expansion into digital real estate is poised to reshape our long-term growth. We posted very strong operating results this quarter at both REA and at Move. In this quarter, the segment accounted for 40% of total segment EBITDA even while investing in developing markets. And as a point of reference, our revenue in this segment has nearly tripled since separation and is approaching $1 billion annually. We think there is a good long-term tailwind to the segment and see further revenue opportunity beyond the core property search.
We are making progress transitioning News and Information Services to digital. We have seen increased evidence that our quality newspapers, the Wall Street Journal, The Times of London and The Australian have a clear digital path. All 3 now have digital paid subscribers that are approaching or are, in the case of The Wall Street Journal, beyond 50% of total subscribers. And they're showing solid growth in paid volumes and improving circulation revenues.
We are continuing to right size the cost base by removing legacy costs at News and Information Services. However, I believe this is more we can do as I mentioned last quarter, which I'll discuss shortly.
With that, I would like to now discuss our financial results.  For the full year fiscal 2017, total revenues were $8.1 billion, a 2% decline compared to the prior year. You will recall that the prior year had a 53rd week, which positively impacted fiscal 2016 revenues by $112 million.
Reported total segment EBITDA for the year was $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year. As a reminder, the prior year included a one-time charge of $280 million for the settlement at News America Marketing and the one-time gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the settlement, the impact of currency, the legal costs related to the U.K. newspaper matters as well as acquisitions and divestments, rose 5%.
During the full year, we had significant non-recurring items impacting earnings per share. These included pretax noncash impairment charges of $785 million, principally related to the fixed asset write-down at The Australian and the U.K. publishing businesses. In addition, equity earnings of affiliates included a pretax write-down of $227 million to reduce our carrying value of Foxtel. These were offset in part by a pretax gain of $107 million at REA from the sale of their European businesses and an improvement in the full year operating results. As a result of these items, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $1.27 compared to $0.28 in the prior year. Again, as a reminder, earnings per share in the prior year benefited from a lower tax expense due in large part the release of U.S. tax asset valuation allowances associated with the divestment of Amplify. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.36 versus $0.40 in the prior year. 
And now for the quarterly financial detail. We reported fiscal 2017 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, down approximately 7% versus the prior year. Again, prior year revenues included $112 million impact from the 53rd week.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to $361 million in the prior year, which included $122 million gain related to the Zillow settlement and the benefit of the extra week. Excluding the Zillow settlement gain, last year's EBITDA would have been $239 million.
For the quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $0.74 compared to $0.16 in the prior year, with the prior year benefiting from the Zillow settlement gain. Results this quarter include a noncash impairment charge of $464 million primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets of the U.K. newspaper group. Taking these into account, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.11 versus $0.10 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined 10% compared to the prior year to $1.3 billion. Over half of the revenue shortfall, this quarter of $77 million was related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Within the segment revenues, advertising declined around 12% or down 11% in local currency. The 53rd week impacted advertising by $33 million, excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, advertising fell 6%.  Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 9% or 6% in local currency. The 53rd week contributed $39 million and accounted for the vast majority of decline this quarter. Excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, circulation revenues rose 1%.
News and Information Services' reported segment EBITDA this quarter was $103 million, down 36% versus the prior period. The decline was primarily driven by lower print advertising revenues, a timing shift at News America Marketing between Q3 and Q4 of this year, which I highlighted last quarter, and the impact of the 53rd week.
I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operating divisions and excluding the 53rd week.
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenue declined 14% versus the prior year period, fairly similar to the third quarter rate but better than the first half rate. Digital accounted for approximately 37% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter. We again saw strong paid volume growth at the Wall Street Journal where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.3 million, a 12% year-over-year increase driven by higher digital-only subscriptions, which rose 34% versus the prior year.
Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones accelerated to 10%, up from mid-single digits last quarter, driven by volume gains and higher subscription pricing at The Wall Street Journal. Importantly, the growth rate this quarter was the highest level achieved since fiscal 2011.  In July, The Wall Street Journal increased subscription prices to new customers by $2 to $5 per month depending on the bundle and also increased cover prices by $1 for both the Monday to Friday and the weekend edition.
Professional information business revenues were flat in the fourth quarter but grew modestly excluding foreign currency, as the year-over-year growth at risk and compliance accelerated to around 30%. Importantly, the pipelines for new business at the professional information business is encouraging, giving us increased confidence that growth can be sustained into fiscal 2018.
On cost initiatives, Dow Jones realized about $60 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 related to The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative and is on track to achieve at least $100 million in underlying cost savings on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018. Cost reductions are across operations, advertising and the newsroom, which is being streamlined to be digital and mobile-first.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 1% or 2% in local currency helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding that and the sale of The Sunday Times in Perth, advertising declined approximately 10% in local currency, similar to the prior quarter.  Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 1% or were flat in local currency as the acquisition of ARM, cover price increases and higher-paid digital subscribers were offset by print volume declines and the sale of The Sunday Times.
We are making progress with digital subscriptions in Australia as well.  Robert mentioned the turnaround at The Australian partly due to the success of its digital subscription offering, which now has over 95,000 subscribers. Across the News Australia masthead, we now have approximately 360,000 paid subscribers including the ARM properties, over 30% higher from the prior year.
We are continuing our assessment of the cost structure at News Australia. While we achieved approximately $40 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017, it is clear that more work needs to be done particularly given our reliance on print in that market. We expect ongoing cost reductions in fiscal 2018 while continuing to drive our digital transition. Additionally, with the integration of ARM, we continue to look at our broader regional community newspapers to ensure the optimal operational and cost structure exists.
At News U.K., advertising revenue trends are similar to last quarter as the results were likely impacted by the general election and the Euro championships last year. Circulation revenues at News U.K. were down 14% or modestly year-over-year in local currency, primarily due to the lower print volume and no newsstand price increase at The Sun this year as compared to the prior year, partially offset by growth at The Times.  Trends at The Times remained positive with print volumes up low single digits this quarter. As Robert mentioned, digital subscribers at The Times and The Sunday Times is up over 10% this quarter versus the last year to 201,000.  At The Sun, the average monthly unique users reached 81 million in the fourth quarter, more than doubling versus the prior year and hitting a record of 85 million in June, as we continue to build audience to drive and improve monetization.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were down 8%, partially related to the shift in timing of in-store products, as mentioned last quarter, and 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues for the quarter decreased 6% to $407 million, mostly due to the 53rd-week negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and declines in the children's division, which faced a difficult prior year comparative. Segment EBITDA decreased 22% to $39 million due to lower revenues, higher compensation expense and write-off related to a few new releases this year. Titles to highlight this quarter include Michael Crichton's Dragon Teeth as well as carryover sales from J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young's Jesus Always. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 20% of consumer revenues compared to 19% in the prior year due to strength in digital audio.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $22 million or 10% to $251 million. And adjusted revenues increased 16%, which excludes the impact from divestment of REA's European business and Move's TigerLead as well as currency impacts and acquisitions. Total reported segment EBITDA was $87 million versus $175 million last year with last year reflecting the gain from the settlement of Zillow. Excluding the Zillow settlement, acquisitions, divestments and currency movements, adjusted segment EBITDA growth was 67%. 
REA Group revenue grew 7% due to improved product mix including higher penetration for [ Premier All ] and higher yield. The growth was partially offset by a $10 million or 8% decline in revenue resulting from the divestment of the European businesses.
Similar to last quarter, REA will report results that present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a larger-than-usual variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Their call will commence shortly after the conclusion of this call.
REA recently acquired a majority stake in Smartline, one of the leading mortgage brokers in Australia, and entered into a strategic partnership with the National Australia Bank. Part of REA's strategy is to integrate property and finance search to better capture value for lead volume.
Move revenues rose approximately 10% to $108 million versus the prior year, again driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher lead volume and improved pricing optimization and higher non-listing Media revenues. TigerLead, which was divested in November, contributed $4 million in the prior year, and the 53rd revenue contribution was $6 million. Excluding those items, revenue growth would have been approximately 23%.
We also grew customers and yields while also posting accelerated lead volume. As expected, realtor contributed to segment EBITDA this quarter and for the full year. And we expect to build on that momentum in fiscal 2018. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong up 9% year-over-year to 58 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased $7 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter due to the $10 million impact from the 53rd week in the prior year and lower subscriber revenues, mostly offset by the addition of the Australian News channel, the operator of Australia's Sky News networks, and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 4% to $24 million driven by lower programming costs.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $19 million this quarter compared to equity income of $5 million last year. Our equity loss pickup this quarter included an $11 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of 
Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network, which has moved into voluntary administration and a further $3 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.  Foxtel revenues for the quarter declined 3% to $600 million. EBITDA decreased 9% to $150 million and was down 10% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and higher programming costs, principally related to the new AFL contract.
Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, which was lower than the prior year primarily due to the shutdown of Presto. In the fourth quarter, Foxtel Play was relaunched as Foxtel Now, which was supported by a new marketing campaign alongside the relaunch of the Foxtel brand. Including Foxtel Now, total subscribers increased modestly versus the third quarter. In the coming months, Foxtel plans to launch an IP dedicated box, which will include a tuner for access to free to air along with enhanced guided user interface. 
In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 13.3% from 14% last year, the first year-over-year improvement since the second quarter of last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% to around AUD 86.
And finally, for the full year fiscal 2017, capital expenditures from continuing operations were flat at $256 million.
Heading into the new fiscal year, there are a few points that I would like to note. At News and Information Services, overall ad trends at this point for our key mastheads remained stable with the fourth quarter, although we had seen a slight improvement at Dow Jones. The first quarter should benefit from the increased subscription prices at Dow Jones that I mentioned earlier as well as increased cover prices in the U.K. and Australia. We assume continued print declines into fiscal 2018, that will aggressively seek out cost reductions. Dow Jones will continue with their 2020 program. And the Australian business continues to transform its cost base as it reinvests the digital growth.
Fox Sports Australia will face an incremental AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million in higher rights costs mostly related to the new NRL contract. We expect to offset much of that from operating efficiencies and a higher affiliates' revenue.
On Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution relatively stable. The pipeline for the year looks strong with releases from key authors such as Ree Drummond, Daniel Silva, Karin Slaughter, Chip and Joanna Gaines, Bernard Cornwell, Victoria Aveyard, Erin Hunter, and Donna Hay.
At Digital Real Estate Services, we continue to expect strong revenue and EBITDA contribution from both REA and Move. At Move, we are pleased with the progress at realtor.com, particularly the revenue improvement in the second half of fiscal 2017 and want to build on that momentum this year. We will continue to roll out our Advantage product, our listing agent offering, to the balance of our customers in the first half of the year and remain focused on further site enhancements to drive audience growth. REA should benefit from higher pricing, continued penetration of listing [indiscernible] products and increased revenue from the expansion into mortgage brokering for which the company has provided some guidance. Given these trends, we expect to see improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

Fiscal 2017 was an important year for News Corp as we posted tangible improvement in profitability powered by the fast-growing Digital Real Estate Services segment. And we monetized premium content while continuing our commitment to increase operating efficiencies.
Since our reincarnation, we have been assertively digital and have led the global debate on the value of content by word and by deed at a time of profound change in our markets and in society. That strategy continues to pay off as evidenced by our full year operating results and by the broadening debate for which News Corp has been a catalyst. We are more than sum of our parts. Our acquisitions in digital development have changed the composition of the company but enhanced the personality and principles that have defined us since the conception of the original News Corporation.
Revenues were relatively stable this year at over $8.1 billion despite the lost free print advertising headwinds and an extra week in the prior year. But importantly, total segment EBITDA improved to $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year, which included litigation settlement charges and gains. Even absent those settlements and other items, adjusted total segment EBITDA expanded 5%.  For the quarter, we took significant impairments, as we recognized the challenges facing print and oriented the company towards the future. Susan will provide you with further details.
In the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the Zillow settlement, digital real estate continued to deliver on its potential not only as a strong source of growth but also in its rapidly expanding contribution to overall adjusted EBITDA. At both REA and Move, we are pleased to see increased traffic, improved engagement and continuing revenue growth, particularly at realtor.com, where Move is making positive contributions to segment EBITDA. From a lagging #3 player in the U.S. market, realtor.com has become the most engaged with audiences and the most important source of leads for realtors.
We are still far from satisfied with our progress, as we firmly believe that the U.S. digital property market is still in an early phase of its evolution and expect many more years of strong audience and revenue growth. In December, realtor rolled out Advantage, a state-of-the-art listing agent product, capturing real-time feedback about potential leads and providing more-targeted ad prominence for properties. The company also unveiled new technological advances with its use of image recognition and augmented reality to highlight listing details on smartphones via its Sign Snap and Street Peek products. We are very conscious of the key role of realtors and do not seek to disintermediate them as is clearly the aspiration of some companies in the sector.  Just this week, realtor.com was pleased to enter an agreement with the Real Estate Board of New York to provide a direct syndicated feed of listings from more than 600 brokerage form -- firms in New York City, further expanding our presence in that important market.
REA continues to outperform the competition in Australia. In June, achieving a record market share of 74% against domain and 7.8x higher time spent on the site. REA is also enhancing engagement through new products as well as through the creation of compelling content relevant to buyers, sellers and agents.
During the year, we divested REA's European operations, renewing our focus on core markets in Australia and East Asia. And we recently expanded into the complementary mortgage business with the acquisition of Smartline. That acquisition along with a strategic partnership with NAB allows REA to tap into a $400 billion a year home loan market.
Also in fiscal 2017, News Corp's standing as the world's largest digital real estate business was bolstered through the merger of Housing.com and PropTiger.com, creating India's most comprehensive digital real estate platform. That market is at an early stage of its development. So we see an important role in ensuring that all families in India have access to accurate listings and insightful information when making such a crucial investment.
Some of the highlights excluding the impact of the extra week last year were: The Wall Street Journal saw strong digital growth, ending with nearly 1.3 million digital subscribers, representing 56% of the journal's total paid subscribers, up almost 70% in the past 2 years. In fact at Dow Jones, we saw 10% circulation revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the largest in it has experienced since fiscal 2011. Meanwhile, the teams streamlined print costs and reinvested in digital through the implementation of our WSJ 2020 strategy. In total, digital accounted for 55% of Dow Jones' full year revenues.
Our professional information business has gained in strength with risk and compliance delivering a strong performance and a healthy sales pipeline. For the year, risk and compliance revenues rose over 20% with close to 30% growth year-on-year in Q4, and we expect even higher growth in fiscal '18.
At the New York Post, digital ad revenue more than offset declines in print advertising for 2 straight fiscal years. The Post has also had success in monetizing mobile with 41% of digital ad revenue coming from mobile in fiscal 2017. We are sharing lessons about mobile successes and techniques around the entire company with far greater rapidity and alacrity.
While print advertising remains challenged across the newspaper industry, our emerging digital advertising platform, News IQ, will help us meet the needs of advertisers through precise and permissioned customer data from our monthly unique U.S. audience of over 110 million people.  We strongly believe that for advertisers, our ability to deliver premium content in a prestige environment will set us apart from the polluted platforms and commodified content. We will have more details for you about the formal launch of News IQ in coming months.
On the other side of the globe, we saw particular success at The Australian, where readership virgined to nearly 0.5 million a day as of May, resulting in higher revenues and EBITDA. The blossoming of The Australian reflects the immense value of excellent journalism and the importance of strong editorial leadership. Meanwhile, news.com.au is the #1 news brand in Australia according to Nielsen. And taste.com.au is Australia's foremost food site. Overall, News Corp Australia remains the country's largest print and digital publisher and, including REA, reaches more than 16.1 million Australians each month.
In the U.K., The Times was the only national newspaper to show print circulation growth in the fourth quarter. In fact, subscriptions to those Times and The Sunday Times reached an all-time high of nearly 0.5 million as of June 30. And on the digital front, The Times and The Sunday Times are hosting over 200,000 digital-only subscribers representing 45% of its paid subscriber base and growth of 10% for the quarter versus the prior year. Digitally, The Sun is fast closing the gap with The Mail in the U.K., more than doubling our global monthly unique visitors in the past year to reach a record 85 million in June. The integration of Wireless Group, which connected The Sun sports devotees with its flagship station, talkSPORT, is proceeding, and the complementarity between the platforms is already clear. This year, talkSPORT won the radio rights for the English Football League, making it the biggest holder of exclusive English football rights among U.K. broadcasters. And we'll also deploy Wireless Group's expertise to improve the quality of our audio products around the company.
News America Marketing stabilized its business this year, thanks to the impressive performance of its in-store products. There is no doubt, retailers are under pressure from digital competition. And providing an enhanced in-store experience is an imperative. Meanwhile, Checkout 51 comfortably surpassed its goal of reaching 10 million users during this year. At year-end, the company boasted a valuable digital membership base of over 14 million strong and growing. That is triple the number of members at acquisition in July 2015.
Book Publishing has flourished, as HarperCollins showed its understanding of the American heartland, underscored by best-selling titles such as The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines and J.D Vance's Hillbilly Elegy. We also saw digital audio sales increase by 47% year-over-year and expanded our foreign language footprint, an important driver for long-term growth, as we seek to exploit our bestsellers across languages and borders. The rise of audiobooks is a particularly notable trend highlighted by the success of Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving a (Expletive), which has audio sales of over 470,000 and print of over 490,000, showing the power of savvy, self-help books and of the audio genre.
Returning to Australia. Fox Sports Australia secured its market-leading position through the extension of A-League soccer rights and successfully launched the FOX LEAGUE channel, its dedicated Rugby league offering. Foxtel has undergone a major brand refresh, which has coincided with the rollout of Foxtel Now, a streaming service with premium content and multiple price points. Foxtel will complement that with the launch of a dedicated, low-cost IP box in the coming months, while the improved iQ3 state-of-the-art set-top box is showing encouraging results. In the fourth quarter, total subscribers at Foxtel including IP improved slightly from the third quarter. And we saw an improvement in cable satellite churn.
One other area I would like to mention in this review of fiscal 2017 is the global impact of our principled stand on intellectual property and the responsibility of the digital duopoly. It is crucial that algorithms are not used to discriminate against quality journalism, and that societies have an informed debate about potential algorithmic abuse. As a result of our efforts, we have begun working with Facebook and Google on a subscription mechanic, one which could help bring more readers to our mastheads and fundamentally change the content ecosystem.
In conclusion, reflecting on the quarter and the year, we are more confident than ever in the power of content and connectivity. Whether it's the news of the day, the match of the week, the book of the year or the home of a lifetime, we are dedicated to informing and inspiring our readers and our partners. And in an age of digital opacity, we are committed to making markets more transparent and more lucrative for our advertisers and allies. Our newer businesses have brought much innovation and energy to the company. And our ability to drive growth is patent and potent. Even so, we are not complacent. We will continuously drive our digital businesses and build our brands. As custodians of the company with the proudest of histories, we know that the past is a platform for the future. For these reasons and more, we're looking forward to the coming year with much confidence in the prospects for shareholders and for our partners.

News Corp's expansion into digital real estate is poised to reshape our long-term growth. We posted very strong operating results this quarter at both REA and at Move. In this quarter, the segment accounted for 40% of total segment EBITDA even while investing in developing markets. And as a point of reference, our revenue in this segment has nearly tripled since separation and is approaching $1 billion annually. We think there is a good long-term tailwind to the segment and see further revenue opportunity beyond the core property search.
We are making progress transitioning News and Information Services to digital. We have seen increased evidence that our quality newspapers, the Wall Street Journal, The Times of London and The Australian have a clear digital path. All 3 now have digital paid subscribers that are approaching or are, in the case of The Wall Street Journal, beyond 50% of total subscribers. And they're showing solid growth in paid volumes and improving circulation revenues.
We are continuing to right size the cost base by removing legacy costs at News and Information Services. However, I believe this is more we can do as I mentioned last quarter, which I'll discuss shortly.
With that, I would like to now discuss our financial results.  For the full year fiscal 2017, total revenues were $8.1 billion, a 2% decline compared to the prior year. You will recall that the prior year had a 53rd week, which positively impacted fiscal 2016 revenues by $112 million.
Reported total segment EBITDA for the year was $885 million compared to $684 million in the prior year. As a reminder, the prior year included a one-time charge of $280 million for the settlement at News America Marketing and the one-time gain of $122 million related to the Zillow settlement. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the settlement, the impact of currency, the legal costs related to the U.K. newspaper matters as well as acquisitions and divestments, rose 5%.
During the full year, we had significant non-recurring items impacting earnings per share. These included pretax noncash impairment charges of $785 million, principally related to the fixed asset write-down at The Australian and the U.K. publishing businesses. In addition, equity earnings of affiliates included a pretax write-down of $227 million to reduce our carrying value of Foxtel. These were offset in part by a pretax gain of $107 million at REA from the sale of their European businesses and an improvement in the full year operating results. As a result of these items, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $1.27 compared to $0.28 in the prior year. Again, as a reminder, earnings per share in the prior year benefited from a lower tax expense due in large part the release of U.S. tax asset valuation allowances associated with the divestment of Amplify. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.36 versus $0.40 in the prior year. 
And now for the quarterly financial detail. We reported fiscal 2017 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, down approximately 7% versus the prior year. Again, prior year revenues included $112 million impact from the 53rd week.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to $361 million in the prior year, which included $122 million gain related to the Zillow settlement and the benefit of the extra week. Excluding the Zillow settlement gain, last year's EBITDA would have been $239 million.
For the quarter, earnings per share from continuing operations were negative $0.74 compared to $0.16 in the prior year, with the prior year benefiting from the Zillow settlement gain. Results this quarter include a noncash impairment charge of $464 million primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets of the U.K. newspaper group. Taking these into account, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.11 versus $0.10 in the prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined 10% compared to the prior year to $1.3 billion. Over half of the revenue shortfall, this quarter of $77 million was related to the 53rd week in the prior year. Within the segment revenues, advertising declined around 12% or down 11% in local currency. The 53rd week impacted advertising by $33 million, excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, advertising fell 6%.  Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 9% or 6% in local currency. The 53rd week contributed $39 million and accounted for the vast majority of decline this quarter. Excluding the 53rd week and currency impact, circulation revenues rose 1%.
News and Information Services' reported segment EBITDA this quarter was $103 million, down 36% versus the prior period. The decline was primarily driven by lower print advertising revenues, a timing shift at News America Marketing between Q3 and Q4 of this year, which I highlighted last quarter, and the impact of the 53rd week.
I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operating divisions and excluding the 53rd week.
At Dow Jones, total advertising revenue declined 14% versus the prior year period, fairly similar to the third quarter rate but better than the first half rate. Digital accounted for approximately 37% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter. We again saw strong paid volume growth at the Wall Street Journal where total subscriber volume across all formats reached 2.3 million, a 12% year-over-year increase driven by higher digital-only subscriptions, which rose 34% versus the prior year.
Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones accelerated to 10%, up from mid-single digits last quarter, driven by volume gains and higher subscription pricing at The Wall Street Journal. Importantly, the growth rate this quarter was the highest level achieved since fiscal 2011.  In July, The Wall Street Journal increased subscription prices to new customers by $2 to $5 per month depending on the bundle and also increased cover prices by $1 for both the Monday to Friday and the weekend edition.
Professional information business revenues were flat in the fourth quarter but grew modestly excluding foreign currency, as the year-over-year growth at risk and compliance accelerated to around 30%. Importantly, the pipelines for new business at the professional information business is encouraging, giving us increased confidence that growth can be sustained into fiscal 2018.
On cost initiatives, Dow Jones realized about $60 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 related to The Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative and is on track to achieve at least $100 million in underlying cost savings on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2018. Cost reductions are across operations, advertising and the newsroom, which is being streamlined to be digital and mobile-first.
At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 1% or 2% in local currency helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding that and the sale of The Sunday Times in Perth, advertising declined approximately 10% in local currency, similar to the prior quarter.  Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 1% or were flat in local currency as the acquisition of ARM, cover price increases and higher-paid digital subscribers were offset by print volume declines and the sale of The Sunday Times.
We are making progress with digital subscriptions in Australia as well.  Robert mentioned the turnaround at The Australian partly due to the success of its digital subscription offering, which now has over 95,000 subscribers. Across the News Australia masthead, we now have approximately 360,000 paid subscribers including the ARM properties, over 30% higher from the prior year.
We are continuing our assessment of the cost structure at News Australia. While we achieved approximately $40 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017, it is clear that more work needs to be done particularly given our reliance on print in that market. We expect ongoing cost reductions in fiscal 2018 while continuing to drive our digital transition. Additionally, with the integration of ARM, we continue to look at our broader regional community newspapers to ensure the optimal operational and cost structure exists.
At News U.K., advertising revenue trends are similar to last quarter as the results were likely impacted by the general election and the Euro championships last year. Circulation revenues at News U.K. were down 14% or modestly year-over-year in local currency, primarily due to the lower print volume and no newsstand price increase at The Sun this year as compared to the prior year, partially offset by growth at The Times.  Trends at The Times remained positive with print volumes up low single digits this quarter. As Robert mentioned, digital subscribers at The Times and The Sunday Times is up over 10% this quarter versus the last year to 201,000.  At The Sun, the average monthly unique users reached 81 million in the fourth quarter, more than doubling versus the prior year and hitting a record of 85 million in June, as we continue to build audience to drive and improve monetization.
Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were down 8%, partially related to the shift in timing of in-store products, as mentioned last quarter, and 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year.
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues for the quarter decreased 6% to $407 million, mostly due to the 53rd-week negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and declines in the children's division, which faced a difficult prior year comparative. Segment EBITDA decreased 22% to $39 million due to lower revenues, higher compensation expense and write-off related to a few new releases this year. Titles to highlight this quarter include Michael Crichton's Dragon Teeth as well as carryover sales from J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young's Jesus Always. Total digital revenues for the quarter were 20% of consumer revenues compared to 19% in the prior year due to strength in digital audio.
In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $22 million or 10% to $251 million. And adjusted revenues increased 16%, which excludes the impact from divestment of REA's European business and Move's TigerLead as well as currency impacts and acquisitions. Total reported segment EBITDA was $87 million versus $175 million last year with last year reflecting the gain from the settlement of Zillow. Excluding the Zillow settlement, acquisitions, divestments and currency movements, adjusted segment EBITDA growth was 67%. 
REA Group revenue grew 7% due to improved product mix including higher penetration for [ Premier All ] and higher yield. The growth was partially offset by a $10 million or 8% decline in revenue resulting from the divestment of the European businesses.
Similar to last quarter, REA will report results that present Europe as discontinued operations. So you will see a larger-than-usual variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Their call will commence shortly after the conclusion of this call.
REA recently acquired a majority stake in Smartline, one of the leading mortgage brokers in Australia, and entered into a strategic partnership with the National Australia Bank. Part of REA's strategy is to integrate property and finance search to better capture value for lead volume.
Move revenues rose approximately 10% to $108 million versus the prior year, again driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher lead volume and improved pricing optimization and higher non-listing Media revenues. TigerLead, which was divested in November, contributed $4 million in the prior year, and the 53rd revenue contribution was $6 million. Excluding those items, revenue growth would have been approximately 23%.
We also grew customers and yields while also posting accelerated lead volume. As expected, realtor contributed to segment EBITDA this quarter and for the full year. And we expect to build on that momentum in fiscal 2018. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong up 9% year-over-year to 58 million in the quarter.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues decreased $7 million or 5% compared to the prior year quarter due to the $10 million impact from the 53rd week in the prior year and lower subscriber revenues, mostly offset by the addition of the Australian News channel, the operator of Australia's Sky News networks, and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose 4% to $24 million driven by lower programming costs.
With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $19 million this quarter compared to equity income of $5 million last year. Our equity loss pickup this quarter included an $11 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of 
Foxtel's investment in the Ten Network, which has moved into voluntary administration and a further $3 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind-down. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.  Foxtel revenues for the quarter declined 3% to $600 million. EBITDA decreased 9% to $150 million and was down 10% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and higher programming costs, principally related to the new AFL contract.
Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers, which was lower than the prior year primarily due to the shutdown of Presto. In the fourth quarter, Foxtel Play was relaunched as Foxtel Now, which was supported by a new marketing campaign alongside the relaunch of the Foxtel brand. Including Foxtel Now, total subscribers increased modestly versus the third quarter. In the coming months, Foxtel plans to launch an IP dedicated box, which will include a tuner for access to free to air along with enhanced guided user interface. 
In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 13.3% from 14% last year, the first year-over-year improvement since the second quarter of last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% to around AUD 86.
And finally, for the full year fiscal 2017, capital expenditures from continuing operations were flat at $256 million.
Heading into the new fiscal year, there are a few points that I would like to note. At News and Information Services, overall ad trends at this point for our key mastheads remained stable with the fourth quarter, although we had seen a slight improvement at Dow Jones. The first quarter should benefit from the increased subscription prices at Dow Jones that I mentioned earlier as well as increased cover prices in the U.K. and Australia. We assume continued print declines into fiscal 2018, that will aggressively seek out cost reductions. Dow Jones will continue with their 2020 program. And the Australian business continues to transform its cost base as it reinvests the digital growth.
Fox Sports Australia will face an incremental AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million in higher rights costs mostly related to the new NRL contract. We expect to offset much of that from operating efficiencies and a higher affiliates' revenue.
On Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution relatively stable. The pipeline for the year looks strong with releases from key authors such as Ree Drummond, Daniel Silva, Karin Slaughter, Chip and Joanna Gaines, Bernard Cornwell, Victoria Aveyard, Erin Hunter, and Donna Hay.
At Digital Real Estate Services, we continue to expect strong revenue and EBITDA contribution from both REA and Move. At Move, we are pleased with the progress at realtor.com, particularly the revenue improvement in the second half of fiscal 2017 and want to build on that momentum this year. We will continue to roll out our Advantage product, our listing agent offering, to the balance of our customers in the first half of the year and remain focused on further site enhancements to drive audience growth. REA should benefit from higher pricing, continued penetration of listing [indiscernible] products and increased revenue from the expansion into mortgage brokering for which the company has provided some guidance. Given these trends, we expect to see improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year.
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And so that is continuing well. I think it's fair to say on the digital advertising front that in the last half of the fiscal, we didn't see the growth that we wanted.

But actually for our other papers, our other mastheads as well, there is potential, but it is dependent upon broader changes in the content ecosystem, which is why we've been so insistent that the large digital platforms need to take responsibility for content. They -- it's not just about accounting, it's also about accountability. So we will continue to push for a subscription mechanic that makes sense for them but certainly makes sense for newspaper masthead's. And that would frankly benefit us.

Our new fiscal year is off to a sterling start, with robust results reflecting our steadfast strategy to push global and digital expansion and to create a cogently balanced revenue mix.In the first quarter, revenues and EBITDA increased",1798,"Thank you, Mike. Our new fiscal year is off to a sterling start, with robust results reflecting our steadfast strategy to push global and digital expansion and to create a cogently balanced revenue mix.
In the first quarter, revenues and EBITDA increased across every segment of our business compared to the same quarter last year, with particularly strong growth in Digital Real Estate where we continue to be the world's largest and leading company. In summary, revenues grew 5% to $2.1 billion and reported total segment EBITDA grew 92% to reach $249 million, up from $130 million in the prior year. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 46%. Reported earnings per share grew to $0.12 versus loss of $0.03 in the prior year.
These results truly underscore the increasing strength of digital real estate and how it is possible to fully transform the character of News Corp and positions us for further growth in the future. We can also see the tangible benefits of our sustained commitment to cost reduction while we continue to invest in the highest quality content.
In August, we and Telstra in Australia announced a nonbinding agreement to combine Foxtel and Fox SPORTS, with News Corp owning 65% of the new company. Pending definitive documentation and regulatory approval, we expect to close in the first half of calendar year 2018. Combining Foxtel and Fox SPORTS and providing News Corp with majority control should give us a better opportunity to take advantage of fortified scale to leverage our immensely valuable sports and entertainment rights as well as a boosting our ability to collect permissioned customer data.
We await regulatory approval and discussion over details continues with our partner, Telstra. But once completed, the combined company is expected to make a substantial contribution to our revenue and EBITDA and fundamentally transform the nature of News Corp.
There was another fundamental change last month which also bodes well for our future, and that's other premium use provider. Google said it would end First Click Free, a seemingly innocently titled policy that undermine business models and damage covenants in societies by banishing premium subscription content. As many of you are aware, Rupert Lockman and I, along with our colleagues at News Corp, have long taken a principled and often solitary stand to protect intellectual property and safeguard journalism so we appreciate this significant first step taken by Google. We will, of course, be monitoring the effect of this change across our mastheads even as we continue our discussions with Google and with Facebook about the ways we can profitably connect readers with our mastheads.
We continue to be deeply concerned by the abuse of algorithms and by unadulterated digital ad market, which had promised transparency but has delivered a paucity, undermining the confidence of advertisers in the digital marketplace. It is clear that advertisers want their products to be promoted on sites that enhance, not tarnish, their image and that they want metrics that are reliable, not risible.
And while on the subject of premium content, let us delve into the News and Information segment, which fared well this quarter with digital subscriptions up at The Wall Street Journal and at other mastheads across the company. Despite the continued challenging advertising trends, our cost consciousness and steady circulation growth helped drive EBITDA growth of 59% in the segment. 
At Dow Jones, digital accounted for 60% of revenues, a record number. Circulation revenues grew 11% and professional information business revenues increased by 5%, led by risk and compliance with a strong 35% increase year-over-year. We saw continued subscriber volume growth at The Wall Street Journal with over 2.2 million total subscribers, approximately 60% of them digital. The ongoing implementation of the WSJ 2020 strategy helped to reduce costs while increasing efficiency.
At the New York Post, we saw digital audience growth of 30% to 84 million unique visitors in September compared to the prior year. Clearly, our U.S. mastheads have a large audience, respected brands and measurable meaningful metrics. With the upcoming launch of News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, we will leverage our quality journalism to connect advertisers with our fast-growing U.S. audience, which reached 115 million monthly unique visitors in September. That number is [indiscernible] unlike many inflated numbers in the digital world, better to be the then
At news in Australia, we emerged as the #1 digital network across all key categories. And total digital subscribers across our mastheads, including IRM, grew more than 30% to over 375,000. Meanwhile, costs continue to be diligently managed by Michael Miller and his team as the composition of the business evolves. Susan Panuccio will explain shortly in more detail.
At News UK, Sun Digital continues to outpace the competition and growth across all devices with 85 million monthly average uniques globally in the quarter based on ABCe. We're also gaining on the competition in the U.K., and according to comScore U.K., Sun Digital is now the largest news brand on mobile in the U.K. 
Audience engagement is on the rise and digital advertising revenues doubled versus the prior year. This summer saw the launch of The Sun Savers digital reward program targeted for casual print buyers. By the end of the first quarter, there are approximately 300,000 registered users, each of whom had provided extra data intelligence in return for genuine discounts from select Sun partners. 
Total subscriptions were up across The Times and The Sunday Times as well, exceeding 450,000 at quarter's end, driven in part by new subscriptions campaign. Digital subscriptions grew 17% in the quarter to 212,000, proving that high-quality journalism will attract a discerning paying audience.
Meanwhile at Wireless Group, which Rebecca Brooks and her team has successfully integrated, we saw the arrival of high-profile talent, particularly at talkSPORT radio, spurring both digital audience growth and Internet-only listening. We have also made progress with exclusive sports rights, including a [ 4 5 ] boxing package and the NFL, which is growing in popularity in the U.K.
In a world of multisession media and user generated content, which is too often abused generated content, Storyful is playing an increasingly important role verifying facts and assisting companies and brands subject to virulent attacks. Storyful, under its new CEO, Sharb Farjami, cannot only from fiction by provide risk analysis for its expanding roster of clients.
Turning to Digital Real Estate. Overall segment EBITDA is up 42% with 20% revenue growth, meaning that the segment was once again the biggest contributor to News Corp's profitability. At Move, home of realtor.com, we saw core real estate revenues grow 21% as the U.S. property market continued its gradual recovery from the financial crisis. 
From a macro perspective, only 5.4% of mortgage holders were underwater compared to 7.1% last year and a peak of 26% in 2009 according to Corelogic. Overall, revenue growth of 15% was partially offset by the $3 million decline in revenue associated with the divestiture last November when we chose to focus on the industry space business. Excluding the impact from the sale, we saw growth of Move of 19% in toto, putting it in prime position to benefit from the continuing recovery in real estate.
We are also increasing our focus on New York City where realtor.com is developing its services, brand and reputation, taking advantage of the conflict between a lesser competitor and real estate companies, agents and brokers who have wearied of its arrogance and impetuosity and who rightly fear its long-term ambition to disintermediate agents and brokers. Across the nation, realtor.com has the most ML-listed for sale homes that are updated every 15 minutes to the benefit of vendors, potential buyers and realtors.
In Australia with REA, we're empowering consumers with REA's acquisition of Smartline, a savvy mortgage broking franchise and its new home loan business, which is being developed in conjunction with National Australia Bank.
Building the financial segment of the business has been an important component of REA's growth strategy, and the extension into the more broker business is a sensible step forward. Meanwhile, REA remains the clear leader in Australian digital real estate markets, with a listing environment performing particularly well in Sydney and Melbourne and the core residential business remaining very strong.
We saw another solid quarter in Book Publishing, where HarperCollins experienced both revenue and EBITDA growth powered by the continued success of Hillbilly Elegy and The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, as well as the strength of new releases such as Daniel Silva's House of Spies consorts Good Daughter and others. New to the second quarter, we have Capital Gains by Chip Gaines, the latest addition of the popular series, The Piney Woman Cooks by [indiscernible] and Bruce Dickinson's Biography. As you erudite folk on the call will appreciate, Mr. Dickinson is the lead vocalist of Iron Maiden.
Looking ahead, HarperCollins is taking advantage of its global English rights through Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express to market the book in conjunction with the imminent release of Fox's movie of the same name. The denouement is worth the price of both the film and the book. 
At Foxtel, there was improved volume growth in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year, led by the strength of Foxtel Now. Foxtel also benefited from lower churn in the quarter. And this week, the company announced the launch of a new IP streaming device as it focuses on improving the user experience. 
FOX SPORTS Australia had revenue growth due to higher affiliate revenues, which more than offset lower ad revenues. And the net also saw a boost from the McGregor-Mayweather fight, which highlighted the potential value of pay-per-view offerings in a sports-hungry Australia. We're excited about the upcoming launch of Watch NRL, a global IP products, which follows the success of Watch IFL as we continue to expand the breadth of product offering a FOX SPORTS Australia and [indiscernible] purchase of Australian sports.
Before I turn things over to our esteemed CFO, Susan Panuccio, it is worth reiterating that our first quarter was no specious way to begin a new fiscal year, with revenue growth and increased profitability across the company. We saw the fruits of much labor to make this a more global and digital company, one increasingly defined by its growing digital real estate business and complemented by more recurring revenues from our cable and satellite businesses and subscription media offerings.
We do have reason for optimism about the future of our premium mastheads in light of Google's reforms and our ongoing discussions with Facebook, and most importantly because of the enduring quality of our journalism. Across our properties, we believe in providence and are sure that increasingly, there will be a premium for the premium. Over to you, Susan."

We delivered very strong operating results for the first fiscal quarter of 2018.

Turning to financials. We delivered very strong operating results for the first fiscal quarter of 2018. We reported fiscal 2018 first quarter total revenues of around $2.1 billion, an increase of $93 million or 5% compared to the prior year. Of that increase, acquisitions and divestments accounted for $51 million and currency added $26 million, with the balance being operational. Excluding those items, adjusted revenues grew 1%.
Reported total segment EBITDA was $249 million compared to $130 million in the prior year, up 92% versus the prior year. Reported results include a benefit of $46 million from the reversal with previously accrued net liabilities related to certain employment taxes in the U.K. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestments, foreign currency and the U.K. newspaper mastheads, adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter grew 46%. For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.12 compared to a loss of $0.03 in the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.07 compared to a loss of $0.01 in prior year.
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 2% compared to the prior year. The Wireless Group and The Australian regional media or ARM acquisition contributed $54 million and FX contributed $14 million this quarter. Within the segment revenues at the [indiscernible] and circulations of subscription revenues increased 3%.
News and Information Services reported segment EBITDA this quarter with $73 million or up 59% versus the prior year, led by an improvement at Dow Jones, ongoing cost initiatives, lower investment spending at Checkout 51 and the absence of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Wireless Group in the prior year.
I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operation division. At Dow Jones, total revenues rose 2%. Within that, advertising revenue declined 10% versus the prior year and saw a modest improvement from the fourth quarter decline due to a slight uplift in financial spending while the business to consumer and technology remains challenging. 
Digital accounted for approximately 38% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter, the highest percentage in its history, up from 33% in financial year '17. Total subscriber volumes at The Wall Street Journal across all formats was over 2.2 million, a 13% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital-only subscriptions, which rose approximately 36% versus the prior year to $1.3 million and represented 58% of the total subscribers versus 48% in the prior year.
Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones was 11% for the quarter, driven by the digital volume gains and higher subscription pricing. As mentioned by Robert, professional information business revenues grew 5% in the first quarter, continuing to accelerate from prior quarter levels, led by risk and compliance, which grew 35%, marking strongest year-over-year performance since 2014. 
In Q1, professional information business revenues represented slightly less than 1/3 of Dow Jones revenues. The Wall Street Journal 2020 program, as previously discussed, is not only about cost transformation but also focuses on the Wall Street becoming a digital-first organization, including more aggressively expanding our digital offerings internationally. 
Over the past year, Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions have nearly doubled in Europe and have grown by almost 70% in Asia. Our international footprint is being further expanded by the global reach of our conferences, including the launch of the Tokyo CEO Council and the WSJD Live in Hong Kong. 
At News Australia, total revenues rose 4%, helped by the integration of the ARM acquisition and foreign currency benefits. Advertising revenues for the quarter increased 3% or declined 1% in local currencies, helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, advertising revenues declined approximately 10% in local currency, relatively similar to the prior quarter.
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 6% or up 2% in local currency as the acquisition of ARM, price increases and higher paid digital subscriptions were partially offset by print volume declines in the sale of the Sunday Times last year.
Regarding our ongoing cost transformation, we remain particularly focused on News Australia, given its reliance on print and higher exposure to advertising revenues. While we are currently targeting at least AUD 40 million in cost reductions this year, the team in Australia are already pacing well ahead as they continue to be cost focused together with continuing their review of the broader regional and community newspaper portfolio following the acquisition of ARM.
The team's focus in Australia is not just to remove legacy costs but to ensure the cost structure is right-sized for the business moving forward. Australia is also making steady progress in the digital conversion, with digital subscribers across the new Australia mastheads now reaching more than 375,000 paid subscribers, including the ARM properties, which is over 30% higher than the prior year.
At News UK, total revenues were down 6%. Advertising revenues declined 9%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate due to continued moderation from print advertising declines at The Times and The Sun and an acceleration in digital advertising at The Sun, driven by higher audience and improved engagement. Circulation revenues at News UK were down 5% as volume declines at The Sun more than offset copper price increases. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenue fell 4% due to ongoing weakness freestanding revenues, which had 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year.
Turning to the publishing segment. Revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $401 million and segment EBITDA increased 4% to $50 million. Part of the highlight this quarter included Daniel Silva's House of Spies and A Good Daughter as well as carryover sales from J Hillbilly Elegy. 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 6% to represent 21% of consumer revenues compared to 20% in the prior year due to strength in downloadable audiobooks. In Digital Real Estate Services, segment revenues increased 20% to $271 million and adjusted revenues increased 19%. Reported segment EBITDA was $95 million versus $67 million last year, up 42%.
REA Group revenues grew 22% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency, partially offset by the divestment of the European businesses last year. Listing volume was stable this quarter but importantly saw a pickup in New South Wales and Victoria. Please refer to REA's earnings release and a conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $107 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from Connections for Buyers, which is benefiting from strong growth in lead volume as well as improved pricing optimization and inventory management. TigerLead, which was divested in November 2016, contributed $3 million of revenues in the prior period. Excluding that, revenue growth would have been approximately 19%. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com grew to 55 million for the quarter, rising mid-single digits from the prior year.
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $17 million or 13% to $145 million compared to the prior few quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added $11 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose to $27 million from $14 million due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the rollout of the FOX LEAGUE channel, a network dedicated to the NRL, which led to a benefit of approximately $10 million this quarter. The results also reflect lower other sports programming right costs, including impact on the absence of Australia versus Sri Lanka cricket in the prior year.
With respect to equity losses/earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $10 million this quarter compared to $15 million in last quarter.
Foxtel revenues for the quarter rose 2% to $263 million but declined 2% in local currency. EBITDA decreased 15% to $122 million and was down 18% in local currency due to planned increases in sports rights costs of approximately $24 million primarily related to the new IFL contract, partially offset by lower transmission and sales and marketing costs.
Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.8 million subscribers, up 2% versus the fourth quarter driven by the rollout of Foxtel Now. In the first quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 12.7%, down from 15.5% last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86.
For the quarter, capital expenditures were $62 million compared to $49 million in the prior year, with increases driven by higher IT spending. However, overall CapEx in fiscal 2018 should be in line with the prior year.
Looking forward to the second quarter, there are a few points I would like to make. At News and Information Services, print advertising trading conditions remain challenging and visibility is limited. We expect ongoing print advertising headwinds and we'll continue to focus on cost efficiencies accordingly. 
In addition, News America Marketing [indiscernible] have 2 less freestanding inserts in the quarter, similar to the first quarter. We expect Fox Sports Australia to face higher costs in the second quarter, a reversal from quarter 1 due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year. We expect over AUD 25 million in higher costs for the second quarter compared to the prior year period. For the full year, we continue to expect AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million in higher costs, mostly related to the NRL, much of which should be offset by higher affiliate revenues and production cost initiatives.
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, notable new releases this quarter include Woman book, Come and Get It and capital gains from Chip Gaines, the author of Magnolia Story. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong growth in REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business and continued growth at Realtor.

And frankly, those things that happened. We really are copping the model at can business with the initial investment in REA back many years ago. And look, we're not complacent for a second because while it's obviously strong growth there and you remember this time last year, it was single-digit growth in revenue. It's now well into double digits. We are constantly reflecting on what we can do better, how we can serve realtors more efficiently but also how we can drive revenue and EBITDA growth for the benefit of all our shareholders."

Our new fiscal year is off to a sterling start, with robust results reflecting our steadfast strategy to pursue global and digital expansion and to create a cogently balanced revenue mix. In the first quarter, revenues and EBITDA incr",1806,"Thank you, Mike. Our new fiscal year is off to a sterling start, with robust results reflecting our steadfast strategy to pursue global and digital expansion and to create a cogently balanced revenue mix.
 
In the first quarter, revenues and EBITDA increased across every segment of our business compared to the same quarter last year, with particularly strong growth in digital real estate, where we continue to be the world's largest and leading company. In summary, revenues grew 5% to $2.1 billion and reported total segment EBITDA grew 92% to reach $249 million, up from $130 million in the prior year. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 46%. Reported earnings per share grew to $0.12 versus loss of $0.03 in the prior year.
 
These results truly underscore the increasing strength of digital real estate and how it has positively transformed the character of News Corp and positioned us for further growth in the future. We can also see the tangible benefits of our sustained commitment to cost reduction while we continue to invest in the highest quality content.
 
In August, we and Telstra in Australia announced a nonbinding agreement to combine Foxtel and Fox Sports, with News Corp owning 65% of the new company. Pending definitive documentation and regulatory approval, we expect to close in the first half of calendar year 2018. Combining Foxtel and Fox Sports and providing News Corp with majority control should give us a better opportunity to take advantage of fortified scale to leverage our immensely valuable sports and entertainment rights as well as a boosting our ability to ""collect"" permissioned customer data.
 
We await regulatory approval and discussion over details continues with our partner, Telstra. But once completed, the combined company is expected to make a substantial contribution to our revenue and EBITDA and fundamentally transform the nature of News Corp.
 
There was another fundamental change last month which also bodes well for our future, and that's of other premium use provider. Google said it would end First Click Free, a seemingly innocently titled policy that undermine business models and damage providence in societies by banishing premium subscription content. As many of you are aware, Rupert, Lachlan and I, along with our colleagues at News Corp, have long taken a principled and often solitary stand to protect intellectual property and safeguard journalism, so we appreciate this significant first step taken by Google. We will, of course, be monitoring the effect of this change across our mastheads even as we continue our discussions with Google and with Facebook about the ways we can profitably connect readers with our mastheads.
 
We continue to be deeply concerned by the abuse of algorithms and by unadulterated digital ad market, which had promised transparency but has delivered opacity, undermining the confidence of advertisers in the digital marketplace. It is clear that advertisers want their products to be promoted on sites that enhance, not tarnish, their image and that they want metrics that are reliable, not risible.
 
And while on the subject of premium content, let us delve into the News and Information segment, which fared well this quarter with digital subscriptions up at The Wall Street Journal and at other mastheads across the company. Despite the continued challenging advertising trends, our cost consciousness and steady circulation growth helped drive EBITDA growth of 59% in the segment. 
 
At Dow Jones, digital accounted for 60% of revenues, a record number. Circulation revenues grew 11% and professional information business revenues increased by 5%, led by risk and compliance with a strong 35% increase year-over-year. We saw continued subscriber volume growth at The Wall Street Journal with over 2.2 million total subscribers, approximately 60% of them digital. The ongoing implementation of the WSJ 2020 strategy helped to reduce costs while increasing efficiency.
 
At the New York Post, we saw digital audience growth of 30% to 84 million unique visitors in September compared to the prior year. Clearly, our U.S. mastheads have a large audience, respected brands and measurable meaningful metrics. With the upcoming launch of News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, we will leverage our quality journalism to connect advertisers with our fast-growing U.S. audience, which reached 115 million monthly unique visitors in September. That number is deduped unlike many inflated numbers in the digital world, better to be deduped than duped.
 
At news in Australia, we emerged as the #1 digital network across all key categories. And total digital subscribers across our mastheads, including ARM, grew more than 30% to over 375,000. Meanwhile, costs continue to be diligently managed by Michael Miller and his team as the composition of the business evolved. Susan Panuccio will explain shortly in more detail.
 
At News UK, Sun Digital continues to outpace the competition in growth across all devices with 85 million monthly average uniques globally in the quarter based on ABCe. We're also gaining on the competition in the U.K., and according to comScore U.K., Sun Digital is now the largest news brand on mobile in the U.K. 
Audience engagement is on the rise and digital advertising revenues doubled versus the prior year. This summer saw the launch of the Sun Savers digital reward program targeted for casual print buyers. By the end of the first quarter, there are approximately 300,000 registered users, each of whom had provided extra data intelligence in return for genuine discounts from select Sun partners. 
Total subscriptions were up across The Times and The Sunday Times as well, exceeding 450,000 at quarter's end, driven in part by new subscriptions campaign. Digital subscriptions grew 17% in the quarter to 212,000, proving that high-quality journalism will attract a discerning paying audience.
 
Meanwhile at Wireless Group, which Rebekah Brooks and her team have successfully integrated, we saw the arrival of high-profile talent, particularly at talkSPORT radio, spurring both digital audience growth and Internet-only listening. We have also made progress with exclusive sports rights, including a [ 4/5 ] boxing package and the NFL, which is growing in popularity in the U.K.
 
In a world of murky social media and user-generated content, which is too often abused generated content, Storyful is playing an increasingly important role, verifying facts and assisting companies and brands subject to virulent attacks. Storyful, under its new CEO, Sharb Farjami, can not only subtract from fiction by provide risk analysis for its expanding roster of clients.
 
Turning to digital real estate. Overall segment EBITDA is up 42% with 20% revenue growth, meaning that the segment was once again the biggest contributor to News Corp's profitability. At Move, home of realtor.com, we saw core real estate revenues grow 21% as the U.S. property market continued its gradual recovery from the financial crisis. 
 
From a macro perspective, only 5.4% of mortgage holders were underwater compared to 7.1% last year and a peak of 26% in 2009 according to Corelogic. Overall, revenue growth of 15% was partially offset by the $3 million decline in revenue associated with the TigerLead divestiture last November when we chose to focus on the core leads industry space business. Excluding the impact from the sale, we saw growth at Move of 19% in Toto, putting it in prime position to benefit from the continuing recovery in real estate.
 
We are also increasing our focus on New York City, where realtor.com is developing its services, brand and reputation, taking advantage of the conflict between a lesser competitor and real estate companies, agents and brokers, who have wearied of its arrogance and impetuosity and, who rightly fear its long-term ambition to disintermediate agents and brokers. Across the nation, realtor.com has the most ML-listed for sale homes that are updated every 15 minutes to the benefit of vendors, potential buyers and realtors.
 
In Australia with REA, we're empowering consumers with REA's acquisition of Smartline, a savvy mortgage broking franchise and its new home loan business, which is being developed in conjunction with National Australia Bank.
 
Building the financial segment of the business has been an important component of REA's growth strategy, and the extension into the more huge broker business is a sensible step forward. Meanwhile, REA remains the clear leader in Australian digital real estate markets, with a listing environment performing particularly well in Sydney and Melbourne, and the core residential business remaining very strong.
 
We saw another solid quarter in Book Publishing, where HarperCollins experienced both revenue and EBITDA growth, powered by the continued success of Hillbilly Elegy and The Subtle Art of Not Giving an (Expletive) as well as the strength of new releases such as Daniel Silva's House of Spies, Karin Slaughter's The Good Daughter and others. New to the second quarter, we have Capital Gaines by Chip Gaines, the latest addition of the popular series, The Pioneer Woman Cooks by Ree Drummond and Bruce Dickinson's autobiography. As you erudite folk on the call will appreciate, Mr. Dickinson is the lead vocalist of Iron Maiden.
 
Looking ahead, HarperCollins is taking advantage of its global English rights to Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express to market the book in conjunction with the imminent release of Fox's movie of the same name. The denouement is worth the price of both the film and the book. 
 
At Foxtel, there was improved volume growth in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year, led by the strength of Foxtel Now. Foxtel also benefited from lower churn in the quarter. And this week, the company announced the launch of a new IP streaming device as it focuses on improving the user experience. 
 
Fox Sports Australia had revenue growth due to higher affiliate revenues, which more than offset lower ad revenues. And the network also saw a boost from the McGregor-Mayweather fight, which highlighted the potential value of pay-per-view offerings in a sports-hungry Australia. We're excited about the upcoming launch of Watch NRL, a global IP product, which follows the success of Watch IFL as we continue to expand the breadth of product offering of Fox Sports Australia and [indiscernible] the virtues of Australian sports.
 
Before I turn things over to our esteemed CFO, Susan Panuccio, it is worth reiterating that our first quarter was an auspicious way to begin a new fiscal year, with revenue growth and increased profitability across the company. We saw the fruits of much labor to make this a more global and digital company, one increasingly defined by its growing digital real estate business and complemented by more recurring revenues from our cable and satellite businesses and subscription media offerings.
 
We do have reason for optimism about the future of our premium mastheads in light of Google's reforms and our ongoing discussions with Facebook, and most importantly because of the enduring quality of our journalism. Across our properties, we believe in providence and are sure that increasingly, there will be a premium for the premium. Over to you, Susan."

Turning to the financials. We delivered very strong operating results for the first fiscal quarter of 2018. We reported fiscal 2018 first quarter total revenues of around $2.1 billion, an increase of $93 million or 5% compared to the prior year. Of that increase, acquisitions and divestments accounted for $51 million and currency added $26 million, with the balance being operational. Excluding those items, adjusted revenues grew 1%.
 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $249 million compared to $130 million in the prior year, up 92% versus the prior year. Reported results include a benefit of $46 million from the reversal with previously accrued net liabilities related to certain employment taxes in the U.K. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestments, foreign currency and the U.K. newspaper mastheads, adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter grew 46%. For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.12 compared to a loss of $0.03 in the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.07 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year.
 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 2% compared to the prior year. The Wireless Group and the Australian Regional Media, or ARM, acquisition contributed $54 million and FX contributed $14 million this quarter. Within segment revenues, advertising was flat and circulation and subscription revenues increased 3%.
 
News and Information Services reported segment EBITDA this quarter with $73 million or up 59% versus the prior year, led by an improvement at Dow Jones, ongoing cost initiatives, lower investment spending at Checkout 51 and the absence of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Wireless Group in the prior year.
  
I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operation division. At Dow Jones, total revenues rose 2%. Within that, advertising revenue declined 10% versus the prior year and saw a modest improvement from the fourth quarter decline due to a slight uplift in financial spending while the business, the consumer and technology remained challenging. 
 
Digital accounted for approximately 38% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter, the highest percentage in its history, up from 33% in financial year '17. Total subscriber volumes at The Wall Street Journal across all formats was over 2.2 million, a 13% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital-only subscriptions, which rose approximately 36% versus the prior year to $1.3 million and represented 58% of the total subscribers versus 48% in the prior year.
 
Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones was 11% for the quarter, driven by the digital volume gains and higher subscription pricing. As mentioned by Robert, professional information business revenues grew 5% in the first quarter, continuing to accelerate from prior quarter levels, led by risk and compliance, which grew 35%, marking the strongest year-over-year performance since 2014. 
 
In Q1, professional information business revenues represented slightly less than 1/3 of Dow Jones revenue. The Wall Street Journal 2020 program, as previously discussed, is not only about cost transformation but also focuses on The Wall Street becoming a digital-first organization, including more aggressively expanding our digital offerings internationally. 
 
Over the past year, Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions have nearly doubled in Europe and have grown by almost 70% in Asia. Our international footprint is being further expanded by the global reach of our conferences, including the launch of the Tokyo CEO Council and the WSJ D.Live in Hong Kong. 
 
At News Australia, total revenues rose 4%, helped by the integration of the ARM acquisition and foreign currency benefits. Advertising revenues for the quarter increased 3% or declined 1% in local currencies, helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, advertising revenues declined approximately 10% in local currency, relatively similar to the prior quarter.
 
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 6% or up 2% in local currency as the acquisition of ARM, cover price increases and higher-paid digital subscriptions were partially offset by print volume declines in the sale of the Sunday Times last year.
 
Regarding our ongoing cost transformation, we remain particularly focused on News Australia, given its reliance on print and higher exposure to advertising revenues. While we are currently targeting at least AUD 40 million in cost reductions this year, the team in Australia are already pacing well ahead of that as they continue to be cost focused, together with continuing their review of the broader regional and community newspaper portfolio following the acquisition of ARM.
 
The team's focus in Australia is not just to remove legacy costs but to ensure the cost structure is right-sized for the business moving forward. Australia is also making steady progress in the digital conversion, with digital subscribers across the News Australia mastheads now reaching more than 375,000 paid subscribers, including the ARM property, which is over 30% higher than the prior year.
 
At News UK, total revenues were down 6%. Advertising revenues declined 9%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate due to continued but moderating print advertising declines at The Times and The Sun and an acceleration in digital advertising at The Sun, driven by higher audience and improved engagement. Circulation revenues at News UK were down 5% as volume declines at The Sun more than offset cover price increases. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 4% due to ongoing weakness in freestanding insert revenues, which had 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year.
 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $401 million and segment EBITDA increased 4% to $50 million. Titles to highlight this quarter included Daniel Silva's House of Spies and Karin Slaughter's The Good Daughter as well as carryover sales from J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy. 
 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 6% to represent 21% of consumer revenues compared to 20% in the prior year due to strength in downloadable audiobooks. In Digital Real Estate Services, segment revenues increased 20% to $271 million and adjusted revenues increased 19%. Reported segment EBITDA was $95 million versus $67 million last year, up 42%.
 
REA Group revenues grew 22% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for [ Premier All ], the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency, partially offset by the divestment of the European businesses last year. Listing volume was stable this quarter but importantly saw a pickup in New South Wales and Victoria. Please refer to REA's earnings release and the conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
 
 
Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $107 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from strong growth in lead volume as well as improved pricing optimization and inventory management. TigerLead, which was divested in November 2016, contributed $3 million of revenues in the prior period. Excluding that, revenue growth would have been approximately 19%. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com grew to 55 million for the quarter, rising mid-single digits from the prior year. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $17 million or 13% to $145 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added $11 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose to $27 million from $14 million due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the rollout of the FOX LEAGUE channel, a network dedicated to the NRL, which led to a benefit of approximately $10 million this quarter. The results also reflect lower other sports programming rights costs, including impact on the absence of Australia versus Sri Lanka cricket tour in the prior year. With respect to equity losses/earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $10 million this quarter compared to $15 million in the last quarter.
 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter rose 2% to $263 million but declined 2% in local currency. EBITDA decreased 15% to $122 million and was down 18% in local currency due to planned increases in sports rights costs of approximately $24 million, primarily related to the new IFL contract, partially offset by lower transmission and sales and marketing costs.
 
Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.8 million subscribers, up 2% versus the fourth quarter driven by the rollout of Foxtel Now. In the first quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 12.7%, down from 15.5% last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86.
 
For the quarter, capital expenditures were $62 million compared to $49 million in the prior year, with increases driven by higher IT spending. However, overall CapEx in fiscal 2018 should be in line with the prior year.
 
Looking forward to the second quarter, there are a few points I would like to make. At News and Information Services, print advertising trading conditions remain challenging and visibility is limited. We expect ongoing print advertising headwinds and we'll continue to focus on cost efficiencies accordingly. 
 
In addition, News America Marketing will again have 2 less freestanding inserts in the quarter, similar to the first quarter. We expect Fox Sports Australia to face higher costs in the second quarter, a reversal from quarter 1 due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year. We expect over AUD 25 million in higher costs for the second quarter compared to the prior year period. For the full year, we continue to expect AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million in higher costs, mostly related to the NRL, much of which should be offset by higher affiliate revenues and production cost initiatives.
 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, notable new releases this quarter include Ree Drummond's The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Come and Get It! and Capital Gaines from Chip Gaines, co-author of The Magnolia Story. 
 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong growth in REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business and continued growth at Realtor.

Our new fiscal year is off to a sterling start, with robust results reflecting our steadfast strategy to pursue global and digital expansion and to create a cogently balanced revenue mix.

Our new fiscal year is off to a sterling start, with robust results reflecting our steadfast strategy to pursue global and digital expansion and to create a cogently balanced revenue mix.
 
In the first quarter, revenues and EBITDA increased across every segment of our business compared to the same quarter last year, with particularly strong growth in digital real estate, where we continue to be the world's largest and leading company. In summary, revenues grew 5% to $2.1 billion and reported total segment EBITDA grew 92% to reach $249 million, up from $130 million in the prior year. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 46%. Reported earnings per share grew to $0.12 versus a loss of $0.03 in the prior year.
 
These results truly underscore the increasing strength of digital real estate and how it has positively transformed the character of News Corp and positioned us for further growth in the future. We can also see the tangible benefits of our sustained commitment to cost reduction while we continue to invest in the highest quality content.
 
In August, we and Telstra in Australia announced a nonbinding agreement to combine Foxtel and Fox Sports, with News Corp owning 65% of the new company. Pending definitive documentation and regulatory approval, we expect to close in the first half of calendar year 2018. Combining Foxtel and Fox Sports and providing News Corp with majority control should give us a better opportunity to take advantage of fortified scale to leverage our immensely valuable sports and entertainment rights as well as a boosting our ability to collect permissioned customer data.
 
We await regulatory approval and discussion over details continues with our partner, Telstra. But once completed, the combined company is expected to make a substantial contribution to our revenue and EBITDA and fundamentally transform the nature of News Corp.
 
There was another fundamental change last month which also bodes well for our future, and that of other premium use provider. Google said it would end First Click Free, a seemingly innocently titled policy that undermined business models and damaged providence in societies by banishing premium subscription content. As many of you are aware, Rupert, Lachlan and I, along with our colleagues at News Corp, have long taken a principled and often solitary stand to protect intellectual property and safeguard journalism, so we appreciate this significant first step taken by Google. We will, of course, be monitoring the effect of this change across our mastheads even as we continue our discussions with Google and with Facebook about the ways we can profitably connect readers with our mastheads.
 
We continue to be deeply concerned by the abusive algorithms and by an adulterated digital ad market, which had promised transparency but has delivered opacity, undermining the confidence of advertisers in the digital marketplace. It is clear that advertisers want their products to be promoted on sites that enhance, not tarnish, their image and that they want metrics that are reliable, not risible.
 
And while on the subject of premium content, let us delve into the News and Information segment, which fared well this quarter with digital subscriptions up at The Wall Street Journal and at other mastheads across the company. Despite the continued challenging advertising trends, our cost consciousness and steady circulation growth helped drive EBITDA growth of 59% in the segment. 
 
At Dow Jones, digital accounted for 60% of revenues, a record number. Circulation revenues grew 11% and professional information business revenues increased by 5%, led by risk and compliance with a strong 35% increase year-over-year. We saw continued subscriber volume growth at The Wall Street Journal with over 2.2 million total subscribers, approximately 60% of them digital. The ongoing implementation of the WSJ 2020 strategy helped to reduce costs while increasing efficiency.
 
At the New York Post, we saw digital audience growth of 30% to 84 million unique visitors in September compared to the prior year. Clearly, our U.S. mastheads have a large audience, respected brands and measurable meaningful metrics. With the upcoming launch of News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, we will leverage our quality journalism to connect advertisers with our fast-growing U.S. audience, which reached 115 million monthly unique visitors in September. That number is deduped unlike many inflated numbers in the digital world, better to be deduped than duped.
 
At news in Australia, we emerged as the #1 digital network across all key categories. And total digital subscribers across our mastheads, including ARM, grew more than 30% to over 375,000. Meanwhile, costs continue to be diligently managed by Michael Miller and his team as the composition of the business evolves. Susan Panuccio will explain shortly in more detail.
 
At News UK, Sun Digital continues to outpace the competition in growth across all devices with 85 million monthly average uniques globally in the quarter based on ABCe. We're also gaining on the competition in the U.K., and according to comScore U.K., Sun Digital is now the largest news brand on mobile in the U.K. 
Audience engagement is on the rise and digital advertising revenues doubled versus the prior year. This summer saw the launch of the Sun Savers digital reward program targeted for casual print buyers. By the end of the first quarter, there were approximately 300,000 registered users, each of whom had provided extra data intelligence in return for genuine discounts from select Sun partners. 
Total subscriptions were up across The Times and The Sunday Times as well, exceeding 450,000 at quarter's end, driven in part by new subscriptions campaign. Digital subscriptions grew 17% in the quarter to 212,000, proving that high-quality journalism will attract a discerning paying audience.
 
Meanwhile at Wireless Group, which Rebekah Brooks and her team have successfully integrated, we saw the arrival of high-profile talent, particularly at talkSPORT radio, spurring both digital audience growth and Internet-only listening. We have also made progress with exclusive sports rights, including a 4-fight boxing package and the NFL, which is growing in popularity in the U.K.
 
In a world of murky social media and user-generated content, which is too often abuser-generated content, Storyful is playing an increasingly important role, verifying facts and assisting companies and brands subject to virulent attacks. Storyful, under its new CEO, Sharb Farjami, can not only sift fact from fiction but provide risk analysis for its expanding roster of clients.
 
Turning to digital real estate. Overall segment EBITDA is up 42% with 20% revenue growth, meaning that the segment was once again the biggest contributor to News Corp's profitability. At Move, home of realtor.com, we saw core real estate revenues grow 21% as the U.S. property market continued its gradual recovery from the financial crisis. 
 
From a macro perspective, only 5.4% of mortgage holders were underwater compared to 7.1% last year and a peak of 26% in 2009 according to Corelogic. Overall, revenue growth of 15% was partially offset by the $3 million decline in revenue associated with the TigerLead divestiture last November when we chose to focus on the core leads in listening space business. Excluding the impact from the sale, we saw growth at Move of 19% in toto, putting it in prime position to benefit from the continuing recovery in real estate.
 
We are also increasing our focus on New York City, where realtor.com is developing its services, brand and reputation, taking advantage of the conflict between a lesser competitor and real estate companies, agents and brokers, who have wearied of its arrogance and impetuosity and, who rightly fear its long-term ambition to disintermediate agents and brokers. Across the nation, realtor.com has the most ML-listed for sale homes that are updated every 15 minutes to the benefit of vendors, potential buyers and realtors.
 
In Australia at REA, we're empowering consumers with REA's acquisition of Smartline, a savvy mortgage broking franchise and its new home loan business, which is being developed in conjunction with National Australia Bank.
 
Building the financial segment of the business has been an important component of REA's growth strategy, and the extension into the more huge broker business is a sensible step forward. Meanwhile, REA remains the clear leader in Australia's digital real estate markets, with the listing environment performing particularly well in Sydney and Melbourne, and the core residential business remaining very strong.
 
We saw another solid quarter in Book Publishing, where HarperCollins experienced both revenue and EBITDA growth, powered by the continued success of Hillbilly Elegy and The Subtle Art of Not Giving an (Expletive) as well as the strength of new releases such as Daniel Silva's House of Spies, Karin Slaughter's The Good Daughter and others. New for the second quarter, we have Capital Gaines by Chip Gaines, the latest addition of the popular series, The Pioneer Woman Cooks by Ree Drummond and Bruce Dickinson's autobiography. As you erudite folk on the call well appreciate, Mr. Dickinson is the lead vocalist of Iron Maiden.
 
Looking ahead, HarperCollins is taking advantage of its global English rights to Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express to market the book in conjunction with the imminent release of Fox's movie of the same name. The denouement is worth the price of both the film and the book. 
 
At Foxtel, there was improved volume growth in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year, led by the strength of Foxtel Now. Foxtel also benefited from lower churn in the quarter. And this week, the company announced the launch of a new IP streaming device as it focuses on improving the user experience. 
 
Fox Sports Australia had revenue growth due to higher affiliate revenues, which more than offset lower ad revenues. And the network also saw a boost from the McGregor-Mayweather fight, which highlighted the potential value of pay-per-view offerings in a sports-hungry Australia. We're excited about the upcoming launch of Watch NRL, a global IP product, which follows the success of Watch IFL as we continue to expand the breadth of product offering of Fox Sports Australia and proselytize the virtues of Australian sports.
 
Before I turn things over to our esteemed CFO, Susan Panuccio, it is worth reiterating that our first quarter was an auspicious way to begin a new fiscal year, with revenue growth and increased profitability across the company. We saw the fruits of much labor to make this a more global and digital company, one increasingly defined by its growing digital real estate business and complemented by more recurring revenues from our cable and satellite businesses and subscription media offerings.
 
We do have reason for optimism about the future of our premium mastheads in light of Google's reforms and our ongoing discussions with Facebook, and most importantly because of the enduring quality of our journalism. Across our properties, we believe in providence and are sure that increasingly, there will be a premium for the premium. Over to you, Susan."

Turning to the financials. We delivered very strong operating results for the first fiscal quarter of 2018. We reported fiscal 2018 first quarter total revenues of around $2.1 billion, an increase of $93 million or 5% compared to the prior year. Of that increase, acquisitions and divestments accounted for $51 million and currency added $26 million, with the balance being operational. Excluding those items, adjusted revenues grew 1%.
 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $249 million compared to $130 million in the prior year, up 92% versus the prior year. Reported results include a benefit of $46 million from the reversal with previously accrued net liabilities related to certain employment taxes in the U.K. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestments, foreign currency and the U.K. newspaper masses, adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter grew 46%. For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.12 compared to a loss of $0.03 in the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.07 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year.
 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 2% compared to the prior year. The Wireless Group and the Australian Regional Media, or ARM, acquisitions contributed $54 million and FX contributed $14 million this quarter. Within segment revenues, advertising was flat and circulation and subscription revenues increased 3%.
 
News and Information Services reported segment EBITDA this quarter with $73 million or up 59% versus the prior year, led by an improvement at Dow Jones, ongoing cost initiatives, lower investment spending at Checkout 51 and the absence of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Wireless Group in the prior year.
  
I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operation divisions. At Dow Jones, total revenues rose 2%. Within that, advertising revenue declined 10% versus the prior year and saw a modest improvement from the fourth quarter decline due to a slight uplift in financial spending while the business to consumer and technology categories remained challenging. 
 
Digital accounted for approximately 38% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter, the highest percentage in its history, up from 33% in financial year '17. Total subscriber volumes at The Wall Street Journal across all formats was over 2.2 million, a 13% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital-only subscriptions, which rose approximately 36% versus the prior year to $1.3 million and represented 58% of the total subscribers versus 48% in the prior year.
 
Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones was 11% for the quarter, driven by the digital volume gains and higher subscription pricing. As mentioned by Robert, professional information business revenues grew 5% in the first quarter, continuing to accelerate from prior quarter levels, led by risk and compliance, which grew 35%, marking the strongest year-over-year performance since 2014. 
 
In Q1, professional information business revenues represented slightly less than 1/3 of Dow Jones revenues. The Wall Street Journal 2020 program, as previously discussed, is not only about cost transformation but also focuses on The Wall Street Journal becoming a digital-first organization, including more aggressively expanding our digital offerings internationally. 
 
Over the past year, Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions have nearly doubled in Europe and have grown by almost 70% in Asia. Our international footprint is being further expanded by the global reach of our conferences, including the launch of the Tokyo CEO Council and the WSJ D.Live in Hong Kong. 
 
At News Australia, total revenues rose 4%, helped by the integration of the ARM acquisition and foreign currency benefits. Advertising revenues for the quarter increased 3% or declined 1% in local currency, helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, advertising revenues declined approximately 10% in local currency, relatively similar to the prior quarter.
 
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 6% or up 2% in local currency as the acquisition of ARM, cover price increases and higher-paid digital subscriptions were partially offset by print volume declines in the sale of the Sunday Times last year.
 
Regarding our ongoing cost transformation, we remain particularly focused on News Australia, given its reliance on print and higher exposure to advertising revenues. While we are currently targeting at least AUD 40 million in cost reductions this year, the team in Australia are already pacing well ahead of that as they continue to be cost focused, together with continuing their review of the broader regional and community newspaper portfolio following the acquisition of ARM.
 
The team's focus in Australia is not just to remove legacy costs but to ensure the cost structure is right-sized for the business moving forward. Australia is also making steady progress in the digital conversion, with digital subscribers across the News Australia mastheads now reaching more than 375,000 paid subscribers, including the ARM properties, which is over 30% higher than the prior year.
 
At News UK, total revenues were down 6%. Advertising revenues declined 9%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate due to continued but moderating print advertising declines at The Times and The Sun and an acceleration in digital advertising at The Sun, driven by higher audience and improved engagement. Circulation revenues at News UK were down 5% as volume declines at The Sun more than offset cover price increases. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 4% due to ongoing weakness in freestanding insert revenues, which had 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year.
 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $401 million and segment EBITDA increased 4% to $50 million. Titles to highlight this quarter included Daniel Silva's House of Spies and Karin Slaughter's The Good Daughter as well as carryover sales from  J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy. 
 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 6% to represent 21% of consumer revenues compared to 20% in the prior year due to strength in downloadable audiobooks. In Digital Real Estate Services, segment revenues increased 20% to $271 million and adjusted revenues increased 19%. Reported segment EBITDA was $95 million versus $67 million last year, up 42%.
 
REA Group revenues grew 22% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency, partially offset by the divestment of the European businesses last year. Listing volume were stable this quarter but importantly saw a pickup in New South Wales and Victoria. Please refer to REA's earnings release and the conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
 
 
Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $107 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from strong growth in lead volume as well as improved pricing optimization in inventory management. TigerLead, which was divested in November 2016, contributed $3 million of revenues in the prior period. Excluding that, revenue growth would have been approximately 19%. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com grew to 55 million for the quarter, rising mid-single digits from the prior year. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $17 million or 13% to $145 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added $11 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose to $27 million from $14 million due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the rollout of the FOX LEAGUE channel, a network dedicated to the NRL, which led to a benefit of approximately $10 million this quarter. The results also reflect lower other sports programming rights costs, including impact on the absence of Australia versus Sri Lanka cricket tour in the prior year. With respect to equity losses/earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $10 million this quarter compared to $15 million in last quarter.
 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter rose 2% to $263 million but declined 2% in local currency. EBITDA decreased 15% to $122 million and was down 18% in local currency due to planned increases in sports rights costs of approximately $24 million, primarily related to the new IFL contract, partially offset by lower transmission and sales and marketing costs.
 
Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.8 million subscribers, up 2% versus the fourth quarter driven by the rollout of Foxtel Now. In the first quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 12.7%, down from 15.5% last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86.
 
For the quarter, capital expenditures were $62 million compared to $49 million in the prior year, with increases driven by higher IT spending. However, overall CapEx in fiscal 2018 should be in line with the prior year.
 
Looking forward to the second quarter, there are a few points I would like to make. At News and Information Services, print advertising trading conditions remain challenging and visibility is limited. We expect ongoing print advertising headwinds and we'll continue to focus on cost efficiencies accordingly. 
 
In addition, News America Marketing will again have 2 less freestanding inserts in the quarter, similar to the first quarter. We expect Fox Sports Australia to face higher costs in the second quarter, a reversal from quarter 1 due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year. We expect over AUD 25 million in higher costs for the second quarter compared to the prior year period. For the full year, we continue to expect AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million in higher costs, mostly related to the NRL, much of which should be offset by higher affiliate revenues and production cost initiatives.
 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, notable new releases this quarter include Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman Cooks: Come and Get It! and Capital Gaines from Chip Gaines, co-author of The Magnolia Story. 
 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong growth in REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business and continued growth at Realtor.

Our new fiscal year is off to a sterling start, with robust results reflecting our steadfast strategy to pursue global and digital expansion and to create a cogently balanced revenue mix.

Our new fiscal year is off to a sterling start, with robust results reflecting our steadfast strategy to pursue global and digital expansion and to create a cogently balanced revenue mix.
 
In the first quarter, revenues and EBITDA increased across every segment of our business compared to the same quarter last year, with particularly strong growth in digital real estate, where we continue to be the world's largest and leading company. In summary, revenues grew 5% to $2.1 billion and reported total segment EBITDA grew 92% to reach $249 million, up from $130 million in the prior year. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 46%. Reported earnings per share grew to $0.12 versus a loss of $0.03 in the prior year.
 
These results truly underscore the increasing strength of digital real estate and how it has positively transformed the character of News Corp and positioned us for further growth in the future. We can also see the tangible benefits of our sustained commitment to cost reduction while we continue to invest in the highest quality content.
 
In August, we and Telstra in Australia announced a nonbinding agreement to combine Foxtel and Fox Sports, with News Corp owning 65% of the new company. Pending definitive documentation and regulatory approval, we expect to close in the first half of calendar year 2018. Combining Foxtel and Fox Sports and providing News Corp with majority control should give us a better opportunity to take advantage of fortified scale to leverage our immensely valuable sports and entertainment rights as well as a boosting our ability to collect permissioned customer data.
 
We await regulatory approval and discussion over details continues with our partner, Telstra. But once completed, the combined company is expected to make a substantial contribution to our revenue and EBITDA and fundamentally transform the nature of News Corp.
 
There was another fundamental change last month which also bodes well for our future, and that of other premium use provider. Google said it would end First Click Free, a seemingly innocently titled policy that undermined business models and damaged providence in societies by banishing premium subscription content. As many of you are aware, Rupert, Lachlan and I, along with our colleagues at News Corp, have long taken a principled and often solitary stand to protect intellectual property and safeguard journalism, so we appreciate this significant first step taken by Google. We will, of course, be monitoring the effect of this change across our mastheads even as we continue our discussions with Google and with Facebook about the ways we can profitably connect readers with our mastheads.
 
We continue to be deeply concerned by the abusive algorithms and by an adulterated digital ad market, which had promised transparency but has delivered opacity, undermining the confidence of advertisers in the digital marketplace. It is clear that advertisers want their products to be promoted on sites that enhance, not tarnish, their image and that they want metrics that are reliable, not risible.
 
And while on the subject of premium content, let us delve into the News and Information segment, which fared well this quarter with digital subscriptions up at The Wall Street Journal and at other mastheads across the company. Despite the continued challenging advertising trends, our cost consciousness and steady circulation growth helped drive EBITDA growth of 59% in the segment. 
 
At Dow Jones, digital accounted for 60% of revenues, a record number. Circulation revenues grew 11% and professional information business revenues increased by 5%, led by risk and compliance with a strong 35% increase year-over-year. We saw continued subscriber volume growth at The Wall Street Journal with over 2.2 million total subscribers, approximately 60% of them digital. The ongoing implementation of the WSJ 2020 strategy helped to reduce costs while increasing efficiency.
 
At the New York Post, we saw digital audience growth of 30% to 84 million unique visitors in September compared to the prior year. Clearly, our U.S. mastheads have a large audience, respected brands and measurable meaningful metrics. With the upcoming launch of News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, we will leverage our quality journalism to connect advertisers with our fast-growing U.S. audience, which reached 115 million monthly unique visitors in September. That number is deduped unlike many inflated numbers in the digital world, better to be deduped than duped.
 
At news in Australia, we emerged as the #1 digital network across all key categories. And total digital subscribers across our mastheads, including ARM, grew more than 30% to over 375,000. Meanwhile, costs continue to be diligently managed by Michael Miller and his team as the composition of the business evolves. Susan Panuccio will explain shortly in more detail.
 
At News UK, Sun Digital continues to outpace the competition in growth across all devices with 85 million monthly average uniques globally in the quarter based on ABCe. We're also gaining on the competition in the U.K., and according to comScore U.K., Sun Digital is now the largest news brand on mobile in the U.K. 
Audience engagement is on the rise and digital advertising revenues doubled versus the prior year. This summer saw the launch of the Sun Savers digital reward program targeted for casual print buyers. By the end of the first quarter, there were approximately 300,000 registered users, each of whom had provided extra data intelligence in return for genuine discounts from select Sun partners. 
Total subscriptions were up across The Times and The Sunday Times as well, exceeding 450,000 at quarter's end, driven in part by new subscriptions campaign. Digital subscriptions grew 17% in the quarter to 212,000, proving that high-quality journalism will attract a discerning paying audience.
 
Meanwhile at Wireless Group, which Rebekah Brooks and her team have successfully integrated, we saw the arrival of high-profile talent, particularly at talkSPORT radio, spurring both digital audience growth and Internet-only listening. We have also made progress with exclusive sports rights, including a 4-fight boxing package and the NFL, which is growing in popularity in the U.K.
 
In a world of murky social media and user-generated content, which is too often abuser-generated content, Storyful is playing an increasingly important role, verifying facts and assisting companies and brands subject to virulent attacks. Storyful, under its new CEO, Sharb Farjami, cannot only sift fact from fiction but provide risk analysis for its expanding roster of clients.
 
Turning to digital real estate. Overall segment EBITDA is up 42% with 20% revenue growth, meaning that the segment was once again the biggest contributor to News Corp's profitability. At Move, home of realtor.com, we saw core real estate revenues grow 21% as the U.S. property market continued its gradual recovery from the financial crisis. 
 
From a macro perspective, only 5.4% of mortgage holders were underwater compared to 7.1% last year and a peak of 26% in 2009 according to Corelogic. Overall, revenue growth of 15% was partially offset by the $3 million decline in revenue associated with the TigerLead divestiture last November when we chose to focus on the core leads in listening space business. Excluding the impact from the sale, we saw growth at Move of 19% in toto, putting it in prime position to benefit from the continuing recovery in real estate.
 
We are also increasing our focus on New York City, where realtor.com is developing its services, brand and reputation, taking advantage of the conflict between a lesser competitor and real estate companies, agents and brokers, who have wearied of its arrogance and impetuosity and, who rightly fear its long-term ambition to disintermediate agents and brokers. Across the nation, realtor.com has the most ML-listed for sale homes that are updated every 15 minutes to the benefit of vendors, potential buyers and realtors.
 
In Australia at REA, we're empowering consumers with REA's acquisition of Smartline, a savvy mortgage broking franchise and its new home loan business, which is being developed in conjunction with National Australia Bank.
 
Building the financial segment of the business has been an important component of REA's growth strategy, and the extension into the more huge broker business is a sensible step forward. Meanwhile, REA remains the clear leader in Australia's digital real estate markets, with the listing environment performing particularly well in Sydney and Melbourne, and the core residential business remaining very strong.
 
We saw another solid quarter in Book Publishing, where HarperCollins experienced both revenue and EBITDA growth, powered by the continued success of Hillbilly Elegy and The Subtle Art of Not Giving an (Expletive) as well as the strength of new releases such as Daniel Silva's House of Spies, Karin Slaughter's The Good Daughter and others. New for the second quarter, we have Capital Gaines by Chip Gaines, the latest addition of the popular series, The Pioneer Woman Cooks by Ree Drummond and Bruce Dickinson's autobiography. As you erudite folk on the call will appreciate, Mr. Dickinson is the lead vocalist of Iron Maiden.
 
Looking ahead, HarperCollins is taking advantage of its global English rights to Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express to market the book in conjunction with the imminent release of Fox's movie of the same name. The denouement is worth the price of both the film and the book. 
 
At Foxtel, there was improved volume growth in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year, led by the strength of Foxtel Now. Foxtel also benefited from lower churn in the quarter. And this week, the company announced the launch of a new IP streaming device as it focuses on improving the user experience. 
 
Fox Sports Australia had revenue growth due to higher affiliate revenues, which more than offset lower ad revenues. And the network also saw a boost from the McGregor-Mayweather fight, which highlighted the potential value of pay-per-view offerings in a sports-hungry Australia. We're excited about the upcoming launch of Watch NRL, a global IP product, which follows the success of Watch IFL as we continue to expand the breadth of product offering of Fox Sports Australia and proselytize the virtues of Australian sports.
 
Before I turn things over to our esteemed CFO, Susan Panuccio, it is worth reiterating that our first quarter was an auspicious way to begin a new fiscal year, with revenue growth and increased profitability across the company. We saw the fruits of much labor to make this a more global and digital company, one increasingly defined by its growing digital real estate business and complemented by more recurring revenues from our cable and satellite businesses and subscription media offerings.
 
We do have reason for optimism about the future of our premium mastheads in light of Google's reforms and our ongoing discussions with Facebook, and most importantly because of the enduring quality of our journalism.

We reported fiscal 2018 first quarter total revenues of around $2.1 billion, an increase of $93 million or 5% compared to th",1691,"Thank you, Robert.
 
Turning to the financials. We delivered very strong operating results for the first fiscal quarter of 2018. We reported fiscal 2018 first quarter total revenues of around $2.1 billion, an increase of $93 million or 5% compared to the prior year. Of that increase, acquisitions and divestments accounted for $51 million and currency added $26 million, with the balance being operational. Excluding those items, adjusted revenues grew 1%.
 
Reported total segment EBITDA was $249 million compared to $130 million in the prior year, up 92% versus the prior year. Reported results include a benefit of $46 million from the reversal with previously accrued net liabilities related to certain employment taxes in the U.K. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestments, foreign currency and the U.K. newspaper masses, adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter grew 46%. For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.12 compared to a loss of $0.03 in the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.07 compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year.
 
Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 2% compared to the prior year. The Wireless Group and the Australian Regional Media, or ARM, acquisitions contributed $54 million and FX contributed $14 million this quarter. Within segment revenues, advertising was flat and circulation and subscription revenues increased 3%.
 
News and Information Services reported segment EBITDA this quarter with $73 million or up 59% versus the prior year, led by an improvement at Dow Jones, ongoing cost initiatives, lower investment spending at Checkout 51 and the absence of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Wireless Group in the prior year.
  
I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operation divisions. At Dow Jones, total revenues rose 2%. Within that, advertising revenue declined 10% versus the prior year and saw a modest improvement from the fourth quarter decline due to a slight uplift in financial spending while the business to consumer and technology categories remained challenging. 
 
Digital accounted for approximately 38% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter, the highest percentage in its history, up from 33% in financial year '17. Total subscriber volumes at The Wall Street Journal across all formats was over 2.2 million, a 13% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital-only subscriptions, which rose approximately 36% versus the prior year to $1.3 million and represented 58% of the total subscribers versus 48% in the prior year.
 
Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones was 11% for the quarter, driven by the digital volume gains and higher subscription pricing. As mentioned by Robert, professional information business revenues grew 5% in the first quarter, continuing to accelerate from prior quarter levels, led by risk and compliance, which grew 35%, marking the strongest year-over-year performance since 2014. 
 
In Q1, professional information business revenues represented slightly less than 1/3 of Dow Jones revenues. The Wall Street Journal 2020 program, as previously discussed, is not only about cost transformation but also focuses on The Wall Street Journal becoming a digital-first organization, including more aggressively expanding our digital offerings internationally. 
 
Over the past year, Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions have nearly doubled in Europe and have grown by almost 70% in Asia. Our international footprint is being further expanded by the global reach of our conferences, including the launch of the Tokyo CEO Council and the WSJ D.Live in Hong Kong. 
 
At News Australia, total revenues rose 4%, helped by the integration of the ARM acquisition and foreign currency benefits. Advertising revenues for the quarter increased 3% or declined 1% in local currency, helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, advertising revenues declined approximately 10% in local currency, relatively similar to the prior quarter.
 
Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 6% or up 2% in local currency as the acquisition of ARM, cover price increases and higher-paid digital subscriptions were partially offset by print volume declines in the sale of the Sunday Times last year.
 
Regarding our ongoing cost transformation, we remain particularly focused on News Australia, given its reliance on print and higher exposure to advertising revenues. While we are currently targeting at least AUD 40 million in cost reductions this year, the team in Australia are already pacing well ahead of that as they continue to be cost focused, together with continuing their review of the broader regional and community newspaper portfolio following the acquisition of ARM.
 
The team's focus in Australia is not just to remove legacy costs but to ensure the cost structure is right-sized for the business moving forward. Australia is also making steady progress in the digital conversion, with digital subscribers across the News Australia mastheads now reaching more than 375,000 paid subscribers, including the ARM properties, which is over 30% higher than the prior year.
 
At News UK, total revenues were down 6%. Advertising revenues declined 9%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate due to continued but moderating print advertising declines at The Times and The Sun and an acceleration in digital advertising at The Sun, driven by higher audience and improved engagement. Circulation revenues at News UK were down 5% as volume declines at The Sun more than offset cover price increases. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 4% due to ongoing weakness in freestanding insert revenues, which had 2 fewer inserts versus the prior year.
 
Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $401 million and segment EBITDA increased 4% to $50 million. Titles to highlight this quarter included Daniel Silva's House of Spies and Karin Slaughter's The Good Daughter as well as carryover sales from  J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy. 
 
Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 6% to represent 21% of consumer revenues compared to 20% in the prior year due to strength in downloadable audiobooks. In Digital Real Estate Services, segment revenues increased 20% to $271 million and adjusted revenues increased 19%. Reported segment EBITDA was $95 million versus $67 million last year, up 42%.
 
REA Group revenues grew 22% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency, partially offset by the divestment of the European businesses last year. Listing volume were stable this quarter but importantly saw a pickup in New South Wales and Victoria. Please refer to REA's earnings release and the conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.
 
 
Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $107 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from strong growth in lead volume as well as improved pricing optimization in inventory management. TigerLead, which was divested in November 2016, contributed $3 million of revenues in the prior period. Excluding that, revenue growth would have been approximately 19%. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com grew to 55 million for the quarter, rising mid-single digits from the prior year. 
In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $17 million or 13% to $145 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added $11 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel. Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose to $27 million from $14 million due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the rollout of the FOX LEAGUE channel, a network dedicated to the NRL, which led to a benefit of approximately $10 million this quarter. The results also reflect lower other sports programming rights costs, including impact on the absence of Australia versus Sri Lanka cricket tour in the prior year. With respect to equity losses/earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $10 million this quarter compared to $15 million in last quarter.
 
Foxtel revenues for the quarter rose 2% to $263 million but declined 2% in local currency. EBITDA decreased 15% to $122 million and was down 18% in local currency due to planned increases in sports rights costs of approximately $24 million, primarily related to the new IFL contract, partially offset by lower transmission and sales and marketing costs.
 
Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.8 million subscribers, up 2% versus the fourth quarter driven by the rollout of Foxtel Now. In the first quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 12.7%, down from 15.5% last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86.
 
For the quarter, capital expenditures were $62 million compared to $49 million in the prior year, with increases driven by higher IT spending. However, overall CapEx in fiscal 2018 should be in line with the prior year.
 
Looking forward to the second quarter, there are a few points I would like to make. At News and Information Services, print advertising trading conditions remain challenging and visibility is limited. We expect ongoing print advertising headwinds and we'll continue to focus on cost efficiencies accordingly. 
 
In addition, News America Marketing will again have 2 less freestanding inserts in the quarter, similar to the first quarter. We expect Fox Sports Australia to face higher costs in the second quarter, a reversal from quarter 1 due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year. We expect over AUD 25 million in higher costs for the second quarter compared to the prior year period. For the full year, we continue to expect AUD 30 million to AUD 40 million in higher costs, mostly related to the NRL, much of which should be offset by higher affiliate revenues and production cost initiatives.
 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, notable new releases this quarter include Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman Cooks: Come and Get It! and Capital Gaines from Chip Gaines, co-author of The Magnolia Story. 
 
At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong growth in REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business and continued growth at Realtor.   
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And clearly, the changes that Google have made to First Click Free, I -- the abolition of it will itself create an environment, an ecosystem, which is itself more conducive to subscription because the fact was that Google was punishing/banishing premium content by not indexing it. And so the early signs are positive but they're, of course, early.

And frankly, those things have happened. We're really copying the model that Lachlan Murdoch have envisaged with the initial investment in REA back many years ago. And look, we're not complacent for a second because while it's obviously strong growth there and you remember this time last year, it was single-digit growth in revenue. It's now well into double digits. We are constantly reflecting on what we can do better, how we can serve realtors more efficiently but also how we can drive revenue and EBITDA growth for the benefit of all our shareholders."
