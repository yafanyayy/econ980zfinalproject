Now let's review our fourth quarter results. Quarterly revenues were $1.265 billion, down 1% on a same-day constant currency basis and down 3% on a reported basis from the year-ago period. Income per share was $0.61. Cash flow from operations was $82 million in the fourth quarter, and capital expenditures were $20 million.
We returned $28 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.22 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $51 million. We have 6.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan. These results were within the range of guidance we provided last quarter.
Robert Half continued to benefit from a tightening job market and solid service demand domestically and in our non-U.S. markets during the fourth quarter. International staffing operations performed particularly well, and Protiviti also reported year-over-year revenue gains. For a while now we've highlighted on these calls our unlevered return on equity, which remained strong during the quarter at 29%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

As Max just noted, global revenues were $1.265 billion in the fourth quarter. This is down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2015 on a reported basis and down 1% on a same-day constant currency basis.
Fourth quarter staffing revenues were down 2% on a same-day constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $845 million in the fourth quarter, down 4% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $219 million, up 5% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
The fourth quarter had 61.4 billing days compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. The current quarter has 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the fourth quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.6%. Global revenues for Protiviti were $201 million in the fourth quarter with $170 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 5% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis.
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 5% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were also up 5%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth by 0.5%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter. This is a 70 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads and lower insurance and payroll tax costs. Our fourth quarter results include $4.3 million in workers' compensation credits pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers' compensation accruals.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 8.9% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down 30 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 50 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.5%. Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $57 million or 28.3% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $62 million or 32.0% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 33.6% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.5% in the previous year's fourth quarter. We ended 2016 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, flat with the prior year. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.0% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2016 with 4,000 full-time employees and contractors for Protiviti, up 5% from the prior year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $105 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income, a decrease of 9% from the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.4%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $14 million in the fourth quarter, down 22% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 14.4%. Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $20 million, a decrease of 26% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 10%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $703 million. Implied days sales outstanding was 50.6 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw during the fourth quarter of 2016 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency. During the quarter, average daily revenues for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions were essentially flat with the immediately preceding third quarter. In years past, we often had sequential growth during this period. Accordingly, on a year-over-year basis, our growth rates were a negative and became slightly more negative as the quarter progressed. We exited the quarter down 2.5% in December versus the prior year compared to a 1.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of January was down 2.6% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement negative revenue growth rates were fairly consistent throughout the quarter, with December revenues down 4.2% versus a 4.9% decline for the full quarter. So far in January, permanent placement revenues are down 18.8% compared to the same period last year. This information is designed to offer a glimpse in the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time, and they cover holiday periods, which can be volatile.
With that said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenue, $1,250,000,000 to $1,310,000,000; income per share, $0.55 to $0.61. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 2% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis, including Protiviti and an EPS decline of 9%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We ended the year with annual revenues that once again surpassed $5 billion and in fact, reached an all-time high. We saw solid demand across-the-board for our professional staffing and consulting divisions, although clients were more cautious during the quarter, particularly in December. All indications are that the U.S. job market continues to tighten. Unemployment for college-degreed workers 25 years and older is just 2.5% today. This is placing pressure on the labor supply, particularly at higher skill levels. And the number of temporary workers as a percentage of the overall U.S. workforce remains near an all-time high, a sign employers are building flexible staffing options into their human resources plans with increasing frequency.
We're also encouraged by recent data from the National Federation of Independent Business that showed that while hiring levels did not increase in the fourth quarter, small business optimism reached its highest level since December 2004. Outside the United States, we also see improving markets. Our international staffing operations had a solid fourth quarter.
As we look at the coming year, we are optimistic about the technology investments we've made, which are designed to foster and accelerate continued innovation. In 2016, we migrated our global staffing teams to a new unified front-office CRM system, and we moved Protiviti's North American operations to a new resource management system.
Going forward, we will continue to expand our client- and candidate-facing digital functionality. We've already introduced new online services, including the ability to search candidate profiles on our websites. To serve up the best matches, we've developed intelligent matching algorithms based on nearly 70 years of placement experience, and we're constantly working to improve these algorithms through machine learning.
We offer innovative matching technology to find temporary and full-time job candidates with the right skills, but technology alone cannot produce the correct fit. There are many steps in the staffing and onboarding processes, including assessing the chemistry and business culture fit between the employer and the job candidate and in the case of temporary assignments, the person's availability. Our major competitive advantage lies in the combination of technology and personal service that we provide because it gives our clients the best opportunity to avoid costly and disruptive staffing mistakes and find the right person every time for their business needs.
Finally, a few closing notes about Protiviti, which had a solid fourth quarter. We are optimistic about the considerable opportunities in the year ahead for this business. Protiviti has focused on diversifying its service offerings, developing and growing a loyal client base and hiring, rewarding great talent, all with very good results. This business is seeing solid demand across all practice areas right now. 
At this time, Keith and I would be happy to respond to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator? Hello, operator?"

As it relates to U.S. trends and tone of business, on the one hand, conversationally, our people would tell you that client optimism, client sentiment has clearly and markedly improved. That said, when you look at their actual activity levels as we speak, there's a little sense of urgency. They're waiting for the perfect candidate. They take more time to vet, more time to interview. It's more a wait and see and show me as it relates to the more optimistic view that they have as confirmed by the NFIB study that we cited, the University of Michigan sentiment index, the PMI services that came out today. So our clients clearly feel better. They're more optimistic, but that's in the future. And they're waiting to see more activity in their business before their hiring activity reflects that. I'd say there's not a particular vertical concentration. It's pretty much across-the-board. Our clients across our verticals are pretty much middle-market companies. From a supply-and-demand standpoint, we would observe it's more about demand than it is supply. On the one hand, when they wait for the perfect candidate, you have fewer perfect candidates than you have candidates overall. That said, if there was more urgency in their need, they would be more accepting of the best candidate available. So our people would tell you between having more A-level orders versus having more candidates, they would take more orders than they would take candidates. Having said that, we would observe that our order levels have improved in the New Year, which would be expected following the holidays, which we have experienced again this year. So tone of business, the conversations are more upbeat. There are more -- there's more optimism, but as far as actual hard making placements, getting starts on the temp side, it remains sluggish."

Gross margin, we don't have in the first quarter the payroll tax and insurance true-up credits that we had in the fourth quarter, and those credits are about 68 basis points when you add workers' comp to state and federal unemployment. So the absence of those credits impacts profitability clearly. Further, your SG&A dollars are about even year-on-year, but your slightly lower revenues give you some negative leverage. And then Protiviti, seasonally, the first quarter is their seasonally slowest quarter. So if we're looking sequentially, they're -- they never do in the first quarter what they do in the fourth. But I will say this. If you look at that sequential trend, there's less falloff in our guidance in Q1 '17 sequentially in their operating income than was the case in Q1 '16. So that's a good thing. So generally speaking, it's less revenue. It's the absence of the true-up credits. The tax rate will be higher. So the tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6%, which was a little under trend, which is 38-ish. Our tax rate guidance for the first quarter is somewhere between 38.25%, 38.5%, and there's always volatility right there. So a little of it's tax rate as well, but it's mostly revenues, a couple points lower, gross margin, the absence of the credits, SG&A, a little negative leverage because of the revenues and a higher tax rate."

The view of Protiviti is the anti-money laundering piece of what they do probably doesn't get impacted very much by propose changes to regulations. If anything, to the extent it relates to protecting our border, it might get better before it gets worse. On the consumer lending side, while there is some discussion about relaxing the CFPB and other consumer lending, the thought there is based on what's been proposed at least. There's not that there be a significant impact. On the positive side, the discussions about cyber and the importance of cyber and the regulations related to cyber, particularly for FSI, would be an opportunity for us because of the technology consulting practice that Protiviti has is very focused on securing, and cyber would be right in their wheelhouse. Further, Protiviti typically works with the largest of the money center banks, and it's viewed that the banks that would most benefit from a relaxed regulatory environment would be more the middle market, the non-money center banks to the extent SIFI designation moves to a larger size and probably won't impact Protiviti's clients as well as smaller financial institutions. So net-net, the view internally at least as to what's understood today is that it shouldn't have significant negative impact. And on the cyber side, there could be some upside."

I'll tell you in 30 years, we've never seen anything like that, nor would it be our expectation that, that'd be the case here, particularly since it's income tax and not payroll tax. If it were a payroll tax, it would be more germane to the discussion with our clients but since we're talking about an income tax, it's our view that it would not get competed away in that we would then -- our cash flow would benefit -- which would ultimately benefit the level of repurchases and dividends we can do with that cash flow."

Now let's review our fourth quarter results. Quarterly revenues were $1.265 billion, down 1% on a same-day constant currency basis and down 3% on a reported basis from the year-ago period. Income per share was $0.61. Cash flow from operations was $82 million in the fourth quarter, and capital expenditures were $20 million.
We returned $28 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.22 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $51 million. We have 6.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan. These results were within the range of guidance we provided last quarter.
Robert Half continued to benefit from a tightening job market and solid service demand domestically and in our non-U.S. markets during the fourth quarter. International staffing operations performed particularly well, and Protiviti also reported year-over-year revenue gains. For a while now we've highlighted on these calls our unlevered return on equity, which remained strong during the quarter at 29%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

As Max just noted, global revenues were $1.265 billion in the fourth quarter. This is down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2015 on a reported basis and down 1% on a same-day constant currency basis.
Fourth quarter staffing revenues were down 2% on a same-day constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $845 million in the fourth quarter, down 4% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $219 million, up 5% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
The fourth quarter had 61.4 billing days compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. The current quarter has 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the fourth quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.6%. Global revenues for Protiviti were $201 million in the fourth quarter with $170 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 5% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis.
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 5% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were also up 5%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth by 0.5%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter. This is a 70 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads and lower insurance and payroll tax costs. Our fourth quarter results include $4.3 million in workers' compensation credits pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers' compensation accruals.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 8.9% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down 30 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 50 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.5%. Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $57 million or 28.3% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $62 million or 32.0% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 33.6% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.5% in the previous year's fourth quarter. We ended 2016 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, flat with the prior year. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.0% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2016 with 4,000 full-time employees and contractors for Protiviti, up 5% from the prior year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $105 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income, a decrease of 9% from the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.4%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $14 million in the fourth quarter, down 22% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 14.4%. Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $20 million, a decrease of 26% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 10%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $703 million. Implied days sales outstanding was 50.6 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw during the fourth quarter of 2016 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency. During the quarter, average daily revenues for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions were essentially flat with the immediately preceding third quarter. In years past, we often had sequential growth during this period. Accordingly, on a year-over-year basis, our growth rates were a negative and became slightly more negative as the quarter progressed. We exited the quarter down 2.5% in December versus the prior year compared to a 1.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of January was down 2.6% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement negative revenue growth rates were fairly consistent throughout the quarter, with December revenues down 4.2% versus a 4.9% decline for the full quarter. So far in January, permanent placement revenues are down 18.8% compared to the same period last year. This information is designed to offer a glimpse in the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time, and they cover holiday periods, which can be volatile.
With that said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenue, $1,250,000,000 to $1,310,000,000; income per share, $0.55 to $0.61. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 2% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis, including Protiviti and an EPS decline of 9%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We ended the year with annual revenues that once again surpassed $5 billion and in fact, reached an all-time high. We saw solid demand across-the-board for our professional staffing and consulting divisions, although clients were more cautious during the quarter, particularly in December. All indications are that the U.S. job market continues to tighten. Unemployment for college-degreed workers 25 years and older is just 2.5% today. This is placing pressure on the labor supply, particularly at higher skill levels. And the number of temporary workers as a percentage of the overall U.S. workforce remains near an all-time high, a sign employers are building flexible staffing options into their human resources plans with increasing frequency.
We're also encouraged by recent data from the National Federation of Independent Business that showed that while hiring levels did not increase in the fourth quarter, small business optimism reached its highest level since December 2004. Outside the United States, we also see improving markets. Our international staffing operations had a solid fourth quarter.
As we look at the coming year, we are optimistic about the technology investments we've made, which are designed to foster and accelerate continued innovation. In 2016, we migrated our global staffing teams to a new unified front-office CRM system, and we moved Protiviti's North American operations to a new resource management system.
Going forward, we will continue to expand our client- and candidate-facing digital functionality. We've already introduced new online services, including the ability to search candidate profiles on our websites. To serve up the best matches, we've developed intelligent matching algorithms based on nearly 70 years of placement experience, and we're constantly working to improve these algorithms through machine learning.
We offer innovative matching technology to find temporary and full-time job candidates with the right skills, but technology alone cannot produce the correct fit. There are many steps in the staffing and onboarding processes, including assessing the chemistry and business culture fit between the employer and the job candidate and in the case of temporary assignments, the person's availability. Our major competitive advantage lies in the combination of technology and personal service that we provide because it gives our clients the best opportunity to avoid costly and disruptive staffing mistakes and find the right person every time for their business needs.
Finally, a few closing notes about Protiviti, which had a solid fourth quarter. We are optimistic about the considerable opportunities in the year ahead for this business. Protiviti has focused on diversifying its service offerings, developing and growing a loyal client base and hiring, rewarding great talent, all with very good results. This business is seeing solid demand across all practice areas right now.

As it relates to U.S. trends and tone of business, on the one hand, conversationally, our people would tell you that client optimism, client sentiment has clearly and markedly improved. That said, when you look at their actual activity levels as we speak, there's a little sense of urgency. They're waiting for the perfect candidate. They take more time to vet, more time to interview. It's more a wait and see and show me as it relates to the more optimistic view that they have as confirmed by the NFIB study that we cited, the University of Michigan sentiment index, the PMI services that came out today. So our clients clearly feel better. They're more optimistic, but that's in the future. And they're waiting to see more activity in their business before their hiring activity reflects that. I'd say there's not a particular vertical concentration. It's pretty much across-the-board. Our clients across our verticals are pretty much middle-market companies. From a supply-and-demand standpoint, we would observe it's more about demand than it is supply. On the one hand, when they wait for the perfect candidate, you have fewer perfect candidates than you have candidates overall. That said, if there was more urgency in their need, they would be more accepting of the best candidate available. So our people would tell you between having more A-level orders versus having more candidates, they would take more orders than they would take candidates. Having said that, we would observe that our order levels have improved in the New Year, which would be expected following the holidays, which we have experienced again this year. So tone of business, the conversations are more upbeat. There are more -- there's more optimism, but as far as actual hard making placements, getting starts on the temp side, it remains sluggish."

Gross margin, we don't have in the first quarter the payroll tax and insurance true-up credits that we had in the fourth quarter, and those credits are about 68 basis points when you add workers' comp to state and federal unemployment. So the absence of those credits impacts profitability clearly. Further, your SG&A dollars are about even year-on-year, but your slightly lower revenues give you some negative leverage. And then Protiviti, seasonally, the first quarter is their seasonally slowest quarter. So if we're looking sequentially, they're -- they never do in the first quarter what they do in the fourth. But I will say this. If you look at that sequential trend, there's less falloff in our guidance in Q1 '17 sequentially in their operating income than was the case in Q1 '16. So that's a good thing. So generally speaking, it's less revenue. It's the absence of the true-up credits. The tax rate will be higher. So the tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6%, which was a little under trend, which is 38-ish. Our tax rate guidance for the first quarter is somewhere between 38.25%, 38.5%, and there's always volatility right there. So a little of it's tax rate as well, but it's mostly revenues, a couple points lower, gross margin, the absence of the credits, SG&A, a little negative leverage because of the revenues and a higher tax rate."

To the extent that the industry uses fewer H1Bs and therefore, everybody focuses on the domestic supply, potentially that tightens the supply. And generally speaking, we would think that's a good thing. I mean, it's already tight at the high end on the development side. But as I said earlier, if you ask our people, technology included, technology development included, they would tell you that they take more orders if they had to choose between more orders and more supply. So we don't expect that the supply thing is growth constraining to a significant degree, and H1B certainly directly won't impact our business. Potentially, they could indirectly impact it."

If anything, to the extent it relates to protecting our border, it might get better before it gets worse. On the consumer lending side, while there is some discussion about relaxing the CFPB and other consumer lending, the thought there is, based on what's been proposed at least, there's not view that there'd be a significant impact. On the positive side, the discussions about cyber and the importance of cyber and the regulations related to cyber, particularly for FSI, would be an opportunity for us because the technology consulting practice that Protiviti has is very focused on security, and cyber would be right in their wheelhouse. Further, Protiviti typically works with the largest of the money center banks, and it's viewed that the banks that would most benefit from a relaxed regulatory environment would be more the middle market, the non-money center banks to the extent the SIFI designation moves to a larger size. It probably isn't going to impact Protiviti's clients as much as it would smaller financial institutions. So net-net, it's -- the view internally at least as to what's understood today is that it shouldn't have significant negative impact. And on the cyber side, there could be some upside."

And clearly, our supply of perfect candidates is different than our supply of solid candidates, and therefore, one could say that our growth is being constrained by candidate supply. However, we wouldn't really articulate it that way because in a normal demand environment where there's more sense of urgency to get your projects done, to get your people hired, they're more flexible in adjusting to market conditions the candidates that are available.

Now let's review our fourth quarter results. Quarterly revenues were $1.265 billion, down 1% on a same-day constant currency basis and down 3% on a reported basis from the year-ago period. Income per share was $0.61. Cash flow from operations was $82 million in the fourth quarter, and capital expenditures were $20 million.
We returned $28 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.22 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $51 million. We have 6.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan. These results were within the range of guidance we provided last quarter.
Robert Half continued to benefit from a tightening job market and solid service demand domestically and in our non-U.S. markets during the fourth quarter. International staffing operations performed particularly well, and Protiviti also reported year-over-year revenue gains. For a while now we've highlighted on these calls our unlevered return on equity, which remained strong during the quarter at 29%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

As Max just noted, global revenues were $1.265 billion in the fourth quarter. This is down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2015 on a reported basis and down 1% on a same-day constant currency basis.
Fourth quarter staffing revenues were down 2% on a same-day constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $845 million in the fourth quarter, down 4% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $219 million, up 5% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
The fourth quarter had 61.4 billing days compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. The current quarter has 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the fourth quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.6%. Global revenues for Protiviti were $201 million in the fourth quarter with $170 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 5% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis.
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 5% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were also up 5%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth by 0.5%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter. This is a 70-basis-point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads and lower insurance and payroll tax costs. Our fourth quarter results include $4.3 million in workers' compensation credits pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers' compensation accruals.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 8.9% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down 30 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 50 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.5%. Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $57 million or 28.3% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $62 million or 32.0% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 33.6% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.5% in the previous year's fourth quarter. We ended 2016 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, flat with the prior year. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.0% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2016 with 4,000 full-time employees and contractors for Protiviti, up 5% from the prior year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $105 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income, a decrease of 9% from the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.4%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $14 million in the fourth quarter, down 22% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 14.4%. Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $20 million, a decrease of 26% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 10%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $703 million. Implied days sales outstanding was 50.6 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw during the fourth quarter of 2016 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency. During the quarter, average daily revenues for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions were essentially flat with the immediately preceding third quarter. In years past, we often had sequential growth during this period. Accordingly, on a year-over-year basis, our growth rates were a negative and became slightly more negative as the quarter progressed. We exited the quarter down 2.5% in December versus the prior year compared to a 1.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of January was down 2.6% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement negative revenue growth rates were fairly consistent throughout the quarter, with December revenues down 4.2% versus a 4.9% decline for the full quarter. So far in January, permanent placement revenues are down 18.8% compared to the same period last year. This information is designed to offer a glimpse in the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time, and they cover holiday periods, which can be volatile.
With that said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenue, $1,250,000,000 to $1,310,000,000; income per share, $0.55 to $0.61. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 2% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis, including Protiviti and an EPS decline of 9%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We ended the year with annual revenues that once again surpassed $5 billion and in fact, reached an all-time high. We saw solid demand across-the-board for our professional staffing and consulting divisions, although clients were more cautious during the quarter, particularly in December. All indications are that the U.S. job market continues to tighten. Unemployment for college-degreed workers 25 years and older is just 2.5% today. This is placing pressure on the labor supply, particularly at higher skill levels. And the number of temporary workers as a percentage of the overall U.S. workforce remains near an all-time high, a sign employers are building flexible staffing options into their human resources plans with increasing frequency.
We're also encouraged by recent data from the National Federation of Independent Business that showed that while hiring levels did not increase in the fourth quarter, small business optimism reached its highest level since December 2004. Outside the United States, we also see improving markets. Our international staffing operations had a solid fourth quarter.
As we look at the coming year, we are optimistic about the technology investments we've made, which are designed to foster and accelerate continued innovation. In 2016, we migrated our global staffing teams to a new unified front-office CRM system, and we moved Protiviti's North American operations to a new resource management system.
Going forward, we will continue to expand our client- and candidate-facing digital functionality. We've already introduced new online services, including the ability to search candidate profiles on our websites. To serve up the best matches, we've developed intelligent matching algorithms based on nearly 70 years of placement experience, and we're constantly working to improve these algorithms through machine learning.
We offer innovative matching technology to find temporary and full-time job candidates with the right skills, but technology alone cannot produce the correct fit. There are many steps in the staffing and onboarding processes, including assessing the chemistry and business culture fit between the employer and the job candidate and in the case of temporary assignments, the person's availability. Our major competitive advantage lies in the combination of technology and personal service that we provide because it gives our clients the best opportunity to avoid costly and disruptive staffing mistakes and find the right person every time for their business needs.
Finally, a few closing notes about Protiviti, which had a solid fourth quarter. We are optimistic about the considerable opportunities in the year ahead for this business. Protiviti has focused on diversifying its service offerings, developing and growing a loyal client base and hiring and rewarding great talent, all with very good results. This business is seeing solid demand across all practice areas right now.

As it relates to U.S. trends and tone of business, on the one hand, conversationally, our people would tell you that client optimism, client sentiment has clearly and markedly improved. That said, when you look at their actual activity levels as we speak, there's little sense of urgency. They're waiting for the perfect candidate. They take more time to vet, more time to interview. It's more a wait and see and show me as it relates to the more optimistic view that they have as confirmed by the NFIB study that we cited, the University of Michigan sentiment index, the PMI services that came out today. So our clients clearly feel better. They're more optimistic, but that's in the future. And they're waiting to see more activity in their business before their hiring activity reflects that. I'd say there's not a particular vertical concentration. It's pretty much across-the-board. Our clients across our verticals are pretty much middle-market companies. From a supply-and-demand standpoint, we would observe it's more about demand than it is supply. On the one hand, when they wait for the perfect candidate, you have fewer perfect candidates than you have candidates overall. That said, if there was more urgency in their need, they would be more accepting of the best candidate available. So our people would tell you between having more A-level orders versus having more candidates, they would take more orders than they would take candidates. Having said that, we would observe that our order levels have improved in the New Year, which would be expected following the holidays, which we have experienced again this year. So tone of business, the conversations are more upbeat. There are more -- there's more optimism, but as far as actual hard making placements, getting starts on the temp side, it remains sluggish."

Gross margin, we don't have in the first quarter the payroll tax and insurance true-up credits that we had in the fourth quarter, and those credits are about 68 basis points when you add workers' comp to state and federal unemployment. So the absence of those credits impacts profitability clearly. Further, your SG&A dollars are about even year-on-year, but your slightly lower revenues give you some negative leverage. And then Protiviti, seasonally, the first quarter is their seasonally slowest quarter. So if we're looking sequentially, they're -- they never do in the first quarter what they do in the fourth. But I will say this. If you look at that sequential trend, there's less falloff in our guidance in Q1 '17 sequentially in their operating income than was the case in Q1 '16. So that's a good thing. So generally speaking, it's less revenue. It's the absence of the true-up credits. The tax rate will be higher. So the tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6%, which was a little under trend, which is 38-ish. Our tax rate guidance for the first quarter is somewhere between 38.25%, 38.5%, and there's always volatility right there. So a little of it's tax rate as well, but it's mostly revenues, a couple points lower, gross margin, the absence of the credits, SG&A, a little negative leverage because of the revenues and a higher tax rate."

If anything, to the extent it relates to protecting our border, it might get better before it gets worse. On the consumer lending side, while there is some discussion about relaxing the CFPB and other consumer lending, the thought there is, based on what's been proposed at least, there's not view that there'd be a significant impact. On the positive side, the discussions about cyber and the importance of cyber and the regulations related to cyber, particularly for FSI, would be an opportunity for us because the technology consulting practice that Protiviti has is very focused on security, and cyber would be right in their wheelhouse. Further, Protiviti typically works with the largest of the money center banks, and it's viewed that the banks that would most benefit from a relaxed regulatory environment would be more the middle market, the non-money center banks to the extent the SIFI designation moves to a larger size. It probably isn't going to impact Protiviti's clients as much as it would smaller financial institutions. So net-net, it's -- the view internally at least as to what's understood today is that it shouldn't have significant negative impact. And on the cyber side, there could be some upside."

Now let's review our fourth quarter results. Quarterly revenues were $1.265 billion, down 1% on a same-day constant currency basis and down 3% on a reported basis from the year-ago period. Income per share was $0.61. Cash flow from operations was $82 million in the fourth quarter, and capital expenditures were $20 million.
We returned $28 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.22 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $51 million. We have 6.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan. These results were within the range of guidance we provided last quarter.
Robert Half continued to benefit from a tightening job market and solid service demand domestically and in our non-U.S. markets during the fourth quarter. International staffing operations performed particularly well, and Protiviti also reported year-over-year revenue gains. For a while now we've highlighted on these calls our unlevered return on equity, which remained strong during the quarter at 29%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

As Max just noted, global revenues were $1.265 billion in the fourth quarter. This is down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2015 on a reported basis and down 1% on a same-day constant currency basis.
Fourth quarter staffing revenues were down 2% on a same-day constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $845 million in the fourth quarter, down 4% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $219 million, up 5% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
The fourth quarter had 61.4 billing days compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. The current quarter has 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the fourth quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.6%. Global revenues for Protiviti were $201 million in the fourth quarter with $170 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 5% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis.
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 5% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were also up 5%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth by 0.5%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38.0% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter. This is a 70-basis-point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads and lower insurance and payroll tax costs. Our fourth quarter results include $4.3 million in workers' compensation credits pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers' compensation accruals.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 8.9% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down 30 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 50 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.5%. Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $57 million or 28.3% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $62 million or 32.0% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 33.6% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.5% in the previous year's fourth quarter. We ended 2016 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, flat with the prior year. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.0% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2016 with 4,000 full-time employees and contractors for Protiviti, up 5% from the prior year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $105 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year. Operating margin was 9.8%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income, a decrease of 9% from the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.4%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $14 million in the fourth quarter, down 22% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 14.4%. Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $20 million, a decrease of 26% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 10%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $703 million. Implied days sales outstanding was 50.6 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw during the fourth quarter of 2016 and so far in January, all adjusted for currency. During the quarter, average daily revenues for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions were essentially flat with the immediately preceding third quarter. In years past, we often had sequential growth during this period. Accordingly, on a year-over-year basis, our growth rates were a negative and became slightly more negative as the quarter progressed. We exited the quarter down 2.5% in December versus the prior year compared to a 1.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of January was down 2.6% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement negative revenue growth rates were fairly consistent throughout the quarter, with December revenues down 4.2% versus a 4.9% decline for the full quarter. So far in January, permanent placement revenues are down 18.8% compared to the same period last year. This information is designed to offer a glimpse in the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time, and they cover holiday periods, which can be volatile.
With that said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: revenue, $1,250,000,000 to $1,310,000,000; income per share, $0.55 to $0.61. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 2% on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis, including Protiviti and an EPS decline of 9%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We ended the year with annual revenues that once again surpassed $5 billion and in fact, reached an all-time high. We saw solid demand across-the-board for our professional staffing and consulting divisions, although clients were more cautious during the quarter, particularly in December. All indications are that the U.S. job market continues to tighten. Unemployment for college-degreed workers 25 years and older is just 2.5% today. This is placing pressure on the labor supply, particularly at higher skill levels. And the number of temporary workers as a percentage of the overall U.S. workforce remains near an all-time high, a sign employers are building flexible staffing options into their human resources plans with increasing frequency.
We're also encouraged by recent data from the National Federation of Independent Business that showed that while hiring levels did not increase in the fourth quarter, small business optimism reached its highest level since December 2004. Outside the United States, we also see improving markets. Our international staffing operations had a solid fourth quarter.
As we look at the coming year, we are optimistic about the technology investments we've made, which are designed to foster and accelerate continued innovation. In 2016, we migrated our global staffing teams to a new unified front-office CRM system, and we moved Protiviti's North American operations to a new resource management system.
Going forward, we will continue to expand our client- and candidate-facing digital functionality. We've already introduced new online services, including the ability to search candidate profiles on our websites. To serve up the best matches, we've developed intelligent matching algorithms based on nearly 70 years of placement experience, and we're constantly working to improve these algorithms through machine learning.
We offer innovative matching technology to find temporary and full-time job candidates with the right skills, but technology alone cannot produce the correct fit. There are many steps in the staffing and onboarding processes, including assessing the chemistry and business culture fit between the employer and the job candidate and in the case of temporary assignments, the person's availability. Our major competitive advantage lies in the combination of technology and personal service that we provide because it gives our clients the best opportunity to avoid costly and disruptive staffing mistakes and find the right person every time for their business needs.
Finally, a few closing notes about Protiviti, which had a solid fourth quarter. We are optimistic about the considerable opportunities in the year ahead for this business. Protiviti has focused on diversifying its service offerings, developing and growing a loyal client base and hiring and rewarding great talent, all with very good results. This business is seeing solid demand across all practice areas right now. 
At this time, Keith and I would be happy to respond to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Operator?"

As it relates to U.S. trends and tone of business, on the one hand, conversationally, our people would tell you that client optimism, client sentiment has clearly and markedly improved. That said, when you look at their actual activity levels as we speak, there's little sense of urgency. They're waiting for the perfect candidate. They take more time to vet, more time to interview. It's more a wait and see and show me as it relates to the more optimistic view that they have as confirmed by the NFIB study that we cited, the University of Michigan sentiment index, the PMI services that came out today. So our clients clearly feel better. They're more optimistic, but that's in the future. And they're waiting to see more activity in their business before their hiring activity reflects that. I'd say there's not a particular vertical concentration. It's pretty much across-the-board. Our clients across our verticals are pretty much middle-market companies. From a supply-and-demand standpoint, we would observe it's more about demand than it is supply. On the one hand, when they wait for the perfect candidate, you have fewer perfect candidates than you have candidates overall. That said, if there was more urgency in their need, they would be more accepting of the best candidate available. So our people would tell you between having more A-level orders versus having more candidates, they would take more orders than they would take candidates. Having said that, we would observe that our order levels have improved in the New Year, which would be expected following the holidays, which we have experienced again this year. So tone of business, the conversations are more upbeat. There are more -- there's more optimism, but as far as actual hard making placements, getting starts on the temp side, it remains sluggish."

Gross margin, we don't have in the first quarter the payroll tax and insurance true-up credits that we had in the fourth quarter, and those credits are about 68 basis points when you add workers' comp to state and federal unemployment. So the absence of those credits impacts profitability clearly. Further, your SG&A dollars are about even year-on-year, but your slightly lower revenues give you some negative leverage. And then Protiviti, seasonally, the first quarter is their seasonally slowest quarter. So if we're looking sequentially, they're -- they never do in the first quarter what they do in the fourth. But I will say this. If you look at that sequential trend, there's less falloff in our guidance in Q1 '17 sequentially in their operating income than was the case in Q1 '16. So that's a good thing. So generally speaking, it's less revenue. It's the absence of the true-up credits. The tax rate will be higher. So the tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6%, which was a little under trend, which is 38-ish. Our tax rate guidance for the first quarter is somewhere between 38.25%, 38.5%, and there's always volatility right there. So a little of it's tax rate as well, but it's mostly revenues, a couple points lower, gross margin, the absence of the credits, SG&A, a little negative leverage because of the revenues and a higher tax rate."

As to changes in the regulatory landscape, as we've talked about before on these calls, FSI regulatory for Protiviti is principally anti-money laundering and consumer lending practices and regulation thereof. The view of Protiviti is the anti-money laundering piece of what they do probably doesn't get impacted very much by proposed changes to regulations. If anything, to the extent it relates to protecting our border, it might get better before it gets worse. On the consumer lending side, while there is some discussion about relaxing the CFPB and other consumer lending, the thought there is, based on what's been proposed at least, there's not view that there'd be a significant impact. On the positive side, the discussions about cyber and the importance of cyber and the regulations related to cyber, particularly for FSI, would be an opportunity for us because the technology consulting practice that Protiviti has is very focused on security, and cyber would be right in their wheelhouse. Further, Protiviti typically works with the largest of the money center banks, and it's viewed that the banks that would most benefit from a relaxed regulatory environment would be more the middle market, the non-money center banks to the extent the SIFI designation moves to a larger size. It probably isn't going to impact Protiviti's clients as much as it would smaller financial institutions. So net-net, it's -- the view internally at least as to what's understood today is that it shouldn't have significant negative impact. And on the cyber side, there could be some upside."

At the end of the day, our types of clients are the types that -- they want to -- they're from Missouri, wait and see, show me and so forth. So I think the good news is the optimism is up. As they start seeing more activity and so forth among their own clients, I think their hiring levels will pick up. They'll move more rapidly. Our placement processes might get condensed. So if you want to be an optimist, there's a lot to be optimistic about. And when Keith talked about the tax proposals that the Trump administration has, I have to admit, it's hard for us to constrain ourselves because I don't see anything negative at all in any of that for us. So that would be a very good thing for us. But I think we'll have to just wait and see what happens.

There have been a few questions about whether that tax savings would be competed away by our competitors essentially returning that through lower bill rates back to the clients. I'll tell you, in 30 years, we've never seen anything like that nor would it be our expectation that, that'd be the case here, particularly since it's an income tax and not a payroll tax. If it were a payroll tax, it would be more germane to the discussion with our clients, but since we're talking about an income tax, it's our view that it would not get competed away and that we would then -- our cash flow would benefit, which would ultimately benefit the level of repurchases and dividends we can do with that cash flow."

Let's review our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Quarterly revenues were $1.287 billion, down 2% on a same-day constant currency basis and down 1% on a reported basis from the first quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.62. Cash flow from operations was $124 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures were $10 million.
We returned $31 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We raised the cash dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.24 per share in February. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $54 million during the quarter. We have 5.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We were pleased with our financial results for the first quarter, particularly our international staffing operations and Protiviti. While the U.S. economic environment is largely stable and the job market is strong, the hiring cycle remains uncharacteristically long as employers take more time to make hiring decisions. Recent reports show a noticeable improvement in optimism about economic prospects, which should shorten the hiring cycle and benefit our business. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the first quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results."

As just noted, global revenues were $1.287 billion in the first quarter. This is down 1% from the first quarter of 2016 on a reported basis and down 2% on a same-day, constant currency basis.
Revenues for our staffing businesses were down 3% in the first quarter on a same-day constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $858 million in the first quarter, down 6% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $233 million, up 9% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The first quarter had 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter of 2016. The second quarter has 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. Currency exchange rates have the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the first quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.5%. 
First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $196 million, with $165 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis. U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 4% from the prior year on a same-day basis and non-U.S. revenues were up 7%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.6%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. 
Gross margin. Now let's talk about gross margin in the first quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of the consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2017, which is flat on a percentage basis compared to last year's first quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.3%.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 27.0% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $51 million or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. 
Staffing, selling, general and administrative costs were 33.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.4% in the previous year's first quarter. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.4% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income for our staffing divisions was $109 million in the first quarter, down 9% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.0%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 8% from 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 9.2%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the first quarter, down 15% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.7%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million, an increase of 16% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 8.6%.
At the end of the first quarter, Accounts Receivable were $700 million. Implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.5 days. 
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and thus far, in April, all adjusted for currency. 
First quarter revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions, while negative, gradually improved during the quarter, led by our international operations. We exited the quarter with March down 2.2% versus the prior year compared to a 2.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first week of April was negative 2.5% compared to the prior year. First quarter global permanent placement revenue growth rates, which were also negative, also improved during the quarter, both in the U.S. and internationally. March revenues were up 3.3% versus last year compared to a 3.1% decline reported for the full quarter. For the first 2 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were down 5.2% compared to the same period last year. This information is designed to provide you with insight into the trends we saw during the first quarter in April. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance: Revenues, $1,275,000,000 to $1,335,000,000; income per share, $0.61 to $0.67. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 3% on a reported basis and 1% adjusted for days and currency and an EPS decline of just under 10%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

Moderate U.S. economic growth in the range of 1.9% to 2.3% is forecast for 2017. Notwithstanding this lower first quarter start, 1.4% GDP growth according to The Wall Street Journal's monthly economic forecasting survey, recent data from several sources, including the NFIB, PMI services activity Index and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, all point to a more upbeat business outlook. We believe the wait and see approach to hiring that has affected our results to date should fade as economic optimism grows. As labor markets continue to tighten, particularly for our professional occupations, we will benefit from our decades of experience helping clients find the right candidates even amid talent shortages. 
Outside of the U.S., we are encouraged by the opportunities afforded by improving economic conditions, particularly in Continental Europe. 
A final note about Protiviti, which had another strong quarter. Protiviti has been broadening its practice areas and now serves clients in a wide range of consulting areas. These include business performance improvement, data management and advance analytics, digital transformation, forensics, technology consulting, internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance and transaction services.

So where as the rate was 37.5 for the first quarter, we're projecting that to go up to about 38.5 in the second quarter. So that's some of it. But if you look at the profitability of the revenue guidance for the second quarter versus the profitability of the revenue guidance for the first quarter, I think you would conclude it's actually a little more profitable because you've got revenue mix favoring per placement, which seasonally has its best quarter in the second quarter. You also have revenue mix favoring Protiviti, which typically does better margin wise in the second quarter than the first. Seasonally, accounting and finance generally in the second quarter is flattish because you've got traditional accounting busy season ending companies file their case, their proxy statements, the private companies file their financial statements with their bankers. So accounting and finance generally in the second quarter treads water, but you get some mixed benefit from perm and from Protiviti. I also need to add. We lose a day in the second quarter, so you get some negative leverage from that. The Easter a year ago fell in the first quarter. Easter this year falls in the second quarter. So whereas typically, you get an extra day in the second quarter sequentially, this year, we actually loose a piece of a day. And then year-on-year, we lose almost a full day. So in the guidance we told you, there was a -- there's a 2-point swing between reported and same-day constant currency implied revenues where you lose a percentage point for billing days and you lose another percentage point for currency, which is principally U.K. Brexit driven."

So on an absolute basis, we did see improvement in March in temp in the U.S., and we certainly saw improvement non-U.S., both in terms of year-over-year rates as well as absolutely. So I want to be clear that temp U.S., March on an absolute basis per day was better than January and February. Just when you compared it to a year ago, the growth rate was about the same. For perm, March was better not only on an absolute basis, but it was better year-on-year as well. We had a very good perm March month. January was a little weak, so March to some degree offset January weakness but we were very pleased with March, particularly in perm, U.S. and non-U.S. When we did our guidance, we took the full quarter average as it worked out, we do a buildup from the bottom when we do our guidance. But when you look at the result, they're slightly better than first quarter average about 1% on a per day basis. We did not dial in March improvement into our second quarter guidance. We hope that's being conservative. So our guidance is a little stronger than the first quarter average, but it is not as strong as March was, temp or perm."

That said, the financial services industry is still very cost focused. And even where we're doing internal audit for financial services firms, there's a margin compression. The good news is Protiviti more than offset that by managing its own internal costs such that we had margin expansion, operating margin expansion year-over-year, which we were pleased with. So the major service [indiscernible] Protiviti internal audit risk and compliance and in and technology consulting, those are still the 3 major service offerings.

I think as an optimist, I think as we improve our digital initiatives, as we share with our clients more and more of our internal technology that lets them participate in the selection and discovery of candidates, it results in more leads to the extent we use our artificial intelligence, our matching algorithms to make better matches. You have a better satisfied client that ultimately snowballs as well. So clearly, relative to prior cycles, we're much more advanced with how we've developed our internal systems, particularly from the point of view and how they're connected and how they interact with our website, which in turn is available to all candidates and clients. Traditionally, our website functionality has been almost exclusively candidate-facing. That's changing rapidly. You can go to our website this second and search our candidate database. You can filter on geography. You can filter on skills. You can filter an education level. You can further benefit from our algorithms where we show -- we map skills that you're searching for to skills that are -- may or not -- that would be relevant as well to what you're searching for. So I think we're light years better in our digital capabilities. We believe long term, the firm that wins has both digital and traditional capabilities. The digital can do a nice job of correlating skills and work experiences. But for things like attitude and professionalism and cultural fit, we still think our human being staff do a better job of that. So I think this hybrid combination of digital and traditional are off-line. I think we've never had that combination of capabilities today that we've had in the past. The other thing I would observe is that we're working together staffing in Protiviti better than we ever have before. We're going to market together. I think the marketplace understands there are certain types of projects that need some kind of project management, but that the staff level can be provided by our traditional staffing organization. So it's a combination together. You get a better price point. You get Big 4 Protiviti level project management. You get staffing specialized staffing feet on The Street, and the combination is effective and the price point's better. So relative to where we've been in prior cycles, we clearly got a better digital offering. That digital offering is well integrated into our traditional offering. And a combination of Protiviti staffing, the blending, the integration, the go-to-market coordination is the best it's ever been."

Let's review our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Quarterly revenues were $1.287 billion, down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis and down 1% on a reported basis from the first quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.62. Cash flow from operations was $124 million in the first quarter, and capital expenditures were $10 million.
We returned $31 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We raised the cash dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.24 per share in February. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $54 million during the quarter. We have 5.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We were pleased with our financial results for the first quarter, particularly our international staffing operations and Protiviti. While the U.S. economic environment is largely stable and the job market is strong, the hiring cycle remains uncharacteristically long as employers take more time to make hiring decisions. Recent reports show a noticeable improvement in optimism about economic prospects, which should shorten the hiring cycle and benefit our business. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the first quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results."

As just noted, global revenues were $1.287 billion in the first quarter. This is down 1% from the first quarter of 2016 on a reported basis and down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.
Revenues for our staffing businesses were down 3% in the first quarter on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $858 million in the first quarter, down 6% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $233 million, up 9% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The first quarter had 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter of 2016. The second quarter has 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
Currency exchange rates have the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the first quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.5%. 
First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $196 million, with $165 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. 
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 4% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were up 7%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.6%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. 
Gross margin. Now let's talk about gross margin in the first quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. 
Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of the consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2017, which is flat on a percentage basis compared to last year's first quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.3%.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 27.0% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $51 million or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. 
Staffing selling, general and administrative costs were 33.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.4% in the previous year's first quarter. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.4% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income for our staffing divisions was $109 million in the first quarter, down 9% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.0%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 8% from 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 9.2%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the first quarter, down 15% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.7%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million, an increase of 16% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 8.6%.
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $700 million. Implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.5 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency. 
First quarter revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions, while negative, gradually improved during the quarter, led by our international operations. We exited the quarter with March down 2.2% versus the prior year compared to a 2.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first week of April was negative 2.5% compared to the prior year. 
First quarter global permanent placement revenue growth rates, which were also negative, also improved during the quarter both in the U.S. and internationally. March revenues were up 3.3% versus last year compared to a 3.1% decline reported for the full quarter. For the first 2 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were down 5.2% compared to the same period last year. 
This information is designed to provide you with insight into the trends we saw during the first quarter in April. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1,275,000,000 to $1,335,000,000; income per share, $0.61 to $0.67. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 3% on a reported basis and 1% adjusted for days and currency and an EPS decline of just under 10%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

As labor markets continue to tighten, particularly for our professional occupations, we will benefit from our decades of experience helping clients find the right candidates even amid talent shortages. Outside the U.S., we are encouraged by the opportunities afforded by improving economic conditions, particularly in Continental Europe. 
A final note about Protiviti, which had another strong quarter. Protiviti has been broadening its practice areas and now serves clients in a wide range of consulting areas. These include business performance improvement, data management and advanced analytics, digital transformation, forensics, technology consulting, internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and transaction services.

So whereas the rate was 37.5% for the first quarter, we're projecting that to go up to about 38.5% in the second quarter. So that's some of it. But if you look at the profitability of the revenue guidance for the second quarter versus the profitability of the revenue guidance for the first quarter, I think you would conclude it's actually a little more profitable because you've got revenue mix favoring per placement, which seasonally has its best quarter in the second quarter. You also have revenue mix favoring Protiviti, which typically does better, margin-wise, in the second quarter than the first. Seasonally, accounting and finance generally in the second quarter is flattish because you've got traditional accounting busy season, ending companies file their case, their proxy statements. The private companies file their financial statements with their bankers. So accounting and finance generally in the second quarter treads water, but you get some mixed benefit from perm and from Protiviti. I also need to add we'll lose a day in the second quarter. So you'll get some negative leverage from that. The Easter a year ago fell in the first quarter. Easter this year falls in the second quarter. So whereas typically, you get an extra day in the second quarter sequentially, this year, we actually lose a piece of a day. And then year-on-year, we lose almost a full day. So in the guidance we told you, there was a -- there's a 2-point swing between reported and same-day, constant-currency implied revenues where you lose a percentage point for billing days and you lose another percentage point for currency, which is principally U.K. Brexit driven."

So if you simply look at revenues per day, in the U.S., temp, they got gradually better even in the U.S., February versus January, March versus February. When you look at year-over-year growth rates for temp U.S., they were pretty constant. So on an absolute basis, we did see improvement in March in temp in the U.S., and we certainly saw improvement non-U.S. both in terms of year-over-year rates as well as absolutely. So I want to be clear that temp U.S., March, on an absolute basis per day, was better than January and February. Just when you compare it to a year ago, the growth rate was about the same. For perm, March was better not only on an absolute basis, but it was better year-on-year as well. We had a very good perm March month. January was a little weak. So March, to some degree, offset January weakness. But we were very pleased with March, particularly in perm, U.S. and non-U.S. When we did our guidance, we took the full quarter average. As it worked out, we do a buildup from the bottom when we do our guidance. But when you look at the result, they're slightly better than first quarter average, about 1% on a per day basis. We did not dial in March improvement into our second quarter guidance. We hope that's being conservative. So our guidance is a little stronger than the first quarter average, but it is not as strong as March was, temp or perm."

The good news is Protiviti more than offset that by managing its own internal cost, such that we had margin expansion, operating margin expansion year-over-year, which we were pleased with. So the major service offerings of Protiviti, internal audit, risk and compliance, and technology consulting, those are still the 3 major service offerings.

And I think the longer the policy uncertainty exists, be it tax reform, be it regulatory reform, be it infrastructure, I think that uncertainty certainly defers the period of time that you see actual improvements in business activity. That said, we had a nice March. We've said it several times now. And it's only 1 month, which is why we didn't roll it all in to our guidance, but we had a nice March. We had more activity in March. We had it in perm, which is typically the most sensitive to macro trends. So we're happy about that.

I think as an optimist, I think as we improve our digital initiatives, as we share with our clients more and more of our internal technology that lets them participate in the selection and discovery of candidates, it ultimately results in more leads to the extent we use our artificial intelligence, our matching algorithms to make better matches. You have a better satisfied client that ultimately snowballs as well. So clearly, relative to prior cycles, we're much more advanced with how we've developed our internal systems, particularly from the point of view and how they're connected and how they interact with our website, which in turn is available to all candidates and clients. Traditionally, our website functionality has been almost exclusively candidate-facing. That's changing rapidly. You can go to our website this second and search our candidate database. You can filter on geography. You can filter on skills. You can filter an education level. You can further benefit from our algorithms, where we show -- we map skills that you're searching for to skills that are -- may or not -- that would be relevant as well to what you're searching for. So I think we're light years better in our digital capabilities. We believe long term, the firm that wins has both digital and traditional capabilities. The digital can do a nice job of correlating skills and work experiences. But for things like attitude and professionalism and cultural fit, we still think our human being staff do a better job of that. So I think this hybrid combination of digital and traditional are off-line. I think we've never had that combination of capabilities today that we've had in the past. The other thing I would observe is that we're working together staffing in Protiviti better than we ever have before. We're going to market together. I think the marketplace understands there are certain type of projects that need some kind of project management but that the staff level can be provided by our traditional staffing organization. So it's a combination together. You get a better price point. You get Big 4 Protiviti level project management. You get staffing, specialized staffing feet on the street, and the combination is effective and the price point is better. So relative to where we've been in prior cycles, we've clearly got a better digital offering. That digital offering is well integrated into our traditional offering. And a combination of Protiviti staffing, the blending, the integration, the go-to-market coordination is the best it's ever been."

So 1 of those 4 was better temp gross margins than we had dialed in. A piece of that were sequentially better conversions, but the bigger piece of that was better spreads. Part of that is a mix issue. As your accounting operations positions and Accountemps are more impacted due to macro, that means your remaining Accountemps business is more staff level versus accounting operations staff level has slightly higher gross margins than accounting operations. So you've got a higher mix of those. So that also helps to explain the increase in gross margins."

Let's review our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Quarterly revenues were $1.287 billion, down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis and down 1% on a reported basis from the first quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.62. Cash flow from operations was $124 million in the first quarter, and capital expenditures were $10 million.
We returned $31 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We raised the cash dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.24 per share in February. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $54 million during the quarter. We have 5.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We were pleased with our financial results for the first quarter, particularly our international staffing operations and Protiviti. While the U.S. economic environment is largely stable and the job market is strong, the hiring cycle remains uncharacteristically long as employers take more time to make hiring decisions. Recent reports show a noticeable improvement in optimism about economic prospects, which should shorten the hiring cycle and benefit our business. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the first quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results."

As just noted, global revenues were $1.287 billion in the first quarter. This is down 1% from the first quarter of 2016 on a reported basis and down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.
Revenues for our staffing businesses were down 3% in the first quarter on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $858 million in the first quarter, down 6% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $233 million, up 9% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The first quarter had 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter of 2016. The second quarter has 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
Currency exchange rates have the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the first quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.5%. 
First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $196 million, with $165 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. 
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 4% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were up 7%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.6%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. 
Gross margin. Now let's talk about gross margin in the first quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. 
Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of a consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2017, which is flat on a percentage basis compared to last year's first quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.3%.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 27.0% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $51 million or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. 
Staffing selling, general and administrative costs were 33.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.4% in the previous year's first quarter. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.4% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income for our staffing divisions was $109 million in the first quarter, down 9% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.0%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 8% from 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 9.2%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the first quarter, down 15% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.7%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million, an increase of 16% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 8.6%.
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $700 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.5 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency. 
First quarter revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions, while negative, gradually improved during the quarter, led by our international operations. We exited the quarter with March down 2.2% versus the prior year compared to a 2.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first week of April was negative 2.5% compared to the prior year. 
First quarter global permanent placement revenue growth rates, which were also negative, also improved during the quarter both in the U.S. and internationally. March revenues were up 3.3% versus last year compared to a 3.1% decline reported for the full quarter. For the first 2 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were down 5.2% compared to the same period last year. 
This information is designed to provide you with insight into the trends we saw during the first quarter in April. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1,275,000,000 to $1,335,000,000; income per share, $0.61 to $0.67. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 3% on a reported basis and 1% adjusted for days and currency and an EPS decline of just under 10%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

Moderate U.S. economic growth in the range of 1.9% to 2.3% is forecast for 2017. Notwithstanding the slower first quarter start, 1.4% GDP growth according to The Wall Street Journal's monthly economic forecasting survey; recent data from several sources, including the NFIB, PMI Services Activity Index and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, all point to a more upbeat business outlook. We believe the wait-and-see approach to hiring that has affected our results to date should fade as economic optimism grows. 
As labor markets continue to tighten, particularly for our professional occupations, we will benefit from our decades of experience helping clients find the right candidates even amid talent shortages. Outside the U.S., we are encouraged by the opportunities afforded by improving economic conditions, particularly in Continental Europe. 
A final note about Protiviti, which had another strong quarter. Protiviti has been broadening its practice areas and now serves clients in a wide range of consulting areas. These include business performance improvement, data management and advanced analytics, digital transformation, forensics, technology consulting, internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and transaction services. We could not be more pleased with the evolution of this business and its strong performance. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to try to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

We did benefit in the first quarter from about $0.01 a share with the new accounting for stock compensation and the tax effects thereof. So whereas the rate was 37.5% for the first quarter, we're projecting that to go up to about 38.5% in the second quarter. So that's some of it. But if you look at the profitability of the revenue guidance for the second quarter versus the profitability of the revenue guidance for the first quarter, I think you would conclude it's actually a little more profitable because you've got revenue mix favoring per placement, which seasonally has its best quarter in the second quarter. You also have revenue mix favoring Protiviti, which typically does better, margin-wise, in the second quarter than the first. Seasonally, accounting and finance generally in the second quarter is flattish because you've got traditional accounting busy season, ending, companies file their Ks, their proxy statements. The private companies file their financial statements with their bankers. So accounting and finance generally in the second quarter treads water, but you get some mixed benefit from perm and from Protiviti. I also need to add we lose a day in the second quarter. So you'll get some negative leverage from that. The Easter a year ago fell in the first quarter. Easter this year falls in the second quarter. So whereas typically, you get an extra day in the second quarter sequentially, this year, we actually lose a piece of a day. And then year-on-year, we lose almost a full day. So in the guidance we told you, there was a -- there's a 2-point swing between reported and same-day, constant-currency implied revenues where you lose a percentage point for billing days and you lose another percentage point for currency, which is principally U.K. Brexit driven."

So if you simply look at revenues per day, in the U.S., temp, they got gradually better even in the U.S., February versus January, March versus February. When you look at year-over-year growth rates for temp U.S., they were pretty constant. So on an absolute basis, we did see improvement in March in temp in the U.S., and we certainly saw improvement non-U.S. both in terms of year-over-year rates as well as absolutely. So I want to be clear that temp U.S., March, on an absolute basis per day, was better than January and February. Just when you compare it to a year ago, the growth rate for us was about the same. For perm, March was better not only on an absolute basis, but it was better year-on-year as well. We had a very good perm March month. January was a little weak. So March, to some degree, offset January weakness. But we were very pleased with March, particularly in perm, U.S. and non-U.S. When we did our guidance, we took the full quarter average. As it worked out, we do a buildup from the bottom when we do our guidance. But when you look at the result, they're slightly better than first quarter average, about 1% on a per day basis. We did not dial in March improvement into our second quarter guidance. We hope that's being conservative. So our guidance is a little stronger than the first quarter average, but it is not as strong as March was, temp or perm."

There's been less higher-margin regulatory compliance work. That has stabilized. It actually grew somewhat this quarter. We were pleased with that. That said, the financial services industry is still very cost-focused. And even where we're doing internal audit for financial services firms, there's some margin compression. The good news is Protiviti more than offset that by managing its own internal cost, such that we had margin expansion, operating margin expansion year-over-year, which we were pleased with. So the major service offerings of Protiviti, internal audit, risk and compliance, and technology consulting, those are still the 3 major service offerings. But in addition to that, we talked about data analytics. We talked about the other in the script there. Protiviti definitely has broadened and continues to broaden its service offerings. Cyber is certainly something that's hot. And to the extent regulatory reform is going to help us in the future, there's more regulatory reform in the cyber area that plays into controls, that plays into security, both of which are in our wheelhouse."

So some of the year-on-year operating margin compression you see is G&A deleverage because we've held the line in the U.S. notwithstanding less revenue. We've added to headcounts outside the U.S. to feed their hot hand, and the combination is we've got some negative SG&A leverage. We're fine with that.

I think as an optimist, I think as we improve our digital initiatives, as we share with our clients more and more of our internal technology that lets them participate in the selection and discovery of candidates, it ultimately results in more leads to the extent we use our artificial intelligence, our matching algorithms to make better matches. You have a better satisfied client that ultimately snowballs as well. So clearly, relative to prior cycles, we're much more advanced with how we've developed our internal systems, particularly from the point of view and how they're connected and how they interact with our website, which in turn is available to all candidates and clients. Traditionally, our website functionality has been almost exclusively candidate-facing. That's changing rapidly. You can go to our website this second and search our candidate database. You can filter on geography. You can filter on skills. You can filter on education level. You can further benefit from our algorithms, where we show -- we map skills that you're searching for to skills that are -- may or not -- that would be relevant as well to what you're searching for. So I think we're light years better in our digital capabilities. We believe long term, the firm that wins has both digital and traditional capabilities. The digital can do a nice job of correlating skills and work experiences. But for things like attitude and professionalism and cultural fit, we still think our human being staff do a better job of that. So I think this hybrid combination of digital and traditional are off-line [ph]. I think we've never had that combination of capabilities today that we've had in the past. The other thing I would observe is that we're working together staffing in Protiviti better than we ever have before. We're going to market together. I think the marketplace understands there are certain type of projects that need some kind of project management but that the staff level can be provided by our traditional staffing organization. So it's a combination together. You get a better price point. You get Big 4 Protiviti level project management. You get staffing, specialized staffing feet on the street, and the combination is effective and the price point is better. So relative to where we've been in prior cycles, we've clearly got a better digital offering. That digital offering is well integrated into our traditional offering. And a combination of Protiviti staffing, the blending, the integration, the go-to-market coordination is the best it's ever been."

So 1 of those 4 was better temp gross margins than we had dialed in. A piece of that were sequentially better conversions, but the bigger piece of that was better spreads. Part of that is a mix issue. As your accounting operations positions and Accountemps are more impacted due to macro, that means your remaining Accountemps business is more staff level versus accounting operations staff level has slightly higher gross margins than accounting operations.

Let's review our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Quarterly revenues were $1.287 billion, down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis and down 1% on a reported basis from the first quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.62. Cash flow from operations was $124 million in the first quarter, and capital expenditures were $10 million.
We returned $31 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We raised the cash dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.24 per share in February. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $54 million during the quarter. We have 5.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We were pleased with our financial results for the first quarter, particularly our international staffing operations and Protiviti. While the U.S. economic environment is largely stable and the job market is strong, the hiring cycle remains uncharacteristically long as employers take more time to make hiring decisions. Recent reports show a noticeable improvement in optimism about economic prospects, which should shorten the hiring cycle and benefit our business. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the first quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results."

As just noted, global revenues were $1.287 billion in the first quarter. This is down 1% from the first quarter of 2016 on a reported basis and down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.
Revenues for our staffing businesses were down 3% in the first quarter on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $858 million in the first quarter, down 6% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $233 million, up 9% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The first quarter had 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter of 2016. The second quarter has 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
Currency exchange rates have the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the first quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.5%. 
First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $196 million, with $165 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. 
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 4% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were up 7%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.6%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. 
Gross margin. Now let's talk about gross margin in the first quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. 
Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of a consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2017, which is flat on a percentage basis compared to last year's first quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.3%.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 27.0% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $51 million or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. 
Staffing selling, general and administrative costs were 33.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.4% in the previous year's first quarter. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.4% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income for our staffing divisions was $109 million in the first quarter, down 9% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.0%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 8% from 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 9.2%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the first quarter, down 15% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.7%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million, an increase of 16% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 8.6%.
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $700 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.5 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency. 
First quarter revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions, while negative, gradually improved during the quarter, led by our international operations. We exited the quarter with March down 2.2% versus the prior year compared to a 2.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first week of April was negative 2.5% compared to the prior year. 
First quarter global permanent placement revenue growth rates, which were also negative, also improved during the quarter both in the U.S. and internationally. March revenues were up 3.3% versus last year compared to a 3.1% decline reported for the full quarter. For the first 2 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were down 5.2% compared to the same period last year. 
This information is designed to provide you with insight into the trends we saw during the first quarter in April. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1,275,000,000 to $1,335,000,000; income per share, $0.61 to $0.67. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 3% on a reported basis and 1% adjusted for days and currency and an EPS decline of just under 10%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

Moderate U.S. economic growth in the range of 1.9% to 2.3% is forecast for 2017. Notwithstanding the slower first quarter start, 1.4% GDP growth according to The Wall Street Journal's monthly economic forecasting survey; recent data from several sources, including the NFIB, PMI Services Activity Index and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, all point to a more upbeat business outlook. We believe the wait-and-see approach to hiring that has affected our results to date should fade as economic optimism grows. 
As labor markets continue to tighten, particularly for our professional occupations, we will benefit from our decades of experience helping clients find the right candidates even amid talent shortages. Outside the U.S., we are encouraged by the opportunities afforded by improving economic conditions, particularly in Continental Europe. 
A final note about Protiviti, which had another strong quarter. Protiviti has been broadening its practice areas and now serves clients in a wide range of consulting areas. These include business performance improvement, data management and advanced analytics, digital transformation, forensics, technology consulting, internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and transaction services. We could not be more pleased with the evolution of this business and its strong performance.

We did benefit in the first quarter from about $0.01 a share with the new accounting for stock compensation and the tax effects thereof. So whereas the rate was 37.5% for the first quarter, we're projecting that to go up to about 38.5% in the second quarter. So that's some of it. But if you look at the profitability of the revenue guidance for the second quarter versus the profitability of the revenue guidance for the first quarter, I think you would conclude it's actually a little more profitable because you've got revenue mix favoring per placement, which seasonally has its best quarter in the second quarter. You also have revenue mix favoring Protiviti, which typically does better, margin-wise, in the second quarter than the first. Seasonally, accounting and finance generally in the second quarter is flattish because you've got traditional accounting busy season, ending, companies file their Ks, their proxy statements. The private companies file their financial statements with their bankers. So accounting and finance generally in the second quarter treads water, but you get some mixed benefit from perm and from Protiviti. I also need to add we lose a day in the second quarter. So you'll get some negative leverage from that. The Easter a year ago fell in the first quarter. Easter this year falls in the second quarter. So whereas typically, you get an extra day in the second quarter sequentially, this year, we actually lose a piece of a day. And then year-on-year, we lose almost a full day. So in the guidance we told you, there was a -- there's a 2-point swing between reported and same-day, constant-currency implied revenues where you lose a percentage point for billing days and you lose another percentage point for currency, which is principally U.K. Brexit driven."

So if you simply look at revenues per day, in the U.S., temp, they got gradually better even in the U.S., February versus January, March versus February. When you look at year-over-year growth rates for temp U.S., they were pretty constant. So on an absolute basis, we did see improvement in March in temp in the U.S., and we certainly saw improvement non-U.S. both in terms of year-over-year rates as well as absolutely. So I want to be clear that temp U.S., March, on an absolute basis per day, was better than January and February. Just when you compare it to a year ago, the growth rate for us was about the same. For perm, March was better not only on an absolute basis, but it was better year-on-year as well. We had a very good perm March month. January was a little weak. So March, to some degree, offset January weakness. But we were very pleased with March, particularly in perm, U.S. and non-U.S. When we did our guidance, we took the full quarter average. As it worked out, we do a buildup from the bottom when we do our guidance. But when you look at the result, they're slightly better than first quarter average, about 1% on a per day basis. We did not dial in March improvement into our second quarter guidance. We hope that's being conservative. So our guidance is a little stronger than the first quarter average, but it is not as strong as March was, temp or perm."

So gross margin, we think our guidance says flat to down 10 basis points, but because in the second quarter, we always get the workers' comp evaluation by third parties, a year ago, I think the number was about $1.5 million credit we had. We never build that into guidance. So when you're comparing this year to last year, last year had the workers' comp credit. This year's guidance does not. Adjusted for that, the gross margins stay at the high levels they were at the first quarter. Share count is a continuation or gets the benefit of the repurchases we did during the quarter. So I think it's in the 1 25 5 neighborhood that we use for share count. CapEx in the quarter were $10 million. I think we're expecting $11 million to $12 million in the second quarter. For the full year, our estimate is around $60 million, which is a little less than we thought it would be last quarter. And that $60 million is down from $80 million a year ago as we don't have the Salesforce CRM. We don't have the Protiviti project management business -- project management software upgrade that we spent heavily on in 2016."

Between first quarter and second quarter, it's less negative and it's only 1% negative. So if we do the midpoint of our second quarter guidance, it would seem the bottom, the inflection point, occurred in the first quarter of '17 so that we're hopeful that that's as bad as it's going to get, and the growth rates are slightly less negative in the second quarter.

There's been less higher-margin regulatory compliance work. That has stabilized. It actually grew somewhat this quarter. We were pleased with that. That said, the financial services industry is still very cost-focused. And even where we're doing internal audit for financial services firms, there's some margin compression. The good news is Protiviti more than offset that by managing its own internal cost, such that we had margin expansion, operating margin expansion year-over-year, which we were pleased with. So the major service offerings of Protiviti, internal audit, risk and compliance, and technology consulting, those are still the 3 major service offerings. But in addition to that, we talked about data analytics. We talked about the other in the script there. Protiviti definitely has broadened and continues to broaden its service offerings. Cyber is certainly something that's hot. And to the extent regulatory reform is going to help us in the future, there's more regulatory reform in the cyber area that plays into controls, that plays into security, both of which are in our wheelhouse."

I think as an optimist, I think as we improve our digital initiatives, as we share with our clients more and more of our internal technology that lets them participate in the selection and discovery of candidates, it ultimately results in more leads to the extent we use our artificial intelligence, our matching algorithms to make better matches. You have a better-satisfied client that ultimately snowballs as well. So clearly, relative to prior cycles, we're much more advanced with how we've developed our internal systems, particularly from the point of view and how they're connected and how they interact with our website, which in turn is available to all candidates and clients. Traditionally, our website functionality has been almost exclusively candidate-facing. That's changing rapidly. You can go to our website this second and search our candidate database. You can filter on geography. You can filter on skills. You can filter on education level. You can further benefit from our algorithms, where we show -- we map skills that you're searching for to skills that are -- may or not -- that would be relevant as well to what you're searching for. So I think we're light years better in our digital capabilities. We believe long term, the firm that wins has both digital and traditional capabilities. The digital can do a nice job of correlating skills and work experiences. But for things like attitude and professionalism and cultural fit, we still think our human being staff do a better job of that. So I think this hybrid combination of digital and traditional are off-line [ph]. I think we've never had that combination of capabilities today that we've had in the past. The other thing I would observe is that we're working together staffing in Protiviti better than we ever have before. We're going to market together. I think the marketplace understands there are certain type of projects that need some kind of project management but that the staff level can be provided by our traditional staffing organization. So it's a combination together. You get a better price point. You get Big 4 Protiviti level project management. You get staffing, specialized staffing feet on the street, and the combination is effective and the price point is better. So relative to where we've been in prior cycles, we've clearly got a better digital offering. That digital offering is well integrated into our traditional offering. And a combination of Protiviti staffing, the blending, the integration, the go-to-market coordination is the best it's ever been."

So as we've said earlier, we're encouraged that March was better. It's 1 month. We didn't totally roll it into our guidance. We hope it's the beginning of many good months to come, but I don't think we're unique when you read almost every day and you see in the press virtually every day, the company is talking about the gap between hard data and soft data, sentiment optimism on the one hand and actual levels of activity on the other. But the good news for us and I guess relative to where we sat 90 days ago, I would tell you our people are moderately more optimistic. And so they've actually seen some signs of improvement at least for 1 month, and it happened to be the last month in the quarter.

So 1 of those 4 was better temp gross margins than we had dialed in. A piece of that were sequentially better conversions, but the bigger piece of that was better spreads. Part of that is a mix issue. As your accounting operations positions and Accountemps are more impacted due to macro, that means your remaining Accountemps business is more staff level versus accounting operations staff level has slightly higher gross margins than accounting operations. So you've got a higher mix of those. So that also helps to explain the increase in gross margins."

Let's review our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Quarterly revenues were $1.287 billion, down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis and down 1% on a reported basis from the first quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.62. Cash flow from operations was $124 million in the first quarter, and capital expenditures were $10 million.
We returned $31 million to our shareholders during the quarter through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We raised the cash dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.24 per share in February. We also repurchased 1.1 million Robert Half shares for $54 million during the quarter. We have 5.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
We were pleased with our financial results for the first quarter, particularly our international staffing operations and Protiviti. While the U.S. economic environment is largely stable and the job market is strong, the hiring cycle remains uncharacteristically long as employers take more time to make hiring decisions. Recent reports show a noticeable improvement in optimism about economic prospects, which should shorten the hiring cycle and benefit our business. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the first quarter. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results."

As just noted, global revenues were $1.287 billion in the first quarter. This is down 1% from the first quarter of 2016 on a reported basis and down 2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.
Revenues for our staffing businesses were down 3% in the first quarter on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $858 million in the first quarter, down 6% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $233 million, up 9% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The first quarter had 63.4 billing days compared to 62.7 days in the first quarter of 2016. The second quarter has 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
Currency exchange rates have the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $6 million in the first quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.5%. 
First quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $196 million, with $165 million coming from revenues in the United States and $31 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. 
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 4% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were up 7%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.6%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. 
Gross margin. Now let's talk about gross margin in the first quarter. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago and relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. 
Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of a consolidated staffing revenues in the first quarter of 2017, which is flat on a percentage basis compared to last year's first quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.3%.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 27.0% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $51 million or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. 
Staffing selling, general and administrative costs were 33.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.4% in the previous year's first quarter. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.4% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income for our staffing divisions was $109 million in the first quarter, down 9% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.0%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $91 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 8% from 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 9.2%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the first quarter, down 15% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.7%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million, an increase of 16% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 8.6%.
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $700 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.5 days.
Before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and thus far in April, all adjusted for currency. 
First quarter revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions, while negative, gradually improved during the quarter, led by our international operations. We exited the quarter with March down 2.2% versus the prior year compared to a 2.8% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first week of April was negative 2.5% compared to the prior year. 
First quarter global permanent placement revenue growth rates, which were also negative, also improved during the quarter both in the U.S. and internationally. March revenues were up 3.3% versus last year compared to a 3.1% decline reported for the full quarter. For the first 2 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were down 5.2% compared to the same period last year. 
This information is designed to provide you with insight into the trends we saw during the first quarter in April. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance: revenues, $1,275,000,000 to $1,335,000,000; income per share, $0.61 to $0.67. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue declines of 3% on a reported basis and 1% adjusted for days and currency and an EPS decline of just under 10%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

So whereas the rate was 37.5% for the first quarter, we're projecting that to go up to about 38.5% in the second quarter. So that's some of it. But if you look at the profitability of the revenue guidance for the second quarter versus the profitability of the revenue guidance for the first quarter, I think you would conclude it's actually a little more profitable because you've got revenue mix favoring per placement, which seasonally has its best quarter in the second quarter. You also have revenue mix favoring Protiviti, which typically does better, margin-wise, in the second quarter than the first. Seasonally, accounting and finance generally in the second quarter is flattish because you've got traditional accounting busy season, ending, companies file their Ks, their proxy statements. The private companies file their financial statements with their bankers. So accounting and finance generally in the second quarter treads water, but you get some mixed benefit from perm and from Protiviti. I also need to add we lose a day in the second quarter. So you'll get some negative leverage from that. The Easter a year ago fell in the first quarter. Easter this year falls in the second quarter. So whereas typically, you get an extra day in the second quarter sequentially, this year, we actually lose a piece of a day. And then year-on-year, we lose almost a full day. So in the guidance we told you, there was a -- there's a 2-point swing between reported and same-day, constant-currency implied revenues where you lose a percentage point for billing days and you lose another percentage point for currency, which is principally U.K. Brexit driven."

So if you simply look at revenues per day, in the U.S., temp, they got gradually better even in the U.S., February versus January, March versus February.

So on an absolute basis, we did see improvement in March in temp in the U.S., and we certainly saw improvement non-U.S. both in terms of year-over-year rates as well as absolutely. So I want to be clear that temp U.S., March, on an absolute basis per day, was better than January and February. Just when you compare it to a year ago, the growth rate for us was about the same. For perm, March was better not only on an absolute basis, but it was better year-on-year as well. We had a very good perm March month. January was a little weak. So March, to some degree, offset January weakness. But we were very pleased with March, particularly in perm, U.S. and non-U.S. When we did our guidance, we took the full quarter average. As it worked out, we do a buildup from the bottom when we do our guidance. But when you look at the result, they're slightly better than first quarter average, about 1% on a per day basis. We did not dial in March improvement into our second quarter guidance. We hope that's being conservative. So our guidance is a little stronger than the first quarter average, but it is not as strong as March was, temp or perm."

That said, the financial services industry is still very cost-focused. And even where we're doing internal audit for financial services firms, there's some margin compression. The good news is Protiviti more than offset that by managing its own internal cost, such that we had margin expansion, operating margin expansion year-over-year, which we were pleased with. So the major service offerings of Protiviti, internal audit, risk and compliance, and technology consulting, those are still the 3 major service offerings.

And I think the policy uncertainty issue is, does it continue this gap between the soft data and the hard data, the optimism, the sentiment data versus real economic activity? And I think the longer the policy uncertainty exists, be it tax reform, be it regulatory reform, be it infrastructure, I think that uncertainty certainly defers the period of time that you see actual improvements in business activity. That said, we had a nice March. We've said it several times now. And it's only 1 month, which is why we didn't roll it all into our guidance, but we had a nice March. We had more activity in March. We had it in perm, which is typically the most sensitive to macro trends. So we're happy about that. But yes, policy uncertainty matters, but factually up through this quarter, there's been less GDP growth, full stop."

I think as an optimist, I think as we improve our digital initiatives, as we share with our clients more and more of our internal technology that lets them participate in the selection and discovery of candidates, it ultimately results in more leads to the extent we use our artificial intelligence, our matching algorithms to make better matches. You have a better-satisfied client that ultimately snowballs as well. So clearly, relative to prior cycles, we're much more advanced with how we've developed our internal systems, particularly from the point of view and how they're connected and how they interact with our website, which in turn is available to all candidates and clients. Traditionally, our website functionality has been almost exclusively candidate-facing. That's changing rapidly. You can go to our website this second and search our candidate database. You can filter on geography. You can filter on skills. You can filter on education level. You can further benefit from our algorithms, where we show -- we map skills that you're searching for to skills that are -- may or not -- that would be relevant as well to what you're searching for. So I think we're light years better in our digital capabilities. We believe long term, the firm that wins has both digital and traditional capabilities. The digital can do a nice job of correlating skills and work experiences. But for things like attitude and professionalism and cultural fit, we still think our human being staff do a better job of that. So I think this hybrid combination of digital and traditional are [ off-line ]. I think we've never had that combination of capabilities today that we've had in the past. The other thing I would observe is that we're working together staffing in Protiviti better than we ever have before. We're going to market together. I think the marketplace understands there are certain type of projects that need some kind of project management but that the staff level can be provided by our traditional staffing organization. So it's a combination together. You get a better price point. You get Big 4 Protiviti level project management. You get staffing, specialized staffing feet on the street, and the combination is effective and the price point is better. So relative to where we've been in prior cycles, we've clearly got a better digital offering. That digital offering is well integrated into our traditional offering. And a combination of Protiviti staffing, the blending, the integration, the go-to-market coordination is the best it's ever been."

So 1 of those 4 was better temp gross margins than we had dialed in. A piece of that were sequentially better conversions, but the bigger piece of that was better spreads. Part of that is a mix issue. As your accounting operations positions and Accountemps are more impacted due to macro, that means your remaining Accountemps business is more staff level versus accounting operations staff level has slightly higher gross margins than accounting operations. So you've got a higher mix of those. So that also helps to explain the increase in gross margins."

Let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenues were $1.308 billion, down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis and down 3% on a reported basis from the second quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.64. Both revenues and EPS were slightly above the midpoint of our previous guidance for this quarter. Cash flow from operations was $253 million. Capital expenditures were $11 million.
During the quarter, we returned $31 million to our stockholders through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1 million Robert Half shares for $47 million during the quarter. We have 4.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Second quarter revenues were strongest internationally, but we were also pleased with the quarter-over-quarter sequential performance of our domestic staffing operations. Every U.S. staffing line of business reported higher sequential revenue growth this year than the same period a year ago. Sequential revenue growth for overall U.S. staffing operations was 2% in the second quarter versus a sequential decline of 1% a year ago. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the second quarter.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

This is down 3% from a year ago on a reported basis and down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis.
Revenues for our staffing business were down 1% year-over-year on a same-day constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $872 million, down 3% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $239 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The second quarter had 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of 2016. The current third quarter has 63.1 billing days compared to 64.1 days in the third quarter of last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both the reported and same-day constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. The effect of currency exchange rates decreased our reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the second quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.7%.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $197 million in the second quarter, with $164 million coming from revenues in the United States and $33 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 1% year-over-year on a same-day constant-currency basis.
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 2% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were down 1%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. 
Now let's turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 20 basis point decline from the same period 1 year ago, primarily due to the absence of prior year workers' compensation credits of $1.4 million and slightly lower temp-to-hire conversions. 
Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.1% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter, which is up compared to last year's 9.9%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin fell 10 basis points versus a year ago to 43.7%. Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 26.7% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
In the second quarter, staffing SG&A costs were 33.5% of staffing revenues versus 32.3% in the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $114 million in the second quarter, down 13% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.3%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $93 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 13% from 2016 and resulted on an operating margin of 9.3%. Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million, down 14% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 18.7%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 7% from 2016, producing an operating margin of [ 8.4% ].
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $708 million. Implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.3 days.
Before we return -- before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and so far in July, all adjusted for currency.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues down 2% versus the prior year compared to a 1.6% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of July was down 2.9% compared to the prior year.
For our permanent placement operations, June revenues were up 5.4% versus last year compared to a 1.4% increase reported for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were up 9.8% compared to the same period last year.
This information covers trends we saw during the second quarter and in July. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time and include holiday impacts from the 4th of July.
With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance: Revenues: $1,305,000,000 to $1,365,000,000; income per share: $0.66 to $0.72.
The midpoint of our Q3 guidance implies reported revenues are down slightly or negative 0.3% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues are up 1.1% adjusted for days and currencies. EPS is down 2.5%.
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release, in our SEC filings. Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We were encouraged by the second quarter results, particularly the continued strength in our non-U.S. staffing operations and the sequential progress of our U.S. operations.
Although GDP growth in the United States has been sluggish, the business outlook is positive. Since the start of 2017, U.S. business leaders, particularly owners of small and midsized companies, have expressed confidence in their prospects. If GDP growth improves, we believe hiring activity should not be far behind. The Federal Reserve Beige Book reported that economic activity expanded across all 12 Federal Reserve districts in June with the pace of growth ranging from slight to moderate. Fed also reported that employment across most of the nation maintained a modest to moderate pace of expansion.
The common thread among many of these business sentiment surveys is concern over the lack of available talent, and skills shortages become more pronounced in professional occupations. Robert Half is positioned to help companies locate and hire this hard-to-find talent. It is what we do best.
We are investing continually in technology innovation to better serve our customers, but technology has its limitations and a great many steps in the hiring process require human skill and judgment. We believe Robert Half's competitive difference is our ability to offer both innovative technical solutions and personal attention backed by our nearly 70 years of experience.
Protiviti also had a solid quarter, particularly its U.S. internal audit and risk and compliance practices. We believe Protiviti is well positioned in the marketplace.
Keith and I will be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

We're going to get some credits in the third quarter. Puts and takes on low and high end. So generally, when we're talking staffing now, tone of business, clients remain wait and see. They remain measured, although sentiment does remain high. Hiring is selective. It's methodical. We are seeing sequential demand improving slowly. Perm a little bit better than temp. Candidates have many options and must be sold on the opportunities presented. Europe remains strong. So the third quarter guidance, we focus first on sequential progress given the trends. The second quarter, June was a little softer than the first 2 months, but not significantly so. There's a lot of noise in the post quarter because of the fourth. So we believe that starting in the U.S., we'll continue to have a little more sequential improvement that's dialed into the midpoint. U.S. remain strong, led by Continental Europe, particularly Germany and Belgium. We expect that would continue so that year-on-year for the first time in several quarters, adjusted for days and currency, will actually show positive revenue growth. The -- as we talked earlier, it is 1 day shorter than the quarter a year ago, so there's a differential between reported and same-day. But generally speaking, the second quarter wasn't that different from the first. It was a little better, and our expectation at the midpoint of our guidance is that the third quarter gets a little better than the second quarter just reported."

Further, in the internal technology arena, we continue to invest heavily in our digital initiatives. Many of those are expensed rather than capitalized because they're improvements of existing solutions rather than brand-new solutions. So together, you've got some negative leverage from SG&A because of the headcount, because of the technology spending. And by the way, a lot of what we've done in the past, in the recent past from a technology standpoint has been software-as-a-service. So we're having to pay those licensee fees currently, which are expensed as well. So when you put it all together, as we said in our guidance at our midpoint, same-day constant-currency revenues are up 1% and EPS is down 2.5%.

So I guess, what it does it take for that increased optimism and some hiring in perm to then kind of filter into the temp side? I mean, your conversation with clients, is it -- are there supply issues? Are they still waiting for regulatory clarity? Anything you can provide on your client conversations will be helpful."

But's what's interesting is our temp bill rates were up 2.5% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. So we've now had 4 or 5 quarters in a row where we have less wage inflation than we've had the immediately prior quarter. So what we're seeing is that our clients, they're just unwilling to pay more because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they billed their clients. So it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand, the labor market tightens. On the other hand, wage inflation declines. So what we need to see more temp growth, we need to see clients with more activities themselves. Again, they'll wait and see. When they see it, they'll do it. The transactional accounting operations positions that are a big part of Accountemps, they need more transaction volumes at our clients, which follows sentiment. So regulatory reform would definitely help. It's clearly been delayed as everyone us. But if you look at the chart over 10 years, you'll see perm and temp are highly correlated. Perm's getting better. We would expect temp to get better."

Let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenues were $1.308 billion, down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis and down 3% on a reported basis from the second quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.64. Both revenues and EPS were slightly above the midpoint of our previous guidance for this quarter. Cash flow from operations was $253 million. Capital expenditures were $11 million.
During the quarter, we returned $31 million to our stockholders through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1 million Robert Half shares for $47 million during the quarter. We have 4.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Second quarter revenues were strongest internationally, but we were also pleased with the quarter-over-quarter sequential performance of our domestic staffing operations. Every U.S. staffing line of business reported higher sequential revenue growth this year than the same period a year ago. Sequential revenue growth for overall U.S. staffing operations was 2% in the second quarter versus a sequential decline of 1% a year ago. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the second quarter.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

This is down 3% from a year ago on a reported basis and down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis.
Revenues for our staffing business were down 1% year-over-year on a same-day constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $872 million, down 3% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $239 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The second quarter had 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of 2016. The current third quarter has 63.1 billing days compared to 64.1 days in the third quarter of last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. The effect of currency exchange rates decreased our reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the second quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.7%.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $197 million in the second quarter, with $164 million coming from revenues in the United States and $33 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 1% year-over-year on a same-day constant-currency basis.
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 2% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were down 1%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. 
Now let's turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 20 basis point decline from the same period 1 year ago, primarily due to the absence of prior year workers' compensation credits of $1.4 million and slightly lower temp-to-hire conversions. 
Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.1% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter, which is up compared to last year's 9.9%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin fell 10 basis points versus a year ago to 43.7%. Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 26.7% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
In the second quarter, staffing SG&A costs were 33.5% of staffing revenues versus 32.3% in the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $114 million in the second quarter, down 13% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.3%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $93 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 13% from 2016 and resulted on an operating margin of 9.3%. Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million, down 14% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 18.7%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 7% from 2016, producing an operating margin of 8.4%.
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $708 million. Implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.3 days.
Before we return -- before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and so far in July, all adjusted for currency.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues down 2% versus the prior year compared to a 1.6% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of July was down 2.9% compared to the prior year.
For our permanent placement operations, June revenues were up 5.4% versus last year compared to a 1.4% increase reported for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were up 9.8% compared to the same period last year.
This information covers trends we saw during the second quarter and in July. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time and include holiday impacts from the 4th of July.
With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues: $1,305,000,000 to $1,365,000,000; income per share: $0.66 to $0.72.
The midpoint of our Q3 guidance implies reported revenues are down slightly or negative 0.3% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues are up 1.1% adjusted for days and currencies. EPS is down 2.5%.

We were encouraged by the second quarter results, particularly the continued strength in our non-U.S. staffing operations and the sequential progress of our U.S. operations.
Although GDP growth in the United States has been sluggish, the business outlook is positive. Since the start of 2017, U.S. business leaders, particularly owners of small and midsized companies, have expressed confidence in their prospects. If GDP growth improves, we believe hiring activity should not be far behind. The Federal Reserve Beige Book reported that economic activity expanded across all 12 Federal Reserve districts in June with the pace of growth ranging from slight to moderate. Fed also reported that employment across most of the nation maintained a modest to moderate pace of expansion.
The common thread among many of these business sentiment surveys is concern over the lack of available talent. As skill shortages become more pronounced in professional occupations, Robert Half is positioned to help companies locate and hire this hard-to-find talent. It is what we do best.
We are investing continually in technology innovation to better serve our customers, but technology has its limitations and a great many steps in the hiring process require human skill and judgment. We believe Robert Half's competitive difference is our ability to offer both innovative technology solutions and personal attention backed by our nearly 70 years of experience.
Protiviti also had a solid quarter, particularly its U.S. internal audit and risk and compliance practices. We believe Protiviti is well positioned in the marketplace.
Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

We're going to get some credits in the third quarter. Puts and takes on low and high end. So generally, when we're talking staffing now, tone of business, clients remain wait and see. They remain measured, although sentiment does remain high. Hiring is selective. It's methodical. We are seeing sequential demand improving slowly. Perm a little bit better than temp. Candidates have many options and must be sold on the opportunities presented. Europe remains strong. So the third quarter guidance, we focus first on sequential progress given the trends. The second quarter, June was a little softer than the first 2 months but not significantly so. There's a lot of noise in the post quarter because of the fourth. So we believe that starting in the U.S., we'll continue to have a little more sequential improvement that's dialed into the midpoint. U.S. remains strong, led by Continental Europe, particularly Germany and Belgium. We expect that would continue so that year-on-year for the first time in several quarters, adjusted for days and currency, will actually show positive revenue growth. The -- as we talked earlier, it is one day shorter than the quarter a year ago, so there's a differential between reported and same-day. But generally speaking, the second quarter wasn't that different from the first. It was a little better, and our expectation at the midpoint of our guidance is that the third quarter gets a little better than the second quarter just reported."

Further, in the internal technology arena, we continue to invest heavily in our digital initiatives. Many of those are expensed rather than capitalized because they're improvements of existing solutions rather than brand-new solutions. So together, you've got some negative leverage from SG&A because of the headcount, because of the technology spending. And by the way, a lot of what we've done in the past, in the recent past from a technology standpoint has been software-as-a-service. So we're having to pay those licensee fees currently, which are expensed as well. So when you put it all together, as we said in our guidance at our midpoint, same-day constant-currency revenues are up 1% and EPS is down 2.5%.

But's what's interesting is our temp bill rates were up 2.5% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. So we've now had 4 or 5 quarters in a row where we have less wage inflation than we've had the immediately prior quarter. So what we're seeing is that our clients, they're just unwilling to pay more because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they billed their clients. So it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand, the labor market tightens. On the other hand, wage inflation declines. So what we need to see more temp growth, we need to see clients with more activities themselves. Again, they're wait and see. When they see it, they'll do it. The transactional accounting operations positions that are a big part of Accountemps, they need more transaction volumes at our clients, which follows sentiment. So regulatory reform would definitely help. It's clearly been delayed, as everyone knows. But if you look at a chart over 10 years, you'll see perm and temp are highly correlated. Perm's getting better. We would expect temp to get better."

Let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenues were $1.308 billion, down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis and down 3% on a reported basis from the second quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.64. Both revenues and EPS were slightly above the midpoint of our previous guidance for this quarter. Cash flow from operations was $253 million. Capital expenditures were $11 million.
During the quarter, we returned $31 million to our stockholders through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1 million Robert Half shares for $47 million during the quarter. We have 4.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Second quarter revenues were strongest internationally, but we were also pleased with the quarter-over-quarter sequential performance of our domestic staffing operations. Every U.S. staffing line of business reported higher sequential revenue growth this year than the same period a year ago. Sequential revenue growth for overall U.S. staffing operations was 2% in the second quarter versus a sequential decline of 1% a year ago. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the second quarter.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

This is down 3% from a year ago on a reported basis and down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis.
Revenues for our staffing business were down 1% year-over-year on a same-day constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $872 million, down 3% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $239 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The second quarter had 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of 2016. The current third quarter has 63.1 billing days compared to 64.1 days in the third quarter of last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. The effect of currency exchange rates decreased our reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the second quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.7%.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $197 million in the second quarter, with $164 million coming from revenues in the United States and $33 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 1% year-over-year on a same-day constant-currency basis.
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 2% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were down 1%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. 
Now let's turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 20 basis-point decline from the same period 1 year ago, primarily due to the absence of prior year workers' compensation credits of $1.4 million and slightly lower temp-to-hire conversions. 
Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.1% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter, which is up compared to last year's 9.9%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin fell 10 basis points versus a year ago to 43.7%. Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 26.7% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
In the second quarter, staffing SG&A costs were 33.5% of staffing revenues versus 32.3% in the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income from our staffing division was $114 million in the second quarter, down 13% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.3%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $93 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 13% from 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%. Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million, down 14% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 18.7%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 7% from 2016, producing an operating margin of 8.4%.
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $708 million. Implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.3 days.
Before we return -- before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and so far in July, all adjusted for currency.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues down 2% versus the prior year compared to a 1.6% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of July was down 2.9% compared to the prior year.
For our permanent placement operations, June revenues were up 5.4% versus last year compared to a 1.4% increase reported for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were up 9.8% compared to the same period last year.
This information covers trends we saw during the second quarter and in July. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time and include holiday impacts from the 4th of July.
With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues: $1,305,000,000 to $1,365,000,000; income per share: $0.66 to $0.72.
The midpoint of our Q3 guidance implies reported revenues are down slightly or negative 0.3% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues are up 1.1% adjusted for days and currencies. EPS is down 2.5%.

We were encouraged by the second quarter results, particularly the continued strength in our non-U.S. staffing operations and the sequential progress of our U.S. operations.
Although GDP growth in the United States has been sluggish, the business outlook is positive. Since the start of 2017, U.S. business leaders, particularly owners of small and midsized companies, have expressed confidence in their prospects. If GDP growth improves, we believe hiring activity should not be far behind. The Federal Reserve Beige Book reported that economic activity expanded across all 12 Federal Reserve districts in June with the pace of growth ranging from slight to moderate. Fed also reported that employment across most of the nation maintained a modest to moderate pace of expansion.
The common thread among many of these business sentiment surveys is concern over the lack of available talent. As skill shortages become more pronounced in professional occupations, Robert Half is positioned to help companies locate and hire this hard-to-find talent. It is what we do best.
We are investing continually in technology innovation to better serve our customers, but technology has its limitations and a great many steps in the hiring process require human skill and judgment. We believe Robert Half's competitive difference is our ability to offer both innovative technology solutions and personal attention backed by our nearly 70 years of experience.
Protiviti also had a solid quarter, particularly its U.S. internal audit and risk and compliance practices. We believe Protiviti is well positioned in the marketplace.
Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

We're going to get some credits in the third quarter. Puts and takes on low and high end. So generally, when we're talking staffing now, tone of business, clients remain wait and see. They remain measured. Although sentiment does remain high, hiring is selective. It's methodical. We are seeing sequential demand improving slowly. Perm a little bit better than temp. Candidates have many options and must be sold on the opportunities presented. Europe remains strong. So the third quarter guidance, we focus first on sequential progress given the trends. The second quarter, June was a little softer than the first 2 months but not significantly so. There's a lot of noise in the post quarter because of the 4th. So we believe that starting in the U.S., we'll continue to have a little more sequential improvement that's dialed into the midpoint. U.S. remains strong, led by Continental Europe, particularly Germany and Belgium. We expect that would continue so that year-on-year for the first time in several quarters, adjusted for days and currency, will actually show positive revenue growth. The -- as we talked earlier, it is 1 day shorter than the quarter a year ago, so there's a differential between reported and same-day. But generally speaking, the second quarter wasn't that different from the first. It was a little better, and our expectation at the midpoint of our guidance is that the third quarter gets a little better than the second quarter just reported."

First of all, with Europe earlier cycle growing nicely, we're aggressively adding to headcount.

Further, in the internal technology arena, we continue to invest heavily in our digital initiatives. Many of those are expensed rather than capitalized because they're improvements of existing solutions rather than brand new solutions. So together, you've got some negative leverage from SG&A because of the headcount, because of the technology spending. And by the way, a lot of what we've done in the past, in the recent past from a technology standpoint, has been software-as-a-service. So we're having to pay those license fees currently, which are expensed as well. So when you put it all together, as we said in our guidance at our midpoint, same-day constant-currency revenues are up 1% and EPS is down 2.5%.

But's what's interesting is our temp bill rates were up 2.5% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. So we've now had 4 or 5 quarters in a row where we have less wage inflation than we've had the immediately prior quarter. So what we're seeing is that our clients, they're just unwilling to pay more because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients. So it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines. So what we need to see more temp growth, we need to see clients with more activities themselves. Again, they're wait and see. When they see it, they'll do it. The transactional accounting operations positions that are a big part of Accountemps, they need more transaction volumes at our clients, which follows sentiment. So regulatory reform would definitely help. It's clearly been delayed, as everyone knows. But if you look at a chart over 10 years, you'll see perm and temp are highly correlated. Perm's getting better. We would expect temp to get better."

Let's review our second quarter financial results. Revenues were $1.308 billion, down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis and down 3% on a reported basis from the second quarter of 2016. Income per share was $0.64. Both revenues and EPS were slightly above the midpoint of our previous guidance for this quarter. Cash flow from operations was $253 million. Capital expenditures were $11 million.
During the quarter, we returned $31 million to our stockholders through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1 million Robert Half shares for $47 million during the quarter. We have 4.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Second quarter revenues were strongest internationally, but we were also pleased with the quarter-over-quarter sequential performance of our domestic staffing operations. Every U.S. staffing line of business reported higher sequential revenue growth this year than the same period a year ago. Sequential revenue growth for overall U.S. staffing operations was 2% in the second quarter versus a sequential decline of 1% a year ago. Robert Half's return on invested capital was 29% during the second quarter.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

This is down 3% from a year ago on a reported basis and down 1% on a same-day constant-currency basis.
Revenues for our staffing business were down 1% year-over-year on a same-day constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $872 million, down 3% on a same-day basis. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $239 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 325 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The second quarter had 63.3 billing days compared to 63.9 days in the second quarter of 2016. The current third quarter has 63.1 billing days compared to 64.1 days in the third quarter of last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. The effect of currency exchange rates decreased our reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the second quarter, which decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.7%.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $197 million in the second quarter, with $164 million coming from revenues in the United States and $33 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were up 1% year-over-year on a same-day constant-currency basis.
U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 2% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were down 1%. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7%. Protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. 
Now let's turn to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.4% of applicable revenues. This is a 20 basis-point decline from the same period 1 year ago, primarily due to the absence of prior year workers' compensation credits of $1.4 million and slightly lower temp-to-hire conversions. 
Revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.1% of consolidated staffing revenues in the second quarter, which is up compared to last year's 9.9%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin fell 10 basis points versus a year ago to 43.7%. Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $53 million or 26.7% of Protiviti revenues. A year ago, Protiviti gross margin was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues.
In the second quarter, staffing SG&A costs were 33.5% of staffing revenues versus 32.3% in the second quarter of 2016. Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18.3% of Protiviti revenues compared to 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period.
Operating income from our staffing division was $114 million in the second quarter, down 13% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.3%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $93 million in operating income. This was a decrease of 13% from 2016 and resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%. Second quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million, down 14% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 18.7%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $17 million in the second quarter, a decrease of 7% from 2016, producing an operating margin of 8.4%.
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $708 million. Implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.3 days.
Before we return -- before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and so far in July, all adjusted for currency.
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the second quarter with June revenues down 2% versus the prior year compared to a 1.6% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of July was down 2.9% compared to the prior year.
For our permanent placement operations, June revenues were up 5.4% versus last year compared to a 1.4% increase reported for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in July, permanent placement revenues were up 9.8% compared to the same period last year.
This information covers trends we saw during the second quarter and in July. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time and include holiday impacts from the 4th of July.
With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues: $1,305,000,000 to $1,365,000,000; income per share: $0.66 to $0.72.
The midpoint of our Q3 guidance implies reported revenues are down slightly or negative 0.3% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues are up 1.1% adjusted for days and currencies. EPS is down 2.5%.

We were encouraged by the second quarter results, particularly the continued strength in our non-U.S. staffing operations and the sequential progress of our U.S. operations.
Although GDP growth in the United States has been sluggish, the business outlook is positive. Since the start of 2017, U.S. business leaders, particularly owners of small and midsized companies, have expressed confidence in their prospects. If GDP growth improves, we believe hiring activity should not be far behind. The Federal Reserve Beige Book reported that economic activity expanded across all 12 Federal Reserve districts in June with the pace of growth ranging from slight to moderate. Fed also reported that employment across most of the nation maintained a modest to moderate pace of expansion.
The common thread among many of these business sentiment surveys is concern over the lack of available talent. As skill shortages become more pronounced in professional occupations, Robert Half is positioned to help companies locate and hire this hard-to-find talent. It is what we do best.
We are investing continually in technology innovation to better serve our customers, but technology has its limitations and a great many steps in the hiring process require human skill and judgment. We believe Robert Half's competitive difference is our ability to offer both innovative technology solutions and personal attention backed by our nearly 70 years of experience.
Protiviti also had a solid quarter, particularly its U.S. internal audit and risk and compliance practices. We believe Protiviti is well positioned in the marketplace.
Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]"

We're going to get some credits in the third quarter. Puts and takes on low and high end. So generally, when we're talking staffing now, tone of business, clients remain wait and see. They remain measured. Although sentiment does remain high, hiring is selective. It's methodical. We are seeing sequential demand improving slowly. Perm a little bit better than temp. Candidates have many options and must be sold on the opportunities presented. Europe remains strong. So the third quarter guidance, we focus first on sequential progress given the trends. The second quarter, June was a little softer than the first 2 months but not significantly so. There's a lot of noise in the post quarter because of the 4th. So we believe that starting in the U.S., we'll continue to have a little more sequential improvement that's dialed into the midpoint. U.S. remains strong, led by Continental Europe, particularly Germany and Belgium. We expect that would continue so that year-on-year for the first time in several quarters, adjusted for days and currency, will actually show positive revenue growth. The -- as we talked earlier, it is 1 day shorter than the quarter a year ago, so there's a differential between reported and same-day. But generally speaking, the second quarter wasn't that different from the first. It was a little better, and our expectation at the midpoint of our guidance is that the third quarter gets a little better than the second quarter just reported."

First of all, with Europe earlier cycle growing nicely, we're aggressively adding to headcount.

Further, in the internal technology arena, we continue to invest heavily in our digital initiatives. Many of those are expensed rather than capitalized because they're improvements of existing solutions rather than brand new solutions. So together, you've got some negative leverage from SG&A because of the headcount, because of the technology spending. And by the way, a lot of what we've done in the past, in the recent past from a technology standpoint, has been software-as-a-service. So we're having to pay those license fees currently, which are expensed as well. So when you put it all together, as we said in our guidance at our midpoint, same-day constant-currency revenues are up 1% and EPS is down 2.5%.

But's what's interesting is our temp bill rates were up 2.5% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. So we've now had 4 or 5 quarters in a row where we have less wage inflation than we've had the immediately prior quarter. So what we're seeing is that our clients, they're just unwilling to pay more because they don't believe they can pass it through in what they bill their clients. So it's actually pretty unprecedented in our experience that on the one hand the labor market tightens, on the other hand wage inflation declines. So what we need to see more temp growth, we need to see clients with more activities themselves. Again, they're wait and see. When they see it, they'll do it. The transactional accounting operations positions that are a big part of Accountemps, they need more transaction volumes at our clients, which follows sentiment. So regulatory reform would definitely help. It's clearly been delayed, as everyone knows. But if you look at a chart over 10 years, you'll see perm and temp are highly correlated. Perm's getting better. We would expect temp to get better."

Now let's review our third quarter financial results. Revenues were $1.325 billion, essentially flat on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the third quarter 1 year ago, and down 1% on a reported basis. Income per share was $0.68. Both revenues and EPS were slightly below the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Cash flow from operations was $129 million, and capital expenditures were $7 million. In the third quarter, we returned $30 million to our shareholders through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 800,000 Robert Half shares for $37 million during the quarter. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchase under our Board approved stock repurchase plan.
Our third quarter results were generally as expected and within the range of our previous guidance, led by strong European operations. Trends strengthen during the quarter, and we are encouraged by the broad-based improvement in revenue growth rates that began in September and continued into October, particularly in the United States. During the third quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 30%. 
I'll now turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at these results."

Global revenues in the third quarter were $1.325 billion, down 1% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis, and roughly flat on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues for our staffing businesses were up 0.3% year-over-year on a same day, constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $854 million, down 2% on a same-day basis, while non-U.S. staffing revenues were $262 million, up 11% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. The third quarter had 63.1 billing days, compared to 64.1 billing days in the third quarter 1 year ago. This reduced reported year-over-year revenue growth rates by 1.5%. The current fourth quarter has 61.3 billing days compared to 61.4 billing days in the fourth quarter of 2016. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends at our operations.
The effect of currency exchange rates increased our reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the third quarter, which boosted year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.8%. For Protiviti, global third quarter revenues were $209 million, with $170 million coming from revenues within the United States and $39 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were down 3% year-over-year on a same day, constant currency basis. 
U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were down 5% from the prior year on a same day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were up 12% on a same day, constant currency basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the third quarter and increasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.3%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms are clients through a network of 76 locations in 26 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.2% of applicable revenues. This is a 20-basis-point decline from the same period 1 year ago. Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.0% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is up from last year's 9.4%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 10 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.4%. 
Gross margin for Protiviti in the third quarter was $62 million or 29.6% of Protiviti revenues. In the third quarter of 2016, Protiviti gross margin was $67 million or 30.9% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 33.8% of staffing revenues versus 32.7% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.8% of revenues, the same as last year's third quarter.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $108 million in the third quarter, down 9% from 1 year ago. Operating margin was 9.6%. Our temporary, consulting and staffing divisions reported $88 million in operating income, down 10% from last year, resulting in an operating margin of 8.7%. 
Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $20 million, down 2% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 78.9%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $24 million in the third quarter, a decrease of 13% from 2016, producing an operating margin of 11.8%. 
Accounts receivable were $738 million at the end of the third quarter. Implied day sales outstanding or DSO were 50.7 days.
Before providing guidance for the fourth quarter, let's review the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.1% versus the prior year compared to a 0.4% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of October was up 2.0% compared to that period in 2016. For permanent placement operations, September revenues were up 7.2% versus last year, compared to a 6.7% increase reported for the [ full quarter ]. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were up 21% compared to the same period last year. These are the trends we saw during the third quarter and so far in October. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $1,287,000,000 to $1,347,000,000; income per share, $0.60 to $0.66. The midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance range implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a reported basis and 3% adjusted for days and currency. EPS would be up 3% versus last year at the midpoint of our guidance range. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the rent risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

As noted earlier on the call, we are encouraged by the recent improving trends we are seeing globally, including in the United States. These trends and their related business climate are favorable for our staffing operations and for Protiviti. 
In the United States, economic activity increased across all 12 Federal Reserve districts according to the latest Beige Book report. In the report, the Fed noted that labor markets are tight and employers are having difficulty finding qualified talent. In addition, the International Monetary Fund described the positive global economic outlook at their recent meetings in Washington, D.C., reported broad-based optimism for most major world economies. The growth outlook for the United States is 2.2% for 2017, which is a significant improvement from last year's 1.5% GDP growth. We are hopeful this portends more business investments and stronger growth among U.S. companies. We believe these investments would benefit both our staffing operations and Protiviti. Revenue growth in Protiviti operations outside the United States, like our staffing business, was stronger than in the U.S. Protiviti operations.
We're excited about our ongoing investments in technology innovation at Robert Half. We completed the global rollout of our CRM software this summer. We also recently unveiled a new website that provides an exceptional user experience for our clients and job candidates, and better meets the preferences of our customers who want digital service options from the businesses they work with. 
Now Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. West that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to if you have additional questions. 
Thank you."

In last year's fourth quarter, we had very large true ups to workers' compensation and to some extent, state unemployment cost such that, I believe the number was $4.5 million to $5 million of true ups to those accruals. We never dial those in to our guidance. Frankly, we don't expect those adjustments at that order of magnitude. But taking the fringe cost out, if you will, the gross margins are comparable.

So when you put the 2 together, you get negative leverage. Further, the IT initiatives that are currently ongoing, Software as a Service-related expenditures get expensed not capitalized and the extent you're improving current processes, that gets expensed not capitalized. So versus prior periods when much of your IT spending got capitalized, we're actually now in an environment where much of that gets expensed.

So for our U.S. Protiviti third quarter, as we talked about before, the hurricane impacts were larger, it was probably $1 million, $1.5 million in that range. Further, they did some -- they had to work performed toward the end of the quarter where contracts weren't actually signed until after the quarter, so they weren't able to recognize that revenue. That's a good thing for the fourth quarter because it rolls into that. Further, there are always puts and takes, principally with their FSI regulatory and their technology consulting practices between when contracts in and when new contracts or projects budget versus projects were placed. And some of the replacements were a little slower than they expected. But the good news is, as I said earlier, particularly when you look sequentially, our guidance assumes that Protiviti has a much better fourth quarter than it did a year ago. And in fact, the profitability, the operating margin will actually be better than a year ago such that for the full year, they're going to come in very close to 10% or double digit, which is what we've said all along. So we are quite happy that they got behind that earlier in the year and they're catching up, and in part because of better U.S. profitability, but even to a larger degree, better non-U.S. profitability, the fourth quarter for Protiviti should be better."

Most of that relates to where you got large number of people in departments all doing recurring routine kind of tasks that get automated, they talk about robotics in that way. I guess, we would also observe because already we've been around a while, we can actually remember when accounting went from manual spreadsheets and then came VisiCalc and then came Lotus 123, and then came Excel. And during those periods there was major concern that, that would reduce demand. And what it did was changed the demand. In fact, if anything it got better. We can also remember when the accounting software package has first came on the scene, and again the nature of the people we placed has changed to some degree, but in total, it's actually expanded. It would be counterintuitive to most people that even as we sit here today, payroll processors are one of the tougher candidate who request that we get, and most companies have an automated payroll system or a third-party payroll provider. But you still need people to process within those systems. So query the net benefit that will accrue to bigger companies.

Now let's review our third quarter financial results. Revenues were $1.325 billion, essentially flat on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the third quarter 1 year ago, and down 1% on a reported basis. Income per share was $0.68. Both revenues and EPS were slightly below the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Cash flow from operations was $129 million, and capital expenditures were $7 million. In the third quarter, we returned $30 million to our shareholders through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 800,000 Robert Half shares for $37 million during the quarter. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Our third quarter results were generally as expected and within the range of our previous guidance, led by strong European operations. Trends strengthened during the quarter, and we are encouraged by the broad-based improvement in revenue growth rates that began in September and continued into October, particularly in the United States. During the third quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 30%. 
I'll now turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at these results."

Global revenues in the third quarter were $1.325 billion, down 1% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis, and roughly flat on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues for our staffing businesses were up 0.3% year-over-year on a same day, constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $854 million, down 2% on a same-day basis, while non-U.S. staffing revenues were $262 million, up 11% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. The third quarter had 63.1 billing days, compared to 64.1 billing days in the third quarter 1 year ago. This reduced reported year-over-year revenue growth rates by 1.5%. The current fourth quarter has 61.3 billing days compared to 61.4 days in the fourth quarter of 2016. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
The effect of currency exchange rates increased our reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the third quarter, which boosted year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.8%. For Protiviti, global third quarter revenues were $209 million, with $170 million coming from revenues within the United States and $39 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were down 3% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. 
U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were down 5% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were up 12% on a same-day, constant currency basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the third quarter and increasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.3%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 76 locations in 26 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.2% of applicable revenues. This is a 20-basis-point decline from the same period 1 year ago. Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.0% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is up from last year's 9.4%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 10 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.4%. 
Gross margin for Protiviti in the third quarter was $62 million or 29.6% of Protiviti revenues. In the third quarter of 2016, Protiviti gross margin was $67 million or 30.9% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 33.8% of staffing revenues versus 32.7% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 17.8% of revenues, the same as last year's third quarter.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $108 million in the third quarter, down 9% from 1 year ago. Operating margin was 9.6%. Our temporary, consulting and staffing divisions reported $88 million in operating income, down 10% from last year, resulting in an operating margin of 8.7%. 
Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $20 million, down 2% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 78.9%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $24 million in the third quarter, a decrease of 13% from 2016, producing an operating margin of 11.8%. 
Accounts receivable were $738 million at the end of the third quarter. Implied day sales outstanding or DSO were 50.7 days.
Before providing guidance for the fourth quarter, let's review the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.1% versus the prior year compared to a 0.4% decline for the full quarter. Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of October was up 2.0% compared to that period in 2016. For permanent placement operations, September revenues were up 7.2% versus last year compared to a 6.7% increase reported for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were up 21% compared to the same period last year. These are the trends we saw during the third quarter and so far in October. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $1,287,000,000 to $1,347,000,000; income per share, $0.60 to $0.66. The midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance range implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a reported basis and 3% adjusted for days and currency. EPS would be up 3% versus last year at the midpoint of our guidance range. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

As noted earlier on the call, we are encouraged by the recent improving trends we are seeing globally, including in the United States. These trends and the related business climate are favorable for our staffing operations and for Protiviti. 
In the United States, economic activity increased across all 12 Federal Reserve districts according to the latest Beige Book report. In the report, the Fed noted that labor markets are tight and employers are having difficulty finding qualified talent. In addition, the International Monetary Fund described the positive global economic outlook at their recent meetings in Washington, D.C., reporting broad-based optimism for most major world economies. The growth outlook for the United States is 2.2% for 2017, which is a significant improvement from last year's 1.5% GDP growth. We are hopeful this portends more business investments and stronger growth among U.S. companies. We believe these investments will benefit both our staffing operations and Protiviti. Revenue growth in Protiviti operations outside the United States, like our staffing business, was stronger than in the U.S. Protiviti operations.
We're excited about our ongoing investments in technology innovation at Robert Half. We completed the global rollout of our CRM software this summer. We also recently unveiled a new website that provides an exceptional user experience for our clients and job candidates, and better meets the preferences of our customers who want digital service options from the businesses they work with.

So when you put the 2 together, you get negative leverage. Further, the IT initiatives that are currently ongoing, Software as a Service-related expenditures get expensed not capitalized. And to the extent you're improving current processes, that gets expensed not capitalized. So versus prior periods when much of your IT spending got capitalized, we're actually now in an environment where much of that gets expensed.

So for our U.S. Protiviti third quarter, as we talked about before, the hurricane impacts were larger. It was probably $1 million, $1.5 million in that range. Further, they did some -- they had work performed toward the end of the quarter where contracts weren't actually signed until after the quarter, so they weren't able to recognize that revenue. That's a good thing for the fourth quarter because it rolls into that. Further, there are always puts and takes, principally with their FSI regulatory and their technology consulting practices between when contracts end and when new contracts or projects, when projects ends versus when new projects replace, and some of the replacements were a little slower than they expected. But the good news is, as I said earlier, particularly when you look sequentially, our guidance assumes that Protiviti has a much better fourth quarter than it did a year ago. And in fact, the profitability, the operating margin will actually be better than a year ago such that for the full year, they're going to come very close to 10% or double digit, which is what we've said all along. So we're quite happy that they got behind that earlier in the year and they're catching up, and in part, because of better U.S. profitability, but even to a larger degree, better non-U.S. profitability, the fourth quarter for Protiviti should be better."

As we've talked about for the last year or so, has been very isolated to a small number of companies, and therefore, the overall impact hasn't been that material. On the other hand, lease accounting, which becomes effective the beginning of 2019, is much more broadly impactful. Every public company has to deal with the new lease accounting standard. So we are seeing many more projects, initially diagnostic in nature, and we're much more hopeful about the impact of lease accounting than we were with the impact of 6 0 6/ revenue recognition to use baseball analogies, whereas we've said in the past, revenue rec was a bunt single. We actually think we're going to get some solid doubles out of lease accounting. Tax reform, again, any change is good. It's been a long time since we've had major tax reform. We would expect an uptick there. But I can't say that we could quantify that given that you don't even know the nature of what it's going to look like."

I guess I'd first say overall that to the extent that happens, that middle market companies will be impacted by it later than big companies. Most of that relates to where you've got large number of people in departments all doing recurring routine kind of tasks that get automated. They talk about robotics in that way. I guess, we would also observe, because we're old and we've been around a while, we can actually remember when accounting went from manual spreadsheets and then came VisiCalc, and then came Lotus 1-2-3, and then came Excel And during those periods, there was major concern that, that would reduce demand. And what it did was change the demand. In fact, if anything it got better. We can also remember when accounting software packages first came on the scene. And again, the nature of the people we placed has changed to some degree, but in total, it's actually expanded. It would be counterintuitive to most people that even as we sit here today, payroll processors are one of the tougher candidate field request that we get. And most companies have an automated payroll system or a third-party payroll provider, but you still need people to process within those systems. So query the net benefit that will accrue to bigger companies. But my point is, you'll get a preview of that with bigger companies before it'll impact our companies."

Now let's review our third quarter financial results. Revenues were $1.325 billion, essentially flat on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the third quarter 1 year ago, and down 1% on a reported basis. Income per share was $0.68. Both revenues and EPS were slightly below the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Cash flow from operations was $129 million, and capital expenditures were $7 million. 
In the third quarter, we returned $30 million to our shareholders through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 800,000 Robert Half shares for $37 million during the quarter. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Our third quarter results were generally as expected and within the range of our previous guidance, led by strong European operations. Trends strengthened during the quarter, and we are encouraged by the broad-based improvement in revenue growth rates that began in September and continued into October, particularly in the United States. During the third quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 30%. 
I'll now turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at these results."

Global revenues in the third quarter were $1.325 billion, down 1% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis, and roughly flat on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues for our staffing businesses were up 0.3% year-over-year on a same day, constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $854 million, down 2% on a same-day basis, while non-U.S. staffing revenues were $262 million, up 11% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. 
We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. The third quarter had 63.1 billing days, compared to 64.1 billing days in the third quarter 1 year ago. This reduced reported year-over-year revenue growth rates by 1.5%. The current fourth quarter has 61.3 billing days compared to 61.4 days in the fourth quarter of 2016. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
The effect of currency exchange rates increased our reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the third quarter, which boosted year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.8%. For Protiviti, global third quarter revenues were $209 million, with $170 million coming from revenues within the United States and $39 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were down 3% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. 
U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were down 5% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were up 12% on a same-day, constant currency basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the third quarter and increasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.3%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 76 locations in 26 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.2% of applicable revenues. This is a 20-basis-point decline from the same period 1 year ago. Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.0% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is up from last year's 9.4%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 10 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.4%. 
Gross margin for Protiviti in the third quarter was $62 million or 29.6% of Protiviti revenues. In the third quarter of 2016, Protiviti gross margin was $67 million or 30.9% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 33.8% of staffing revenues versus 32.7% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti was 17.8% of revenues, the same as last year's third quarter.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $108 million in the third quarter, down 9% from 1 year ago. Operating margin was 9.6%. Our temporary, consulting and staffing divisions reported $88 million in operating income, down 10% from last year, resulting in an operating margin of 8.7%. 
Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $20 million, down 2% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 17.9%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $24 million in the third quarter, a decrease of 13% from 2016, producing an operating margin of 11.8%. 
Accounts receivable were $738 million at the end of the third quarter. Implied day sales outstanding or DSO were 50.7 days.
Before providing guidance for the fourth quarter, let's review the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.1% versus the prior year compared to a 0.4% decline for the full quarter. 
Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of October was up 2.0% compared to that period in 2016. For permanent placement operations, September revenues were up 7.2% versus last year compared to a 6.7% increase reported for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were up 21% compared to the same period last year. These are the trends we saw during the third quarter and so far in October. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $1,287,000,000 to $1,347,000,000; income per share, $0.60 to $0.66. The midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance range implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a reported basis and 3% adjusted for days and currency. EPS would be up 3% versus last year at the midpoint of our guidance range. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

As noted earlier on the call, we are encouraged by the recent improving trends we are seeing globally, including in the United States. These trends and the related business climate are favorable for our staffing operations and for Protiviti. 
In the United States, economic activity increased across all 12 Federal Reserve districts according to the latest Beige Book report. In the report, the Fed noted that labor markets are tight and employers are having difficulty finding qualified talent. In addition, the International Monetary Fund described the positive global economic outlook at their recent meetings in Washington, D.C., reporting broad-based optimism for most major world economies. 
The growth outlook for the United States is 2.2% for 2017, which is a significant improvement from last year's 1.5% GDP growth. We are hopeful this portends more business investments and stronger growth among U.S. companies. We believe these investments will benefit both our staffing operations and Protiviti. Revenue growth in Protiviti operations outside the United States, like our staffing business, was stronger than in the U.S. Protiviti operations.
We're excited about our ongoing investments in technology innovation at Robert Half. We completed the global rollout of our CRM software this summer. We also recently unveiled a new website that provides an exceptional user experience for our clients and job candidates, and better meets the preferences of our customers who want digital service options from the businesses they work with.

We never dial those in to our guidance. Frankly, we don't expect those adjustments at that order of magnitude. But taking the fringe cost out, if you will, the gross margins are comparable. But that's a significant reconciling item as you look at year-over-year revenues versus year-over-year margins."

So when you put the 2 together, you get negative leverage. Further, the IT initiatives that are currently ongoing, Software as a Service-related expenditures get expensed not capitalized. And to the extent you're improving current processes, that gets expensed not capitalized. So versus prior periods when much of your IT spending got capitalized, we're actually now in an environment where much of that gets expensed.

Further, they did some -- they had work performed toward the end of the quarter where contracts weren't actually signed until after the quarter, so they weren't able to recognize that revenue. That's a good thing for the fourth quarter because it rolls into that. Further, there are always puts and takes, principally with their FSI regulatory and their technology consulting practices between when contracts end and when new contracts or projects -- when projects ends versus when new projects replace, and some of the replacements were a little slower than they expected. But the good news is, as I said earlier, particularly when you look sequentially, our guidance assumes that Protiviti has a much better fourth quarter than it did a year ago. And in fact, the profitability, the operating margin will actually be better than a year ago such that for the full year, they're going to come very close to 10% or double digit, which is what we've said all along. So we're quite happy that they got behind that earlier in the year and they're catching up, and in part, because of better U.S. profitability, but even to a larger degree, better non-U.S. profitability, the fourth quarter for Protiviti should be better."

Change is always good. Revenue recognition, or 606 for technical people, as we've talked about for the last year or so, has been very isolated to a small number of companies, and therefore, the overall impact hasn't been that material. On the other hand, lease accounting, which becomes effective the beginning of 2019, is much more broadly impactful. Every public company has to deal with the new lease accounting standard. So we are seeing many more projects, initially diagnostic in nature, and we're much more hopeful about the impact of lease accounting than we were with the impact of 606/ revenue recognition. To use baseball analogies, whereas we've said in the past, revenue rec was a bunt single; we actually think we're going to get some solid doubles out of lease accounting. Tax reform, again, any change is good. It's been a long time since we've had major tax reform. We would expect an uptick there. But I can't say that we could quantify that given that you don't even know the nature of what it's going to look like."

I guess I'd first say overall that to the extent that happens, that middle market companies will be impacted by it later than will big companies. Most of that relates to where you've got large number of people in departments all doing recurring routine kind of tasks that get automated. They talk about robotics in that way. I guess, we would also observe, because we're old and we've been around a while, we can actually remember when accounting went from manual spreadsheets and then came VisiCalc, and then came Lotus 1-2-3, and then came Excel And during those periods, there was major concern that, that would reduce demand. And what it did was change the demand. In fact, if anything it got better. We can also remember when accounting software packages first came on the scene. And again, the nature of the people we placed has changed to some degree, but in total, it's actually expanded. It would be counterintuitive to most people that even as we sit here today, payroll processors are one of the tougher candidate field requests that we get. And most companies have an automated payroll system or a third-party payroll provider, but you still need people to process within those systems. So query the net benefit that will accrue to bigger companies. But my point is, you'll get a preview of that with bigger companies before it'll impact our companies."

Now let's review our third quarter financial results. Revenues were $1.325 billion, essentially flat on a same-day constant currency basis compared to the third quarter 1 year ago, and down 1% on a reported basis. Income per share was $0.68. Both revenues and EPS were slightly below the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Cash flow from operations was $129 million, and capital expenditures were $7 million. 
In the third quarter, we returned $30 million to our shareholders through a $0.24 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 800,000 Robert Half shares for $37 million during the quarter. We have 3.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Our third quarter results were generally as expected and within the range of our previous guidance, led by strong European operations. Trends strengthened during the quarter, and we are encouraged by the broad-based improvement in revenue growth rates that began in September and continued into October, particularly in the United States. During the third quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 30%. 
I'll now turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at these results."

Global revenues in the third quarter were $1.325 billion, down 1% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis, and roughly flat on a same-day constant currency basis. Third quarter revenues for our staffing businesses were up 0.3% year-over-year on a same day, constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $854 million, down 2% on a same-day basis, while non-U.S. staffing revenues were $262 million, up 11% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. 
We have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 83 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. The third quarter had 63.1 billing days, compared to 64.1 billing days in the third quarter 1 year ago. This reduced reported year-over-year revenue growth rates by 1.5%. The current fourth quarter has 61.3 billing days compared to 61.4 days in the fourth quarter of 2016. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
The effect of currency exchange rates increased our reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $9 million in the third quarter, which boosted year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.8%. For Protiviti, global third quarter revenues were $209 million, with $170 million coming from revenues within the United States and $39 million from revenues outside the United States. Protiviti revenues were down 3% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. 
U.S. Protiviti revenues in the third quarter were down 5% from the prior year on a same-day basis, and non-U.S. revenues were up 12% on a same-day, constant currency basis. Exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the third quarter and increasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.3%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 76 locations in 26 countries.
Now let's turn to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.2% of applicable revenues. This is a 20-basis-point decline from the same period 1 year ago. Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.0% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is up from last year's 9.4%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 10 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.4%. 
Gross margin for Protiviti in the third quarter was $62 million or 29.6% of Protiviti revenues. In the third quarter of 2016, Protiviti gross margin was $67 million or 30.9% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 33.8% of staffing revenues versus 32.7% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti was 17.8% of revenues, the same as last year's third quarter.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $108 million in the third quarter, down 9% from 1 year ago. Operating margin was 9.6%. Our temporary, consulting and staffing divisions reported $88 million in operating income, down 10% from last year, resulting in an operating margin of 8.7%. 
Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $20 million, down 2% from the prior year, producing an operating margin of 17.9%. Operating profit for Protiviti was $24 million in the third quarter, a decrease of 13% from 2016, producing an operating margin of 11.8%. 
Accounts receivable were $738 million at the end of the third quarter. Implied day sales outstanding or DSO were 50.7 days.
Before providing guidance for the fourth quarter, let's review the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues up 2.1% versus the prior year compared to a 0.4% decline for the full quarter. 
Revenue growth for the first 2 weeks of October was up 2.0% compared to that period in 2016. For permanent placement operations, September revenues were up 7.2% versus last year compared to a 6.7% increase reported for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were up 21% compared to the same period last year. These are the trends we saw during the third quarter and so far in October. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $1,287,000,000 to $1,347,000,000; income per share, $0.60 to $0.66. The midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance range implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on a reported basis and 3% adjusted for days and currency. EPS would be up 3% versus last year at the midpoint of our guidance range. We limit our guidance to one quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

As noted earlier on the call, we are encouraged by the recent improving trends we are seeing globally, including in the United States. These trends and the related business climate are favorable for our staffing operations and for Protiviti. 
In the United States, economic activity increased across all 12 Federal Reserve districts according to the latest Beige Book report. In the report, the Fed noted that labor markets are tight and employers are having difficulty finding qualified talent. In addition, the International Monetary Fund described the positive global economic outlook at their recent meetings in Washington, D.C., reporting broad-based optimism for most major world economies. 
The growth outlook for the United States is 2.2% for 2017, which is a significant improvement from last year's 1.5% GDP growth. We are hopeful this portends more business investments and stronger growth among U.S. companies. We believe these investments will benefit both our staffing operations and Protiviti. Revenue growth in Protiviti operations outside the United States, like our staffing business, was stronger than in the U.S. Protiviti operations.
We're excited about our ongoing investments in technology innovation at Robert Half. We completed the global rollout of our CRM software this summer. We also recently unveiled a new website that provides an exceptional user experience for our clients and job candidates, and better meets the preferences of our customers who want digital service options from the businesses they work with.

So when you put the 2 together, you get negative leverage. Further, the IT initiatives that are currently ongoing, Software as a Service-related expenditures get expensed not capitalized. And to the extent you're improving current processes, that gets expensed not capitalized. So versus prior periods when much of your IT spending got capitalized, we're actually now in an environment where much of that gets expensed.

Further, they did some -- they had work performed toward the end of the quarter where contracts weren't actually signed until after the quarter, so they weren't able to recognize that revenue. That's a good thing for the fourth quarter because it rolls into that. Further, there are always puts and takes, principally with their FSI regulatory and their technology consulting practices between when contracts end and when new contracts or projects -- when projects ends versus when new projects replace, and some of the replacements were a little slower than they expected. But the good news is, as I said earlier, particularly when you look sequentially, our guidance assumes that Protiviti has a much better fourth quarter than it did a year ago. And in fact, the profitability, the operating margin will actually be better than a year ago such that for the full year, they're going to come very close to 10% or double digit, which is what we've said all along. So we're quite happy that they got behind that earlier in the year and they're catching up, and in part, because of better U.S. profitability, but even to a larger degree, better non-U.S. profitability, the fourth quarter for Protiviti should be better."

Change is always good. Revenue recognition, or 606 for technical people, as we've talked about for the last year or so, has been very isolated to a small number of companies, and therefore, the overall impact hasn't been that material. On the other hand, lease accounting, which becomes effective the beginning of 2019, is much more broadly impactful. Every public company has to deal with the new lease accounting standard. So we are seeing many more projects, initially diagnostic in nature, and we're much more hopeful about the impact of lease accounting than we were with the impact of 606/ revenue recognition. To use baseball analogies, whereas we've said in the past, revenue rec was a bunt single; we actually think we're going to get some solid doubles out of lease accounting. Tax reform, again, any change is good. It's been a long time since we've had major tax reform. We would expect an uptick there. But I can't say that we could quantify that given that you don't even know the nature of what it's going to look like."

I guess I'd first say overall that to the extent that happens, that middle market companies will be impacted by it later than will big companies. Most of that relates to where you've got large number of people in departments all doing recurring routine kind of tasks that get automated. They talk about robotics in that way. I guess, we would also observe, because we're old and we've been around a while, we can actually remember when accounting went from manual spreadsheets and then came VisiCalc, and then came Lotus 1-2-3, and then came Excel And during those periods, there was major concern that, that would reduce demand. And what it did was change the demand. In fact, if anything it got better. We can also remember when accounting software packages first came on the scene. And again, the nature of the people we placed has changed to some degree, but in total, it's actually expanded. It would be counterintuitive to most people that even as we sit here today, payroll processors are one of the tougher candidate field requests that we get. And most companies have an automated payroll system or a third-party payroll provider, but you still need people to process within those systems. So query the net benefit that will accrue to bigger companies. But my point is, you'll get a preview of that with bigger companies before it'll impact our companies."
