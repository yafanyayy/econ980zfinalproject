Thank you for joining us. 2016 was a monumental year for Exelon, and I'm very proud of what we've accomplished. We made great progress in the ongoing transformation of our company while delivering on our commitments",1073,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us. 
2016 was a monumental year for Exelon, and I'm very proud of what we've accomplished. We made great progress in the ongoing transformation of our company while delivering on our commitments. We performed well financially. Our 2016 GAAP earnings at $1.22 and our non-GAAP earnings were $2.68, landing near the top of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70. 
At the utilities, we benefited from a hot summer and low storm costs. At ExGen, the nuclear fleet has its best performance year on record and at Constellation, the team executed very, very well. 
In 2016, for the first time, our regulated utility, less the holding company, earnings represented more than half of the total earnings and is consistent with our goal for the utilities to be a growing the majority of our EPS. 
And we've implemented a dividend growth strategy of 2.5% annually through 2018. 
In March, we closed on the acquisition of PHI, adding $8.3 billion to our utility rate base and creating a significant geographic footprint covering the mid-Atlantic region. The integration of PHI is going better than planned helped by our experience with BGE. We are working our way through the first 2 cycles of catch up rate cases at the PHI utilities. 
We're seeing additional opportunities to help improve the business processes and the stakeholder outreach process as we go through those rate cases. 
The other banner highlight for 2016 was the creation of the ZEC programs in both New York and Illinois. For years, we have argued that all clean energy resources be treated the same way for their environmental our tributes. We're able to work with a wide range of stakeholders in both states to enact programs that compensate these plans for their environmental attributes. 
As a result of these programs, we plan to continue to operate 5 plants and protect high-paying jobs, reserves needed tax basis in rural communities and maintain irreplaceable, emission-free baseload power production. 
These programs provide a supplemental cash flow for up to 12 years for some of our most at risk plans. 
The Illinois legislation also provides significant benefit for our customers in energy efficiency, additional renewable generation and to benefit lower income customers. The program also adds to the earnings visibility at ComEd by implementing a decoupling mechanism, supporting energy efficiency investments where we know will be able to earn on a return on those investments in extending the formula rate to 2022. 
In 2016, we also find ways to grow stable revenue streams. We deployed $5.2 billion of CapEx at the utilities, growing the rate basis by $2 billion, acquired ConEd Solutions and will close the FitzPatrick Nuclear Plant Station this spring. 
We have completed 9 transmission and distribution rate cases, providing revenue increases of $397 million. 
None of these accomplishments would be possible without the remarkable 34,000 employees that work hard every day to keep the power and gas flowing. Our workers donated over 172,000 hours to local nonprofits and Exelon donated $46 million, both of which were the most ever for Exelon. 
The commitment to our community is clearly part of who we are and shows our engagement beyond the products we deliver everyday. 
We also recognize the support of our employees is essential to high-performing work cultures and that is why Exelon took industry lead on 2 important initiatives in 2016. We expanded our pay leave policies to what are truly the best-in-class with 16 weeks of maternity leave, 8 weeks for fathers and adopted parents and 2 weeks of family leave. 
We were also the first utility to sign the White House equal pay push. 
Being a good citizen also means supporting our local businesses. In 2016, our spent with female minority-owned businesses reached $1.9 billion. Over 200% since 2011 and it represents almost 20% of our sourceable spending. The team has done a great job making sure we work with our suppliers across all our communities. 
Doing the right thing by our employees and communities is the smart thing for business, and more importantly, it's the right thing to do. We are proud to be leading the industry forward in these fronts. 
Turning to operations. Our utilities had a great year. The legacy Exelon Utilities continue to perform in top quartile on key operating and customer satisfaction metrics. These are the foundations of a constructed regulatory relationship. 
The efforts at PHI before the merger and our intense focus on operations since then has started to show benefits. 
The color blocks are improving even compared to 2015, although we did get some help from favorable weather in 2016. PHI is still improving. We're encouraged by the gain so far, and we have a plan in place to deliver for our customers and stakeholders. 
The color blocks show great performance, but this actually is underselling how will we did in 2016. We actually had a number of best covers this year: ComEd, BGE; PECO had their best satisfaction ever. ComEd and PHI outage frequency were the best ever; and BGE had its stronger average outage duration or shortest average outage duration ever. 
The benefits of our uniform management model across the utilities, our smart grid initiative and our continued reliability spending are currently paying dividends for our customers. 
Turning to our nonregulated business operations, we had a banner year generations well. Our nuclear fleet has its highest ever capacity factor at 94.6 versus the industry average of 90.4, which allowed us to produce an additional 7 terawatt hours more and approximately $275 million of revenue than if we had just been average. 
We also had the shortest average refueling duration ever just over 22 days versus the industry average of 37 days. 
The fact the entire fleet performed so well against the backdrop of potential plant closures and fighting for ZEC is truly a testament to the professionalism of the workforce, which we all are greatly appreciative of. 
Our gas, hydro and assets also had a good year. Strong energy capture on renewable and power dispatch on our conventional plants. 
At Constellation, the team performed exceptionally well. Our customer renewal rate was 77% for electric and 91% for gas. Equally important, our new business win rate was at 28% last year and our C&I market share grew to 25%. 
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Jack to provide the financial update."
296181,415478678,1126588,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2017",2017-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus on 2016 results, 2017 earnings guidance and updates to a number of our financial disclosures including gross margin.

My remarks today will focus on 2016 results, 2017 earnings guidance and updates to a number of our financial disclosures including gross margin. 
Going forward, the fourth quarter will be when we update key financial disclosures and roll our hedge disclosures for the year. 
On Slide 8, as Chris stated, we had a very strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.68 per share, near the top end of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. 
Strong performance above our Utility and Generation businesses drove these results. The appendix contains further detail on both our fourth quarter and full year financial results by operating company on Slides 52 and 53. 
Turning to Slide 9. We expect to deliver full year 2017 adjusted operating earnings of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, with the first quarter in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our 2017 guidance range includes a full year contribution from PHI, contributions from the FitzPatrick plants after closing and the partial year impacts of the New York and Illinois ZEC programs that start on April 1 and June 1, respectively. 
The growth in utility earnings primarily reflects continued reliability investments at ComEd, plus higher formulaic allowed ROEs as well as increased rates from the recent distribution rate cases at BGE, ACE and Pepco Maryland. These are partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to a return to normal short cost after Comark 2016 as well as higher depreciation and amortization driven by capital expenditures. 
At Exelon Generation, the year-over-year decreases is primarily driven by the impact of hedging into lower energy prices, partially offset by revenues from the New York and Illinois ZEC programs as well as the new taxes CCGTs coming online this summer. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found on the appendix starting on Slide 55. 
On Slide 10, let's turn to our updated multi-year forecast that will cover 2017 to 2020 and provide a refresh of what we shared with you at the Analyst Day. For your convenience, in the appendix we show this updated number side-by-side against the analyst day numbers. 
We will [indiscernible] more than $20 billion into our utilities to the benefits of our customers over the next 4 years, which is a slight increase since Analyst Day. Upside comps from future energy jobs bill in Illinois which will allow ComEd to growth rate base and on an a fair rate of return on energy efficiency investments. We now project rate base growth of 6.5% through 2020. 
On Slide 11 of the $9 billion of rate base growth expected through 2020, approximately 75% is covered on either formula rates or other similar types of mechanisms. These timely recovery mechanisms allow us to make additional investments on the behalf of our customers while supporting our ability to earn our allowed ROE. Where we do not have mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to enact and implement these types of tools. 
I should also note that following the passage of the Illinois legislation more than 70% of our rate base is decoupled. 
On Slide 12, we showed a trailing 12-month blended transmission distribution earned booked ROE at each of the PHI utilities relative to their allowed ROEs. ROEs at PHI have improved modestly but there's still much work to be done. Legacy Exelon Utilities had a strong 2016, earning 10.5% as a group, helped by favorable weather and lower-than-normal storm activity. 
On a weather normalized basis, the earned returns or ROEs will be closer to 10.1%. Improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining a strong performance of the legacy Exelon Utilities is important to meeting our overall utility earnings growth targets. 
Going forward, we will provide the slide on a quarterly basis to keep you updated on the progress we're making on an earned returns perspective. 
On Slide 13, we have an update on our current rate cases that are still in progress. Since our last update, we have completed 2 of the pending rate cases: The Pepco Maryland case was decided in November and we received a $52.5 million revenue increase. 
In addition, the ComEd annual formula rate filing was settled in December with an increase of $127 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments which include $663 million for smart grid related work that help strengthen and modernize the electric system. 
We still have 4 pending rate cases at Pepco and Delmarva. The mine were asking for $216 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across those jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on the Delmarva Maryland case in mid-February, with the remaining cases being completed over the summer. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slide 61 through 66 in the appendix. 
Consistent with our previous discussions, we expect to file rate cases in each of the PHI the restrictions again in 2017 as we continue to close the gap between allowed and earned ROEs. 
Slide 14 provides an update on our outlook for utility EPS. The bars are largely the same as an Analyst Day, albeit an angle higher in 2017 and 2020. The increase in 2017 is due to continued cost management efforts and the increase in 2020 is due to ComEd's ROEs and efficiency-related investments. 
With a higher 2017 starting point, we now project strong 6% to 8% utility EPS growth through 2020. 
Turning to Slide 15, we've modified our gross margin disclosures for ExGen. We now included new line that carves out capacity and ZEC revenues. ZEC revenues are the payments Exelon receives in New York and Illinois for the beneficial environmental attributes of nuclear plants. The purpose of this new line item is to clearly call out the portion of our gross margins is more contracted in nature. 
As a result of including ZEC revenues from New York and Illinois, the Fitzpatrick acquisition and the reversal of the shut down decisions of Quad Cities and Clinton. Total gross margin increased by $650 million, $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion in 2017, '18 and '19, respectively. 
Almost all the gross margin changes relate to the fleet updates with changes in power prices adding $50 million in 2018 and costing us $50 million in 2019. 
Turning to Slide 16. On our last earnings call, we announced that we were reducing O&M by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen, adding to the $400 million of savings regarding taking out of the business. 
The baseline O&M outlook remains the same from last quarter, although the total O&M cost outlook has increased with the addition of the FitzPatrick, Quad Cities and Clinton power stations, which we break out on the slides for your reference. Our baseline capital spend is decreasing through 2020, driven by the proactive investments we've made in our nuclear fleet over the years. These investments have resulted in best-in-class performance that reduce risk for significant unplanned capital spending the future.  On Slide 40, we provide greater detail on these investments and the impact they have had on the nuclear fleet since 2010. 
We continue to run an efficient organization, and we'll always look for ways to reduce costs and run the fleet more cost-effectively while maintaining the highest standards for safety and reliability. 
Turning to Slide 17, ExGen will generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is more free cash flow for that time period than what was included in our analyst the disclosure. This is primarily driven by the incremental cash associated with the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, partially offset by the impact of lower power prices in the out there years. As we've said before, we will use ExGen's a free cash flow to fund utility investment and pay down over $3 billion of debt through 2020. 
Turning to Slide 18, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. We were forecasted to be at 3.3x debt-to-EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to a long-term target of 3x debt-to-EBITDA. 
As we said before, we will look to retire holding company debt once we've reached that 3x targeted ExGen. 
From a recourse perspective, we are already below the 3x debt-to-EBITDA level at 2.7x as shown here on the slide. This ratio will continue to decline as well with the pay down of debt to reach our consolidated 3x target. The health of our ExGen balance sheet is strong and is continuing to improve. 
Before I turn the call over to Chris, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the potential impacts of tax reform legislation to Exelon, which has been a topic of discussion since the election. 
Research reports and our peers have already reported earnings that discussed the impact sectors to their businesses. Our policy perspective, we think simplifying the tax code and lowering rates is the right objective. We are actively working with our partners at EEI and ENI and on our own to help [indiscernible] the tax design. No legislations has been introduced at this time, so no details on exactly what would be included and how will it be included is available beyond the short discussion of the truck plant or the house footprint. In fact, just last week, senate finance committee Chairman Haas said, he's not planning on using the house legislation as a start deploying point . So the Senate will have its own bill and there's no proposal for that bill at this time. And President Trump's economic team has stated that they will have their own views on tax reform once they are in place. 
At this time, there's no way to know when tax forms package will look like and how long it will take to advance, which leaves us of a mindset that is premature to quantify how tax reform will impact Exelon's financial outlook. We've run a wide range of scenarios to understand high-level impacts of common themes in the house and truck plants. The house blueprint excluding order adjustment provisions will be neutral for our utilities, neutral to positive at the Genco and negative at the holding company due to the elimination of all interest deductibility. 
Order adjustment will be an additional negative at ExGen due to the importation of nuclear fuel and at the utilities would raise the cost of imported handy capital equipment that goes in the rate base. We've seen significant opposition to both the order adjustment and elimination of interest expense deductibility recently leaving the fate of these provisions unclear. 
To the extent the Trump campaign becomes the basis of legislation and the election is made to take interest deductability rather than immediately spend capital additions, it can be meaningfully positive to Exelon's earnings. 
We see a long path until tax policy has clarity. We'll continue to advocate for the best interest of our customers and shareholders as legislation is developed. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

This is Exelon's value proposition, and we're not wavering from these commitments. Strong utility growth, we expect to grow the rate base at 2.5% annually through 2020 -- or 6.5% -- and cut that -- 6.5% annually through 2020, which converts to EPS growth off our 2017 midpoint of 6% to 8% a year. 
We will continue to look for opportunities to invest in reliability and customer service. ExGen is expected to generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is better than we had budgeted at the Analyst Day. 
We will use this free cash flow primarily to invest in the utilities, pay down over $3 billion of debt over the next years, and we will continue to optimize the value of ExGen through best-in-class operating like we saw in 2016, capturing the benefits of our gen-to-load matching strategy and fair compensation for our clean energy assets similar to what we've accomplished in Illinois and New York. 
We remain focused on the balance sheet and are comfortable -- comfortably exceeding our credit metrics targets over the planning horizon. And our capital allocation priorities will remain the same: Regulated utility growth, dividend growth and debt production. 
The leadership team firmly believes we can deliver on these commitments to our shareholders. Our executive compensation is directly tied to these goals, with the long-term components driven by keeping the multi-year earnings targets of the utilities, which ensures we grow this business as we've committed to you, meeting our targets improvements in earned ROEs at the utilities, which ensure we turn around the performance of the PHI utilities and maintain a strong investment-grade credit metrics, which ensures the financial health of the business no matter what the commodity price backdrop is. 
Finally, our long-term compensation will be adjusted point per point  with the 3-year performance relative to the UTY. Meaning, that we are directly in line with long-term shareholders. 
I'm proud of everything this team has accomplished in 2016 and very excited about the plan we have in place for the future.

We have a $900 million maturity in 2020 where I think you could see us potentially retire that or some component of that. And we're looking at opportunities with use of proceeds from variety of strategic activities that we have ongoing to address the roughly $600 million of export that's not tied to the mandatory convertibles reissuance of $1.15 billion in '17."

Spent a lot of time on my own with the EEI leadership in D.C. to kind of look at this utility -- this effect on utilities, utility customers and what has happened in the '86 tax bill. So there's certain things in regulated space that kind of created a difference. I'm sure a lot of industries turn to say they're different. But surely back in '86, the insurance industry and the utility industry -- regulated utility industry was recognized as an exemption or a different methodology. So that kind of conversation is happening within a process. It's not right to have the debate across the table until we have a bill, but coalescing under Tom's leadership and the EEI executive leadership and board, we're kind of working through those issues. Everybody's look for a lower corporate tax rate. That's an easy one. Jack talked about the probability of the blueprint staying the way it is now versus after the sausage is made is something we'll just have to stay engaged and follow. But you reduce and interest reduction from a utility, and that automatically goes on to the customer. And we got to make sure it's not an unintended tax increase to the customer, and we just have to work through those details."

Thank you for joining us. 2016 was a monumental year for Exelon, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. We made great progress in the ongoing transformation of our company while delivering on our commitments. We performed well financially. Our 2016 GAAP earnings at $1.22 and our non-GAAP earnings were $2.68, landing near the top of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70. At the utilities, we benefited from a hot summer and low storm cost. At ExGen, the nuclear fleet had its best performance year on record, and at Constellation, the team executed very, very well. 
In 2016, for the first time, our regulated utility, less the holding company, earnings represented more than half of the total earnings and is consistent with our goal for the utilities to be a growing the majority of our EPS. And we've implemented a dividend growth strategy of 2.5% annually through 2018.
In March, we closed on the acquisition of PHI, adding $8.3 billion to our utility rate base and creating a significant geographic footprint covering the mid-Atlantic region. The integration of PHI is going better than planned, helped by our experience with BGE. We are working our way through the first of the 2 cycles of catch-up rate cases at the PHI utilities. We're seeing additional opportunities to help and improve the business processes and the stakeholder outreach process as we go through those rate cases.
The other banner highlight for 2016 was the creation of the ZEC programs in both New York and Illinois. For years, we have argued that all clean energy resources be treated the same way for their environmental attributes. We are able to work with a wide range of stakeholders in both states to enact programs that compensate these plans for their environmental attributes. As a result of these programs, we plan to continue to operate 5 plants and protect high-paying jobs, preserve needed tax bases in rural communities and maintain irreplaceable, emission-free baseload power production. These programs provide a supplemental cash flow for up to 12 years for some of our most at-risk plants.
The Illinois legislation also provides significant benefit for our customers in energy efficiency, additional renewable generation and to benefit lower-income customers. The program also adds to the earnings visibility at ComEd by implementing a decoupling mechanism, supporting energy efficiency investments where we now will be able to earn on a return on those investments and extending the formula rate to 2022.
In 2016, we also found ways to further grow stable revenue streams. We deployed $5.2 billion of CapEx at the utilities, growing the rate bases by $2 billion, acquired ConEd Solutions and will close the FitzPatrick nuclear plant station this spring. We have completed 9 transmission and distribution rate cases, providing revenue increases of $397 million.
None of these accomplishments would be possible without the remarkable 34,000 employees that work hard every day to keep our power and gas flowing. Our workers donated over 170,000 hours to local nonprofits, and Exelon donated $46 million, both of which were the most ever for Exelon. The commitment to our community is clearly part of who we are and shows our engagement beyond the products we deliver every day.
We also recognize the support of our employees is essential to high-performing work cultures, and that is why Exelon took industry lead on 2 important initiatives in 2016. We expanded our pay leave policies to what are truly the best-in-class, with 16 weeks of maternity leave; 8 weeks for fathers and adoptive parents; and 2 weeks of family leave. We were also the first utility to sign the White House Equal Pay pledge.
Being a good citizen also means supporting our local businesses. In 2016, our spend with female- and minority-owned businesses reached $1.9 billion, over 200% since 2011, and it represents almost 20% of our sourceable spending. The team has done a great job making sure we work with our suppliers across all our communities.
Doing the right thing by our employees and communities is the smart thing for business, and more importantly, it's the right thing to do. We are proud to be leading the industry forward in these fronts.
Turning to operations. Our utilities had a great year. The legacy Exelon utilities continue to perform at top quartile on key operating and customer satisfaction metrics. These are the foundations of a constructive regulatory relationship.
The efforts at PHI before the merger and our intense focus on operations since then have started to show benefits. The color blocks are improving even compared to 2015, although we did get some help from favorable weather in 2016. PHI is still improving. We're encouraged by the gain so far, and we have a plan in place to deliver for our customers and stakeholders. 
The color blocks show a great performance, but this actually is underselling how well we did in 2016. We actually had a number of best evers this year. ComEd, BGE, PECO had their best customer satisfaction ever. ComEd and PHI outage frequency were the best ever, and BGE had its strongest average outage duration -- or shortest average outage duration ever. The benefits of our uniform management model across the utilities, our smart grid initiative and our continued reliability spending are currently paying dividends for our customers.
Turning to our nonregulated business operations. We had a banner year in generation as well. Our nuclear fleet had its highest-ever capacity factor at 94.6 versus the industry average of 90.4, which allowed us to produce an additional 7 terawatt hours more and approximately $275 million of revenue than if we had just been average. We also had the shortest average refueling duration ever, just over 22 days, versus the industry average of 37 days.
The fact the entire fleet performed so well against the backdrop of potential plant closures and fighting for ZECs is truly a testament to the professionalism of the workforce, which we all are greatly appreciative of.
Our gas, hydro and renewable assets also had a good year. Strong energy capture on the renewable and power dispatch on our conventional plants. At Constellation, the team performed exceptionally well. Our customer renewal rate was 77% for electric and 91% for gas. Equally important, our new business win rate was at 28% last year, and our C&I market share grew to 25%.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Jack to provide a financial update."

My remarks today will focus on 2016 results, 2017 earnings guidance and updates to a number of our financial disclosures, including gross margin.

My remarks today will focus on 2016 results, 2017 earnings guidance and updates to a number of our financial disclosures, including gross margin. Going forward, the fourth quarter will be when we update key financial disclosures and roll our hedge disclosures forward the year. 
On Slide 8, as Chris stated, we had a very strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.68 per share, near the top end of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Strong performance of both our utility and generation businesses drove these results. The appendix contains further detail on both our fourth quarter and full year financial results by operating company on Slides 52 and 53.
Turning to Slide 9. We expect to deliver full year 2017 adjusted operating earnings of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, with the first quarter in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our 2017 guidance range includes a full year contribution from PHI, contributions from the FitzPatrick plants after closing and the partial year impacts of the New York and Illinois ZEC programs that start on April 1 and June 1, respectively.
The growth in utility earnings primarily reflects continued reliability investments at ComEd, plus higher formulaic allowed ROEs as well as increased rates from the recent distribution rate cases at BGE, ACE and Pepco Maryland. These are partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to a return to normal storm cost after Coremark [ph] 2016 as well as higher depreciation and amortization driven by capital expenditures.
At Exelon Generation, the year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by the impact of hedging into lower energy prices, partially offset by revenues from the New York and Illinois ZEC programs as well as the new Texas CCGTs coming online this summer. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found on the appendix starting on Slide 55.
On Slide 10, let's turn to our updated multiyear forecast that will cover 2017 to 2020 and provide a refresh of what we shared with you at the Analyst Day. For your convenience, in the appendix, we show these updated numbers side by side against the Analyst Day numbers. 
We will invest more than $20 million into our utilities to the benefit of our customers over the next 4 years, which is a slight increase since Analyst Day. Upside comps from the future energy jobs bill at Illinois, which will allow ComEd to grow rate base and earn a fair rate of return on energy efficiency investments. We now project rate base growth of 6.5% through 2020.
On Slide 11, of the $9 billion of rate base growth expected through 2020, approximately 75% is covered on either formula rates or other similar types of mechanisms. These timely recovery mechanisms allow us to make additional investments on the behalf of our customers while supporting our ability to earn our allowed ROE. Where we do not have mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to enact and implement these types of tools. I should also note that following the passage of the Illinois legislation, more than 70% of our rate base is decoupled.
On Slide 12, we showed a trailing 12-month blended transmission distribution earned book ROE at each of the PHI utilities relative to their allowed ROEs. ROEs at PHI have improved modestly, but there's still much work to be done. Legacy Exelon utilities had a strong 2016, earning 10.5% as a group, helped by favorable weather and lower-than-normal storm activity. On a weather-normalized basis, the earned returns or ROEs would be closer to 10.1%. Improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining a strong performance of the legacy Exelon utilities will be important to meeting our overall utility earnings growth targets. Going forward, we will provide a slide on a quarterly basis to keep you updated on the progress we're making from an earned returns perspective.
On Slide 13, we have an update on our current rate cases that are still in progress. Since our last update, we have completed 2 of the pending rate cases. The Pepco Maryland case was decided in November, and we received a $52.5 million revenue increase. In addition, the ComEd annual formula rate filing was settled in December with an increase of $127 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments, which include $663 million for smart grid-related work, had helped strengthen and modernize the electric system.
We still have 4 pending rate cases at Pepco and Delmarva. Combined, we're asking for $216 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across those jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on the Delmarva Maryland case in mid-February, with the remaining cases being completed over the summer. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slide 61 through 66 in the appendix.
Consistent with our previous discussions, we expect to file rate cases in each of the PHI jurisdictions again in 2017 as we continue to close the gap between allowed and earned ROEs. 
Slide 14 provides an update on our outlook for utility EPS. The bars are largely the same as in Analyst Day, albeit $0.05 higher in 2017 and 2020. The increase in 2017 is due to continued cost management efforts, and the increase in 2020 is due to ComEd ROEs and efficiency-related investments. With a higher 2017 starting point, we are now -- we now project strong 6% to 8% utility EPS growth through 2020.
Turning to Slide 15. We've modified our gross margin disclosures for ExGen. We now include a new line that carves out capacity and ZEC revenues. ZEC revenues are the payments Exelon receives in New York and Illinois for the beneficial environmental attributes of our nuclear plants. The purpose of this new line item is to clearly call out the portion of our gross margin that is more contracted in nature. As a result of including ZEC revenues from New York and Illinois, the Fitzpatrick acquisition and the reserve -- reversal of the shutdown decisions of Quad Cities and Clinton, total gross margin increased by $650 million, $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion in 2017, '18 and '19, respectively. Almost all the gross margin changes relate to the fleet updates, with changes in power prices adding $50 million in 2018 and costing us $50 million in 2019.
Turning to Slide 16. On our last earnings call, we announced that we were reducing O&M by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. 
The baseline O&M outlook remains the same from last quarter, although the total O&M cost outlook has increased with the addition of the FitzPatrick, Quad Cities and Clinton power stations, which we break out on the slides for your reference. Our baseline capital spend is decreasing through 2020, driven by the proactive investments we've made in our nuclear fleet over the years. These investments have resulted in best-in-class performance and reduced risk for a significant unplanned capital spend in the future. On Slide 40, we provide greater detail on these investments and the impact they have had on the nuclear fleet since 2010.
We continue to run an efficient organization, and we'll always look for ways to reduce costs and run the fleet more cost-effectively while maintaining the highest standards for safety and reliability.
Turning to Slide 17. ExGen will generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is more free cash flow for that time period than what was included in our Analyst Day disclosure. This is primarily driven by the incremental cash associated with the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, partially offset by the impacts of lower power prices in the outer years. As we've said before, we will use ExGen's a free cash flow to fund utility investment and pay down over $3 billion of debt through 2020.
Turning to Slide 18. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. We are forecasted to be at 3.3x debt to EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long-term target of 3x debt to EBITDA. As we have said before, we will look to retire holding company debt once we have reached the 3x target at ExGen.
From a recourse perspective, we are already below the 3x debt-to-EBITDA level at 2.7x, as shown here on the slide. This ratio will continue to decline as well with the paydown of debt to reach our consolidated 3x target. The health of our ExGen balance sheet is strong and is continuing to improve.
Before I turn the call over to Chris, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the potential impacts of tax reform legislation to Exelon, which has been a topic of discussion since the election. Research reports and our peers who have already reported earnings have discussed the impacts to the sector and their businesses. From a policy perspective, we think simplifying the tax code and lowering rates is the right objective. We are actively working with our partners at EEI and NEI and all -- and on our own to helping form the ultimate tax design. No legislation has been introduced at this time, so no details on exactly what will be included or how it will be included is available beyond the short description of the Trump plan or the House Blueprint. In fact, just last week, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hass said he is not planning on using the House legislation as a starting point. So the Senate will have its own bill, and there's no proposal for that bill at this time. And President Trump's economic team has stated that they will have their own views on tax reform once they're in place.
At this time, there's no way to know what tax reform package will look like and how long it will take to advance, which leaves us of a mind-set that is premature to quantify how tax reform will impact Exelon's financial outlook. We have run a wide range of scenarios to understand high-level impacts of common themes in the House and Trump plans. The House Blueprint, excluding order adjustment provisions, will be neutral for our utilities, neutral to positive at the Genco and negative at the holding company due to the elimination of all interest deductibility.
Order adjustment will be an additional negative at ExGen due to the importation of nuclear fuel and, at the utilities, would raise the cost of imported handy capital equipment that goes in the rate base. We have seen significant opposition to both the border adjustment and elimination of interest expense deductibility recently, leaving the fate of these provisions unclear.
To the extent the Trump campaign becomes the basis of legislation and the election is made to take interest deductibility and -- rather than immediately expense capital additions, it can be meaningfully positive to Exelon's earnings. We see a long path until tax policy has clarity. We'll continue to advocate for the best interest of our customers and shareholders as legislation is developed.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

This is Exelon's value proposition, and we are not wavering from these commitments. Strong utility growth. We expect to grow the rate base at 2.5% annually through 2020 -- 6.5% -- and cut that one right away -- 6.5% annually through 2020, which converts to EPS growth off our 2017 midpoint of 6% to 8% a year. We will continue to look for opportunities to invest in reliability and customer service. ExGen is expected to generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is better than we had budgeted at the Analyst Day. We will use this free cash flow primarily to invest in the utilities, pay down over $3 billion of debt over the next years. And we will continue to optimize the value of ExGen through best-in-class operating like we saw in 2016, capturing the benefits of our gen-to-load matching strategy and fair compensation for our clean energy assets, similar to what we've accomplished in Illinois and New York. We remain focused on the balance sheet and are comfortable -- comfortably exceeding our credit metrics targets over the planning horizon. And our capital allocation priorities will remain the same: regulated utility growth, dividend growth and debt reduction. The leadership team firmly believes we can deliver on these commitments to our shareholders. 
Our executive compensation is directly tied to these goals, with the long-term components driven by hitting the multiyear earnings targets of the utilities, which ensures we grow this business as we have committed to you; meeting our targets improvements in earned ROEs at the utilities, which ensure we turn around the performance of the PHI utilities; and maintain a strong investment-grade credit metrics, which ensures the financial health of the business no matter what the commodity price backdrop is. Finally, our long-term compensation will be adjusted point per point  with the 3-year performance relative to the UTY; meaning, that we are directly in line with the long-term shareholders.
I'm proud of everything that this team has accomplished in 2016 and very excited about the plan we have in place for the future.

Spent a lot of time on my own with the East EEI leadership in D.C. to kind of look at this utility -- this effect on utilities, utility customers and what has happened in the '86 tax bill. So there are certain things in regulated space that kind of create a difference. I'm sure a lot of industries has turned to say they're different. But surely, back in '86, the insurance industry and the utility industry -- regulated utility industry was recognized as an exemption or a different methodology. So that kind of conversation is happening within the process. It's not right to have the debate across the table until we have a bill. But coalescing under Tom Kuhn's leadership and the EEI executive leadership and board, we're kind of working through those issues. Everybody is for a lower corporate tax rate. That's an easy one. Jack talked about the probability of the blueprint staying the way it is now versus after the sausage is made is something we'll just have to stay engaged and follow. But you reduce an interest reduction from a utility, and that automatically goes on to the customer. And we got to make sure it's not an unintended tax increase to the customer, and we just have to work through those details."

And as you mentioned, that will be 100% CP this year. That's obviously a positive change when you think about price. There was some movement in the import capabilities. We saw it shrink some into the ComEd zone, and we saw it increase slightly into Eastern map. So that has an offsetting effect in those 2 areas. I guess the big thing is it remains around the 2 biggest variables, which are the [indiscernible] behavior and, as you know, year-over-year, the energy rents are down given how low the prices were on the pool last year and then, additionally, what the new build is.

Thank you for joining us. 2016 was a monumental year for Exelon, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. We made great progress in the ongoing transformation of our company while delivering on our commitments",1084,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us. 2016 was a monumental year for Exelon, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. We made great progress in the ongoing transformation of our company while delivering on our commitments. We performed well financially. Our 2016 GAAP earnings at $1.22 and our non-GAAP earnings were $2.68, landing near the top of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70. At the utilities, we benefited from a hot summer and low storm cost. At ExGen, the nuclear fleet had its best performance year on record, and at Constellation, the team executed very, very well. 
In 2016, for the first time, our regulated utility, less the holding company, earnings represented more than half of the total earnings and is consistent with our goal for the utilities to be a growing the majority of our EPS. And we've implemented a dividend growth strategy of 2.5% annually through 2018.
In March, we closed on the acquisition of PHI, adding $8.3 billion to our utility rate base and creating a significant geographic footprint covering the Mid-Atlantic region. The integration of PHI is going better than planned, helped by our experience with BGE. We are working our way through the first of the 2 cycles of catch-up rate cases at the PHI utilities. We're seeing additional opportunities to help and improve the business processes and the stakeholder outreach process as we go through those rate cases.
The other banner highlight for 2016 was the creation of the ZEC programs in both New York and Illinois. For years, we have argued that all clean energy resources be treated the same way for their environmental attributes. We are able to work with a wide range of stakeholders in both states to enact programs that compensate these plans for their environmental attributes. As a result of these programs, we plan to continue to operate 5 plants and protect high-paying jobs, preserve needed tax bases in rural communities and maintain irreplaceable, emission-free baseload power production. These programs provide a supplemental cash flow for up to 12 years for some of our most at-risk plants.
The Illinois legislation also provides significant benefit for our customers in energy efficiency, additional renewable generation and to benefit lower-income customers. The program also adds to the earnings visibility at ComEd by implementing a decoupling mechanism, supporting energy efficiency investments where we now will be able to earn on a return on those investments and extending the formula rate to 2022.
In 2016, we also found ways to further grow stable revenue streams. We deployed $5.2 billion of CapEx at the utilities, growing the rate bases by $2 billion, acquired ConEd Solutions and will close the FitzPatrick nuclear plant station this spring. We have completed 9 transmission and distribution rate cases, providing revenue increases of $397 million.
None of these accomplishments would be possible without the remarkable 34,000 employees that work hard every day to keep our power and gas flowing. Our workers donated over 170,000 hours to local nonprofits, and Exelon donated $46 million, both of which were the most ever for Exelon. The commitment to our community is clearly part of who we are and shows our engagement beyond the products we deliver every day.
We also recognize that the support of our employees is essential to high-performing work cultures, and that is why Exelon took industry lead on 2 important initiatives in 2016. We expanded our pay leave policies to what are truly the best-in-class, with 16 weeks of maternity leave; 8 weeks for fathers and adoptive parents; and 2 weeks of family leave. We were also the first utility to sign the White House Equal Pay pledge.
Being a good citizen also means supporting our local businesses. In 2016, our spend with female- and minority-owned businesses reached $1.9 billion, over 200% since 2011, and it represents almost 20% of our sourceable spending. The team has done a great job making sure we work with our suppliers across all our communities.
Doing the right thing by our employees and communities is the smart thing for business, and more importantly, it's the right thing to do. We are proud to be leading the industry forward in these fronts.
Turning to operations. Our utilities had a great year. The legacy Exelon utilities continue to perform at top quartile on key operating and customer satisfaction metrics. These are the foundations of a constructive regulatory relationship.
The efforts at PHI before the merger and our intense focus on operations since then have started to show benefits. The color blocks are improving even compared to 2015, although we did get some help from favorable weather in 2016. PHI is still improving. We're encouraged by the gain so far, and we have a plan in place to deliver for our customers and stakeholders. 
The color blocks show a great performance, but this actually is underselling how well we did in 2016. We actually had a number of best evers this year. ComEd, BGE, PECO had their best customer satisfaction ever. ComEd and PHI outage frequency were the best ever, and BGE had its strongest average outage duration -- or shortest average outage duration ever. The benefits of our uniform management model across the utilities, our smart grid initiative and our continued reliability spending are currently paying dividends for our customers.
Turning to our nonregulated business operations. We had a banner year in generation as well. Our nuclear fleet had its highest-ever capacity factor at 94.6 versus the industry average of 90.4, which allowed us to produce an additional 7 terawatt hours more and approximately $275 million of revenue than if we had just been average. We also had the shortest average refueling duration ever, just over 22 days, versus the industry average of 37 days.
The fact the entire fleet performed so well against the backdrop of potential plant closures and fighting for ZECs is truly a testament to the professionalism of the workforce, which we all are greatly appreciative of.
Our gas, hydro and renewable assets also had a good year. Strong energy capture on the renewable and power dispatch on our conventional plants. At Constellation, the team performed exceptionally well. Our customer renewal rate was 77% for electric and 91% for gas. Equally important, our new business win rate was at 28% last year, and our C&I market share grew to 25%.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Jack to provide a financial update."

My remarks today will focus on 2016 results, 2017 earnings guidance and updates to a number of our financial disclosures, including gross margin.

My remarks today will focus on 2016 results, 2017 earnings guidance and updates to a number of our financial disclosures, including gross margin. Going forward, the fourth quarter will be when we update key financial disclosures and roll our hedge disclosures forward the year. 
On Slide 8, as Chris stated, we had a very strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.68 per share, near the top end of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Strong performance of both our utility and generation businesses drove these results. The appendix contains further detail on both our fourth quarter and full year financial results by operating company on Slides 52 and 53.
Turning to Slide 9. We expect to deliver full year 2017 adjusted operating earnings of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, with the first quarter in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our 2017 guidance range includes a full year contribution from PHI, contributions from the FitzPatrick plants after closing and the partial year impacts of the New York and Illinois ZEC programs that start on April 1 and June 1, respectively.
The growth in utility earnings primarily reflects continued reliability investments at ComEd, plus higher formulaic allowed ROEs as well as increased rates from the recent distribution rate cases at BGE, ACE and Pepco Maryland. These are partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to a return to normal storm costs and after a calmer 2016 as well as higher depreciation and amortization driven by capital expenditures.
At Exelon Generation, the year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by the impact of hedging into lower energy prices, partially offset by revenues from the New York and Illinois ZEC programs as well as the new Texas CCGTs coming online this summer. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found on the appendix starting on Slide 55.
On Slide 10, let's turn to our updated multiyear forecast that will cover 2017 to 2020 and provide a refresh of what we shared with you at the Analyst Day. For your convenience, in the appendix, we show these updated numbers side by side against the Analyst Day numbers. 
We will invest more than $20 million into our utilities to the benefit of our customers over the next 4 years, which is a slight increase since Analyst Day. Upside comps from the Future Energy Jobs Bill at Illinois, which will allow ComEd to grow rate base and earn a fair rate of return on energy efficiency investments. We now project rate base growth of 6.5% through 2020.
On Slide 11, of the $9 billion of rate base growth expected through 2020, approximately 75% is covered on either formula rates or other similar types of mechanisms. These timely recovery mechanisms allow us to make additional investments on the behalf of our customers while supporting our ability to earn our allowed ROE. Where we do not have mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to enact and implement these types of tools. I should also note that following the passage of the Illinois legislation, more than 70% of our rate base is decoupled.
On Slide 12, we showed a trailing 12-month blended transmission distribution earned book ROE at each of the PHI utilities relative to their allowed ROEs. ROEs at PHI have improved modestly, but there's still much work to be done. Legacy Exelon utilities had a strong 2016, earning 10.5% as a group, helped by favorable weather and lower-than-normal storm activity. On a weather-normalized basis, the earned returns or ROEs would be closer to 10.1%. Improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining a strong performance of the legacy Exelon utilities will be important to meeting our overall utility earnings growth targets. Going forward, we will provide a slide on a quarterly basis to keep you updated on the progress we're making from an earned returns perspective.
On Slide 13, we have an update on our current rate cases that are still in progress. Since our last update, we have completed 2 of the pending rate cases. The Pepco Maryland case was decided in November, and we received a $52.5 million revenue increase. In addition, the ComEd annual formula rate filing was settled in December with an increase of $127 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments, which include $663 million for smart grid-related work, had helped strengthen and modernize the electric system.
We still have 4 pending rate cases at Pepco and Delmarva. Combined, we're asking for $216 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across those jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on the Delmarva Maryland case in mid-February, with the remaining cases being completed over the summer. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slide 61 through 66 in the appendix.
Consistent with our previous discussions, we expect to file rate cases in each of the PHI jurisdictions again in 2017 as we continue to close the gap between allowed and earned ROEs. 
Slide 14 provides an update on our outlook for utility EPS. The bars are largely the same as in Analyst Day, albeit $0.05 higher in 2017 and 2020. The increase in 2017 is due to continued cost management efforts, and the increase in 2020 is due to ComEd ROEs and efficiency-related investments. With a higher 2017 starting point, we are now -- we now project strong 6% to 8% utility EPS growth through 2020.
Turning to Slide 15. We've modified our gross margin disclosures for ExGen. We now include a new line that carves out capacity and ZEC revenues. ZEC revenues are the payments Exelon receives in New York and Illinois for the beneficial environmental attributes of our nuclear plants. The purpose of this new line item is to clearly call out the portion of our gross margin that is more contracted in nature. As a result of including ZEC revenues from New York and Illinois, the Fitzpatrick acquisition and the reserve -- reversal of the shutdown decisions of Quad Cities and Clinton, total gross margin increased by $650 million, $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion in 2017, '18 and '19, respectively. Almost all the gross margin changes relate to the fleet updates, with changes in power prices adding $50 million in 2018 and costing us $50 million in 2019.
Turning to Slide 16. On our last earnings call, we announced that we were reducing O&M by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. 
The baseline O&M outlook remains the same from last quarter, although the total O&M cost outlook has increased with the addition of the FitzPatrick, Quad Cities and Clinton power stations, which we break out on the slides for your reference. Our baseline capital spend is decreasing through 2020, driven by the proactive investments we've made in our nuclear fleet over the years. These investments have resulted in best-in-class performance and reduced risk for a significant unplanned capital spend in the future. On Slide 40, we provide greater detail on these investments and the impact they have had on the nuclear fleet since 2010.
We continue to run an efficient organization, and we'll always look for ways to reduce costs and run the fleet more cost-effectively while maintaining the highest standards for safety and reliability.
Turning to Slide 17. ExGen will generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is more free cash flow for that time period than what was included in our Analyst Day disclosure. This is primarily driven by the incremental cash associated with the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, partially offset by the impacts of lower power prices in the outer years. As we've said before, we will use ExGen's a free cash flow to fund utility investment and pay down over $3 billion of debt through 2020.
Turning to Slide 18. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. We are forecasted to be at 3.3x debt to EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long-term target of 3x debt to EBITDA. As we have said before, we will look to retire holding company debt once we have reached the 3x target at ExGen.
From a recourse perspective, we are already below the 3x debt-to-EBITDA level at 2.7x, as shown here on the slide. This ratio will continue to decline as well with the paydown of debt to reach our consolidated 3x target. The health of our ExGen balance sheet is strong and is continuing to improve.
Before I turn the call over to Chris, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the potential impacts of tax reform legislation to Exelon, which has been a topic of discussion since the election. Research reports and our peers who have already reported earnings have discussed the impacts to the sector and their businesses. From a policy perspective, we think simplifying the tax code and lowering rates is the right objective. We are actively working with our partners at EEI and NEI and all -- and on our own to helping form the ultimate tax design. No legislation has been introduced at this time, so no details on exactly what will be included or how it will be included is available beyond the short description of the Trump plan or the House Blueprint. In fact, just last week, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hass said he is not planning on using the House legislation as a starting point. So the Senate will have its own bill, and there's no proposal for that bill at this time. And President Trump's economic team has stated that they will have their own views on tax reform once they're in place.
At this time, there's no way to know what tax reform package will look like and how long it will take to advance, which leaves us of a mindset that it is premature to quantify how tax reform will impact Exelon's financial outlook. We have run a wide range of scenarios to understand high-level impacts of common themes in the House and Trump plans. The House Blueprint, excluding order adjustment provisions, will be neutral for our utilities, neutral to positive at the Genco and negative at the holding company due to the elimination of all interest deductibility.
Order adjustment will be an additional negative at ExGen due to the importation of nuclear fuel, as the utilities would raise the cost of imported T&D [ph] capital equipment that goes in the rate base. We have seen significant opposition to both the border adjustment and elimination of interest expense deductibility recently, leaving the fate of these provisions unclear.
To the extent the Trump campaign becomes the basis of legislation and the election is made to take interest deductibility and -- rather than immediately expense capital additions, it can be meaningfully positive to Exelon's earnings. We see a long path until tax policy has clarity. We'll continue to advocate for the best interest of our customers and shareholders as legislation is developed.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

This is Exelon's value proposition, and we are not wavering from these commitments. Strong utility growth. We expect to grow the rate base at 2.5% -- annually through 2020 -- 6.5% -- Anne caught that one right away -- 6.5% annually through 2020, which converts to EPS growth off our 2017 midpoint of 6% to 8% a year. We will continue to look for opportunities to invest in reliability and customer service. ExGen is expected to generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is better than we had budgeted at the Analyst Day. We will use this free cash flow primarily to invest in the utilities, pay down over $3 billion of debt over the next years. And we will continue to optimize the value of ExGen through best-in-class operating like we saw in 2016, capturing the benefits of our gen-to-load matching strategy and fair compensation for our clean energy assets, similar to what we've accomplished in Illinois and New York. We remain focused on the balance sheet and are comfortable -- comfortably exceeding our credit metrics targets over the planning horizon. And our capital allocation priorities will remain the same: regulated utility growth, dividend growth and debt reduction. The leadership team firmly believes we can deliver on these commitments to our shareholders. 
Our executive compensation is directly tied to these goals, with the long-term components driven by hitting the multiyear earnings targets of the utilities, which ensures we grow this business as we have committed to you; meeting our targets improvements in earned ROEs at the utilities, which ensure we turn around the performance of the PHI utilities; and maintain the strong investment-grade credit metrics, which ensures the financial health of the business no matter what the commodity price backdrop is. Finally, our long-term compensation will be adjusted point per point with the 3-year performance relative to the UTY; meaning, that we are directly in line with the long-term shareholders.
I'm proud of everything that this team has accomplished in 2016 and very excited about the plan we have in place for the future. 
So with that, Stephanie, we can open it up for questions."

Spent a lot of time on my own with the East EEI leadership in D.C. to kind of look at this utility -- this effect on utilities, utility customers and what has happened in the '86 tax bill. So there are certain things in regulated space that kind of create a difference. I'm sure a lot of industries are trying to say they're different. But surely, back in '86, the insurance industry and the utility industry -- regulated utility industry was recognized as an exemption or a different methodology. So that kind of conversation is happening within the process. It's not right to have the debate across the table until we have a bill. But coalescing under Tom Kuhn's leadership and the EEI executive leadership and board, we're kind of working through those issues. Everybody is for a lower corporate tax rate. That's an easy one. Jack talked about the probability of the blueprint staying the way it is now versus after the sausage is made is something we'll just have to stay engaged and follow. But you reduce an interest reduction from a utility, and that automatically goes on to the customer. And we got to make sure it's not an unintended tax increase to the customer, and we just have to work through those details."

And as you mentioned, that will be 100% CP this year. That's obviously a positive change when you think about price. There was some movement in the import capabilities. We saw it shrink some into the ComEd zone, and we saw it increase slightly into Eastern MACT. So that has an offsetting effect in those 2 areas. I guess the big thing is it remains around the 2 biggest variables, which are the bidding behavior and, as you know, year-over-year, the energy rents are down given how low the prices were on the pool last year and then, additionally, what the newbuild is. And we continue to struggle to see how the economics of that newbuild works given how marginal it is at best with where the market is on a forward basis. So putting that all together, there's a lot of moving pieces.

Thank you for joining us. 2016 was a monumental year for Exelon, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. We made great progress in the ongoing transformation of our company while delivering on our commitments",1084,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us. 2016 was a monumental year for Exelon, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. We made great progress in the ongoing transformation of our company while delivering on our commitments. We performed well financially. Our 2016 GAAP earnings at $1.22 and our non-GAAP earnings were $2.68, landing near the top of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70. At the utilities, we benefited from a hot summer and low storm cost. At ExGen, the nuclear fleet had its best performance year on record, and at Constellation, the team executed very, very well. 
In 2016, for the first time, our regulated utility, less the holding company, earnings represented more than half of the total earnings and is consistent with our goal for the utilities to be a growing the majority of our EPS. And we've implemented a dividend growth strategy of 2.5% annually through 2018.
In March, we closed on the acquisition of PHI, adding $8.3 billion to our utility rate base and creating a significant geographic footprint covering the Mid-Atlantic region. The integration of PHI is going better than planned, helped by our experience with BGE. We are working our way through the first of the 2 cycles of catch-up rate cases at the PHI utilities. We're seeing additional opportunities to help and improve the business processes and the stakeholder outreach process as we go through those rate cases.
The other banner highlight for 2016 was the creation of the ZEC programs in both New York and Illinois. For years, we have argued that all clean energy resources be treated the same way for their environmental attributes. We are able to work with a wide range of stakeholders in both states to enact programs that compensate these plans for their environmental attributes. As a result of these programs, we plan to continue to operate 5 plants and protect high-paying jobs, preserve needed tax bases in rural communities and maintain irreplaceable, emission-free baseload power production. These programs provide a supplemental cash flow for up to 12 years for some of our most at-risk plants.
The Illinois legislation also provides significant benefit for our customers in energy efficiency, additional renewable generation and to benefit lower-income customers. The program also adds to the earnings visibility at ComEd by implementing a decoupling mechanism, supporting energy efficiency investments where we now will be able to earn on a return on those investments and extending the formula rate to 2022.
In 2016, we also found ways to further grow stable revenue streams. We deployed $5.2 billion of CapEx at the utilities, growing the rate bases by $2 billion, acquired ConEd Solutions and will close the FitzPatrick nuclear plant station this spring. We have completed 9 transmission and distribution rate cases, providing revenue increases of $397 million.
None of these accomplishments would be possible without the remarkable 34,000 employees that work hard every day to keep our power and gas flowing. Our workers donated over 170,000 hours to local nonprofits, and Exelon donated $46 million, both of which were the most ever for Exelon. The commitment to our community is clearly part of who we are and shows our engagement beyond the products we deliver every day.
We also recognize that the support of our employees is essential to high-performing work cultures, and that is why Exelon took industry lead on 2 important initiatives in 2016. We expanded our pay leave policies to what are truly the best-in-class, with 16 weeks of maternity leave; 8 weeks for fathers and adoptive parents; and 2 weeks of family leave. We were also the first utility to sign the White House Equal Pay pledge.
Being a good citizen also means supporting our local businesses. In 2016, our spend with female- and minority-owned businesses reached $1.9 billion, over 200% since 2011, and it represents almost 20% of our sourceable spending. The team has done a great job making sure we work with our suppliers across all our communities.
Doing the right thing by our employees and communities is the smart thing for business, and more importantly, it's the right thing to do. We are proud to be leading the industry forward in these fronts.
Turning to operations. Our utilities had a great year. The legacy Exelon utilities continue to perform at top quartile on key operating and customer satisfaction metrics. These are the foundations of a constructive regulatory relationship.
The efforts at PHI before the merger and our intense focus on operations since then have started to show benefits. The color blocks are improving even compared to 2015, although we did get some help from favorable weather in 2016. PHI is still improving. We're encouraged by the gain so far, and we have a plan in place to deliver for our customers and stakeholders. 
The color blocks show a great performance, but this actually is underselling how well we did in 2016. We actually had a number of best evers this year. ComEd, BGE, PECO had their best customer satisfaction ever. ComEd and PHI outage frequency were the best ever, and BGE had its strongest average outage duration -- or shortest average outage duration ever. The benefits of our uniform management model across the utilities, our smart grid initiative and our continued reliability spending are currently paying dividends for our customers.
Turning to our nonregulated business operations. We had a banner year in generation as well. Our nuclear fleet had its highest-ever capacity factor at 94.6 versus the industry average of 90.4, which allowed us to produce an additional 7 terawatt hours more and approximately $275 million of revenue than if we had just been average. We also had the shortest average refueling duration ever, just over 22 days, versus the industry average of 37 days.
The fact the entire fleet performed so well against the backdrop of potential plant closures and fighting for ZECs is truly a testament to the professionalism of the workforce, which we all are greatly appreciative of.
Our gas, hydro and renewable assets also had a good year. Strong energy capture on the renewable and power dispatch on our conventional plants. At Constellation, the team performed exceptionally well. Our customer renewal rate was 77% for electric and 91% for gas. Equally important, our new business win rate was at 28% last year, and our C&I market share grew to 25%.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Jack to provide a financial update."

On Slide 8, as Chris stated, we had a very strong year financially and operationally across the company.

Strong performance of both our utility and generation businesses drove these results. The appendix contains further detail on both our fourth quarter and full year financial results by operating company on Slides 52 and 53.
Turning to Slide 9. We expect to deliver full year 2017 adjusted operating earnings of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, with the first quarter in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our 2017 guidance range includes a full year contribution from PHI, contributions from the FitzPatrick plants after closing and the partial year impacts of the New York and Illinois ZEC programs that start on April 1 and June 1, respectively.
The growth in utility earnings primarily reflects continued reliability investments at ComEd, plus higher formulaic allowed ROEs as well as increased rates from the recent distribution rate cases at BGE, ACE and Pepco Maryland. These are partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to a return to normal storm costs and after a calmer 2016 as well as higher depreciation and amortization driven by capital expenditures.
At Exelon Generation, the year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by the impact of hedging into lower energy prices, partially offset by revenues from the New York and Illinois ZEC programs as well as the new Texas CCGTs coming online this summer. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found on the appendix starting on Slide 55.
On Slide 10, let's turn to our updated multiyear forecast that will cover 2017 to 2020 and provide a refresh of what we shared with you at the Analyst Day. For your convenience, in the appendix, we show these updated numbers side by side against the Analyst Day numbers. 
We will invest more than $20 million into our utilities to the benefit of our customers over the next 4 years, which is a slight increase since Analyst Day. Upside comps from the Future Energy Jobs Bill at Illinois, which will allow ComEd to grow rate base and earn a fair rate of return on energy efficiency investments. We now project rate base growth of 6.5% through 2020.
On Slide 11, of the $9 billion of rate base growth expected through 2020, approximately 75% is covered on either formula rates or other similar types of mechanisms. These timely recovery mechanisms allow us to make additional investments on the behalf of our customers while supporting our ability to earn our allowed ROE. Where we do not have mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to enact and implement these types of tools. I should also note that following the passage of the Illinois legislation, more than 70% of our rate base is decoupled.
On Slide 12, we showed a trailing 12-month blended transmission distribution earned book ROE at each of the PHI utilities relative to their allowed ROEs. ROEs at PHI have improved modestly, but there's still much work to be done. Legacy Exelon utilities had a strong 2016, earning 10.5% as a group, helped by favorable weather and lower-than-normal storm activity. On a weather-normalized basis, the earned returns or ROEs would be closer to 10.1%. Improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining a strong performance of the legacy Exelon utilities will be important to meeting our overall utility earnings growth targets. Going forward, we will provide a slide on a quarterly basis to keep you updated on the progress we're making from an earned returns perspective.
On Slide 13, we have an update on our current rate cases that are still in progress. Since our last update, we have completed 2 of the pending rate cases. The Pepco Maryland case was decided in November, and we received a $52.5 million revenue increase. In addition, the ComEd annual formula rate filing was settled in December with an increase of $127 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments, which include $663 million for smart grid-related work, had helped strengthen and modernize the electric system.
We still have 4 pending rate cases at Pepco and Delmarva. Combined, we're asking for $216 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across those jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on the Delmarva Maryland case in mid-February, with the remaining cases being completed over the summer. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slide 61 through 66 in the appendix.
Consistent with our previous discussions, we expect to file rate cases in each of the PHI jurisdictions again in 2017 as we continue to close the gap between allowed and earned ROEs. 
Slide 14 provides an update on our outlook for utility EPS. The bars are largely the same as in Analyst Day, albeit $0.05 higher in 2017 and 2020. The increase in 2017 is due to continued cost management efforts, and the increase in 2020 is due to ComEd ROEs and efficiency-related investments. With a higher 2017 starting point, we are now -- we now project strong 6% to 8% utility EPS growth through 2020.
Turning to Slide 15. We've modified our gross margin disclosures for ExGen. We now include a new line that carves out capacity and ZEC revenues. ZEC revenues are the payments Exelon receives in New York and Illinois for the beneficial environmental attributes of our nuclear plants. The purpose of this new line item is to clearly call out the portion of our gross margin that is more contracted in nature. As a result of including ZEC revenues from New York and Illinois, the Fitzpatrick acquisition and the reserve -- reversal of the shutdown decisions of Quad Cities and Clinton, total gross margin increased by $650 million, $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion in 2017, '18 and '19, respectively. Almost all the gross margin changes relate to the fleet updates, with changes in power prices adding $50 million in 2018 and costing us $50 million in 2019.
Turning to Slide 16. On our last earnings call, we announced that we were reducing O&M by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. 
The baseline O&M outlook remains the same from last quarter, although the total O&M cost outlook has increased with the addition of the FitzPatrick, Quad Cities and Clinton power stations, which we break out on the slides for your reference. Our baseline capital spend is decreasing through 2020, driven by the proactive investments we've made in our nuclear fleet over the years. These investments have resulted in best-in-class performance and reduced risk for a significant unplanned capital spend in the future. On Slide 40, we provide greater detail on these investments and the impact they have had on the nuclear fleet since 2010.
We continue to run an efficient organization, and we'll always look for ways to reduce costs and run the fleet more cost-effectively while maintaining the highest standards for safety and reliability.
Turning to Slide 17. ExGen will generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is more free cash flow for that time period than what was included in our Analyst Day disclosure. This is primarily driven by the incremental cash associated with the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, partially offset by the impacts of lower power prices in the outer years. As we've said before, we will use ExGen's a free cash flow to fund utility investment and pay down over $3 billion of debt through 2020.
Turning to Slide 18. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. We are forecasted to be at 3.3x debt to EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long-term target of 3x debt to EBITDA. As we have said before, we will look to retire holding company debt once we have reached the 3x target at ExGen.
From a recourse perspective, we are already below the 3x debt-to-EBITDA level at 2.7x, as shown here on the slide. This ratio will continue to decline as well with the paydown of debt to reach our consolidated 3x target. The health of our ExGen balance sheet is strong and is continuing to improve.
Before I turn the call over to Chris, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the potential impacts of tax reform legislation to Exelon, which has been a topic of discussion since the election. Research reports and our peers who have already reported earnings have discussed the impacts to the sector and their businesses. From a policy perspective, we think simplifying the tax code and lowering rates is the right objective. We are actively working with our partners at EEI and NEI and all -- and on our own to helping form the ultimate tax design. No legislation has been introduced at this time, so no details on exactly what will be included or how it will be included is available beyond the short description of the Trump plan or the House Blueprint. In fact, just last week, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hass said he is not planning on using the House legislation as a starting point. So the Senate will have its own bill, and there's no proposal for that bill at this time. And President Trump's economic team has stated that they will have their own views on tax reform once they're in place.
At this time, there's no way to know what tax reform package will look like and how long it will take to advance, which leaves us of a mindset that it is premature to quantify how tax reform will impact Exelon's financial outlook. We have run a wide range of scenarios to understand high-level impacts of common themes in the House and Trump plans. The House Blueprint, excluding order adjustment provisions, will be neutral for our utilities, neutral to positive at the Genco and negative at the holding company due to the elimination of all interest deductibility.
Order adjustment will be an additional negative at ExGen due to the importation of nuclear fuel, as the utilities would raise the cost of imported T&D [ph] capital equipment that goes in the rate base. We have seen significant opposition to both the border adjustment and elimination of interest expense deductibility recently, leaving the fate of these provisions unclear.
To the extent the Trump campaign becomes the basis of legislation and the election is made to take interest deductibility and -- rather than immediately expense capital additions, it can be meaningfully positive to Exelon's earnings. We see a long path until tax policy has clarity. We'll continue to advocate for the best interest of our customers and shareholders as legislation is developed.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We expect to grow the rate base at 2.5% -- annually through 2020 -- 6.5% -- Anne caught that one right away -- 6.5% annually through 2020, which converts to EPS growth off our 2017 midpoint of 6% to 8% a year. We will continue to look for opportunities to invest in reliability and customer service. ExGen is expected to generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is better than we had budgeted at the Analyst Day. We will use this free cash flow primarily to invest in the utilities, pay down over $3 billion of debt over the next years. And we will continue to optimize the value of ExGen through best-in-class operating like we saw in 2016, capturing the benefits of our gen-to-load matching strategy and fair compensation for our clean energy assets, similar to what we've accomplished in Illinois and New York. We remain focused on the balance sheet and are comfortable -- comfortably exceeding our credit metrics targets over the planning horizon. And our capital allocation priorities will remain the same: regulated utility growth, dividend growth and debt reduction. The leadership team firmly believes we can deliver on these commitments to our shareholders. 
Our executive compensation is directly tied to these goals, with the long-term components driven by hitting the multiyear earnings targets of the utilities, which ensures we grow this business as we have committed to you; meeting our targets improvements in earned ROEs at the utilities, which ensure we turn around the performance of the PHI utilities; and maintain the strong investment-grade credit metrics, which ensures the financial health of the business no matter what the commodity price backdrop is. Finally, our long-term compensation will be adjusted point per point with the 3-year performance relative to the UTY; meaning, that we are directly in line with the long-term shareholders.
I'm proud of everything that this team has accomplished in 2016 and very excited about the plan we have in place for the future. 
So with that, Stephanie, we can open it up for questions."

But surely, back in '86, the insurance industry and the utility industry -- regulated utility industry was recognized as an exemption or a different methodology. So that kind of conversation is happening within the process. It's not right to have the debate across the table until we have a bill. But coalescing under Tom Kuhn's leadership and the EEI executive leadership and board, we're kind of working through those issues. Everybody is for a lower corporate tax rate. That's an easy one. Jack talked about the probability of the blueprint staying the way it is now versus after the sausage is made is something we'll just have to stay engaged and follow.

And as you mentioned, that will be 100% CP this year. That's obviously a positive change when you think about price. There was some movement in the import capabilities. We saw it shrink some into the ComEd zone, and we saw it increase slightly into Eastern MACT. So that has an offsetting effect in those 2 areas. I guess the big thing is it remains around the 2 biggest variables, which are the bidding behavior and, as you know, year-over-year, the energy rents are down given how low the prices were on the pool last year and then, additionally, what the newbuild is. And we continue to struggle to see how the economics of that newbuild works given how marginal it is at best with where the market is on a forward basis. So putting that all together, there's a lot of moving pieces. Our long-standing policy is really not to try to forecast that, but there's a lot of puts and takes that we're evaluating as we go through this."

We're off to a great start for 2017. In March, we marked our one year anniversary of the merger between Exelon and Pepco Holdings. 
Since the close, PHI has successfully executed on merger commitments, achieved synergy savings and made significant progress toward full integration. 
We also continue to work hard on the regulatory front. Since the beginning of the year, PHI closed out the Delmarva Maryland rate case and reached a settlement for our electric and gas rate case in Delaware. We're now down to just Pepco DC cases from our first plant cycle of rate case filings. 
That said, our regulatory team has already started the second cycle of rate cases at Pepco Maryland and Asus plant. 
At ExGen, we completed the acquisition of FitzPatrick power plant, representing the 25th nuclear reactor where we have ownership stake. We welcome the new employees to the Exelon family. 
We also announced the Exelon Generation renewable joint venture, which is allowing us to recycle capital at valuation meaningfully above the value implied for our ExGen at our current share price. The JV allows us to make even faster progress on our debt reduction goals without diminishing our commitment to renewable power. 
We continue to focus on the legal challenges to the Zero Emission Credits, or ZEC, in New York and Illinois. We remain confident that our arguments will prevail. We'll cover these points in more detail in the call, but I wanted to highlight what we have done while staying focused on the day-to-day operations. 
As shown on Slide 5, on a GAAP basis, we've earned $1.07 versus $0.19 a share last year and on an operating basis, we earned $0.65 versus $0.68 last year, which puts us at the top of our $0.55 to $0.65 range and above consensus of $0.62. 
Moving to Slide 6. Our first operation -- our first quarter operations report was strong. Our color block charts highlight operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities. 
Legacy Exelon Utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. PECO actually had its best customer satisfaction rating ever during first quarter. BGE experienced the best ever CAIDI and SAIFI performance of all time. At PHI, we're encouraged by the progress we are making and our customers are seeing the benefits. 
For example, by using a common lockout tug out process, a procedure that has established a zone of protection while restoring equipment, we were able to send over 400 employees and contractors from BGE, ComEd and PECO to support the storm restoration at Delmarva during winter Storm Stellar. 
As a result, Delmarva customers had their power restored 2 days sooner. Our thanks to everybody that helped accomplishing that speedy recovery. 
The power of Exelon Utilities platform is significant benefit to our customers. We continue to improve upon these metrics to meet reliability commitments we have made to provide better service to our customers. 
The nuclear team had a great quarter also. They completed 3 refueling outages and achieved the capacity factor of 94%. 
They had also had the fastest refueling outage ever for Calver nuclear station 2, running 20 days. 
In the Power business, we realized renewable energy capture rate of nearly 96% and a power dispatch match of 94% over 99%. 
Our 2 newbuilds, CCGT in Texas, have both achieved first flyer and are now selling test power onto the grid. The state-of-the-art plants, which are totally nearly 2,200 megawatts are on budget, on schedule for full commercial operations in the second quarter. We expect that they will be ready to participate in Texas this summer. 
At Constellation, our highly hedged portfolio in 2017, mitigates the impact of weaker power prices and lower load given the mild winter weather. 
Even in this recent low volatility environment, our C&I business has been able to hold onto margins and keep customer renewables. 
On Slide 7, we view 2016 is a great success in delivering on our commitments and preserving some of our at risk nuclear units by securing compensation for the clean energy attributes. 
For 2017, we're focused on executing on these gains we made last year, and more importantly, affirming the ZEC programs in the quarter. 
In New York, litigation is further along at this point. On March 29, the judge in New York Federal Court heard oral arguments on our motions to dismiss. We made strong arguments at this hearing and believe the law is clearly on our side. 
We do ask that -- we do get asked when we expect a decision, but the judge is not giving a specific timeline for deadline to issue for order. If we prevail in a motion to dismiss, we would expect the other side to appeal that decision.  If the judge denies our motion to dismiss, we'll move forward with the case as planned. 
As I said, previously, we're confident in the strength of our case. 
In Illinois, 2 groups of plants have challenge the ZEC and federal court in the cases of being before 1 judge. The plan is filed for preliminary injunction on March 31. We intervened in that case on April 10, and we filed motions to dismiss. The judge has held a preliminary injunction motion while he receives full briefing on the motion to dismiss. He will then determine whether there is a legal basis to go forward. That briefing will be completed by May 15 and the judge is scheduled to inform the parties of his intention on May 22nd. 
In the interim, we start recognizing ZEC revenues in New York on April 1. In Illinois, the utilities have filed tariffs to begin collecting that ZEC payments on June 1. We don't expect the actual ZEC procurement process in Illinois to conclude until later in the fall. We remain confident that the ZEC programs will be upheld in the courts to the benefits of the state, the communities and these valuable resources. 
As we have discussed last year in our carbon policy principles, we see state programs as an essential mechanism until have more work the same federal policy that values clean baseload generation. Energy Secretary Perry, recent Director to look at the importance of preserving baseload generation is early but encouraging. We appreciate the secretary's focus to promote and needed market reforms to compensate these assets. We will support the DOE's effort as they move forward. 
Turning to the upcoming PJM auction. We understand the investment community is paying close attention particularly after the disappointing MISO capacity auction results. Joe Nigro is available to answer more detailed questions if you have them. But let me share a few thoughts around the auction. 
Through the positive, we're going to 100% CP for the first time which will put a higher performance burden on the entire fleet. We still think this should lead to a more responsible bidding given the higher risk around nonperformance. The C numbers or the import capacity into ComEd and EMAC LDAs have tightened this year versus last year. 
The tightening can flag more constrained market conditions than last year in these zones, which could help in separation. So the negative PJM load is demand forecast, again, for this auction and FERC approved seasonal aggregation that will allow products to otherwise would not clear to participate 100% in CP world. 
Finally, we have the risk of more uneconomic generation being built primary in Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
These drivers are important, but we still expect clearing prices to come down to bidding behavior. 
The UFC has bid our assets in recent auctions to reflect the underlying economic needs of the individual plants, which in turn has led to some of our plants not clearing. You should expect us to bid our assets in the same responsible fashion in this next upcoming auction. 
Now let the turn the call over to Jack to walk through the numbers."

My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases and update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some the events that occurred this quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. We had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.65 per share at the top of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares to $0.68 per share for the first quarter of 2016. 
Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.47 per share. Versus our plant, the utility results were impacted by unfavorable weather at PECO and PHI, which was more than offset by O&M timing across all the utilities. With 70% of our distribution rate base and decoupled jurisdictions including ComEd starting in 2017, we experienced less volatility on our utility earnings from record warm weather in January and February than if we did not have these programs. To help with us in context, this is the first time in 146 years when there was no snow in the ground in Chicago for both January and February. 
Across PJM, January and February were the warmest on record since data started being collected in 1950. 
Generation had a strong quarter relative to plan, earning $0.18 per share. We had good performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted and our Constellation team, once again, delivered strong results despite weak power prices and low volatility. 
Turning to Slide 9. The $0.65 per share in the first quarter this year was $0.03 per share lower than the first quarter of 2016. To the positive, we have full quarter of contribution from PHI relative to only 8 days last year, which added $0.09. The other utilities benefited from rate relief and higher rate base, partly offset at PECO with even milder weather than last year. 
ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the known impacts of lower capacity prices and power price realization as well as more plant refueling outages. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 in the second quarter compared with $0.65 last year. Our second quarter results will include contributions from the FitzPatrick plant and the impacts of the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. 
The Illinois ZEC legislation will go into effect on June 1 and plant procurement is expected to occur later this fall. Plans receiving contracts with recognized revenues retroactive to the June 1 effective date. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute well, delivering stronger returns in the quarter. Looking at the trailing 12-month booked ROEs, we saw nice improvements even relative to what we showed last quarter. 
At PHI, we saw all of the utilities restrict gains with some help coming as revenues from the first cycle of rate cases are starting to flow through to results. 
For the legacy Exelon Utilities, we continue to see strong earned ROEs over 10% that lift the consolidated Exelon utilities platform to nearly 10%, including PHI. 
We have plenty of work to do at utilities and with our regulators to keep improving the product we're delivering to our customers. But we're happy with where the overall business is performing. We're, obviously, pleased with our earned ROEs are trending, but I want to remind you that there will be variability in the [indiscernible] ROEs that are different utilities as we go forward. The timing of rate case implementation, weather comparability and in-service states will all impact results. 
We think the ability to earn strong ROEs and the plan that we have in place at PHI to improve their ROEs will be the recipe for our future success. 
On Slide 12, we have an update on our rate cases. Since our fourth quarter call, we have closed out the the Delmarva Maryland case with a revenue increase of $38 million. We've also reached unanimous settlements in our Delmarva Delaware electric and gas cases for $31.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively. And would expect commission approval during the second quarter. 
From our first cycle of plant rate cases, we're now down just to the Pepco D.C. case, where we expect the Commission decision later in July. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to get PHI's revenues and book ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. 
As we've shared with you many times before, we've always viewed the turnaround in PHI earned ROEs as a two rate cycle process. To that end, we bought our second rate cases at A's and Pepco Maryland this quarter. 
Combined with the outstanding cases from the first cycle that I previously mentioned, we are currently asking for $252 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability off the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland and ACE likely  in Q4 2017 and first quarter of 2018, respectively. We plan to file a second cycle of cases in most if not all of PHI's jurisdiction in 2017 with all completed by the end of 2018, putting us in a position to earn between 9% and 10% ROEs in 2019. More details on the rate case is our schedules to be found on Slide 29 through 36 in the appendix. 
Slide 13 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. 
During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generation load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $50 million in both 2018 and 2019 due to the impact of price changes on our portfolio. We ended the quarter approximately 12% to 15% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align fundamental view of spot market upside at NiHub. Although we have increased our links in other regions as well. 
We're comfortable with being more open when we look at market fundamentals. For example, forward regional natural gas prices today are over $1 per MMBtu higher than they realized last year yet the forward for power are only about $1 per megawatt higher. We do not believe that is a sustainable situation. 
To that point, I should note the power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter and have reversed about half of the first quarter price declines. 
On Slide 14, we have highlighted some key recent events. On March 31, 2017, we executed on the creation of the Exelon Generation renewables JV, which will provide us with $400 million of pretax cash. 
Including allocated debt that puts total JV enterprise value at approximately $1.7 billion. The price implies an EV to EBITDA multiple over 10x and a dollar per kW value over $1,200. 
The JV consists of 1,296 megawatts of renewable generation capacity, which is about 35% of our renewables output and has an average contract life of 14 years. The JV structure provides the option to drop-down contractable renewable assets from our portfolio in the future. The proceeds from this sale will be used to accelerate our deleveraging strategy. 
Also on March 31, we closed on the acquisition of the FitzPatrick Nuclear Station from Entergy, which adds 838 megawatts of nuclear capacity to our portfolio. 
As you know, the FitzPatrick plant is part of the New York ZEC program, and we received ZEC payments for the next 12 years, which started on April 1. The plant is now operated by Exelon, and I'm happy to report, we had a clean cut over FitzPatrick on to the Exelon platform. We're excited to have the FitzPatrick employees as part of the Exelon family. 
Our Exelon Generation Texas partnership, commonly referred to as EGTP, is a portfolio of 3,476 megawatts of gas generation in Texas. In 2014, we raised $675 million of nonrecourse project finance for the assets, which currently has a balance of approximately $650 million. With a downturn in our account power markets, these assets have been under pressure with a debt rating at a discount face value for some time and the plants struggling to generate adequate cash flows. 
Due to the combination of challenge cash flows and our decision not to inject additional equity, we have come to terms with the lenders to pursue an orderly sale of the assets on their behalf. 
The modest current earnings and all the debt are still included in our financial outlook. However, we see the ultimate exit from these assets be accretive to our EPS and debt-to-EBITDA starting in 2018. 
In light of the process, we are not in the position to expand further on this transaction. 
Finally during the quarter, we decided to discontinue the sales process of the Mystic 8 and 8 assets. We were exploring the sale of these assets as a direct result of interest received from the potential buyers. During the sale process, we ran into some issues with the fuel supply agreement that needs to be addressed and as we've said, we would only transact when we realize the price greater than our whole value. Our continuing to own this assets does not impact our commitments on our debt-to-EBITDA target and debt reduction plans that we already shared with you. 
Turning to Slide 15, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment-grade credit rating. We're forecasting to be 3.2x debt-to-EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long-term target of 3x debt-to-EBITDA. 
On a recourse debt basis, we're already well ahead of our target and taking into account the sale of EGTP, we would be on target overall. As we said before, we will look to retire debt once we would reach 3x target at ExGen. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

And as you know, I'll start by saying we have a long-standing practice of really not discussing our bidding strategy around the capacity auction and where we think it will clear. I think there is one thing though we have to take into account at this timing of the 2 auctions. And so MISO auction was for June of this year through May of next year and the PJM auction, obviously, is much further out in the curve. When you think about the operation for the plant and if you'll fuel loaded in the core at Clinton, for example, that plant was going to continue to operate during that period. What I will say about Quad Cities in the bidding is we're going to continue to remain responsible in the way we bid our capacity, reflecting the underlying economics of our plant, and that's consistent with what we've done with past auctions. I think the major question with this auction continues to be, as Chris mentioned, bidding behavior from the existing generation as well as the discipline associated with newbuild. As it relates to existing facilities, we continue to see economically challenged plans that have cleared previous auctions. And in addition to that, we see the economics the newbuilds being margin. In the last auction, we cleared about 27 gigawatts of base capacity, which was about 16% of the total procurement. And it remains to be seen how that 27 gigawatts will participate in this auction, but the big variable, as I mentioned, will continue to be the bidding of all the plants, and we will remain disciplined in that regard with all of our facilities."

There are 3 buckets of issues that I think I look at.

There are 3 buckets of issues that I think I look at. One is carbon pricing on the market and what FERC can do to facilitate the states who are interested in doing that. The second bucket would be the Mopar issues that's PJM's grid 2020 [indiscernible] and the third bucket are energy reforms. And so I think all three of these things are implied as well in connection with the secretary. Let me talk about the three. First, we think there was a constructive discussion around carbon. One of the issues that has limited the ability of states to incorporate aggressive pricings 2between the states and I think there was good discussion around what FERC can do to address that problem. There is, I think, you'll agree if you saw the technical conference growing recognition that putting carbon explicitly in the market is something that would address a lot of these issues. And there's a growing receptivity to that. The issue of the Mopar's, that's where I think it most directly addresses the state ZEC programs and the RAC programs. The New England proposal doesn't deal with existing baseload generation or existing generation of any kind frankly, and that's consistent with FERC president. And so that template wouldn't have any effect on the safe programs, but PJM proposal does, however, deal with existing resources. And we have not historically supported that proposal. We recognize PJM has made some important changes, and those were talked about that the technical conference. The issue with the Mopar from our perspective is that it is a distraction from some unfinished work that we believe FERC and PJM ought to get to first. Unfortunately, it has become a little bit of a tempest and the teapot in a sense that there's a false narrative out there challenges to the IPP sector are driven by ZEC and the REC policies when in fact a number of our colleagues in the business side values dropped by 70% and 80% before the word ZEC even came into our dialogue. So we just -- we don't think the Mopar is an approach that is going to workable, it applies in the phase of what the states are looking to do. I don't think it will be that effective. We talked about MISO Zone 4. It's notable that. And we did Clinton in a way where would that have cleared in that auction or has that be excluded by the Mopar, the price in MISO would have risen from $1.50 to $5 a megawatt [indiscernible]. That's certainly not going to address the downstate issues that ING and others are facing. At the end of it, we agree with what Chairman [indiscernible] , and she basically questioned the wisdom, approaching this problem set with more movers per unit that are receiving state environmental or attribute payments. And I think that's why New York guy saw them, MISO and others and [indiscernible] are not going in that direction. So that's -- we don't agree with the direction on the Moper, but when let me talk to you about something important that came up during the session and I think [indiscernible] and that is India talked about in Monday's session, and I'm going to loosely quote, I'm saying that we politely ignored energy market design problems that are undervaluing baseload assets. And we can't afford to ignore those problems anymore. And we completely agree with that. We have talked and talked over the last few years about energy pricing problems in the markets on that whole negative pricing, the fact that certain units gained set price during the hours, the over commitment of resources driving uplift and a whole host of issues that we've had technical conferences on and white papers on and we just having gotten -- started on working on that. And as a consequence, and not addressing those energy market issues, states and our customers are being deprived of assets that add resiliency, they add fuel diversity, and they add some environmental benefits. And so what we expect to do at the end of the second conference you heard California and others echo this is, we want to set a deadline for bringing the conclusion the energy market the form that we talked about. And we think that talking about Mopers or other things that interfere with state's rights before we fix the energy market problems, it's a little bit like putting your shoes on before you put your pants up. At the end of the day, it makes you a little bit silly. And so once we hit a reconstituted format at FERC, we're going to go after these energy price reforms. And we think Secretary Perry's memo opens the door to address these issues. So we think the last couple of days Secretary Perry's memo gives us an opening to look at some unfinished business that we had to get active. So long answer, big subject, but we see a lot of promise and what we saw over the last couple of days when we see a lot of promise and what DOE is looking at. We have to get the stuff over the finish line."

First, we think the DOE has an important role in setting policy. I think the implementation requirement of that policy in certain instances be new legislation, it could be things that are done at the NRC in terms of regulatory burdens on nuclear, but it would involve the commission in that sense. It could involve different changes and roles at FERC. But DOE is going to have an important voice in our view in this policy discussion, and we'll set the tone even if we can't complete all of the objectives. There are certain tools that DOE has. Section 202 has the authority under the Federal Power Act as an example allows them to secure resources in the market that are needed. That is a power that has been used sparingly I think only 2x in history, but certainly, there's a discussion around the use of it for base load resources. With regard to attributes payment, I think environmental attribute payment second think we're kind of wait and see by the administration goes on carbon. But I think your general sentiment is correct that, that's not something we see immediately coming out of the department. But you asked kind of more fundamental question as the states are covering environmental and PJM is covering reliability, what's left. Well, I'll tell you what's left. What's left is resiliency, there's a little bit of a different concept then reliability, reliability assumes that pipeline infrastructure and other critical pieces are in place, PJM assumes that and says whether there's some reliability impacts or reliability expectations could be met. Resiliency looks a little bit deeper at that and understands the impact of pipeline disruptions on natural gas fired generation and should we start modeling those sorts of things, is there a value there. The other piece that is not correctly valued in the market is fuel diversity. As we transition to a market that is made up more and more of just natural gas, we're exposing our customers to fuel price volatility in the long run. Those things because of the short-term nature of the markets are fully considered. But if you look at Secretary Perry's memo, I think it's a second bullet point -- second and third bullet points of that memo address those very issues."

We're off to a great start in 2017. In March, we marked our 1 year anniversary of the merger between Exelon and Pepco Holdings. 
Since the close, PHI has successfully executed on merger commitments, achieved synergy savings and made significant progress toward full integration. 
We also continue to work hard on the regulatory front. Since the beginning of the year, PHI closed out the Delmarva Maryland rate case and reached a settlement for our electric and gas rate case in Delaware. We are now down to just Pepco D.C. cases from our first planned cycle of rate case filings. 
That said, our regulatory team has already started the second cycle of rate cases at Pepco Maryland and ACE's planned. 
At ExGen, we completed the acquisition of FitzPatrick power plant, representing the 25th nuclear reactor where we have ownership stake. We welcome the new employees to the Exelon family. 
We also announced the Exelon Generation Renewables joint venture, which is allowing us to recycle capital at a valuation meaningfully above the value implied for our ExGen at our current share price. The JV allows us to make even faster progress on our debt reduction goals without diminishing our commitment to renewables -- renewable power.
We continue to focus on the legal challenges to the zero emission credits, or ZEC, in New York and Illinois. We remain confident that our arguments will prevail. We'll cover these points in more detail in the call, but I wanted to highlight what we have done while staying focused on the day-to-day operations. 
As shown on Slide 5, on a GAAP basis, we've earned $1.07 versus $0.19 a share last year. And on an operating basis, we earned $0.65 versus $0.68 last year, which puts us at the top of our $0.55 to $0.65 range and above consensus of $0.62. 
Moving to Slide 6. Our first operation -- our first quarter operational report was strong. Our color block charts highlight operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities. 
Legacy Exelon Utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. PECO actually had its best customer satisfaction rating ever during the first quarter. BGE experienced the best ever CAIDI and SAIFI performance of all time. At PHI, we're encouraged by the progress we are making and our customers are seeing the benefits. 
For example, by using a common lockout/tag-out process, a procedure that established as a zone of protection while restoring equipment, we were able to send over 400 employees and contractors from BGE, ComEd and PECO to support the storm restoration at Delmarva during Winter Storm Stella. 
As a result, Delmarva customers had their power restored 2 days sooner. Our thanks to everybody that helped in accomplishing that speedy recovery. 
The power of Exelon Utilities platform is a significant benefit to our customers. We continue to improve upon these metrics to meet reliability commitments we have made to provide better service to our customers. 
The nuclear team had a great quarter also. They completed 3 refueling outages and achieved a capacity factor of 94%. 
They also had the fastest refueling outage ever for Calvert Cliffs nuclear station 2, running 20 days. 
In the Power business, we realized renewable energy capture rate of nearly 96% and a power dispatch match of 94% -- over 99%. 
Our 2 newbuild CCGTs in Texas have both achieved first flyer and are now selling test power onto the grid. The state-of-the-art plants, which are totally nearly 2,200 megawatts, are on budget, on schedule for full commercial operations in the second quarter. We expect that they will be ready to participate in Texas this summer. 
At Constellation, our highly hedged portfolio in 2017 mitigates the impacts of weaker power prices and lower load given the mild winter weather. 
Even in this recent low volatility environment, our C&I business has been able to hold onto margins and keep customer renewables. 
On Slide 7, we view 2016 as a great success in delivering on our commitments and preserving some of our at-risk nuclear units by securing compensation for their clean energy attributes. 
For 2017, we're focused on executing on these gains we made last year, and more importantly, affirming the ZEC programs in the quarter. 
In New York, litigation is further along at this point. On March 29, the judge in New York Federal Court heard oral arguments on our motions to dismiss. We made strong arguments at this hearing and believe the law is clearly on our side. 
We do ask that -- we do get asked when we expect a decision, but the judge is not giving a specific time line or deadline to issue for order. If we prevail in a motion to dismiss, we would expect the other side to appeal that decision. If the judge denies our motion to dismiss, we'll move forward with the case as planned. 
As I've said previously, we're confident in the strength of our case. 
In Illinois, 2 groups of plaintiffs have challenged the ZEC and federal court and the cases are being before 1 judge. The plaintiffs filed for preliminary injunction on March 31. We intervened in that case on April 10, and we filed motions to dismiss. The judge has held a preliminary injunction motion while he receives full briefing on the motion to dismiss. He will then determine whether there is a legal basis to go forward. That briefing will be completed by May 15 and the judge is scheduled to inform the parties of his intention on May 22. 
In the interim, we start recognizing ZEC revenues in New York on April 1. In Illinois, the utilities have filed tariffs to begin collecting the ZEC payments on June 1. We don't expect the actual ZEC procurement process in Illinois to conclude until later in the fall. We remain confident that the ZEC programs will be upheld in the courts to the benefits of the state, the communities and these valuable resources. 
As we have discussed last year in our carbon policy principles, we see state programs as an essential mechanism until we have more cohesive federal policy that values clean baseload generation. Energy Secretary Perry's recent directive to look at the importance of preserving baseload generation is early but encouraging. We appreciate the secretary's focus to promote and needed market reforms to compensate these assets. We will support the DOE's effort as they move forward. 
Turning to the upcoming PJM auction. We understand the investment community is paying close attention particularly after the disappointing MISO capacity auction results. Joe Nigro is available to answer more detailed questions if you have them. But let me share a few thoughts around the auction. 
To the positive, we're going to 100% CP for the first time, which will put a higher performance burden on the entire fleet. We still think this should lead to a more responsible bidding, given the higher risk around nonperformance. The CETL numbers or the import capacity into ComEd and EMAAC LDAs have tightened this year versus last year. 
The tightening could flag more constrained market conditions than last year in these zones, which could help in separation. So the negative PJM load is demand forecast, again, for this auction and FERC-approved seasonal aggregation that will allow products that otherwise would not clear to participate in a 100% CP world. 
Finally, we have the risk of more uneconomic generation being built primarily in Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
These drivers are important, but we still expect clearing prices to come down to bidding behavior. 
You have seen us bid our assets in recent auctions to reflect the underlying economic needs of the individual plants, which in turn has led to some of our plants not clearing. You should expect us to bid our assets in the same responsible fashion in this next upcoming auction. 
Now let me the turn the call over to Jack to walk through the numbers."

My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the events that occurred this quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. We had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.65 per share at the top of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares to $0.68 per share for the first quarter of 2016. 
Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.47 per share. Versus our plan, the utility results were impacted by unfavorable weather at PECO and PHI, which was more than offset by O&M timing across all the utilities. With 70% of our distribution rate base and decoupled jurisdictions, including ComEd starting in 2017, we experienced less volatility on our utility earnings from record warm weather in January and February than if we did not have these programs. To help put this winter in context, this was the first time in 146 years when there was no snow on the ground in Chicago for both January and February. 
Looking across PJM, January and February were the warmest on record since data started being collected in 1950. 
Generation had a strong quarter relative to plan, earning $0.18 per share. We had good performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted and our Constellation team, once again, delivered strong results despite weak power prices and low volatility. 
Turning to Slide 9. The $0.65 per share in the first quarter this year was $0.03 per share lower than the first quarter of 2016. To the positive, we had a full quarter of contribution from PHI relative to only 8 days last year, which added $0.09. The other utilities benefited from rate relief and higher rate base, partly offset at PECO with even milder weather than last year. 
ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the known impacts of lower capacity prices and power price realization as well as more plant refueling outages. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 in the second quarter compared with $0.65 last year. Our second quarter results will include contributions from the FitzPatrick plant and the impacts of the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. The Illinois ZEC legislation will go into effect on June 1 and plant procurement is expected to occur later this fall. Plants receiving contracts would recognized revenues retroactive to the June 1 effective date. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute well, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter. Looking at the trailing 12-month booked ROEs, we saw nice improvements even relative to what we showed last quarter. 
At PHI, we saw all of the utilities restore gains with some help coming as revenues from the first cycle of rate cases are starting to flow through to results. 
For the legacy Exelon Utilities, we continue to see strong earned ROEs, over 10%, that lift the consolidated Exelon utilities platform to nearly 10%, including PHI. 
We have plenty of work to do at utilities and with our regulators to keep improving the product we're delivering to our customers. But we're happy with where the overall business is performing. We're, obviously, pleased with where our earned ROEs are trending, but I want to remind you that there will be variability in the earned ROEs that are different utilities as we go forward. The timing of rate case implementation, weather comparability and in-service dates will all impact results. 
We think the ability to earn strong ROEs and the plan that we have in place at PHI to improve their ROEs will be the recipe for our future success. 
On Slide 12, we have an update on our rate cases. Since our fourth quarter call, we have closed out the Delmarva Maryland case with a revenue increase of $38 million. We've also reached unanimous settlements in our Delmarva Delaware electric and gas cases for $31.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively and would expect commission approval during the second quarter. 
From our first cycle of planned rate cases, we're now down just to the Pepco D.C. case, where we expect a Commission decision later in July. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to get PHI's revenues and our book ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. 
As we've shared with you many times before, we've always viewed the turnaround in PHI earned ROEs as a 2 rate case cycle process. To that end, we filed our second rate cases at ACE and Pepco Maryland this quarter. 
Combined with the outstanding cases from the first cycle that I previously mentioned, we are currently asking for $252 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland and ACE likely in Q4 2017 and first quarter of 2018, respectively. We plan to file a second cycle of cases in most, if not all, of PHI's jurisdictions in 2017 with all completed by the end of 2018, putting us in a position to earn between 9% and 10% ROEs in 2019. More details on the rate case is in our schedules to be found on Slides 29 through 36 in the appendix. 
Slide 13 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. 
During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generational load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $50 million in both 2018 and 2019 due to the impact of price changes on our open portfolio. We ended the quarter approximately 12% to 15% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align to our fundamental view of spot market upside at NiHub. Although we have increased our length in other regions as well. 
We're comfortable with being more open when we look at market fundamentals. For example, forward regional natural gas prices today are over $1 per MMBtu higher than they realized last year, yet the forwards for power are only about $1 per megawatt higher. We do not believe that is a sustainable situation. 
To that point, I should note the power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter and have reversed about half of the first quarter price declines. 
On Slide 14, we have highlighted some key recent events. On March 31, 2017, we executed on the creation of the Exelon Generation Renewables JV, which will provide us with $400 million of pretax cash, including allocated debt that puts total JV enterprise value at approximately $1.7 billion. The price implies an EV to EBITDA multiple over 10x and a dollar per kW value over $1,200. 
The JV consists of 1,296 megawatts of renewable generation capacity, which is about 35% of our renewables output and has an average contract life of 14 years. The JV structure provides the option to drop down contractor renewable assets from our portfolio in the future. The proceeds from this sale will be used to accelerate our deleveraging strategy. 
Also on March 31, we closed on the acquisition of the FitzPatrick nuclear station from Entergy, which adds 838 megawatts of nuclear capacity to our portfolio. 
As you know, the FitzPatrick plant is part of the New York ZEC program, and we'll receive ZEC payments for the next 12 years, which started on April 1. The plant is now operated by Exelon, and I'm happy to report we had a clean cutover of FitzPatrick on to the Exelon platform. We're excited to have the FitzPatrick employees as part of the Exelon family. 
Our Exelon Generation Texas partnership, commonly referred to as EGTP, is a portfolio of 3,476 megawatts of gas generation in Texas. In 2014, we raised $675 million of nonrecourse project finance for the assets, which currently has a balance of approximately $650 million. With the downturn in ERCOT power markets, these assets have been under pressure with the debt trading at a discounted face value for some time and the plants struggling to generate adequate cash flows. 
Due to the combination of challenged cash flows and our decision not to inject additional equity, we have come to terms with the lenders to pursue an orderly sale of the assets on their behalf. 
The modest current earnings and all the debt are still included in our financial outlook. However, we see the ultimate exit from these assets being accretive to our EPS and debt-to-EBITDA multiple starting in 2018. 
In light of the process, we're not in the position to expand further on this transaction. 
Finally, during the quarter, we decided to discontinue the sales process of the Mystic 8 and 9 assets. We were exploring the sale of these assets as a direct result of interest received from potential buyers. During the sales process, we ran into some issues with the fuel supply agreement that needs to be addressed, and as we've said, we would only transact if we realize a price greater than our [ mutual ] whole value. Our continuing to own this assets does not impact our commitments on our debt-to-EBITDA target and debt reduction plans that we've already shared with you. 
Turning to Slide 15. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment-grade credit rating. We're forecasting to be at 3.2x debt-to-EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long-term target of 3x debt-to-EBITDA. 
On a recourse debt basis, we're already well ahead of our target, and taking into account the sale of EGTP, we would be on target overall. As we said before, we will look to retire Holdco debt once we have reached 3x target at ExGen. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

You already told us that's bounced a little bit, but people are looking forward to sort of 2020 roll coming this fall and looking at the open, theoretically, open position and worried about the capacity market print and thinking, well, 2020 is going to be another down year. So I don't know if you can comment on where -- how that looks today and also how that dovetails with what you continue to do with vis-a-vis debt reduction at ExGen.

And as you know, I'll start by saying we have a long-standing practice of really not discussing our bidding strategy around capacity auctions and where we think it will clear. I think there is one thing though you have to take into account, is the timing of the 2 auctions. The MISO auction was for June of this year through May of next year and the PJM auction, obviously, is much further out in the curve. When you think about the operation for the power plant and the fuel loaded in the core at Clinton, for example, that plant was going to continue to operate during that period. What I will say about Quad Cities in the bidding is we're going to continue to remain responsible in the way we bid our capacity, reflecting the underlying economics of our plant, and that's consistent with what we've done with past auctions. I think the major question mark with this auction continues to be, as Chris mentioned, bidding behavior from the existing generations as well as the discipline associated with newbuilds. As it relates to existing facilities, we continue to see economically challenged plants that have cleared previous auctions. And in addition to that, we see the economics of newbuilds being marginal. In the last auction, we cleared about 27 gigawatts of base capacity, which was about 16% of the total procurement. And it remains to be seen how that 27 gigawatts will participate in this auction. But the big variable, as I mentioned, will continue to be the bidding of all the plants, and we will remain disciplined in that regard with all our facilities."

Steve, let me start off and talk a little about the technical conference over the last couple days. There are 3 buckets of issues that I think I'd look at.

Steve, let me start off and talk a little about the technical conference over the last couple days. There are 3 buckets of issues that I think I'd look at. One is carbon pricing on the market and what FERC can do to facilitate the states who are interested in doing that. The second bucket would be the MOPR issues. That's PJM's Grid 20/20, what New England ISO put out. And the third bucket are energy reforms. And so I think all 3 of these things are implied as well in connection with the secretary's memo. Let me talk about the 3. First, we think there was a constructive discussion around carbon. One of the issues that has limited the ability of states to incorporate aggressive pricing is leakage between the states, and I think there was good discussion around what FERC can do to address that problem. There is, I think you'd agree if you saw the technical conference, a growing recognition that putting carbon explicitly in the market is something that would address a lot of these issues and there's a growing receptivity to that. On the issue of the MOPRs, that's where I think it most directly addresses the state ZEC programs and the REC programs. The New England proposal doesn't deal with existing baseload generation or existing generation of any kind, frankly, and that's consistent with FERC president. And so that template wouldn't have any effect on the state programs, but PJM proposal does, however, deal with existing resources. And we have not historically supported that proposal. We recognize PJM has made some important changes, and those were talked about at the technical conference. The issue with the MOPR, from our perspective, is that it is a distraction from some unfinished work that we believe FERC and PJM ought to get to first. Unfortunately, it's become a little bit of a tempest in a teapot in a sense that there's a false narrative out there that the challenges to the IPP sector are driven by ZEC and REC policies when, in fact, a number of our colleagues in the business side [indiscernible] values drop by 70% and 80% before the word ZEC even came into our dialogue. So we just -- we don't think the MOPR is an approach that is going to workable, applies in the phase of what the states are looking to do. I don't think it'll be that effective. We talked about MISO Zone 4. It's notable that -- and we did Clinton in a way where it would not have cleared in that auction or had been excluded by a MOPR. The price in MISO would have risen from $1.50 to $5 a megawatt tag. That's certainly not going to address the downstate issues that [ ING ] and others are facing. At the end of it, we agree with what Chairman LaFleur said. And she basically questioned the wisdom of approaching this problem set with more MOPRs per units that are receiving state environmental attribute payments. And I think that's why New York guys saw the MISO and others are not going in that direction. So that's -- we don't agree with the direction on the MOPR, but let me talk to you about something important that came up during this session and I think we'll do it good. And that is [indiscernible] talked about in Monday's session, and I'm going to loosely quote him, saying that we politely ignored energy market design problems that are undervaluing baseload assets. In the end, he can't afford to ignore those problems anymore. And we completely agree with that. We have talked and talked over the last few years about energy pricing problems in the markets, contracts sold, negative pricing, the fact that certain units can't set price during hours, the overcommitment of resources driving uplift and a whole host of issues that we've had technical conferences on and white papers on and we just haven't gotten started on working on that. And as a consequence of not addressing those energy market issues, states and our customers are being deprived of assets that add resiliency, they add fuel diversity, and they add some environmental benefits. And so what we expect to do at the end of the technical conference, you heard Calpine and others echo this, is we want to set a deadline for bringing to conclusion the energy market reforms that we had talked about. And we think that talking about MOPRs or other things that interfere with state's rights, before we fix the energy market problems, is a little bit like putting your shoes on before you put your pants up. At the end of the day, it makes you look a little bit silly. And so once we get a reconstituted quorum at FERC, we're going to go after these energy price reforms. And we think Secretary Perry's memo opens the door to address these issues. So we think the last couple of days and Secretary Perry's memo gives us an opening to look at some unfinished business that we have to get active. So long answer, big subject, but we see a lot of promise in what we saw over the last couple of days and we see a lot of promise in what the DOE is looking at. We have to get this stuff over the finish line."

First, we think the DOE has an important role in setting policy. I think the implementation requirement of that policy could, in certain instances, be new legislation. It could be things that are done at the NRC in terms of regulatory burdens on nuclear, but it would involve the commission in that sense. It could involve different changes and roles at FERC. But the DOE is going to have an important voice, in our view, in this policy discussion and will set the tone even if we can't complete all of the objectives. There are certain tools that DOE has. Section 202(c), authority under the Federal Power Act, as an example, allows them to secure resources in the market that are needed. That is a power that has been used sparingly, I think only 2 times in history. But certainly, there's a discussion around the use of it for baseload resources. In -- with regard to attributes payments, I think -- environmental attribute payments, I think we're kind of in a wait and see where the administration goes on carbon. But I think your general sentiment is correct, that that's not something we see immediately coming out of the department. But you asked kind of the more fundamental question. As the states are covering environmental and PJM is covering reliability, what's left? Well, I'll tell you what's left. What's left is resiliency. There's a little bit of a different concept than reliability. Reliability assumes that pipeline infrastructure and other critical pieces are in place. PJM assumes that and says whether there's some reliability impacts or the reliability expectations could be met. Resiliency looks a little bit deeper at that and understands the impact of pipeline disruptions on natural gas-fired generation and should we start modeling those sorts of things, is there a value there? The other piece that is not currently valued in the market is fuel diversity. As we transition to a market that is made up more and more of just natural gas, we're exposing our customers to fuel price volatility in the long run. Those things, because of the short-term nature of the markets, are fully considered. But if you look at Secretary Perry's memo, I think it's the second bullet point -- second and third bullet points of that memo address those very issues."

We're off to a great start in 2017. In March, we marked our 1 year anniversary of the merger between Exelon and Pepco Holdings. 
Since the close, PHI has successfully executed on merger commitments, achieved synergy savings and made significant progress toward full integration. 
We also continue to work hard on the regulatory front. Since the beginning of the year, PHI closed out the Delmarva Maryland rate case and reached a settlement for our electric and gas rate case in Delaware. We are now down to just Pepco D.C. cases from our first planned cycle of rate case filings. 
That said, our [ regular ] team has already started the second cycle of rate cases at Pepco Maryland and ACE as planned. 
At ExGen, we completed the acquisition of FitzPatrick power plant, representing the 25th nuclear reactor where we have ownership stake. We welcome the new employees to the Exelon family. 
We also announced the Exelon Generation Renewables joint venture, which is allowing us to recycle capital at a valuation meaningfully above the value implied for our ExGen at our current share price. The JV allows us to make even faster progress on our debt reduction goals without diminishing our commitment to renewables -- renewable power.
We continue to focus on the legal challenges to the zero emission credits, or ZEC, in New York and Illinois. We remain confident that our arguments will prevail. We'll cover these points in more detail in the call, but I wanted to highlight what we have done while staying focused on the day-to-day operations. 
As shown on Slide 5, on a GAAP basis, we've earned $1.07 versus $0.19 a share last year. And on an operating basis, we earned $0.65 versus $0.68 last year, which puts us at the top of our $0.55 to $0.65 range and above consensus of $0.62. 
Moving to Slide 6. Our first operation -- our first quarter operational report was strong. Our color block charts highlight operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities. 
Legacy Exelon Utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. PECO actually had its best customer satisfaction rating ever during the first quarter. BGE experienced the best ever CAIDI and SAIFI performance of all time. At PHI, we're encouraged by the progress we are making and our customers are seeing the benefits. 
For example, by using a common lockout/tag-out process, a procedure that establishes a zone of protection while restoring equipment, we were able to send over 400 employees and contractors from BGE, ComEd and PECO to support the storm restoration at Delmarva during Winter Storm Stella. 
As a result, Delmarva customers had their power restored 2 days sooner. Our thanks to everybody that helped in accomplishing that speedy recovery. 
The power of Exelon Utilities platform is a significant benefit to our customers. We continue to improve upon these metrics to meet reliability commitments we have made to provide better service to our customers. 
The nuclear team had a great quarter also. They completed 3 refueling outages and achieved a capacity factor of 94%. 
They also had the fastest refueling outage ever for Calvert Cliffs nuclear station 2, running 20 days. 
In the Power business, we realized renewable energy capture rate of nearly 96% and a power dispatch match of 94% -- over 99%. 
Our 2 new build CCGTs in Texas have both achieved first flyer and are now selling test power onto the grid. The state-of-the-art plants, which are totally, nearly 2,200 megawatts, are on budget, on schedule for full commercial operations in the second quarter. We expect that they will be ready to participate in Texas this summer. 
At Constellation, our highly hedged portfolio in 2017 mitigates the impacts of weaker power prices and lower load given the mild winter weather. 
Even in this recent low volatility environment, our C&I business has been able to hold onto margins and keep customer renewables. 
On Slide 7, we view 2016 as a great success in delivering on our commitments and preserving some of our at-risk nuclear units by securing compensation for their clean energy attributes. 
For 2017, we're focused on executing on these gains we made last year, and more importantly, affirming the ZEC programs in the court. 
In New York, litigation is further along at this point. On March 29, the judge in New York Federal Court heard oral arguments on our motions to dismiss. We made strong arguments at this hearing and believe the law is clearly on our side. 
We do ask that -- we do get asked when we expect a decision, but the judge has not given a specific time line or deadline to issue for order. If we prevail in a motion to dismiss, we would expect the other side to appeal that decision. If the judge denies our motion to dismiss, we'll move forward with the case as planned. 
As I've said previously, we're confident in the strength of our case. 
In Illinois, 2 groups of plaintiffs have challenged the ZEC and federal court and the cases are being before 1 judge. The plaintiffs filed for preliminary injunction on March 31. We intervened in that case on April 10, and we filed motions to dismiss. The judge has held a preliminary injunction motion while he receives full briefing on the motion to dismiss. He will then determine whether there is a legal basis to go forward. That briefing will be completed by May 15 and the judge is scheduled to inform the parties of his intention on May 22. 
In the interim, we start recognizing ZEC revenues in New York on April 1. In Illinois, the utilities have filed tariffs to begin collecting the ZEC payments on June 1. We don't expect the actual ZEC procurement process in Illinois to conclude until later in the fall. We remain confident that the ZEC programs will be upheld in the courts to the benefits of the state, the communities and these valuable resources. 
As we have discussed last year in our carbon policy principles, we see state programs as an essential mechanism until we have a more cohesive federal policy that values clean baseload generation. Energy Secretary Perry's recent directive to look at the importance of preserving baseload generation is early but encouraging. We appreciate the secretary's focus to promote and needed market reforms to compensate these assets. We will support the DOE's effort as they move forward. 
Turning to the upcoming PJM auction. We understand the investment community is paying close attention particularly after the disappointing MISO capacity auction results. Joe Nigro is available to answer more detailed questions if you have them. But let me share a few thoughts around the auction. 
To the positive, we're going to 100% CP for the first time, which will put a higher performance burden on the entire fleet. We still think this should lead to a more responsible bidding, given the higher risk around nonperformance. The CETL numbers or the import capacity into ComEd and EMAAC LDAs have tightened this year versus last year. 
The tightening could flag more constrained market conditions than last year in these zones, which could help in separation. So the negative PJM load is demand forecast, again, for this auction and FERC-approved seasonal aggregation that will allow products that otherwise would not clear to participate in a 100% CP world. 
Finally, we have the risk of more uneconomic generation being built primarily in Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
These drivers are important, but we still expect clearing prices to come down to bidding behavior. 
You have seen us bid our assets in recent auctions to reflect the underlying economic needs of the individual plants, which in turn has led to some of our plants not cleared. You should expect us to bid our assets in the same responsible fashion in this next upcoming auction. 
Now let me the turn the call over to Jack to walk through the numbers."

My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the events that occurred this quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. We had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.65 per share at the top of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares to $0.68 per share for the first quarter of 2016. 
Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.47 per share. Versus our plan, the utility results were impacted by unfavorable weather at PECO and PHI, which was more than offset by O&M timing across all the utilities. With 70% of our distribution rate base and decoupled jurisdictions, including ComEd starting in 2017, we experienced less volatility on our utility earnings from record warm weather in January and February than if we did not have these programs. To help put this winter in context, this was the first time in 146 years when there was no snow on the ground in Chicago for both January and February. 
Looking across PJM, January and February were the warmest on record since data started being collected in 1950. 
Generation had a strong quarter relative to plan, earning $0.18 per share. We had good performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted and our Constellation team, once again, delivered strong results despite weak power prices and low volatility. 
Turning to Slide 9. The $0.65 per share in the first quarter this year was $0.03 per share lower than the first quarter of 2016. To the positive, we had a full quarter of contribution from PHI relative to only 8 days last year, which added $0.09. The other utilities benefited from rate relief and higher rate base, partly offset at PECO with even milder weather than last year. 
ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the known impacts of lower capacity prices and power price realization as well as more plant refueling outages. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 in the second quarter compared with $0.65 last year. Our second quarter results will include contributions from the FitzPatrick plant and the impacts of the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. The Illinois ZEC legislation will go into effect on June 1 and plant procurement is expected to occur later this fall. Plants receiving contracts would recognize revenues retroactive to the June 1 effective date. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute well, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter. Looking at the trailing 12-month booked ROEs, we saw nice improvements even relative to what we showed last quarter. 
At PHI, we saw all of the utilities register gains with some help coming as revenues from the first cycle of rate cases are starting to flow through to results. 
For the legacy Exelon Utilities, we continue to see strong earned ROEs, over 10%, that lift the consolidated Exelon utilities platform to nearly 10%, including PHI. 
We have plenty of work to do at the utilities and with our regulators to keep improving the product we're delivering to our customers. But we're happy with where the overall business is performing. We're, obviously, pleased with where our earned ROEs are trending, but I want to remind you that there will be variability in the earned ROEs that are different utilities as we go forward. The timing of rate case implementation, weather comparability and in-service dates will all impact results. 
We think the ability to earn strong ROEs and the plan that we have in place at PHI to improve their ROEs will be the recipe for our future success. 
On Slide 12, we have an update on our rate cases. Since our fourth quarter call, we have closed out the Delmarva Maryland case with a revenue increase of $38 million. We've also reached unanimous settlements in our Delmarva Delaware electric and gas cases for $31.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively and would expect commission approval during the second quarter. 
From our first cycle of planned rate cases, we're now down just to the Pepco D.C. case, where we expect a Commission decision later in July. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to get PHI's revenues and our booked ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. 
As we've shared with you many times before, we've always viewed the turnaround in PHI earned ROEs as a 2 rate case cycle process. To that end, we filed our second rate cases at ACE and Pepco Maryland this quarter. 
Combined with the outstanding cases from the first cycle that I previously mentioned, we are currently asking for $252 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland and ACE likely in Q4 2017 and first quarter of 2018, respectively. We plan to file a second cycle of cases in most, if not all, of PHI's jurisdictions in 2017 with all completed by the end of 2018, putting us in a position to earn between 9% and 10% ROEs in 2019. More details on the rate case is in our schedules to be found on Slides 29 through 36 in the appendix. 
Slide 13 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. 
During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generational load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $50 million in both 2018 and 2019 due to the impact of price changes on our open portfolio. We ended the quarter approximately 12% to 15% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align to our fundamental view of spot market upside at NiHub. Although we have increased our length in other regions as well. 
We're comfortable with being more open when we look at market fundamentals. For example, forward regional natural gas prices today are over $1 per MMBtu higher than they realized last year, yet the forwards for power are only about $1 per megawatt higher. We do not believe that is a sustainable situation. 
To that point, I should note that power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter and have reversed about half of the first quarter price declines. 
On Slide 14, we have highlighted some key recent events. On March 31, 2017, we executed on the creation of the Exelon Generation Renewables JV, which will provide us with $400 million of pretax cash, including allocated debt that puts total JV enterprise value at approximately $1.7 billion. The price implies an EV to EBITDA multiple over 10x and a dollar per kW value over $1,200. 
The JV consists of 1,296 megawatts of renewable generation capacity, which is about 35% of our renewables output and has an average contract life of 14 years. The JV structure provides the option to drop down contractor renewable assets from our portfolio in the future. The proceeds from this sale will be used to accelerate our deleveraging strategy. 
Also on March 31, we closed on the acquisition of the FitzPatrick nuclear station from Entergy, which adds 838 megawatts of nuclear capacity to our portfolio. 
As you know, the FitzPatrick plant is part of the New York ZEC program, and we'll receive ZEC payments for the next 12 years, which started on April 1. The plant is now operated by Exelon, and I'm happy to report we had a clean cutover of FitzPatrick on to the Exelon platform. We're excited to have the FitzPatrick employees as part of the Exelon family. 
Our Exelon Generation Texas partnership, commonly referred to as EGTP, is a portfolio of 3,476 megawatts of gas generation in Texas. In 2014, we raised $675 million of nonrecourse project finance for the assets, which currently has a balance of approximately $650 million. With the downturn in ERCOT power markets, these assets have been under pressure with the debt trading at a discounted face value for some time and the plants struggling to generate adequate cash flows. 
Due to the combination of challenged cash flows and our decision not to inject additional equity, we have come to terms with the lenders to pursue an orderly sale of the assets on their behalf. 
The modest current earnings and all the debt are still included in our financial outlook. However, we see the ultimate exit from these assets being accretive to our EPS and debt-to-EBITDA multiple starting in 2018. 
In light of the process, we're not in a position to expand further on this transaction. 
Finally, during the quarter, we decided to discontinue the sales process of the Mystic 8 and 9 assets. We were exploring the sale of these assets as a direct result of interest received from potential buyers. During the sales process, we ran into some issues with the fuel supply agreement that needs to be addressed, and as we've said, we would only transact if we could realize a price greater than our [ mutual ] whole value. Our continuing to own this assets does not impact our commitments on our debt-to-EBITDA target and debt reduction plans that we've already shared with you. 
Turning to Slide 15. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment-grade credit rating. We're forecasting to be at 3.2x debt-to-EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long-term target of 3x debt-to-EBITDA. 
On a recourse debt basis, we're already well ahead of our target, and taking into account the sale of EGTP, we would be on target overall. As we said before, we will look to retire Holdco debt once we have reached 3x target at ExGen. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

You already told us that's bounced a little bit, but people are looking forward to sort of 2020 roll coming this fall and looking at the open, theoretically, open position and worried about the capacity market print and thinking, well, 2020 is going to be another down year. So I don't know if you can comment on where -- how that looks today and also how that dovetails with what you continue to do with vis-a-vis debt reduction at ExGen. Because while the balance sheet looks like it's in absolutely great shape today, if EBITDA keeps going south, it's sort of a -- the bar keeps going up every year in terms of how -- what you have to do with your cash flow to keep it at that level of leverage."

And as you know, I'll start by saying we have a long-standing practice of really not discussing our bidding strategy around capacity auctions and where we think it will clear. I think there is one thing though you have to take into account, is the timing of the 2 auctions. The MISO auction was for June of this year through May of next year and the PJM auction, obviously, is much further out in the curve. When you think about the operation for the power plant and the fuel loaded in the core at Clinton, for example, that plant was going to continue to operate during that period. What I will say about Quad Cities in the bidding is we're going to continue to remain responsible in the way we bid our capacity, reflecting the underlying economics of our plants, and that's consistent with what we've done with past auctions. I think the major question mark with this auction continues to be, as Chris mentioned, bidding behavior from the existing generations as well as the discipline associated with newbuilds. As it relates to existing facilities, we continue to see economically challenged plants that have cleared previous auctions. And in addition to that, we see the economics of new builds being marginal. In the last auction, we cleared about 27 gigawatts of base capacity, which was about 16% of the total procurement. And it remains to be seen how that 27 gigawatts will participate in this auction. But the big variable, as I mentioned, will continue to be the bidding of all the plants, and we will remain disciplined in that regard with all our facilities."

Steve, let me start off and talk a little about the technical conference over the last couple days. There are 3 buckets of issues that I think I'd look at. One is carbon pricing on the market and what FERC can do to facilitate the states who are interested in doing that. The second bucket would be the MOPR issues. That's PJM's Grid 20/20, what New England ISO put out. And the third bucket are energy reforms. And so I think all 3 of these things are in play as well in connection with the secretary's memo. Let me talk about the 3. First, we think there was a constructive discussion around carbon. One of the issues that has limited the ability of states to incorporate aggressive pricing is leakage between the states, and I think there was good discussion around what FERC can do to address that problem. There is, I think you'd agree if you saw the technical conference, a growing recognition that putting carbon explicitly in the market is something that would address a lot of these issues and there's a growing receptivity to that. On the issue of the MOPRs, that's where I think it most directly addresses the state ZEC programs and the REC programs. The New England proposal doesn't deal with existing baseload generation or existing generation of any kind, frankly, and that's consistent with FERC precedent. And so that template wouldn't have any effect on the state programs, but PJM proposal does, however, deal with existing resources. And we have not historically supported that proposal. We recognize PJM has made some important changes, and those were talked about at the technical conference. The issue with the MOPR, from our perspective, is that it is a distraction from some unfinished work that we believe FERC and PJM ought to get to first. Unfortunately, it's become a little bit of a tempest in a teapot in the sense that there's a false narrative out there that the challenges to the IPP sector are driven by ZEC and REC policies when, in fact, a number of our colleagues in the business saw equity values drop by 70% and 80% before the word ZEC even came into our dialogue. So we just -- we don't think the MOPR is an approach that is going to workable, it flies in the face of what the states are looking to do. I don't think it'll be that effective. We talked about MISO Zone 4. It's notable that -- had we bid Clinton in a way where it would not have cleared in that auction or had been excluded by a MOPR, the price in MISO would have risen from $1.50 to $5 a megawatt tag. That's certainly not going to address the downstate issues that [ Daiichi ] and others are facing. At the end of it, we agree with what Chairman LaFleur said. And she basically questioned the wisdom of approaching this problem set with more MOPRs per units that are receiving state environmental attribute payments. And I think that's why New York ISO and MISO and others are not going in that direction. So that's -- we don't agree with the direction on the MOPR, but let me talk to you about something important that came up during this session and I think we'll do it good. And that is Andy Ott talked about in Monday's session, and I'm going to loosely quote him, saying that we've politely ignored energy market design problems that are undervaluing baseload assets. And he added, we can't afford to ignore those problems anymore. And we completely agree with that. We have talked and talked over the last few years about energy pricing problems in the markets, [ contacts  hold ], negative pricing, the fact that certain units can't set price during hours, the overcommitment of resources driving uplift and a whole host of issues that we've had technical conferences on and white papers on and we just haven't gotten started on working on that. And as a consequence of not addressing those energy market issues, states and our customers are being deprived of assets that add resiliency, they add fuel diversity, and they add some environmental benefits. And so what we expect to do at the end of the technical conference, you heard Calpine and others echo this, is we want to set a deadline for bringing to conclusion the energy market reforms that we had talked about. And we think that talking about MOPRs or other things that interfere with state's rights, before we fix the energy market problems, is a little bit like putting your shoes on before you put your pants up. At the end of the day, it makes you look a little bit silly. And so once we get a reconstituted quorum at FERC, we're going to go after these energy price reforms. And we think Secretary Perry's memo opens the door to address these issues. So we think the last couple of days and Secretary Perry's memo gives us an opening to look at some unfinished business that we have to get active. So long answer, big subject, but we see a lot of promise in what we saw over the last couple of days, and we see a lot of promise in what the DOE is looking at. We have to get this stuff over the finish line."

First, we think the DOE has an important role in setting policy. I think the implementation requirement of that policy could, in certain instances, be new legislation. It could be things that are done at the NRC in terms of regulatory burdens on nuclear, but it would involve the commission in that sense. It could involve different changes and roles at FERC. But the DOE is going to have an important voice, in our view, in this policy discussion and will set the tone even if it can't complete all of the objectives. There are certain tools that DOE has. Section 202(c), authority under the Federal Power Act, as an example, allows them to secure resources in the market that are needed. That is a power that has been used sparingly, I think only 2 times in history. But certainly, there's a discussion around the use of it for baseload resources. In -- with regard to attribute payments, I think -- environmental attribute payments, I think we're kind of in a wait and see where the administration goes on carbon. But I think your general sentiment is correct, that that's not something we see immediately coming out of the department. But you asked kind of a more fundamental question. As the states are covering environmental and PJM is covering reliability, what's left? Well, I'll tell you what's left. What's left is resiliency. There's a little bit of a different concept than reliability. Reliability assumes that pipeline infrastructure and other critical pieces are in place. PJM assumes that and says whether there's some reliability impacts or the reliability expectations could be met. Resiliency looks a little bit deeper at that and understands the impact of pipeline disruptions on natural gas-fired generation and should we start modeling those sorts of things, is there a value there? The other piece that is not currently valued in the market is fuel diversity. As we transition to a market that is made up more and more of just natural gas, we're exposing our customers to fuel price volatility in the long run. Those things, because of the short-term nature of the markets, are fully considered. But if you look at Secretary Perry's memo, I think it's the second bullet point -- second and third bullet points of that memo address those very issues."

We're off to a great start in 2017. In March, we marked our 1 year anniversary of the merger between Exelon and Pepco Holdings. 
Since the close, PHI has successfully executed on merger commitments, achieved synergy savings and made significant progress toward full integration. 
We also continue to work hard on the regulatory front. Since the beginning of the year, PHI closed out the Delmarva Maryland rate case and reached a settlement for our electric and gas rate case in Delaware. We are now down to just Pepco D.C. cases from our first planned cycle of rate case filings. 
That said, our [ regular ] team has already started the second cycle of rate cases at Pepco Maryland and ACE as planned. 
At ExGen, we completed the acquisition of FitzPatrick power plant, representing the 25th nuclear reactor where we have ownership stake. We welcome the new employees to the Exelon family. 
We also announced the Exelon Generation Renewables joint venture, which is allowing us to recycle capital at a valuation meaningfully above the value implied for our ExGen at our current share price. The JV allows us to make even faster progress on our debt reduction goals without diminishing our commitment to renewables -- renewable power.
We continue to focus on the legal challenges to the zero emission credits, or ZEC, in New York and Illinois. We remain confident that our arguments will prevail. We'll cover these points in more detail in the call, but I wanted to highlight what we have done while staying focused on the day-to-day operations. 
As shown on Slide 5, on a GAAP basis, we've earned $1.07 versus $0.19 a share last year. And on an operating basis, we earned $0.65 versus $0.68 last year, which puts us at the top of our $0.55 to $0.65 range and above consensus of $0.62. 
Moving to Slide 6. Our first operation -- our first quarter operational report was strong. Our color block charts highlight operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities. 
Legacy Exelon Utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. PECO actually had its best customer satisfaction rating ever during the first quarter. BGE experienced the best ever CAIDI and SAIFI performance of all time. At PHI, we're encouraged by the progress we are making and our customers are seeing the benefits. 
For example, by using a common lockout/tag-out process, a procedure that establishes a zone of protection while restoring equipment, we were able to send over 400 employees and contractors from BGE, ComEd and PECO to support the storm restoration at Delmarva during Winter Storm Stella. 
As a result, Delmarva customers had their power restored 2 days sooner. Our thanks to everybody that helped in accomplishing that speedy recovery. 
The power of Exelon Utilities platform is a significant benefit to our customers. We continue to improve upon these metrics to meet reliability commitments we have made to provide better service to our customers. 
The nuclear team had a great quarter also. They completed 3 refueling outages and achieved a capacity factor of 94%. 
They also had the fastest refueling outage ever for Calvert Cliffs nuclear station 2, running 20 days. 
In the Power business, we realized renewable energy capture rate of nearly 96% and a power dispatch match of 94% -- over 99%. 
Our 2 new build CCGTs in Texas have both achieved first flyer and are now selling test power onto the grid. The state-of-the-art plants, which are totally, nearly 2,200 megawatts, are on budget, on schedule for full commercial operations in the second quarter. We expect that they will be ready to participate in Texas this summer. 
At Constellation, our highly hedged portfolio in 2017 mitigates the impacts of weaker power prices and lower load given the mild winter weather. 
Even in this recent low volatility environment, our C&I business has been able to hold onto margins and keep customer renewables. 
On Slide 7, we view 2016 as a great success in delivering on our commitments and preserving some of our at-risk nuclear units by securing compensation for their clean energy attributes. 
For 2017, we're focused on executing on these gains we made last year, and more importantly, affirming the ZEC programs in the court. 
In New York, litigation is further along at this point. On March 29, the judge in New York Federal Court heard oral arguments on our motions to dismiss. We made strong arguments at this hearing and believe the law is clearly on our side. 
We do ask that -- we do get asked when we expect a decision, but the judge has not given a specific time line or deadline to issue for order. If we prevail in a motion to dismiss, we would expect the other side to appeal that decision. If the judge denies our motion to dismiss, we'll move forward with the case as planned. 
As I've said previously, we're confident in the strength of our case. 
In Illinois, 2 groups of plaintiffs have challenged the ZEC and federal court and the cases are being before 1 judge. The plaintiffs filed for preliminary injunction on March 31. We intervened in that case on April 10, and we filed motions to dismiss. The judge has held a preliminary injunction motion while he receives full briefing on the motion to dismiss. He will then determine whether there is a legal basis to go forward. That briefing will be completed by May 15 and the judge is scheduled to inform the parties of his intention on May 22. 
In the interim, we start recognizing ZEC revenues in New York on April 1. In Illinois, the utilities have filed tariffs to begin collecting the ZEC payments on June 1. We don't expect the actual ZEC procurement process in Illinois to conclude until later in the fall. We remain confident that the ZEC programs will be upheld in the courts to the benefits of the state, the communities and these valuable resources. 
As we have discussed last year in our carbon policy principles, we see state programs as an essential mechanism until we have a more cohesive federal policy that values clean baseload generation. Energy Secretary Perry's recent directive to look at the importance of preserving baseload generation is early but encouraging. We appreciate the secretary's focus to promote and needed market reforms to compensate these assets. We will support the DOE's effort as they move forward. 
Turning to the upcoming PJM auction. We understand the investment community is paying close attention particularly after the disappointing MISO capacity auction results. Joe Nigro is available to answer more detailed questions if you have them. But let me share a few thoughts around the auction. 
To the positive, we're going to 100% CP for the first time, which will put a higher performance burden on the entire fleet. We still think this should lead to a more responsible bidding, given the higher risk around nonperformance. The CETL numbers or the import capacity into ComEd and EMAAC LDAs have tightened this year versus last year. 
The tightening could flag more constrained market conditions than last year in these zones, which could help in separation. So the negative PJM load is demand forecast, again, for this auction and FERC-approved seasonal aggregation that will allow products that otherwise would not clear to participate in a 100% CP world. 
Finally, we have the risk of more uneconomic generation being built primarily in Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
These drivers are important, but we still expect clearing prices to come down to bidding behavior. 
You have seen us bid our assets in recent auctions to reflect the underlying economic needs of the individual plants, which in turn has led to some of our plants not cleared. You should expect us to bid our assets in the same responsible fashion in this next upcoming auction. 
Now let me the turn the call over to Jack to walk through the numbers."

My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the events that occurred this quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. We had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.65 per share at the top of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares to $0.68 per share for the first quarter of 2016. 
Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.47 per share. Versus our plan, the utility results were impacted by unfavorable weather at PECO and PHI, which was more than offset by O&M timing across all the utilities. With 70% of our distribution rate base and decoupled jurisdictions, including ComEd starting in 2017, we experienced less volatility on our utility earnings from record warm weather in January and February than if we did not have these programs. To help put this winter in context, this was the first time in 146 years when there was no snow on the ground in Chicago for both January and February. 
Looking across PJM, January and February were the warmest on record since data started being collected in 1950. 
Generation had a strong quarter relative to plan, earning $0.18 per share. We had good performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted and our Constellation team, once again, delivered strong results despite weak power prices and low volatility. 
Turning to Slide 9. The $0.65 per share in the first quarter this year was $0.03 per share lower than the first quarter of 2016. To the positive, we had a full quarter of contribution from PHI relative to only 8 days last year, which added $0.09. The other utilities benefited from rate relief and higher rate base, partly offset at PECO with even milder weather than last year. 
ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the known impacts of lower capacity prices and power price realization as well as more plant refueling outages. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 in the second quarter compared with $0.65 last year. Our second quarter results will include contributions from the FitzPatrick plant and the impacts of the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. The Illinois ZEC legislation will go into effect on June 1 and plant procurement is expected to occur later this fall. Plants receiving contracts would recognize revenues retroactive to the June 1 effective date. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute well, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter. Looking at the trailing 12-month booked ROEs, we saw nice improvements even relative to what we showed last quarter. 
At PHI, we saw all of the utilities register gains with some help coming as revenues from the first cycle of rate cases are starting to flow through to results. 
For the legacy Exelon Utilities, we continue to see strong earned ROEs, over 10%, that lift the consolidated Exelon utilities platform to nearly 10%, including PHI. 
We have plenty of work to do at the utilities and with our regulators to keep improving the product we're delivering to our customers. But we're happy with where the overall business is performing. We're, obviously, pleased with where our earned ROEs are trending, but I want to remind you that there will be variability in the earned ROEs that are different utilities as we go forward. The timing of rate case implementation, weather comparability and in-service dates will all impact results. 
We think the ability to earn strong ROEs and the plan that we have in place at PHI to improve their ROEs will be the recipe for our future success. 
On Slide 12, we have an update on our rate cases. Since our fourth quarter call, we have closed out the Delmarva Maryland case with a revenue increase of $38 million. We've also reached unanimous settlements in our Delmarva Delaware electric and gas cases for $31.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively and would expect commission approval during the second quarter. 
From our first cycle of planned rate cases, we're now down just to the Pepco D.C. case, where we expect a Commission decision later in July. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to get PHI's revenues and our booked ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. 
As we've shared with you many times before, we've always viewed the turnaround in PHI earned ROEs as a 2 rate case cycle process. To that end, we filed our second rate cases at ACE and Pepco Maryland this quarter. 
Combined with the outstanding cases from the first cycle that I previously mentioned, we are currently asking for $252 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland and ACE likely in Q4 2017 and first quarter of 2018, respectively. We plan to file a second cycle of cases in most, if not all, of PHI's jurisdictions in 2017 with all completed by the end of 2018, putting us in a position to earn between 9% and 10% ROEs in 2019. More details on the rate case is in our schedules to be found on Slides 29 through 36 in the appendix. 
Slide 13 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. 
During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generational load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $50 million in both 2018 and 2019 due to the impact of price changes on our open portfolio. We ended the quarter approximately 12% to 15% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align to our fundamental view of spot market upside at NiHub. Although we have increased our length in other regions as well. 
We're comfortable with being more open when we look at market fundamentals. For example, forward regional natural gas prices today are over $1 per MMBtu higher than they realized last year, yet the forwards for power are only about $1 per megawatt higher. We do not believe that is a sustainable situation. 
To that point, I should note that power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter and have reversed about half of the first quarter price declines. 
On Slide 14, we have highlighted some key recent events. On March 31, 2017, we executed on the creation of the Exelon Generation Renewables JV, which will provide us with $400 million of pretax cash, including allocated debt that puts total JV enterprise value at approximately $1.7 billion. The price implies an EV to EBITDA multiple over 10x and a dollar per kW value over $1,200. 
The JV consists of 1,296 megawatts of renewable generation capacity, which is about 35% of our renewables output and has an average contract life of 14 years. The JV structure provides the option to drop down contractor renewable assets from our portfolio in the future. The proceeds from this sale will be used to accelerate our deleveraging strategy. 
Also on March 31, we closed on the acquisition of the FitzPatrick nuclear station from Entergy, which adds 838 megawatts of nuclear capacity to our portfolio. 
As you know, the FitzPatrick plant is part of the New York ZEC program, and we'll receive ZEC payments for the next 12 years, which started on April 1. The plant is now operated by Exelon, and I'm happy to report we had a clean cutover of FitzPatrick on to the Exelon platform. We're excited to have the FitzPatrick employees as part of the Exelon family. 
Our Exelon Generation Texas partnership, commonly referred to as EGTP, is a portfolio of 3,476 megawatts of gas generation in Texas. In 2014, we raised $675 million of nonrecourse project finance for the assets, which currently has a balance of approximately $650 million. With the downturn in ERCOT power markets, these assets have been under pressure with the debt trading at a discounted face value for some time and the plants struggling to generate adequate cash flows. 
Due to the combination of challenged cash flows and our decision not to inject additional equity, we have come to terms with the lenders to pursue an orderly sale of the assets on their behalf. 
The modest current earnings and all the debt are still included in our financial outlook. However, we see the ultimate exit from these assets being accretive to our EPS and debt-to-EBITDA multiple starting in 2018. 
In light of the process, we're not in a position to expand further on this transaction. 
Finally, during the quarter, we decided to discontinue the sales process of the Mystic 8 and 9 assets. We were exploring the sale of these assets as a direct result of interest received from potential buyers. During the sales process, we ran into some issues with the fuel supply agreement that needs to be addressed, and as we've said, we would only transact if we could realize a price greater than our [ mutual ] whole value. Our continuing to own this assets does not impact our commitments on our debt-to-EBITDA target and debt reduction plans that we've already shared with you. 
Turning to Slide 15. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment-grade credit rating. We're forecasting to be at 3.2x debt-to-EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long-term target of 3x debt-to-EBITDA. 
On a recourse debt basis, we're already well ahead of our target, and taking into account the sale of EGTP, we would be on target overall. As we said before, we will look to retire Holdco debt once we have reached 3x target at ExGen. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

You already told us that's bounced a little bit, but people are looking forward to sort of 2020 roll coming this fall and looking at the open, theoretically, open position and worried about the capacity market print and thinking, well, 2020 is going to be another down year. So I don't know if you can comment on where -- how that looks today and also how that dovetails with what you continue to do with vis-a-vis debt reduction at ExGen. Because while the balance sheet looks like it's in absolutely great shape today, if EBITDA keeps going south, it's sort of a -- the bar keeps going up every year in terms of how -- what you have to do with your cash flow to keep it at that level of leverage."

Our fundamental perspective would be that as liquidity returns to the market, prices are going up across and our hedging approach and the link that we're carrying relative to ratable is demonstrative of that.

And as you know, I'll start by saying we have a long-standing practice of really not discussing our bidding strategy around capacity auctions and where we think it will clear. I think there is one thing though you have to take into account, is the timing of the 2 auctions. The MISO auction was for June of this year through May of next year and the PJM auction, obviously, is much further out in the curve. When you think about the operation for the power plant and the fuel loaded in the core at Clinton, for example, that plant was going to continue to operate during that period. What I will say about Quad Cities in the bidding is we're going to continue to remain responsible in the way we bid our capacity, reflecting the underlying economics of our plants, and that's consistent with what we've done with past auctions. I think the major question mark with this auction continues to be, as Chris mentioned, bidding behavior from the existing generations as well as the discipline associated with newbuilds. As it relates to existing facilities, we continue to see economically challenged plants that have cleared previous auctions. And in addition to that, we see the economics of new builds being marginal. In the last auction, we cleared about 27 gigawatts of base capacity, which was about 16% of the total procurement. And it remains to be seen how that 27 gigawatts will participate in this auction. But the big variable, as I mentioned, will continue to be the bidding of all the plants, and we will remain disciplined in that regard with all our facilities."

Steve, let me start off and talk a little about the technical conference over the last couple days. There are 3 buckets of issues that I think I'd look at. One is carbon pricing on the market and what FERC can do to facilitate the states who are interested in doing that. The second bucket would be the MOPR issues. That's PJM's Grid 20/20, what New England ISO put out. And the third bucket are energy reforms. And so I think all 3 of these things are in play as well in connection with the secretary's memo. Let me talk about the 3. First, we think there was a constructive discussion around carbon. One of the issues that has limited the ability of states to incorporate aggressive pricing is leakage between the states, and I think there was good discussion around what FERC can do to address that problem. There is, I think you'd agree if you saw the technical conference, a growing recognition that putting carbon explicitly in the market is something that would address a lot of these issues and there's a growing receptivity to that. On the issue of the MOPRs, that's where I think it most directly addresses the state ZEC programs and the REC programs. The New England proposal doesn't deal with existing baseload generation or existing generation of any kind, frankly, and that's consistent with FERC precedent. And so that template wouldn't have any effect on the state programs, but PJM proposal does, however, deal with existing resources. And we have not historically supported that proposal. We recognize PJM has made some important changes, and those were talked about at the technical conference. The issue with the MOPR, from our perspective, is that it is a distraction from some unfinished work that we believe FERC and PJM ought to get to first. Unfortunately, it's become a little bit of a tempest in a teapot in the sense that there's a false narrative out there that the challenges to the IPP sector are driven by ZEC and REC policies when, in fact, a number of our colleagues in the business saw equity values drop by 70% and 80% before the word ZEC even came into our dialogue. So we just -- we don't think the MOPR is an approach that is going to workable, it flies in the face of what the states are looking to do. I don't think it'll be that effective. We talked about MISO Zone 4. It's notable that -- had we bid Clinton in a way where it would not have cleared in that auction or had been excluded by a MOPR, the price in MISO would have risen from $1.50 to $5 a megawatt tag. That's certainly not going to address the downstate issues that [ Daiichi ] and others are facing. At the end of it, we agree with what Chairman LaFleur said. And she basically questioned the wisdom of approaching this problem set with more MOPRs per units that are receiving state environmental attribute payments. And I think that's why New York ISO and MISO and others are not going in that direction. So that's -- we don't agree with the direction on the MOPR, but let me talk to you about something important that came up during this session and I think we'll do it good. And that is Andy Ott talked about in Monday's session, and I'm going to loosely quote him, saying that we've politely ignored energy market design problems that are undervaluing baseload assets. And he added, we can't afford to ignore those problems anymore. And we completely agree with that. We have talked and talked over the last few years about energy pricing problems in the markets, [ contacts  hold ], negative pricing, the fact that certain units can't set price during hours, the overcommitment of resources driving uplift and a whole host of issues that we've had technical conferences on and white papers on and we just haven't gotten started on working on that. And as a consequence of not addressing those energy market issues, states and our customers are being deprived of assets that add resiliency, they add fuel diversity, and they add some environmental benefits. And so what we expect to do at the end of the technical conference, you heard Calpine and others echo this, is we want to set a deadline for bringing to conclusion the energy market reforms that we had talked about. And we think that talking about MOPRs or other things that interfere with state's rights, before we fix the energy market problems, is a little bit like putting your shoes on before you put your pants up. At the end of the day, it makes you look a little bit silly. And so once we get a reconstituted quorum at FERC, we're going to go after these energy price reforms. And we think Secretary Perry's memo opens the door to address these issues. So we think the last couple of days and Secretary Perry's memo gives us an opening to look at some unfinished business that we have to get active. So long answer, big subject, but we see a lot of promise in what we saw over the last couple of days, and we see a lot of promise in what the DOE is looking at. We have to get this stuff over the finish line."

First, we think the DOE has an important role in setting policy. I think the implementation requirement of that policy could, in certain instances, be new legislation. It could be things that are done at the NRC in terms of regulatory burdens on nuclear, but it would involve the commission in that sense. It could involve different changes and roles at FERC. But the DOE is going to have an important voice, in our view, in this policy discussion and will set the tone even if it can't complete all of the objectives. There are certain tools that DOE has. Section 202(c), authority under the Federal Power Act, as an example, allows them to secure resources in the market that are needed. That is a power that has been used sparingly, I think only 2 times in history. But certainly, there's a discussion around the use of it for baseload resources. In -- with regard to attribute payments, I think -- environmental attribute payments, I think we're kind of in a wait and see where the administration goes on carbon. But I think your general sentiment is correct, that that's not something we see immediately coming out of the department. But you asked kind of a more fundamental question. As the states are covering environmental and PJM is covering reliability, what's left? Well, I'll tell you what's left. What's left is resiliency. There's a little bit of a different concept than reliability. Reliability assumes that pipeline infrastructure and other critical pieces are in place. PJM assumes that and says whether there's some reliability impacts or the reliability expectations could be met. Resiliency looks a little bit deeper at that and understands the impact of pipeline disruptions on natural gas-fired generation and should we start modeling those sorts of things, is there a value there? The other piece that is not currently valued in the market is fuel diversity. As we transition to a market that is made up more and more of just natural gas, we're exposing our customers to fuel price volatility in the long run. Those things, because of the short-term nature of the markets, are fully considered. But if you look at Secretary Perry's memo, I think it's the second bullet point -- second and third bullet points of that memo address those very issues."

We are pleased to deliver another good quarter. We achieved strong financial results while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make significant gains on the policy front. I",846,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We are pleased to deliver another good quarter. We achieved strong financial results while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make significant gains on the policy front. I'll begin by highlighting our financial performance and then briefly discuss some of the key policy and strategic objectives that are top of mind of many of you and us. Joe Dominguez then cover in more detail the status of our recent wins in New York and Illinois as well as our thoughts on potential PJM market reforms. Jack will walk you through the numbers.
As shown on Slide 5, on a GAAP basis, in the second quarter, we are $0.09 per share versus $0.29 last year. On an operating basis, we earned $0.54 per share versus $0.65 last year, which is near the top of our $0.45 to $0.55 guidance range. These are strong results relative to our expectations and led by ExGen. 
Moving to Slide 6. We continue to execute very well operationally with the second quarter.com extending some of the best efforts. On our color block chart shows key operating and customer satisfaction benchmarks for the utilities. Legacy Exelon Utilities again remained almost entirely in the first quartile, BGE and ComEd achieving first  decile in CAIDI performance. BGE also delivered its best-ever safety and CAIDI performance and ComEd best-ever safety performance. And I'm proud to say that Pepco was identified in the J.D. Power study as one of the most improved utilities in customer satisfaction from 2016 to 2017. This is a great achievement and shows we are delivering on our commitments to our customers. The scale of Exelon Utilities platform again significantly benefited our customers in the second quarter. We leveraged our management model and our geographic overlap to deliver better and faster service, particularly in the East. For example, in May, we dispatched Delmarva and PECO crews to assist BGE with the restoration of a multi-day natural gas outage that affected customers in West Baltimore. The assistance provided by the other crews not only helped to reduce the outage time by a full day but also allow BGE to operate the balance of the system safely with 100% gas order response during the outage. We're glad to see our customers are benefiting from the Exelon Utilities platform. 
The nuclear team also had a great quarter. They achieved 90.9% capacity factor and completed 6 refueling outages, Nine Mile 1 registered its shortest outage duration on record. In the power business, our assets performed well. Our 2 new Texas CCGTs, about 2,200 megawatts, are now online and fully operational. These plants are state-of-the-art and able to ramp up quickly to better serve the load that may come with the hot summer weather in Texas. 
Moving to Slide 7. We have seen several key developments in markets and regulatory matters. We had significant wins on the ZEC programs. As many of you already know, we prevailed on our motions to dismiss in both Illinois and New York with both judges finding in favor on standing in legal matters. These wins are strong affirmations of the ZEC program design. More importantly, these wins will support the continued operation of at-risk nuclear plants, providing clean affordable energy for our customers for many years to come. Needless to say, we're pleased  with the results. Joe Dominguez will cover more of the details in a few minutes. 
With respect to PHI, we wrapped up our first cycle of rate cases as part of Exelon with the D.C. order last week. Jack will discuss in more detail but we're happy with the progress we're making at PHI operationally and on the regulatory front. We are pleased that in July, the D.C. Court of Appeals affirmed the D.C. commission approval of the PHI merger resolving an open item. PJM capacity results were announced on May 23 in all of our nuclear plants and PJM cleared the auction except Quad Cities and Three Mile Island. The RPM results show considerable variability by year in the RTO zone. However, our disciplined bidding approach in recent years continues to provide greater stability and realized capacity revenues, which Jack will discuss shortly. 
With Three Mile Island filling to clear PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive auction, we came to the difficult decision to close the plant in September 2019 at the end of the next fuel cycle. A program that fairly compensates the plants for 0 admission energy similar to what we have seen in New York and Illinois is needed in order to continue operations. It's important to note that the economic challenges facing TMI -- facing TMI impact all nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. We remain hopeful that the state policymakers can find a solution that preserves these important assets. The total Pennsylvania nuclear fleet injects $2 billion into the state's economy each year and supports 1,600 direct and indirect jobs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Dominguez, who will provide some details on ZEC challenges and other items."
296181,532038670,1262866,"Exelon Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everybody. As Chris said, I'm going to cover the ZEC rulings, the current status of ZEC legislative efforts in other states, the DOE study and PJM operational and market reforms. Let me start with the court cases. Obviously,",1318,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everybody. As Chris said, I'm going to cover the ZEC rulings, the current status of ZEC legislative efforts in other states, the DOE study and PJM operational and market reforms. 
Let me start with the court cases. Obviously, we're very pleased  with the decisions in the district courts. The Illinois District Court decision has been appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. We expect the New York court's decision to be appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
I want to make a couple of points about why we are very confident in the ultimate outcome of those cases. First, the District Court decided these cases at a very preliminary stage, whereas as a legal matter, the courts had to assume all the facts that the plaintiffs thought were accurate. Those facts were not accurate, but even under the plaintiff's versions of the case, the courts found that they had no legal claim whatsoever. Second, as you may know, oftentimes, where a part prevails in a case on a procedural or standing issue, the court will not proceed to decide the subsequent legal issues. That wasn't the case here. In both decisions, the District Courts rejected the entire waterfront of the plaintiff's claims beyond the substantive and procedural -- through the substantive and procedural issues. I think that speaks to how high a hill they will need to climb on appeal to reverse those decisions. At the heart of it, the decisions reject the plaintiff's arguments that state policies that favor cleaner sources of generation violate federal wholesale markets. The District Court for the southern district of New York summed it up this way. It said that competing generators have no complaint that they don't qualify for state programs because ""they made business decisions about how they generate electricity."" Policymakers and customers increasingly want reliable low-cost 0 emission electricity. That's what do we do at Exelon. The ZEC policies begin to recognize that nuclear energy plays an important role in meeting those customer needs and we're going to continue to advance that argument in Pennsylvania and other states. We're actively developing coalitions and we're working with policymakers to educate them on the issues. And as Chris said, the issues don't just face TMI but the entire nuclear industry as a whole and the entire industry, of course, in Pennsylvania. Now let me be clear, we're not just working on ZEC issues. We don't think that's the only approach. We have said for a long time that we think that the best market outcome is the price attributes directly into the market, in the case of greenhouse gases, price on carbon. And it's more clear to us now than ever that federal wholesale markets need to evolve to fully incorporate attributes like resiliency, fuel diversity and environmental qualities of the generation resources. If the markets don't evolve, then the markets are going to have a diminished role in energy policy going forward. 
I know that in the past we've fielded questions on these calls about whether, as a company, we remain committed to markets. We are committed, but the markets have to be well functioning. Our commitment to markets only extends so far as it provides the best outcomes for our customers. We have said for years that markets have problems. Those problems are undisputed. We have had many workshops at FERC and other places talking about price formation as an example, yet those issues have remained unresolved and the consequence has been that some of the most valuable resources for our customers are being forced out by a market that hasn't been working. That's why we feel confident that the DOE study and a reconstituted quorum at FERC is going to address some of these long-standing issues. Now let me talk about the study and some of the PJM market reforms that I'm hinting at here. 
As you know, the study has been worked on for a number of months; everybody wants to see it. We hope to see it at some point in time this month. We think that it is going to focus on baseload resources and the critical role of nuclear and the critical role of other fuel sources that have resilient on-site fuel. We think that the DOE study is important because it will frame the objectives for the administration for the next 4 years and we think it's going to be an important signpost to inform the agenda at FERC. Here's what we hope to see in the report. First, we want to see a recognition of the value of nuclear and an appreciation of the state programs in Illinois, New York and the other places that are going to adopt these programs. Let me be specific. We expect the FERC to respect those programs and not to tamper with the functioning. There are a couple of [indiscernible] complaints that need to be addressed. The ISOs do not support those complaints but that is on the docket and ready for action by a new FERC, and we have talked to the Department of Energy about those issues and we've had productive conversations. 
The second issue is that we need to look at the market design changes that have been long pending. As many of you know, PJM has recently put out a white paper on this issue, talking about energy price formation primarily in the off-peak hours and the need for all forms of generation to be able to set price. From our perspective, this is a very important issue and we appreciate PJM's time line, which calls for a FERC filing sometime in the first quarter of 2018 and full implementation of the market reforms by the summer of '18. We're going to push very hard to make sure that happens. 
Third, we hope the Department of Energy puts a spotlight on the issue of resiliency. Let me spend a moment talking about that. We have talked about reliability in the form of being able to run the system even in an event that we have major components, electrical components that failed. But as increasingly, the system depends on both intermittent generation and natural gas fire generation that don't have the ability to secure fuel for long-term operations. We need to be -- we need to make sure that our customers get electricity even in the event of a long-term disruption of the natural gas pipeline system. That's something that currently is not being modeled and needs to be modeled. 
So PJM has recently put out a white paper on this subject with a schedule of activities. The first activity is to address operational reserves beginning this winter. Importantly, that doesn't require any FERC activity or any stakeholder support. That within the tariff is within PJM's full province, and again, we are pushing to make sure these things are done. That's an important start and should begin to be reflected in pricing this winter for baseload resources that provide the kind of resiliency that I'm talking about. 
But that's not the end of this subject. We have to, as an industry and as a country, come to grips with this potential risk to our system and examine the possibility of multiple pipeline failures. And the policies that come from that should favor fuel generation sources that have on-site fuel like nuclear plants that could run for a year or 2 in the event of these emergencies. So we're going to continue to focus on that and those are the -- really the 3 areas that we're hoping that the DOE will provide some guidance on. So obviously, we have a lot going on in the policy space. We're making very good progress but a lot of work remains to be done. I look forward to taking your questions after Jack concludes his part of the presentation."

My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter.",1768,"Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter. 
On Slide 9, as Chris mentioned earlier, we had a strong second quarter financially and operationally across the company. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.54 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. Exelon's utilities lets holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.33 per share. Relative to plan, utility results were slightly favorable, primarily driven by O&M timing across all of the utilities. Generation earned $0.22 per share in the second quarter. This was favorable versus the plan, driven by the timing of O&M and realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trust. Our nuclear plants had another strong quarter with higher capacity factors than budgeted and the constellation team continued to deliver strong results with good customer wins. 
Turning to Slide 10. The $0.54 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2016. Overall, the utilities benefited from increased rates and higher rate base partly offset by year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the known impacts of lower power price realization and more plant refueling outages, partly offset by New York ZEC revenues. 
On Slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $1.19 per share are $0.14 per share lower than the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the New York ZEC revenues with partial offsets from our utilities with higher rates, supporting our ongoing reliability investments and a full year contribution from PHI. 
Turning to Slide 12. We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share in the third quarter compared with $0.91 per share last year. Our third quarter results will include a full quarter of contributions from the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. In Illinois, the ZEC program went into effect on June 1 but the ICC has yet to conduct its ZEC procurement process. It's anticipated that the procurement event and the execution of contracts with winning ZEC suppliers will occur in the fourth quarter. Therefore, no revenues will be recognized until that process concludes. We would then include all of the Illinois ZEC revenues retroactive to June 1. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our utilities continue to execute, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter in addition to strong customer-focused operational performance. Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, at PHI, we saw some of the utilities register lower trailing ROEs relative to what we showed last quarter. The degradation was expected primarily due to the timing of equity infusions that Exelon made into PHI in 2016, following the merger close. 
For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remain over 10%, lifting the consolidated Exelon utilities' platform to nearly 10% including PHI. We still have work to do with the utilities to continue improving the product we're delivering to our customers, but we're happy with where the overall business is performing. As we've said before, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the plan that we put in place at PHI. 
On Slide 14, we update the status of our rate cases. Since our first quarter call, the unanimous settlements in Delmarva Delaware electric and gas cases were approved with a combined revenue increase of $36 million. We also received the commission decision in the Pepco D.C. rate case during the quarter with a revenue increase of $37 million. We've now completed our first cycle of planned rate cases in the PHI jurisdictions with the second cycle already underway. We filed rate cases at ACE and Pepco Maryland last quarter and just recently filed again at Delmarva Maryland during the second quarter. Combined, we are currently asking for $168 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect final ruling on Pepco Maryland in the fourth quarter of this year and decisions on ACE and Delmarva Maryland in the first quarter of 2018. We plan to file second rate cases in the remaining PHI jurisdictions later in 2017 and expect to have them resolved by the end of 2018, helping to put us in a position to earn our targeted ROEs in 2019. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's revenues and earned ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on Slides 35 through 42 in the Appendix. 
Turning to Slide 15. The PJM base residual results were announced in May. We cleared 16.2 gigawatts of capacity in the auction with the bulk of our capacity clearing in the ComEd and Eastern max zones which cleared about the rest of our RTO pricing at $188 per megawatt day. We continue to follow the disciplined approach to bidding our plants based on their specific cost profiles. We believe this bidding discipline is the right strategy for our plants and has led to more stability in our capacity revenue streams than seen in other generators that have not been as disciplined. Our Three Mile Island nuclear plant failed to clear on the PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive year with this auction. We've been losing both cash and earnings at the plant in recent years and do not see a path to profitability as the market backdrop exists today. Accordingly, earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to retire the plant in the fall of 2019. We're engaged with stakeholders in Pennsylvania to find ways to preserve the plant but we're still early in that process. From a financial perspective, the closure will add $0.04 to $0.07 per share of EPS annually beyond 2019, depending on the refueling year. We expect to realize positive cumulative cash flows of approximately $225 million through 2021 with the closure. 
Slide 16 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generational load matching strategy. Total gross margin decreased in the second quarter by $150 million  in 2018 due to the removal of EGTP from the portfolio as well as the impact of lower capacity revenues in MISO in New York. Total gross margin in 2019 is down $150 million from last quarter, driven by the removal of EGTP from the portfolio and the EGTP from the portfolio and forecasted closer of TMI in September 2019. 
Let me be clear that although gross margin is down due to the divestiture of EGTP and planned closure of TMI, the impacts of both are accretive to EPS and cash flow. The elimination of EGTP lowers gross margin by roughly $100 million in 2018 and 2019 but is EPS accretive by $0.02 to $0.03 per share in each of those years. So there are cost offsets you should consider. And while we do not expect to close TMI until the fall of 2019, the retirement lowers our 2019 gross margin by roughly $50 million, although the EPS impact is roughly $0.05 positive. And as I said earlier, the retirement will be $0.04 to $0.07 EPS accretive annually beyond 2019, depending on the refueling year. 
From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind  our ratable hedging program in 2018 and $0.08 to $0.11 behind -- 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align with our fundamental view of spud market upside in NiHub. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. 
Turning to Slide 17. On the topic of power market forward, you have heard us and many others talk about the reduced liquidity in the forward power curves that arguably can create price distortions. We do not mean for this chart to be comprehensive but it's illustrative of what has been happening in the forward power markets. That top chart shows the volumes traded on a cumulative 2- and 5-year forward period for PJM West on peak power using a 6-month average to smooth some of the seasonal volatility. I would flag in this context that, overall -- I would flag in this context that overall volumes have been on a pretty consistent decline, both in absolute terms and particularly when looking beyond 2 years, which can be seen in the narrowing of the 2 lines on the chart. Arguably, more interesting, when thinking about forward power price transparency is the amount of transactions in those years. Looking at the lower right chart, front year volumes are over 71% of the 5-year cumulative volumes with 2019 representing another 23%. The volumes traded in 2020 and beyond are only 6% of the total volumes with 2021 nearly nonexistent. Compared to last year, total volumes are lower and the amount of volumes in the out years is even less. We wanted to share some of those data with you, particularly as folks are thinking about the roll-forward of 2020 earnings estimates. We would note that our fundamentals group has a more constructive view on power markets than this illiquid forward curve suggests, but we appreciate that there is [indiscernible] safety in using the forwards. However, when running your numbers, we would just encourage you all to appreciate what is underpinning those forward prices. 
Turning to Slide 18. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade rating. We have now removed EGTP from our credit metrics, which, in turn, has improved our consolidated net debt to EBITDA at year-end 2017 to 2.9x, which is below our target of 3x. If we focus only on recourse debt, our leverage is at 2.5x EBITDA. We're pleased with the improvements in our balance sheet and we'll continue to focus on a combination of debt paydown between ExGen and the holding company. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to  Chris."

In closing, I'd like to remind you all that Exelon's success is a direct result of our people and the culture of performance and service that we've created as an organization. In June, we held our sixth Exelon Innovation Expo in Washington, D.C. This annual event brings together employees, vendors and other key stakeholders to share all the ways Exelon is working to embrace and advance the future of the energy industry. The Expo is also an excellent opportunity for our employees across the company to share ideas, explore new technologies, drive collaboration and push each other to do even better for our customers. 
On Slide 20, Exelon culture is also built on serving our communities, both externally and internally. We accomplished a lot on this front during the quarter and several awards really do stand out. First, Exelon is being added to the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which recognizes companies that spend over $1 billion with Tier 1 diverse and minority-owned suppliers. In 2016, we spent nearly $2 million with these important partners. We're only 1 of 27 companies to be named to the roundtable and the only utility or energy company. I expressly want to thank Bill [indiscernible] and Bridget Reedy for their leadership on expanding our supplier base to benefit our communities. For the first time, Points of Light named us as -- named us to the civic 50, which recognizes the 50 most community-minded public and private companies in the United States. Our company strives ever day to better serve our communities. So this award is especially gratifying. We're also named to Diversity Inc's top 50 companies for diversity, come adding to our previous position as the best utility. We embrace utility -- we embrace diversity in all forms, so this represents an important distinction for our company. 
On Slide 21, the value proposition. We once again want to reiterate our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to the investors. We continue to grow the utility rate base at 6.5% annually through 2020 and regulated EPS by 6% to 8% annually through 2020 through capital investments that directly benefit our customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use the free cash flow generated at ExGen to fund incremental utility needs at the utilities of $2.5 billion and paid down approximately $3 billion of debt over the next 4 years at ExGen and the holding companies. We're focused on optimizing the value for our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the gen 2 load matching strategy. We will continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics and growing our dividend in a consistent visible manner. So I'd like to thank you all for joining again and for your interest, and now we're ready to take questions."

And so that they talk to politicians and they say why would you take a tough a vote on this only to have it overturned in the court. So these decisions resolve that issue, and we expect as these decisions get solidified in the appellate courts that it'll provide additional catalyst for those discussions in other states."

And what that allows us to do is much greater flexibility on where we focus our debt retirement plans. So I think you'll see us, depending on maturities, look at both the holding company as well as ExGen for future retirements. And it obviously gives us a much greater degree of visibility uncertainty around of cash flows, which I think plays into Chris response in the valuation. We would expect that the valuation metrics for our generation company reflect the reduced productivity that's associated with these important assets."

We are pleased to deliver another good quarter.

We are pleased to deliver another good quarter. We achieved strong financial results while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make significant gains on the policy front. 
I'll begin by highlighting our financial performance and then briefly discuss some of the key policy and strategic objectives that are top of mind of many of you and us. Joe Dominguez will then cover in more detail the status of our recent wins in New York and Illinois as well as our thoughts on potential PJM market reforms. Jack will walk you through the numbers.
As shown on Slide 5, on a GAAP basis, in the second quarter, we earned $0.09 per share versus $0.29 last year. On an operating basis, we earned $0.54 per share versus $0.65 last year, which is near the top of our $0.45 to $0.55 guidance range. These are strong results relative to our expectations and led by ExGen. 
Moving to Slide 6. We continue to execute very well operationally with the second quarter extending some of the best-evers. On our color block chart -- shows key operating and customer satisfaction benchmarks for the utilities. Legacy Exelon Utilities again remained almost entirely in the first quartile, BGE and ComEd achieving first decile in CAIDI performance. BGE also delivered its best-ever SAIFI and CAIDI performance, and ComEd experienced its best-ever SAIFI performance. 
And I'm proud to say that Pepco was identified in the JD Power study as one of the most improved utilities in customer satisfaction from 2016 to 2017. This is a great achievement and shows we're delivering on our commitments to our customers. The scale of Exelon utilities' platform, again, significantly benefited our customers in the second quarter. We leveraged our management model and our geographic overlap to deliver better and faster service, particularly in the East. 
For example, in May, we dispatched Delmarva and PECO crews to assist BGE with the restoration of a multiday natural gas outage that affected customers in West Baltimore. The assistance provided by the other crews not only helped to reduce the outage time by a full day but also allowed BGE to operate the balance of the system safely with 100% gas odor response during the outage. We're glad to see our customers are benefiting from the Exelon utility platform. 
The nuclear team also had a great quarter. They achieved 90.9% capacity factor and completed 6 refueling outages. Nine Mile 1 registered its shortest outage duration on record. 
In the power business, our assets performed well. Our 2 new Texas CCGTs, about 2,200 megawatts, are now online and fully operational. These plants are state of the art and able to ramp up quickly to better serve the load that may come with the hot summer weather in Texas. 
Moving to Slide 7. We have seen several key developments in markets and regulatory matters. We had significant wins on the ZEC programs. As many of you already know, we prevailed on our motions to dismiss in both Illinois and New York with both judges finding in favor on standing in legal matters. These wins are strong affirmations of the ZEC program design. More importantly, these wins will support the continued operation of at-risk nuclear plants providing clean affordable energy for our customers for many years to come. Needless to say, we're pleased  with the results. Joe Dominguez will cover more of the details in a few minutes. 
With respect to PHI, we wrapped up our first cycle of rate cases as part of Exelon with the D.C. order last week. Jack will discuss in more detail, but we're happy with the progress we're making at PHI operationally and on the regulatory front. We are pleased that, in July, the D.C. Court of Appeals affirmed the D.C. commission approval of the PHI merger resolving an open item. 
PJM capacity results were announced on May 23 in all of our nuclear plants, and PJM cleared the auction except Quad Cities and Three Mile Island. The RPM results show considerable variability by year in the RTO zone. However, our disciplined bidding approach in recent years continues to provide greater stability and realized capacity revenues, which Jack will discuss shortly. 
With Three Mile Island failing to clear the PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive auction, we came to the difficult decision to close the plant in September 2019 at the end of the next fuel cycle. A program that fairly compensates the plants for zero-emission energy similar to what we have seen in New York and Illinois is needed in order to continue operations. 
It's important to note that the economic challenges facing TMI impact all nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. We remain hopeful that the state policymakers can find a solution that preserves these important assets. The total Pennsylvania nuclear fleet injects $2 billion into the state's economy each year and supports 1,600 direct and indirect jobs. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Dominguez, who will provide some details on ZEC challenges and other items."

As Chris said, I'm going to cover the ZEC rulings, the current status of ZEC legislative efforts in other states, the DOE study and PJM operational and market reforms. Let me start with the court cases. Obviously,",1315,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everybody. As Chris said, I'm going to cover the ZEC rulings, the current status of ZEC legislative efforts in other states, the DOE study and PJM operational and market reforms. 
Let me start with the court cases. Obviously, we're very pleased  with the decisions in the district courts. The Illinois District Court decision has been appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. We expect the New York court's decision to be appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
I want to make a couple of points about why we are very confident in the ultimate outcome of those cases. First, the district court decided these cases at a very preliminary stage, where as a legal matter, the courts had to assume all the facts that the plaintiffs pled were accurate. Those facts were not accurate, but even under the plaintiff's versions of the case, the courts found that they had no legal claim whatsoever. 
Second, as you may know, oftentimes, where a party prevails in a case on a procedural or standing issue, the court will not proceed to decide the substantive legal issues. That wasn't the case here. In both decisions, the District Courts rejected the entire waterfront of the plaintiff's claims beyond the substantive and procedural -- through the substantive and procedural issues. I think that speaks to how high a hill they will need to climb on appeal to reverse those decisions. 
At the heart of it, the decisions reject the plaintiff's arguments that state policies that favor cleaner sources of generation violate federal wholesale markets. The district court for the Southern District of New York summed it up this way: It said that competing generators have no complaint that they don't qualify for state programs because ""they made business decisions about how they generate electricity."" 
Policymakers and customers increasingly want reliable low-cost zero-emission electricity. That's what do we do at Exelon. The ZEC policies begin to recognize that nuclear energy plays an important role in meeting those customer needs, and we're going to continue to advance that argument in Pennsylvania and other states. We're actively developing coalitions, and we're working with policymakers to educate them on the issues. And as Chris said, the issues don't just face TMI but the entire nuclear industry as a whole and the entire industry, of course, in Pennsylvania. 
Now let me be clear, we're not just working on ZEC issues. We don't think that's the only approach. We have said for a long time that we think that the best market outcome is the price attributes directly into the market, in the case of greenhouse gases, price on carbon. And it's more clear to us now than ever that federal wholesale markets need to evolve to fully incorporate attributes like resiliency, fuel diversity and environmental qualities of the generation resources. If the markets don't evolve, then the markets are going to have a diminished role in energy policy going forward. 
I know that in the past we've fielded questions on these calls about whether, as a company, we remain committed to markets. We are committed, but the markets have to be well functioning. Our commitment to markets only extends so far as it provides the best outcomes for our customers. 
We have said for years that the markets have problems. Those problems are undisputed. We have had many workshops at FERC and other places talking about price formation as an example, yet those issues have remained unresolved and the consequence has been that some of the most valuable resources for our customers are being forced out by a market that hasn't been working. That's why we feel confident that the DOE study and a reconstituted quorum at FERC is going to address some of these longstanding issues. 
Now let me talk about the study and some of the PJM market reforms that I'm hinting at here. As you know, the study has been worked on for a number of months. Everybody wants to see it. We hope to see it at some point in time this month. We think that it is going to focus on baseload resources on the critical role of nuclear and the critical role of other fuel sources that have resilient on-site fuel. We think that the DOE study is important because it will frame the objectives for the administration for the next 4 years, and we think it's going to be an important signpost to inform the agenda at FERC. 
Here's what we hope to see in the report: First, we want to see a recognition of the value of nuclear and an appreciation of the state programs in Illinois, New York and the other places that are going to adopt these programs. Let me be specific. We expect the FERC to respect those programs and not to tamper with the functioning. There are a couple of MOPR complaints that need to be addressed. The ISOs do not support those complaints, but that is on the docket and ready for action by a new FERC, and we have talked to the Department of Energy about those issues, and we've had productive conversations. 
The second issue is that we need to look at the market design changes that have been long pending. As many of you know, PJM has recently put out a whitepaper on this issue, talking about energy price formation primarily in the off-peak hours and the need for all forms of generation to be able to set price. From our perspective, this is a very important issue, and we appreciate PJM's time line, which calls for a FERC filing sometime in the first quarter of 2018 and full implementation of the market reforms by the summer of '18. We're going to push very hard to make sure that happens. 
Third, we hope the Department of Energy puts a spotlight on the issue of resiliency. Let me spend a moment talking about that. We have talked about reliability in the form of being able to run the system even in an event that we have major components, electrical components that failed. But as increasingly, the system depends on both intermittent generation and natural gas fire generation that don't have the ability to secure fuel for long-term operations. We need to be -- we need to make sure that our customers get electricity even in the event of a long-term disruption of the natural gas pipeline system. That's something that currently is not being modeled and needs to be modeled. 
So PJM has recently put out a whitepaper on this subject with a schedule of activities. The first activity is to address operational reserves beginning this winter. Importantly, that doesn't require any FERC activity or any stakeholder support. That within the tariff is within PJM's full province, and again, we are pushing to make sure these things are done. That's an important start and should begin to be reflected in pricing this winter for baseload resources that provide the kind of resiliency that I'm talking about. 
But that's not the end of this subject. We have to, as an industry and as a country, come to grips with this potential risk to our system and examine the possibility of multiple pipeline failures. And the policies that come from that should favor fuel generation sources that have on-site fuel like nuclear plants that could run for a year or 2 in the event of these emergencies. 
So we're going to continue to focus on that, and those are the -- really the 3 areas that we're hoping that the DOE will provide some guidance on. So obviously, we have a lot going on in policy space. We're making very good progress, but a lot of work remains to be done. 
I look forward to taking your questions after Jack concludes his part of the presentation."
296181,532038670,1263925,"Exelon Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter.",1764,"Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter. 
On Slide 9, as Chris mentioned earlier, we had a strong second quarter financially and operationally across the company. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.54 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. Exelon's utilities less holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.33 per share. Relative to plan, utility results were slightly favorable, primarily driven by O&M timing across all of the utilities. 
Generation earned $0.22 per share in the second quarter. This was favorable versus the plan, driven by the timing of O&M and realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trusts. Our nuclear plants had another strong quarter with higher capacity factors than budgeted, and the constellation team continued to deliver strong results with good customer wins. 
Turning to Slide 10. The $0.54 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2016. Overall, the utilities benefited from increased rates and higher rate base partly offset by year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the known impacts of lower power price realization and more planned refueling outages, partly offset by New York ZEC revenues. 
On Slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $1.19 per share are $0.14 per share lower than the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the New York ZEC revenues with partial offsets from our utilities with higher rates supporting our ongoing reliability investments and a full year contribution from PHI. 
Turning to Slide 12. We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share in the third quarter compared with $0.91 per share last year. Our third quarter results will include a full quarter of contributions from the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. 
In Illinois, the ZEC program went into effect on June 1, but the ICC has yet to conduct its ZEC procurement process. It's anticipated that the procurement event and the execution of contracts with winning ZEC suppliers will occur in the fourth quarter. Therefore, no revenues will be recognized until that process concludes. We would then include all of the Illinois ZEC revenues retroactive to June 1. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our utilities continue to execute, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter in addition to strong customer-focused operational performance. Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, at PHI, we saw some of the utilities register lower trailing ROEs relative to what we showed last quarter. The degradation was expected primarily due to the timing of equity infusions that Exelon made into PHI in 2016 following the merger close. 
For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remain over 10%, lifting the consolidated Exelon utilities' platform to nearly 10%, including PHI. We still have work to do with the utilities to continue improving the product we're delivering to our customers, but we're happy with where the overall business is performing. As we've said before, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the plan that we put in place at PHI. 
On Slide 14, we update the status of our rate cases. Since our first quarter call, the unanimous settlements in Delmarva Delaware electric and gas cases were approved with a combined revenue increase of $36 million. We also received the commission decision in the Pepco D.C. rate case during the quarter with a revenue increase of $37 million. 
We've now completed our first cycle of planned rate cases in the PHI jurisdictions with the second cycle already underway. We filed rate cases at ACE and Pepco Maryland last quarter and just recently filed again at Delmarva Maryland during the second quarter. Combined, we are currently asking for $168 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland in the fourth quarter of this year and decisions on ACE and Delmarva Maryland in the first quarter of 2018. 
We plan to file second rate cases in the remaining PHI jurisdictions later in 2017 and expect to have them resolved by the end of 2018, helping to put us in a position to earn our targeted ROEs in 2019. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's revenues and earned ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on slides 35 through 42 in the Appendix. 
Turning to Slide 15. The PJM base residual auction results were announced in May. We cleared 16.2 gigawatts of capacity in the auction with the bulk of our capacity clearing in the ComEd and Eastern MAAC zones, which cleared above the rest of RTO, pricing at $188 per megawatt day. We continue to follow a disciplined approach to bidding our plants based on their specific cost profiles. We believe this bidding discipline is the right strategy for our plants and has led to more stability in our capacity revenue streams than seen in other generators that have not been as disciplined. 
Our Three Mile Island nuclear plant failed to clear in the PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive year with this auction. We've been losing both cash and earnings at the plant in recent years and do not see a path to profitability as the market backdrop exists today. Accordingly, earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to retire the plant in the fall of 2019. We're engaged with stakeholders in Pennsylvania to find ways to preserve the plant, but we're still early in that process. 
From a financial perspective, the closure will add $0.04 to $0.07 per share of EPS annually beyond 2019, depending on the refueling year. We expect to realize positive cumulative cash flows of approximately $225 million through 2021 with the closure. 
Slide 16 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generation to load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased in the second quarter by $150 million in 2018 due to the removal of EGTP from the portfolio as well as the impacts of lower-capacity revenues in MISO and New York. Total gross margin in 2019 is down $150 million from last quarter, driven by the removal of EGTP from the portfolio and the forecasted closer of TMI in September of 2019. 
Let me be clear that although gross margin is down due to the divestiture of EGTP and planned closure of TMI, the impacts of both are accretive to EPS and cash flow. The elimination of EGTP lowers gross margin by roughly $100 million in 2018 and 2019 but is EPS accretive by $0.02 to $0.03 per share in each of those years. So there are cost offsets you should consider. 
And while we do not expect to close TMI until the fall of 2019, the retirement lowers our 2019 gross margin by roughly $50 million, although the EPS impact is roughly $0.05 positive. And as I said earlier, the retirement will be $0.04 to $0.07 EPS accretive annually beyond 2019, depending on the refueling year. 
From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and $0.08 to $0.11 behind -- 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align with our fundamental view of spot market upside in NiHub. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. 
Turning to Slide 17. On the topic of power market forwards, you have heard us and many others talk about the reduced liquidity in the forward power curves that arguably can create price distortions. We do not mean for this chart to be comprehensive, but it's illustrative of what has been happening in the forward power markets. The top chart shows the volumes traded on a cumulative 2- and 5-year forward period for PJM West on peak power using a 6-month average to smooth some of the seasonal volatility. 
I would flag in this context that, overall -- I would flag in this context that overall volumes have been on a pretty consistent decline, both in absolute terms and particularly when looking beyond 2 years, which can be seen in the narrowing of the 2 lines on the chart. 
Arguably, more interesting, when thinking about forward power price transparency, is the amount of transactions in those years. Looking at the lower-right chart, prompt year volumes are over 71% of the 5-year cumulative volumes with 2019 representing another 23%. The volumes traded in 2020 and beyond are only 6% of the total volumes with 2021 nearly nonexistent. Compared to last year, total volumes are lower, and the amount of volumes in the out-years is even less. 
We wanted to share some of this data with you, particularly as folks are thinking more about the roll forward of 2020 earnings estimates. We would note that our fundamentals group has a more constructive view on power markets than these illiquid forward curves suggest, but we appreciate that there is perceived safety in using the forwards. However, when running your numbers, we would just encourage you all to appreciate what is underpinning those forward prices. 
Turning to Slide 18. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade rating. We have now removed EGTP from our credit metrics, which, in turn, has improved our consolidated net debt to EBITDA at year-end 2017 to 2.9x, which is below our target of 3x. If we focus only on recourse debt, our leverage is at 2.5x EBITDA. We're pleased with the improvements in our balance sheet, and we'll continue to focus on a combination of debt paydown between ExGen and the holding company. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

In closing, I'd like to remind you all that Exelon's success is a direct result of our people and the culture of performance and service that we've created as an organization. 
In June, we held our sixth Exelon Innovation Expo in Washington, D.C. This annual event brings together employees, vendors and other key stakeholders to share all the ways Exelon is working to embrace and advance the future of the energy industry. The Expo is also an excellent opportunity for our employees across the company to share ideas, explore new technologies, drive collaboration and push each other to do even better for our customers. 
On Slide 20, Exelon culture is also built on serving our communities, both externally and internally. We accomplished a lot on this front during the quarter, and several awards really do stand out. First, Exelon is being added to the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which recognizes companies that spend over $1 billion with Tier 1 diverse and minority-owned suppliers. In 2016, we spent nearly $2 million with these important partners. We're only 1 of 27 companies to be named to the roundtable and the only utility or energy company. I especially 
want to thank Bill Von Hoene and Bridget Reidy for their leadership on expanding our supplier base to benefit our communities. 
For the first time, Points of Light named us as -- named us to the Civic 50, which recognizes the 50 most community-minded public and private companies in the United States. Our company strives ever day to better serve our communities, so this award is especially gratifying. We're also named to DiversityInc's top 50 companies for diversity, adding to our previous position as the best utility. We embrace utility -- we embrace diversity in all forms, so this represents an important distinction for our company. 
On Slide 21, the value proposition. We once again want to reiterate our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to the investors. We continue to grow the utility rate base at 6.5% annually through 2020 and regulated EPS by 6% to 8% annually through 2020 through capital investments that directly benefit our customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use the free cash flow generated at ExGen to fund incremental utility needs at the utilities of $2.5 billion and pay down approximately $3 billion of debt over the next 4 years at ExGen and the holding companies. 
We're focused on optimizing the value for our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt-reduction plans and maximizing value through the gen-to-load matching strategy. We will continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics and growing our dividend in a consistent, visible manner. 
So I'd like to thank you all for joining again and for your interest, and now we're ready to take questions."

We felt we're at a prove-me state on PHI that not only do we have to integrate them successfully into our management model and drive the performance to our operational standards that we've set at the other Exelon utilities but also achieve what is a fair and reasonable recovery on rate cases, and we're executing on that now. And I think we're proving ourselves, and we think that, that should be translated into a more reasonable valuation, not only at the utility level but at the ExGen level. So we'll strive to continue to really achieve some lofty goals and secure what we think is solid revenues and be able to reinvest those revenues into creating greater returns for the investors."

So we should see those come to strong fruition over the next year to 2, and we'd like to see the compensation for it. We also believe that we're doing a really great job on what we've committed to, to the customers around reliability and service at all our utilities in gaining fair returns, catching up a little bit on the PHI utilities, and productive rate cases should also be a catalyst for achieving a better multiple on the EPS. So next couple years, we should be where we're at -- where we want to be at."

And it's -- we understand the decision that's been made to not go forward with the risks that they still have around it and the financial burdens it would create for the customers. So that's one thing. The -- if you look at what we're talking about with our nuclear assets, they are definitely providing a product and a service unlike any other generating assets. Not only is it the reliability that we load at core for 18 to 24 months and they can run through any weather cycle and are not dependent on a fuel delivery that allows a baseload generation, a level of reliability to the system, the compensation that should be sought and granted for their environmental benefits to the communities they serve, an example of Illinois' power stack, 60% of the power in Illinois is carbon free. 90% of that comes from the nuclear facilities. It allows the state to make its goals that it wants to make on carbon reduction. And without these assets being fairly compensated, that would go in the opposite direction. And finally, these assets that do provide the societal benefit around carbon and the societal benefit around reliability and sustainable national security, they also are great economic supporters of the communities they serve, the tax basis for the schools, the parks, the employment base. So on many levels, they've been evaluated as critical and should be compensated for the lifespan that they have remaining to provide a bridge to what could be that source of energy that provides that same level of the great attributes going forward."

We are pleased to deliver another good quarter.

We are pleased to deliver another good quarter. We achieved strong financial results while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make significant gains on the policy front. 
I'll begin by highlighting our financial performance and then briefly discuss some of the key policy and strategic objectives that are top of mind of many of you and us. Joe Dominguez will then cover in more detail the status of our recent wins in New York and Illinois as well as our thoughts on potential PJM market reforms. Jack will walk you through the numbers.
As shown on Slide 5, on a GAAP basis, in the second quarter, we earned $0.09 per share versus $0.29 last year. On an operating basis, we earned $0.54 per share versus $0.65 last year, which is near the top of our $0.45 to $0.55 guidance range. These are strong results relative to our expectations and led by ExGen. 
Moving to Slide 6. We continue to execute very well operationally with the second quarter extending some of the best-evers. On our color block chart -- shows key operating and customer satisfaction benchmarks for the utilities. Legacy Exelon Utilities again remained almost entirely in the first quartile, BGE and ComEd achieving first decile in CAIDI performance. BGE also delivered its best-ever SAIFI and CAIDI performance, and ComEd experienced its best-ever SAIFI performance. 
And I'm proud to say that Pepco was identified in the J.D. Power study as one of the most improved utilities in customer satisfaction from 2016 to 2017. This is a great achievement and shows we're delivering on our commitments to our customers. 
The scale of Exelon utilities' platform, again, significantly benefited our customers in the second quarter. We leveraged our management model and our geographic overlap to deliver better and faster service, particularly in the East. 
For example, in May, we dispatched Delmarva and PECO crews to assist BGE with the restoration of a multiday natural gas outage that affected customers in West Baltimore. The assistance provided by the other crews not only helped to reduce the outage time by a full day but also allowed BGE to operate the balance of the system safely with 100% gas odor response during the outage. We're glad to see our customers are benefiting from the Exelon utility platform. 
The nuclear team also had a great quarter. They achieved 90.9% capacity factor and completed 6 refueling outages. Nine Mile 1 registered its shortest outage duration on record. 
In the power business, our assets performed well. Our 2 new Texas CCGTs, about 2,200 megawatts, are now online and fully operational. These plants are state of the art and able to ramp up quickly to better serve the load that may come with the hot summer weather in Texas. 
Moving to Slide 7. We have seen several key developments in markets and regulatory matters. We had significant wins on the ZEC programs. As many of you already know, we prevailed on our motions to dismiss in both Illinois and New York, with both judges finding in favor on standing and legal merits. These wins are strong affirmations of the ZEC program design. More importantly, these wins will support the continued operation of at-risk nuclear plants providing clean, affordable energy for our customers for many years to come. Needless to say, we're pleased with the results. Joe Dominguez will cover more of the details in a few minutes. 
With respect to PHI, we wrapped up our first cycle of rate cases as part of Exelon with the D.C. order last week. Jack will discuss in more detail, but we're happy with the progress we're making at PHI operationally and on the regulatory front. We are pleased that, in July, the D.C. Court of Appeals affirmed the D.C. commission approval of the PHI merger resolving an open item. 
PJM capacity results were announced on May 23 in all of our nuclear plants, and PJM cleared the auction except Quad Cities and Three Mile Island. The RPM results show considerable variability by year in the RTO zone. However, our disciplined bidding approach in recent years continues to provide greater stability and realized capacity revenues, which Jack will discuss shortly. 
With Three Mile Island failing to clear the PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive auction, we came to the difficult decision to close the plant in September 2019, at the end of the next fuel cycle. A program that fairly compensates the plants for its zero-emission energy, similar to what we have seen in New York and Illinois, is needed in order to continue operations. 
It's important to note that the economic challenges facing TMI impact all nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. We remain hopeful that the state policymakers can find a solution that preserves these important assets. The total Pennsylvania nuclear fleet injects $2 billion into the state's economy each year and supports 1,600 direct and indirect jobs. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Dominguez, who will provide some details on ZEC challenges and other items."
296181,532038670,1264103,"Exelon Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everybody. As Chris said, I'm going to cover the ZEC rulings, the current status of ZEC legislative efforts in other states, the DOE study and PJM operational and market reforms. Let me start with the court cases. Obviously,",1314,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everybody. As Chris said, I'm going to cover the ZEC rulings, the current status of ZEC legislative efforts in other states, the DOE study and PJM operational and market reforms. 
Let me start with the court cases. Obviously, we're very pleased with the decisions in the district courts. The Illinois District Court decision has been appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. We expect the New York court's decision to be appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
I want to make a couple of points about why we are very confident in the ultimate outcome of those cases. First, the district court decided these cases at a very preliminary stage, where, as a legal matter, the courts had to assume all the facts that the plaintiffs pled were accurate. Those facts were not accurate, but even under the plaintiff's versions of the case, the courts found that they had no legal claim whatsoever. 
Second, as you may know, oftentimes, where a party prevails in a case on a procedural or standing issue, the court will not proceed to decide the substantive legal issues. That wasn't the case here. In both decisions, the district courts rejected the entire waterfront of the plaintiff's claims beyond the substantive and procedural -- through the substantive and procedural issues. I think that speaks to how high a hill they will need to climb on appeal to reverse those decisions. 
At the heart of it, the decisions reject the plaintiff's arguments that state policies that favor cleaner sources of generation violate federal wholesale markets. The district court for the Southern District of New York summed it up this way: It said that competing generators have no complaint that they don't qualify for state programs because ""they made business decisions about how they generate electricity."" 
Policymakers and customers increasingly want reliable low-cost zero-emission electricity. That's what do we do at Exelon. The ZEC policies begin to recognize that nuclear energy plays an important role in meeting those customer needs, and we're going to continue to advance that argument in Pennsylvania and other states. We're actively developing coalitions, and we're working with policymakers to educate them on the issues. And as Chris said, the issues don't just face TMI but the entire nuclear industry as a whole and the entire industry, of course, in Pennsylvania. 
Let me be clear, we're not just working on ZEC issues. We don't think that's the only approach. We have said for a long time that we think that the best market outcome is the price attributes directly into the market, in the case of greenhouse gases, price on carbon. And it's more clear to us now than ever that federal wholesale markets need to evolve to fully incorporate attributes like resiliency, fuel diversity and environmental qualities of the generation resources. If the markets don't evolve, then the markets are going to have a diminished role in energy policy going forward. 
I know that in the past we've fielded questions on these calls about whether, as a company, we remain committed to markets. We are committed, but the markets have to be well functioning. Our commitment to markets only extends so far as it provides the best outcomes for our customers. 
We have said for years that the markets have problems. Those problems are undisputed. We have had many workshops at FERC and other places talking about price formation as an example, yet those issues have remained unresolved and the consequence has been that some of the most valuable resources for our customers are being forced out by a market that hasn't been working. That's why we feel confident that the DOE study and a reconstituted quorum at FERC is going to address some of these longstanding issues. 
Now let me talk about the study and some of the PJM market reforms that I'm hinting at here. As you know, the study has been worked on for a number of months. Everybody wants to see it. We hope to see it at some point in time this month. We think that it is going to focus on baseload resources, on the critical role of nuclear and the critical role of other fuel sources that have resilient on-site fuel. We think that the DOE study is important because it will frame the objectives for the administration for the next 4 years, and we think it's going to be an important signpost to inform the agenda at FERC. 
Here's what we hope to see in the report: First, we want to see a recognition of the value of nuclear and an appreciation of the state programs in Illinois, New York and the other places that are going to adopt these programs. Let me be specific. We expect the FERC to respect those programs and not to tamper with the functioning. There are a couple of MOPR complaints that need to be addressed. The ISOs do not support those complaints, but that is on the docket and ready for action by a new FERC, and we have talked to the Department of Energy about those issues, and we've had productive conversations. 
The second issue is that we need to look at the market design changes that have been long pending. As many of you know, PJM has recently put out a whitepaper on this issue, talking about energy price formation primarily in the off-peak hours and the need for all forms of generation to be able to set price. From our perspective, this is a very important issue, and we appreciate PJM's time line, which calls for a FERC filing sometime in the first quarter of 2018 and full implementation of the market reforms by the summer of '18. We're going to push very hard to make sure that happens. 
Third, we hope the Department of Energy puts a spotlight on the issue of resiliency. Let me spend a moment talking about that. We have talked about reliability in the form of being able to run the system even in an event that we had major components, electrical components that failed. But as increasingly the system depends on both intermittent generation and natural gas fire generation that don't have the ability to secure fuel for long-term operations, we need to be -- we need to make sure that our customers get electricity even in the event of a long-term disruption of the natural gas pipeline system. That's something that currently is not being modeled and needs to be modeled. 
So PJM has recently put out a whitepaper on this subject with a schedule of activities. The first activity is to address operational reserves beginning this winter. Importantly, that doesn't require any FERC activity or any stakeholder support. That, within the tariff, is within PJM's full province, and again, we are pushing to make sure these things are done. That's an important start and should begin to be reflected in pricing this winter for baseload resources that provide the kind of resiliency that I'm talking about. 
But that's not the end of this subject. We have to, as an industry and as a country, come to grips with this potential risk to our system and examine the possibility of multiple pipeline failures. And the policies that come from that should favor fuel generation sources that have on-site fuel like nuclear plants that could run for a year or 2 in the event of these emergencies. 
So we're going to continue to focus on that, and those are the -- really the 3 areas that we're hoping that the DOE will provide some guidance on. So obviously, we have a lot going on in policy space. We're making very good progress, but a lot of work remains to be done. 
I look forward to taking your questions after Jack concludes his part of the presentation."

My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter.",1763,"Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter. 
On Slide 9, as Chris mentioned earlier, we had a strong second quarter financially and operationally across the company. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.54 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. Exelon's utilities less holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.33 per share. Relative to plan, utility results were slightly favorable, primarily driven by O&M timing across all of the utilities. 
Generation earned $0.22 per share in the second quarter. This was favorable versus the plan, driven by the timing of O&M and realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trusts. Our nuclear plants had another strong quarter with higher capacity factors than budgeted, and the Constellation team continued to deliver strong results with good customer wins. 
Turning to Slide 10. The $0.54 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2016. Overall, the utilities benefited from increased rates and higher rate base partly offset by year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the known impacts of lower power price realization and more planned refueling outages, partly offset by New York ZEC revenues. 
On Slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $1.19 per share are $0.14 per share lower than the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the New York ZEC revenues, with partial offsets from our utilities with higher rates supporting our ongoing reliability investments and a full year contribution from PHI. 
Turning to Slide 12. We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share in the third quarter compared with $0.91 per share last year. Our third quarter results will include a full quarter of contributions from the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. 
In Illinois, the ZEC program went into effect on June 1, but the ICC has yet to conduct its ZEC procurement process. It's anticipated that the procurement event and the execution of contracts with winning ZEC suppliers will occur in the fourth quarter. Therefore, no revenues will be recognized until that process concludes. We would then include all of the Illinois ZEC revenues retroactive to June 1. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our utilities continue to execute, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter in addition to strong customer-focused operational performance. Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, at PHI, we saw some of the utilities register lower trailing ROEs relative to what we showed last quarter. The degradation was expected primarily due to the timing of equity infusions that Exelon made into PHI in 2016 following the merger close. 
For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remain over 10%, lifting the consolidated Exelon utilities' platform to nearly 10%, including PHI. We still have work to do with the utilities to continue improving the product we're delivering to our customers, but we're happy with where the overall business is performing. As we've said before, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the plan that we put in place at PHI. 
On Slide 14, we update the status of our rate cases. Since our first quarter call, the unanimous settlements in Delmarva Delaware electric and gas cases were approved, with a combined revenue increase of $36 million. We also received a commission decision in the Pepco D.C. rate case during the quarter, with a revenue increase of $37 million. 
We've now completed our first cycle of planned rate cases in the PHI jurisdictions with the second cycle already underway. We filed rate cases at ACE and Pepco Maryland last quarter and just recently filed again at Delmarva Maryland during the second quarter. Combined, we are currently asking for $168 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland in the fourth quarter of this year and decisions on ACE and Delmarva Maryland in the first quarter of 2018. 
We plan to file second rate cases in the remaining PHI jurisdictions later in 2017 and expect to have them resolved by the end of 2018, helping to put us in a position to earn our targeted ROEs in 2019. 
We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's revenues and earned ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on slides 35 through 42 in the Appendix. 
Turning to Slide 15. The PJM base residual auction results were announced in May. We cleared 16.2 gigawatts of capacity in the auction with the bulk of our capacity clearing in the ComEd and Eastern MAAC zones, which cleared above the rest of RTO, pricing at $188 per megawatt day. We continue to follow a disciplined approach to bidding our plants based on their specific cost profiles. We believe this bidding discipline is the right strategy for our plants and has led to more stability in our capacity revenue streams than seen in other generators that have not been as disciplined. 
Our Three Mile Island nuclear plant failed to clear in the PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive year with this auction. We've been losing both cash and earnings at the plant in recent years and do not see a path to profitability as the market backdrop exists today. Accordingly, earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to retire the plant in the fall of 2019. We're engaged with stakeholders in Pennsylvania to find ways to preserve the plant, but we're still early in that process. 
From a financial perspective, the closure will add $0.04 to $0.07 per share of EPS annually beyond 2019, depending on the refueling year. We expect to realize positive cumulative cash flows of approximately $225 million through 2021 with the closure. 
Slide 16 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generation to load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased in the second quarter by $150 million in 2018 due to the removal of EGTP from the portfolio as well as the impacts of lower-capacity revenues in MISO and New York. Total gross margin in 2019 is down $150 million from last quarter, driven by the removal of EGTP from the portfolio and the forecasted closure of TMI in September of 2019. 
Let me be clear that although gross margin is down due to the divestiture of EGTP and planned closure of TMI, the impacts of both are accretive to EPS and cash flow. The elimination of EGTP lowers gross margin by roughly $100 million in 2018 and 2019 but is EPS accretive by $0.02 to $0.03 per share in each of those years. So there are cost offsets you should consider. 
And while we do not expect to close TMI until the fall of 2019, the retirement lowers our 2019 gross margin by roughly $50 million, although the EPS impact is roughly $0.05 positive. And as I said earlier, the retirement will be $0.04 to $0.07 EPS accretive annually beyond 2019, depending on the refueling year. 
From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and $0.08 to $0.11 behind -- 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align with our fundamental view of spot market upside in NiHub. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. 
Turning to Slide 17. On the topic of power market forwards, you have heard us and many others talk about the reduced liquidity in the forward power curves that arguably can create price distortions. We do not mean for this chart to be comprehensive, but it's illustrative of what has been happening in the forward power markets. The top chart shows the volumes traded on a cumulative 2- and 5-year forward period for PJM West on-peak power using a 6-month average to smooth some of the seasonal volatility. 
I would flag in this context that, overall -- I would flag in this context that overall volumes have been on a pretty consistent decline, both in absolute terms and particularly when looking beyond 2 years, which can be seen in the narrowing of the 2 lines on the chart. 
Arguably, more interesting, when thinking about forward power price transparency, is the amount of transactions in those years. Looking at the lower-right chart, prompt year volumes are over 71% of the 5-year cumulative volumes, with 2019 representing another 23%. The volumes traded in 2020 and beyond are only 6% of the total volumes, with 2021 nearly nonexistent. Compared to last year, total volumes are lower, and the amount of volumes in the out-years is even less. 
We wanted to share some of this data with you, particularly as folks are thinking more about the roll forward of 2020 earnings estimates. We would note that our fundamentals group has a more constructive view on power markets than these illiquid forward curves suggest, but we appreciate that there is perceived safety in using the forwards. However, when running your numbers, we would just encourage you all to appreciate what is underpinning those forward prices. 
Turning to Slide 18. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade rating. We have now removed EGTP from our credit metrics, which, in turn, has improved our consolidated net debt to EBITDA at year-end 2017 to 2.9x, which is below our target of 3x. If we focus only on recourse debt, our leverage is at 2.5x EBITDA. We're pleased with the improvements in our balance sheet, and will continue to focus on a combination of debt paydown between ExGen and the holding company. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

In closing, I'd like to remind you all that Exelon's success is a direct result of our people and the culture of performance and service that we've created as an organization.

In closing, I'd like to remind you all that Exelon's success is a direct result of our people and the culture of performance and service that we've created as an organization. 
In June, we held our sixth Exelon Innovation Expo in Washington, D.C. This annual event brings together employees, vendors and other key stakeholders to share all the ways Exelon is working to embrace and advance the future of the energy industry. The Expo is also an excellent opportunity for our employees across the company to share ideas, explore new technologies, drive collaboration and push each other to do even better for our customers. 
On Slide 20, Exelon culture is also built on serving our communities, both externally and internally. We accomplished a lot on this front during the quarter, and several awards really do stand out. First, Exelon is being added to the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which recognizes companies that spend over $1 billion with Tier 1 diverse and minority-owned suppliers. In 2016, we spent nearly $2 million with these important partners. We are only 1 of 27 companies to be named to the roundtable and the only utility or energy company. I especially want to thank Bill Von Hoene and Bridget Reidy for their leadership on expanding our supplier base to benefit our communities. 
For the first time, Points of Light named us as -- named us to the Civic 50, which recognizes the 50 most community-minded public and private companies in the United States. Our company strives every day to better serve our communities, so this award is especially gratifying. 
We're also named to DiversityInc's top 50 companies for diversity, adding to our previous position as the best utility. We embrace utility -- we embrace diversity in all forms, so this represents an important distinction for our company. 
On Slide 21, the value proposition. We once again want to reiterate our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to the investors. We continue to grow the utility rate base at 6.5% annually through 2020 and regulated EPS by 6% to 8% annually through 2020 through capital investments that directly benefit our customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use the free cash flow generated at ExGen to fund incremental utility needs at the utilities of $2.5 billion and pay down approximately $3 billion of debt over the next 4 years at ExGen and the holding companies. 
We're focused on optimizing the value for our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt-reduction plans and maximizing value through the gen-to-load matching strategy. We will continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics and growing our dividend in a consistent, visible manner. 
So I'd like to thank you all for joining again and for your interest, and now we're ready to take questions."

So bringing -- having a free cash flow machine that's being given more certainty on its capabilities by programs like the ZEC and the fantastic work that Constellation achieves through the margins that they create, we like what we're doing right now. What we have said in the past is we believe that we're undervalued and that we need to be seeing that value increase in the market as we make these accomplishments. We felt we're at a prove-me state on PHI, that not only do we have to integrate them successfully into our management model and drive the performance to our operational standards that we've set at the other Exelon utilities, but also achieve what is a fair and reasonable recovery on rate cases, and we're executing on that now. And I think we're proving ourselves, and we think that, that should be translated into a more reasonable valuation, not only at the utility level but at the ExGen level. So we'll strive to continue to really achieve some lofty goals and secure what we think is solid revenues and be able to reinvest those revenues into creating greater returns for the investors."

So that's one thing. The -- if you look at what we're talking about with our nuclear assets, they are definitely providing a product and a service unlike any other generating assets. Not only is it the reliability that we load at core for 18 to 24 months and they can run through any weather cycle and are not dependent on a fuel delivery that allows a baseload generation, a level of reliability to the system, the compensation that should be sought and granted for their environmental benefits to the communities they serve, an example of Illinois' power stack, 60% of the power in Illinois is carbon free. 90% of that comes from the nuclear facilities. It allows the state to make its goals that it wants to make on carbon reduction. And without these assets being fairly compensated, that would go in the opposite direction, so. And finally, these assets that do provide the societal benefit around carbon and the societal benefit around reliability and sustainable national security, they also are great economic supporters of the communities they serve, the tax basis for the schools, the parks, the employment base.

If we ever found that the value was constrained or our strategic growth was hampered based off of the company's being together, you could have that conversation to create value, but there's no reason that having them together and using the synergies that we have between having the 2 companies, that we shouldn't be valued fairly for that as we execute on our strategic plans.

We are pleased to deliver another good quarter. We achieved strong financial results while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make significant gains on the policy front.",849,"Thanks, Dan, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We are pleased to deliver another good quarter. We achieved strong financial results while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make significant gains on the policy front. 
I'll begin by highlighting our financial performance and then briefly discuss some of the key policy and strategic objectives that are top of mind of many of you and us. Joe Dominguez will then cover in more detail the status of our recent wins in New York and Illinois as well as our thoughts on potential PJM market reforms. Jack will walk you through the numbers.
As shown on Slide 5, on a GAAP basis, in the second quarter, we earned $0.09 per share versus $0.29 last year. On an operating basis, we earned $0.54 per share versus $0.65 last year, which is near the top of our $0.45 to $0.55 guidance range. These are strong results relative to our expectations and led by ExGen. 
Moving to Slide 6. We continue to execute very well operationally with the second quarter extending some of the best-evers. On our color block chart -- shows key operating and customer satisfaction benchmarks for the utilities. Legacy Exelon Utilities again remained almost entirely in the first quartile, BGE and ComEd achieving first decile in CAIDI performance. BGE also delivered its best-ever SAIFI and CAIDI performance, and ComEd experienced its best-ever SAIFI performance. 
And I'm proud to say that Pepco was identified in the J.D. Power study as one of the most improved utilities in customer satisfaction from 2016 to 2017. This is a great achievement and shows we're delivering on our commitments to our customers. 
The scale of Exelon utilities' platform, again, significantly benefited our customers in the second quarter. We leveraged our management model and our geographic overlap to deliver better and faster service, particularly in the East. 
For example, in May, we dispatched Delmarva and PECO crews to assist BGE with the restoration of a multiday natural gas outage that affected customers in West Baltimore. The assistance provided by the other crews not only helped to reduce the outage time by a full day but also allowed BGE to operate the balance of the system safely with 100% gas odor response during the outage. We're glad to see our customers are benefiting from the Exelon utility platform. 
The nuclear team also had a great quarter. They achieved 90.9% capacity factor and completed 6 refueling outages. Nine Mile 1 registered its shortest outage duration on record. 
In the power business, our assets performed well. Our 2 new Texas CCGTs, about 2,200 megawatts, are now online and fully operational. These plants are state of the art and able to ramp up quickly to better serve the load that may come with the hot summer weather in Texas. 
Moving to Slide 7. We have seen several key developments in markets and regulatory matters. We had significant wins on the ZEC programs. As many of you already know, we prevailed on our motions to dismiss in both Illinois and New York, with both judges finding in favor on standing and legal merits. These wins are strong affirmations of the ZEC program design. More importantly, these wins will support the continued operation of at-risk nuclear plants providing clean, affordable energy for our customers for many years to come. Needless to say, we're pleased with the results. Joe Dominguez will cover more of the details in a few minutes. 
With respect to PHI, we wrapped up our first cycle of rate cases as part of Exelon with the D.C. order last week. Jack will discuss in more detail, but we're happy with the progress we're making at PHI operationally and on the regulatory front. We are pleased that, in July, the D.C. Court of Appeals affirmed the D.C. commission approval of the PHI merger resolving an open item. 
PJM capacity results were announced on May 23 in all of our nuclear plants, and PJM cleared the auction except Quad Cities and Three Mile Island. The RPM results show considerable variability by year in the RTO zone. However, our disciplined bidding approach in recent years continues to provide greater stability and realized capacity revenues, which Jack will discuss shortly. 
With Three Mile Island failing to clear the PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive auction, we came to the difficult decision to close the plant in September 2019, at the end of the next fuel cycle. A program that fairly compensates the plants for its zero-emission energy, similar to what we have seen in New York and Illinois, is needed in order to continue operations. 
It's important to note that the economic challenges facing TMI impact all nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. We remain hopeful that the state policymakers can find a solution that preserves these important assets. The total Pennsylvania nuclear fleet injects $2 billion into the state's economy each year and supports 1,600 direct and indirect jobs. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Dominguez, who will provide some details on ZEC challenges and other items."

Let me start with the court cases. Obviously,",1314,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everybody. As Chris said, I'm going to cover the ZEC rulings, the current status of ZEC legislative efforts in other states, the DOE study and PJM operational and market reforms. 
Let me start with the court cases. Obviously, we're very pleased with the decisions in the district courts. The Illinois District Court decision has been appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. We expect the New York court's decision to be appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
I want to make a couple of points about why we are very confident in the ultimate outcome of those cases. First, the district court decided these cases at a very preliminary stage, where, as a legal matter, the courts had to assume all the facts that the plaintiffs pled were accurate. Those facts were not accurate, but even under the plaintiff's versions of the case, the courts found that they had no legal claim whatsoever. 
Second, as you may know, oftentimes, where a party prevails in a case on a procedural or standing issue, the court will not proceed to decide the substantive legal issues. That wasn't the case here. In both decisions, the district courts rejected the entire waterfront of the plaintiff's claims beyond the substantive and procedural -- through the substantive and procedural issues. I think that speaks to how high a hill they will need to climb on appeal to reverse those decisions. 
At the heart of it, the decisions reject the plaintiff's arguments that state policies that favor cleaner sources of generation violate federal wholesale markets. The district court for the Southern District of New York summed it up this way: It said that competing generators have no complaint that they don't qualify for state programs because ""they made business decisions about how they generate electricity."" 
Policymakers and customers increasingly want reliable low-cost zero-emission electricity. That's what do we do at Exelon. The ZEC policies begin to recognize that nuclear energy plays an important role in meeting those customer needs, and we're going to continue to advance that argument in Pennsylvania and other states. We're actively developing coalitions, and we're working with policymakers to educate them on the issues. And as Chris said, the issues don't just face TMI but the entire nuclear industry as a whole and the entire industry, of course, in Pennsylvania. 
Let me be clear, we're not just working on ZEC issues. We don't think that's the only approach. We have said for a long time that we think that the best market outcome is the price attributes directly into the market, in the case of greenhouse gases, price on carbon. And it's more clear to us now than ever that federal wholesale markets need to evolve to fully incorporate attributes like resiliency, fuel diversity and environmental qualities of the generation resources. If the markets don't evolve, then the markets are going to have a diminished role in energy policy going forward. 
I know that in the past we've fielded questions on these calls about whether, as a company, we remain committed to markets. We are committed, but the markets have to be well functioning. Our commitment to markets only extends so far as it provides the best outcomes for our customers. 
We have said for years that the markets have problems. Those problems are undisputed. We have had many workshops at FERC and other places talking about price formation as an example, yet those issues have remained unresolved and the consequence has been that some of the most valuable resources for our customers are being forced out by a market that hasn't been working. That's why we feel confident that the DOE study and a reconstituted quorum at FERC is going to address some of these longstanding issues. 
Now let me talk about the study and some of the PJM market reforms that I'm hinting at here. As you know, the study has been worked on for a number of months. Everybody wants to see it. We hope to see it at some point in time this month. We think that it is going to focus on baseload resources, on the critical role of nuclear and the critical role of other fuel sources that have resilient on-site fuel. We think that the DOE study is important because it will frame the objectives for the administration for the next 4 years, and we think it's going to be an important signpost to inform the agenda at FERC. 
Here's what we hope to see in the report: First, we want to see a recognition of the value of nuclear and an appreciation of the state programs in Illinois, New York and the other places that are going to adopt these programs. Let me be specific. We expect the FERC to respect those programs and not to tamper with the functioning. There are a couple of MOPR complaints that need to be addressed. The ISOs do not support those complaints, but that is on the docket and ready for action by a new FERC, and we have talked to the Department of Energy about those issues, and we've had productive conversations. 
The second issue is that we need to look at the market design changes that have been long pending. As many of you know, PJM has recently put out a whitepaper on this issue, talking about energy price formation primarily in the off-peak hours and the need for all forms of generation to be able to set price. From our perspective, this is a very important issue, and we appreciate PJM's time line, which calls for a FERC filing sometime in the first quarter of 2018 and full implementation of the market reforms by the summer of '18. We're going to push very hard to make sure that happens. 
Third, we hope the Department of Energy puts a spotlight on the issue of resiliency. Let me spend a moment talking about that. We have talked about reliability in the form of being able to run the system even in an event that we had major components, electrical components that failed. But as increasingly the system depends on both intermittent generation and natural gas fire generation that don't have the ability to secure fuel for long-term operations, we need to be -- we need to make sure that our customers get electricity even in the event of a long-term disruption of the natural gas pipeline system. That's something that currently is not being modeled and needs to be modeled. 
So PJM has recently put out a whitepaper on this subject with a schedule of activities. The first activity is to address operational reserves beginning this winter. Importantly, that doesn't require any FERC activity or any stakeholder support. That, within the tariff, is within PJM's full province, and again, we are pushing to make sure these things are done. That's an important start and should begin to be reflected in pricing this winter for baseload resources that provide the kind of resiliency that I'm talking about. 
But that's not the end of this subject. We have to, as an industry and as a country, come to grips with this potential risk to our system and examine the possibility of multiple pipeline failures. And the policies that come from that should favor fuel generation sources that have on-site fuel like nuclear plants that could run for a year or 2 in the event of these emergencies. 
So we're going to continue to focus on that, and those are the -- really the 3 areas that we're hoping that the DOE will provide some guidance on. So obviously, we have a lot going on in policy space. We're making very good progress, but a lot of work remains to be done. 
I look forward to taking your questions after Jack concludes his part of the presentation."

My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter.",1763,"Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter. 
On Slide 9, as Chris mentioned earlier, we had a strong second quarter financially and operationally across the company. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.54 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. Exelon's utilities less holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.33 per share. Relative to plan, utility results were slightly favorable, primarily driven by O&M timing across all of the utilities. 
Generation earned $0.22 per share in the second quarter. This was favorable versus the plan, driven by the timing of O&M and realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trusts. Our nuclear plants had another strong quarter with higher capacity factors than budgeted, and the Constellation team continued to deliver strong results with good customer wins. 
Turning to Slide 10. The $0.54 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2016. Overall, the utilities benefited from increased rates and higher rate base partly offset by year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the known impacts of lower power price realization and more planned refueling outages, partly offset by New York ZEC revenues. 
On Slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $1.19 per share are $0.14 per share lower than the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the New York ZEC revenues, with partial offsets from our utilities with higher rates supporting our ongoing reliability investments and a full year contribution from PHI. 
Turning to Slide 12. We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share in the third quarter compared with $0.91 per share last year. Our third quarter results will include a full quarter of contributions from the New York ZEC program that started on April 1. 
In Illinois, the ZEC program went into effect on June 1, but the ICC has yet to conduct its ZEC procurement process. It's anticipated that the procurement event and the execution of contracts with winning ZEC suppliers will occur in the fourth quarter. Therefore, no revenues will be recognized until that process concludes. We would then include all of the Illinois ZEC revenues retroactive to June 1. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our utilities continue to execute, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter in addition to strong customer-focused operational performance. Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, at PHI, we saw some of the utilities register lower trailing ROEs relative to what we showed last quarter. The degradation was expected primarily due to the timing of equity infusions that Exelon made into PHI in 2016 following the merger close. 
For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remain over 10%, lifting the consolidated Exelon utilities' platform to nearly 10%, including PHI. We still have work to do with the utilities to continue improving the product we're delivering to our customers, but we're happy with where the overall business is performing. As we've said before, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the plan that we put in place at PHI. 
On Slide 14, we update the status of our rate cases. Since our first quarter call, the unanimous settlements in Delmarva Delaware electric and gas cases were approved, with a combined revenue increase of $36 million. We also received a commission decision in the Pepco D.C. rate case during the quarter, with a revenue increase of $37 million. 
We've now completed our first cycle of planned rate cases in the PHI jurisdictions with the second cycle already underway. We filed rate cases at ACE and Pepco Maryland last quarter and just recently filed again at Delmarva Maryland during the second quarter. Combined, we are currently asking for $168 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions. We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland in the fourth quarter of this year and decisions on ACE and Delmarva Maryland in the first quarter of 2018. 
We plan to file second rate cases in the remaining PHI jurisdictions later in 2017 and expect to have them resolved by the end of 2018, helping to put us in a position to earn our targeted ROEs in 2019. 
We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's revenues and earned ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on slides 35 through 42 in the Appendix. 
Turning to Slide 15. The PJM base residual auction results were announced in May. We cleared 16.2 gigawatts of capacity in the auction with the bulk of our capacity clearing in the ComEd and Eastern MAAC zones, which cleared above the rest of RTO, pricing at $188 per megawatt day. We continue to follow a disciplined approach to bidding our plants based on their specific cost profiles. We believe this bidding discipline is the right strategy for our plants and has led to more stability in our capacity revenue streams than seen in other generators that have not been as disciplined. 
Our Three Mile Island nuclear plant failed to clear in the PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive year with this auction. We've been losing both cash and earnings at the plant in recent years and do not see a path to profitability as the market backdrop exists today. Accordingly, earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to retire the plant in the fall of 2019. We're engaged with stakeholders in Pennsylvania to find ways to preserve the plant, but we're still early in that process. 
From a financial perspective, the closure will add $0.04 to $0.07 per share of EPS annually beyond 2019, depending on the refueling year. We expect to realize positive cumulative cash flows of approximately $225 million through 2021 with the closure. 
Slide 16 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generation to load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased in the second quarter by $150 million in 2018 due to the removal of EGTP from the portfolio as well as the impacts of lower-capacity revenues in MISO and New York. Total gross margin in 2019 is down $150 million from last quarter, driven by the removal of EGTP from the portfolio and the forecasted closure of TMI in September of 2019. 
Let me be clear that although gross margin is down due to the divestiture of EGTP and planned closure of TMI, the impacts of both are accretive to EPS and cash flow. The elimination of EGTP lowers gross margin by roughly $100 million in 2018 and 2019 but is EPS accretive by $0.02 to $0.03 per share in each of those years. So there are cost offsets you should consider. 
And while we do not expect to close TMI until the fall of 2019, the retirement lowers our 2019 gross margin by roughly $50 million, although the EPS impact is roughly $0.05 positive. And as I said earlier, the retirement will be $0.04 to $0.07 EPS accretive annually beyond 2019, depending on the refueling year. 
From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and $0.08 to $0.11 behind -- 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align with our fundamental view of spot market upside in NiHub. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. 
Turning to Slide 17. On the topic of power market forwards, you have heard us and many others talk about the reduced liquidity in the forward power curves that arguably can create price distortions. We do not mean for this chart to be comprehensive, but it's illustrative of what has been happening in the forward power markets. The top chart shows the volumes traded on a cumulative 2- and 5-year forward period for PJM West on-peak power using a 6-month average to smooth some of the seasonal volatility. 
I would flag in this context that, overall -- I would flag in this context that overall volumes have been on a pretty consistent decline, both in absolute terms and particularly when looking beyond 2 years, which can be seen in the narrowing of the 2 lines on the chart. 
Arguably, more interesting, when thinking about forward power price transparency, is the amount of transactions in those years. Looking at the lower-right chart, prompt year volumes are over 71% of the 5-year cumulative volumes, with 2019 representing another 23%. The volumes traded in 2020 and beyond are only 6% of the total volumes, with 2021 nearly nonexistent. Compared to last year, total volumes are lower, and the amount of volumes in the out-years is even less. 
We wanted to share some of this data with you, particularly as folks are thinking more about the roll forward of 2020 earnings estimates. We would note that our fundamentals group has a more constructive view on power markets than these illiquid forward curves suggest, but we appreciate that there is perceived safety in using the forwards. However, when running your numbers, we would just encourage you all to appreciate what is underpinning those forward prices. 
Turning to Slide 18. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade rating. We have now removed EGTP from our credit metrics, which, in turn, has improved our consolidated net debt to EBITDA at year-end 2017 to 2.9x, which is below our target of 3x. If we focus only on recourse debt, our leverage is at 2.5x EBITDA. We're pleased with the improvements in our balance sheet, and will continue to focus on a combination of debt paydown between ExGen and the holding company. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

In closing, I'd like to remind you all that Exelon's success is a direct result of our people and the culture of performance and service that we've created as an organization. 
In June, we held our sixth Exelon Innovation Expo in Washington, D.C. This annual event brings together employees, vendors and other key stakeholders to share all the ways Exelon is working to embrace and advance the future of the energy industry. The Expo is also an excellent opportunity for our employees across the company to share ideas, explore new technologies, drive collaboration and push each other to do even better for our customers. 
On Slide 20, Exelon culture is also built on serving our communities, both externally and internally. We accomplished a lot on this front during the quarter, and several awards really do stand out. First, Exelon is being added to the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which recognizes companies that spend over $1 billion with Tier 1 diverse and minority-owned suppliers. In 2016, we spent nearly $2 million with these important partners. We are only 1 of 27 companies to be named to the roundtable and the only utility or energy company. I especially want to thank Bill Von Hoene and Bridget Reidy for their leadership on expanding our supplier base to benefit our communities. 
For the first time, Points of Light named us as -- named us to the Civic 50, which recognizes the 50 most community-minded public and private companies in the United States. Our company strives every day to better serve our communities, so this award is especially gratifying. 
We're also named to DiversityInc's top 50 companies for diversity, adding to our previous position as the best utility. We embrace utility -- we embrace diversity in all forms, so this represents an important distinction for our company. 
On Slide 21, the value proposition. We once again want to reiterate our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to the investors. We continue to grow the utility rate base at 6.5% annually through 2020 and regulated EPS by 6% to 8% annually through 2020 through capital investments that directly benefit our customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use the free cash flow generated at ExGen to fund incremental utility needs at the utilities of $2.5 billion and pay down approximately $3 billion of debt over the next 4 years at ExGen and the holding companies. 
We're focused on optimizing the value for our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt-reduction plans and maximizing value through the gen-to-load matching strategy. We will continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics and growing our dividend in a consistent, visible manner. 
So I'd like to thank you all for joining again and for your interest, and now we're ready to take questions."

So you don't have this slide in your deck, but you've periodically put it in the slide that shows the 2017 to 2020 ExGen free cash flow profile.

We felt we're at a prove-me state on PHI, that not only do we have to integrate them successfully into our management model and drive the performance to our operational standards that we've set at the other Exelon utilities, but also achieve what is a fair and reasonable recovery on rate cases, and we're executing on that now. And I think we're proving ourselves, and we think that, that should be translated into a more reasonable valuation, not only at the utility level but at the ExGen level.

So that's one thing. The -- if you look at what we're talking about with our nuclear assets, they are definitely providing a product and a service unlike any other generating assets. Not only is it the reliability that we load at core for 18 to 24 months and they can run through any weather cycle and are not dependent on a fuel delivery that allows a baseload generation, a level of reliability to the system, the compensation that should be sought and granted for their environmental benefits to the communities they serve, an example of Illinois' power stack, 60% of the power in Illinois is carbon free. 90% of that comes from the nuclear facilities. It allows the state to make its goals that it wants to make on carbon reduction. And without these assets being fairly compensated, that would go in the opposite direction, so. And finally, these assets that do provide the societal benefit around carbon and the societal benefit around reliability and sustainable national security, they also are great economic supporters of the communities they serve, the tax basis for the schools, the parks, the employment base. So on many levels, they've been evaluated as critical and should be compensated for the lifespan that they have remaining to provide a bridge to what could be that source of energy that provides that same level of the great attributes going forward."

And all of those things put together drive some of the decisions with our program. As you can tell, looking at our numbers, we're well behind our ratable hedging plan in both '18 and '19, and you could see that's the case in the Midwest and that's the case in Texas as well, and it aligns to our market views, but those aren't independent decisions. They're tied indirectly with what we're doing with debt reduction and managing our balance sheet, and we will continue to do that."

Our adjusted EPS was $0.85 as well, reaching the midpoint of our guidance. Strong utility and Genco performance more than offset headwinds from the mild summer weather that impacted all our trained for ACE utilities as well as volumes at Constellation. As we head into urine, we have law to be encouraged about. Our regulatory utilities are continuing to execute very well, what you had a plan for the year, operationally, and we are performing in quarter top quartile across most performance measures. We are registering significant improvements at PHI, even relative to last year. We are doing exactly what we said we would do as part of our merger commitments, improving performance and reliability for our customers. We are executing on our CapEx program for 2017. We're excited about the valuable technological investments we're deploying to our customers' benefit. The FERC is making strides to address pressing resiliency needs for the power system, and we see that in a 2-step process. Starting with empowering PJM to fix deficiencies in the power price formation by the summer of 2018, and then a longer term FERC process to address resiliency. The Department of Energy Section 403 filing noted a clause in the current price formation are part of the reason that nuclear units, the most resilient and cost effectively 0 emission resources in PJM are being lost in premature retirements. Given our size of our PJM fleet, each dollar or megawatt hour of distortion caused by a flood market design undermines the Genco's economics by approximately $135 million per year on an unhedged basis. We believe that DOE's focus on price formation will lead to a successful formation that FERC that will eliminate these distortions by the summer of 2018. We have not reflected the value of these reforms in our forecast that we're showing you today, but we do believe they could be a significant positive for us starting in 2018. Finally, we are executing on our management plan, focused on strengthening our operation and continuing to find efficiencies. To that end, we lowered our costs by $250 million on a run-rate basis in 2020, primarily at the Genco, including today's announcement we're in our cost, our O&M cost, versus planned by over $700 million annually from initiatives identified since 2015. We continue to challenge our businesses to evaluate cost and today's announcements savings are part of that ongoing effort. We're confident in our previous announced plan to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow at the Genco through 2020. That will fund our utility growth, grow the dividend and meet our debt reduction commitments. It is this deliberate work that positions us well to face some headwinds. After a series of mild summers and winters, we have seen decline in power market volatility, which is weighing on the forward price -- power prices, impacting the Constellation business. Just as we experienced during periods of low volatility, we're again seeing less disciplined by some of the wholesale and retail competitors in the market as they become more aggressive with their pricing. We have been through low discipline, low volatility periods before, and they end up in the same way. Those without discipline fail, that is when we can grow our market share by winning business a good margins or acquiring new business is offered for sale. We expect volatility to return to the markets with normal weather conditions, which will benefit our Constellation and Generation business. In the meantime, we remain disciplined in our bidding strategy and remained the behind our ratable hedging in our generation. Last week, the Illinois Power Authority shifted its schedule for finalizing the procurement of the Illinois ZEC contracts by 1 month from late December 2017 to late January of 2018. Based on our assumptions, this delay will shift $0.09 of EPS from 2017 to 2018. Even with the unanticipated EPS shift, we're narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.55 to $2.75 per share, keeping us on path to the midpoint of our original guidance at the utilities outperformed our plan. Moving on to Slide 6, I want to highlight our excellent operational performance for the quarter. The color block chart continues to show strong quartile -- top quartile performance across all of the utilities in most categories. I particularly want to call out the tremendous improvements at PHI compared to last year. With the 22% improvement in reliability, with PHI on track for their best year ever in reliability and a 17% improvement in speed of restoration of outages. Performance improvements like these really highlight the benefits going to our customers with the integration of PHI into Exelon. And finally, as in prior quarters, our best-in-class nuclear power fleets performed with very high reliability in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 7. Now let me turn to the proposed rule issued by Secretary Perry in September. The order is aimed at protecting our customers from outages, resulting from man-made and natural interruptions on the gas system by preserving resilient generation sources, including nuclear. We commend the Secretariat for focusing attention on the need to reform the energy markets, and ensure that our customers continue to benefit from the resilient system. FERC is currently considering the DOE's proposal, with the first round of comments filed on October 21, reply comments due on November 7 and the final order scheduled for December 11. We have shared our perspective on this important policy initiative. First, we think the FERC should direct PJM to evaluate and correct any deficiencies they see in energy price formation, which have put baseload generation assets at a disadvantage. We believe timely action on price formation could be implemented by as early as mid-2018. These reforms will be valuable first step in preserving resilient baseload generation as well as delivering economic and environmental benefits, the nuclear power uniquely provide. We expect 135 terawatt hours of our generation output in PJM to benefit from price uplift that were layer in over the coming years at the existing hedges roll off. Second, we think FERC can take on -- take the time to fully evaluate market reforms that will ensure power supply resiliency. This is a multi-fast that exercise that should take into account the cost and impact to our customers and economy of the long-term interruption of a natural gas and fuel supply -- interruption of the natural gas fuel supply. We believe these are important issues that need to be addressed for our country's future, but they require more analysis to ensure the right reforms are implemented. We are encouraged by the process being made at FERC and PJM, support for price formation changes. Between these efforts and state initiatives, we're optimistic about the path to preserve nuclear power plants and their critical economic environmental and reliability roles that they have in the communities that we serve. I'll now turn the call over to Jack to take us through the numbers."

Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon's utilities less Ho",2077,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon's utilities less Holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.49 per share. Versus our plan, utility results were slightly favorable due to lower O&M and reduced storm activity over the third quarter. Generation earned $0.36 per share, which is a little behind our plan. The third quarter was hurt by mild weather that reduced Constellation low volumes and a lack of price volatility, which reduced optimization opportunities. We did offset some weakness for payable O&M timing. Turning to Slide 9. Our $0.85 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.06 per share lower than the third quarter of 2016. Overall, utilities benefited from improved earned ROEs and higher rate base, partly offset by adverse year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down primarily on lower power prices, lower load volumes due to mild weather and fewer optimization opportunities, partially offset by the addition of New York ZEC revenue and higher capacity prices. Turning to Slide 10. We are updating our 2017 guidance range. We had expected the Illinois Power Authority to finalize procurement for the ZEC programs in December, which based on our assumptions, would have contributed $0.09 of EPS in 2017 since the revenues are retroactive to the beginning of program on June 1. However, last week, the Illinois power authority updated their schedule pushing the final contract date to January 30, 2018. The delayed timing has no impact on the amount we expect to receive or our free cash flow outlook. But it will change the timing of earnings recognition, shifting EPS into 2018. With that in mind, we are updating our 2017 EPS guidance range, strengthening the top and bottom of the range by a nickel. So we're now at $2.55 to $2.75 per share. Strong performance of utilities is allowing us to still target the midpoint of our original guidance range of absorbing the $0.09 of ZEC timing impact. Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute delivering strong earnings returns of the quarter in addition to the robust operational performance Chris already discussed. Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, we saw improvement at PHI compared to last quarter across all jurisdictions except ACE, where they roll out favorable weather in the third quarter of 2016 for the less beneficial summer weather this year. Our efforts to improve operations and the contributions from the rate cases resolved over the past year are driving a better earned ROEs at PHI. For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10%, but a bit in the last quarter with less favorable year-over-year weather impacts at ComEd and PECO that you can see on Slide 9 quarter call. Overall Exelon's utilities ROEs are still nearly 10%, including PHI. We're proud of the performance of our overall utility business and we still see opportunity to improve our returns at the PHI utilities as we bring their performance to levels more consistent with the rest of our utilities. On Slide 12, we update the status of our rate cases. At Atlantic City Electric, we reached a settlement for the second case in a row. The settlement provides a 4% rate increase, with new rates implemented earlier than what would have occurred if the case was fully litigated. The timing rate making in New Jersey is helping us make beneficial investments for our customers. While still a work-in-progress, the investments are having an impact with outages down 33% and average customer outage time down 35% compared to 2011. We also received an order for Pepco Maryland that granted an electric distribution base rate increase of $32.4 million based on an allowed ROE of 9.5%. The improved electric delivery rates became effective on October 20, 2017. We filed rate cases in the third quarter for Delmarva Delaware electric and gas and expect orders by the third quarter of 2018. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's earned ROEs allowed levels while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules will be found on Slides 34 to 42 in the Appendix. Turning to Slide 13. We regularly update you on our progress on the regulatory front, but another essential aspect of the business is a effectively deploying capital on behalf of our customers. We're currently on course to deploy our targeted $5.3 billion of capital in 2017. We've highlighted on this slide 2 of the many notable projects we're developing to benefit our communities and customers. The first is Pepco's Waterfront Substation. This substation is part of the larger capital grid project and is currently under construction with expected completion in 2017. Once complete, it will improve our reliability to existing customers and to support the plan growth in the Capitol Riverfront and Southwest Waterfront areas in the next 20 to 30 years. The other project I'd like to highlight ComEd Grand Prairie Gateway transmission line that was energized earlier this year. It's a $200 million, 60 mile-long transmission line in Northern Illinois that provide structural benefits to the market, resulting in lower energy and congestion charges to customers and an increased import capability of approximately 1,000 megawatts. Over the next 15 years, customers collectively will save over $120 million and carbon emissions will be reduced by nearly 500,000 tons. These are just a couple of examples of how we continue to invest prudently across all our utilities and look forward to sharing more as we go forward. 
Slide 14 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. Before I get into the market developments impacting gross margins, let me first discuss the impacts from a shift and revenue recognition for the Illinois ZEC from 2017 to 2018, which we also show in the Waterfalls in Slide 21 in the appendix. The capacity in ZEC declines by $150 million in 2017 and increases by a $150 million in 2018, offset by $50 million in other capacity declines, which I'll discuss in a moment. The rest of the bars help to then isolate movements in underline gross margin related to ZEC timing. In 2017, gross margin is down $50 million compared to last quarter, partially reflecting the effect of the mild summer and reduced optimization opportunities. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced for our generation matching strategy. Turning to 2018 and 2019. Separate from the Illinois ZEC timing, our gross margin is down $200 million for each year and can be bucketed into 2 categories. The first relates business and our unhedged power position. We are lowering our assumptions from MISO and New York capacity prices based on recent spot year options and bilateral fields in the market. This lower the capacity in ZEC line by $50 million on a rounded basis from last quarter. For 2018, the line shows up as a positive $100 million after the timing uplift from $150 million of Illinois ZEC, while the $15 million decline in 2019 just reflects the lower outlook for past revenues. During the third quarter, we also saw declines in energy prices, including some adverse news and basis differentials in the PJM sum with cost another $50 million in 2018 and '19. However, with the recent rally in power prices, we have already recovered about half of the $100 million of 2019 gross margin declines for Generation. We also see $100 million decline in gross margins in 2018 and 2019 from the Constellation business, reflected in the lower power new business to go live. A series of mild summers and winters have contributed to reduced power market volatility, which in turn is impacting the competitiveness of our load business. As we've witnessed in prior periods with low price volatility, some of our competitors are mispricing risk in an effort to win business. In the wholesale load business, we're seeing other players mispricing risks as we consider the market risk from weather volatility, basis variability and the likely impact of energy market reforms that Chris talked about earlier. Against this backdrop, we are clearing our margins near the low end of historical realizations. In the C&I business, the consolidation of the supply years since the polar vortex has led to better margin to spend with unit margin holding consistent with prior years. We are however revenue renewal rates compared to last couple of years, moving from something closer to 80% to low 70s. Now deep lower renewal rates, we still expect our volumes to be flat year-over-year whereas our premium guidance assumes higher renewal rates that will drive volume growth to Constellation in 2018 and 2019. Notably, even against the challenge market backdrop, we're holding volumes and margins flat, which is a testament to the strength of our retail platform and our disciplined approach to bidding business. The updated gross margins for 2018 and '19 incorporates C&I renewal rates from the low 70s and the wholesale margins hovering around the bottom end of what we've realized over time. We've been through these periods of low load pricing, lower load pricing in the past and has previously created opportunities for us. A return to normal weather will inject some power market volatility, which will positively impact forward power prices for Generation. Retailers and wholesalers in mispriced risk have consistently been driven from the business when we go from a period of low volatility to a volatility event. When the market corrects, we'll be there to win business at good margins and grow volumes and market share, just as we had in the past. Even against the current market backdrop, Constellation continues to generate strong earnings and free cash flow. Our gen-to-load matching strategy remains competitive advantage relative to our peers, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our generation output to market in a disciplined manner. From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. Spot natural gas prices this year at $3 per Mcf, which is $0.50 higher than last year in spite of mild weather this past winter and summer. However, these higher prices have provided only modest uplift to spot power prices this summer, while the forward prices have decreased slightly. We think that a return to more normal weather and volatility in the market will help reverse this. And as Chris discussed, we see a path power market reforms that represent real value uplift for us. We're maintaining a additional link to be able to monetize these reforms. 
Turning to Slide 15. We continually challenge our organization to find operating efficiencies and focus on managing our cost. To that end, we're announcing another wave of O&M cost reductions, building on previous years' efforts. We will ramp these new initiatives over the next 2 years, as shown on the lower-right table, reaching a $250 million annual run rate in 2020. The savings will come primarily from ExGen and the corporate center. If you look at the together with the programs we've announced since 2015, we'll strip out over $700 million annual run rate cost, providing significant earnings and free cash flow benefits. Turning to Slide 16. We appreciate that there are many puts and takes this year in ExGen, but have both benefited on our free cash flow outlook through 2020. When we take into account the movement in power price forwards through the end of October, updated gross margin outlook for Constellation, the benefit of further cost cuts, the early closure of TMI and exit of EGTP plants and changes to base CapEx in working capital associated with all these business updates, we remain confident in the free cash flow outlook and capital allocation commitments we made at the beginning of the year. We're also committed to meeting or beating our 3x debt-to-EBITDA target for ExGen's balance sheet, which we will meet over planning horizon. On the fourth quarter call, we will roll forward the free cash flow outlook for the next plan period. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris."

Turning to Slide 17, I want to take a moment to highlight the contributions made by Exelon and our employees to help the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Exelon utilities sent more than 2,200 employees and contractors and support personnel from our 6 utilities to help with the recovery efforts at hurricane Irma. Our cruise travel to Florida and Georgia where they, for more than 2 weeks, worked in very difficult conditions. We're very proud of our employees and the hard work that they do to help the communities come back from after these disasters. A very special thanks to all those who helped in the restoration and support efforts. Exelon employees also stepped up from the volunteer perspective. Our employees have donated their time and resources to communities impacted by the storms. We also had a number of our Constellation employees in Houston directly displaced by the storms and to see coworkers come to their aid illustrates the value that we embody here at Exelon. Slide 18, we want to reinforce our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to our investors. We've continued to grow the utility's rate base at 6.5% and the regulated EPS to 6% to 8% annually through 2020, underpinning the capital investments that directly benefit the customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use free cash flow generated at the Genco to fund incremental equities at the utilities and pay down debt over the next 4 years at ExGen and the Holding Company. We're focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plant, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing our value through gen-to-load matching strategies. We continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit rate metrics and grow our dividends in a stable consistent manner. And as many of you are aware, our dividend growth program is for 2.5% annually from 2016 through 2018. We are working with our board and expect to provide an update on a multiyear outlook for the dividend growth plan as part of our planning and budgeting process that we're undertaking currently. Before I go to questions, I want to come back to where we started off in the call. We have a number of positives underlying our outlook. The utilities are growing and executing well. We are confident that the FERC actions around resiliency will facilitate needed power price reforms in PJM that will fairly compensate our generate assets. We continue to improve operations where were finding ways to run our business more efficiently and taking out an additional $250 million in cost as discussed.

As was the case back in 2012 and '13, we have seen a downturn in most renewal rates down close to the 70%. And we're marking this closer to that 70% number.

We're still within that $2 to $4 range. I think the big thing, the takeaway is, we're going to serve about $200 million-megawatt hours of load this year across our platform between retail and wholesale. And we expect to do the same thing next year. The thing is, we're just not going to achieve the growth that we expected in our C&I power business and as Chris said and Jack said, the before that is, we don't think it's prudent to chase the market.

One is obviously, we have contracts from the books already. And we have some hedges on the books already, so there will be a feathering in effect to the value proposition as this. But most importantly, from our perspective, I think one of the things we offer our customers, and it's really important, is transparency.

Now you know that's going to cycle during different growth period, but that was the way we had the dividend set to grow. In the first couple of years, we were starting to get closer to that, giving that accomplished in the early 20s. And so that's when we came up with the growth policy at 2.5%. As you can see, the utilities are continuing to grow, although right now, it's taking cash in infusion, equity infusion from the Holdco through the Genco. But they're continuing to grow. So our stability of the dividend is a very well anchored. Our growth potential growth for the dividend is well anchored. As we come through the last couple of years and started to see more reliable or consistent cash flows from the Genco on programs that compensate for the other benefits besides just the energy, you're seeing a potential that, that can be a dependable cash flow, that can be used for potential return of value to the shareholders. So that's the way we're looking at it, you're presenting it to the board. But the cyclical nature of the commodity market will not leave us, but the certainty of that certain elements on those revenue streams give us the opportunity to look at the world a little bit differently.

The advent of digitalization of the distribution system and the transmission system have offered us an opportunity for capital investments that directly benefit the customers and drive reliability. We have now put in communications backbones to reach smart meters to help us with fault isolators, factory closures, that's the kind of expand, along with replacement antiquated cable and updating the system with new components. Now as we go into the 2020 and beyond, there is a significant amount of work being done on what else can be done to develop into the smart city that we can better serve the communities while investing and driving efficiency into the systems. And the work that's being done on microgrids, the experimental work there, to see what the societal benefit in certain microgrids in certain locations. What we can do to integrate with more of the community is there an assistance within the street light programs or assistance that we can provide with our own infrastructure on the meter reading of water or gas or other types of systems is where we'll be going. And I think, there's technology is morphing faster than it ever has in our sector.

If you've seen our fleeting, you know that we have a multiyear process where, in the first instance, we need to get analytics from the RTOs. Can they run without pipelines, what the impact of the consumers. We can move from there to design basis for the system that we think is going to iterate between -- and FERC in the Department of Energy sometime after we get the data. In terms of how we ultimately implement that into the system, I think once we of the design basis, what we are trying to avoid, we will start looking at mitigation solutions, maybe the retention of additional fuel secure resources to avoid this outage risk. But I think it's premature to get there. One way you can think about is, though, you can take a look at the capacity performance program. We were able to value the cost of incremental reliability associated with dual fuel. So if the design basis ultimately ends up being we need 90 days of fuel, we have a mathematical way of calculating what's the market solution to get dual fuel resources to 90 days of fuel with it. That would probably be the $8 or $10 of megawatt hour in terms of doing that based on the cost we saw in CPAY. So that's 1 approach. But from our perspective, we need to drop back here, take a look at the data, make sure we have the right resolution of resiliency, the right design basis and that we come back with market solutions or other solutions that we would ensure resources to mitigate that risk and provide the security we need that we provide to the customers and the nation."

Our adjusted EPS was $0.85 as well, reaching the midpoint of our guidance. Strong utility and Genco performance more than offset headwinds from the mild summer weather that impacted our PECO ACE utilities as well as volumes at Constellation. As we head into year-end, we have a lot to be encouraged about. Our regulatory utilities are continuing to execute very well, running ahead of plan for the year, and operationally, we're performing in quarter top quartile across most performance measures. 
We are registering significant improvements at PHI, even relative to last year. We are doing exactly what we said we would do as part of our merger commitments, improving performance and reliability for our customers. We are executing on our CapEx program for 2017. We're excited about the valuable technologies investments we are deploying to our customers' benefit. 
The FERC is making strides to address pressing resiliency needs for the power system, and we see that in a 2-step process, starting with empowering PJM to fix deficiencies in the power price formation by the summer of 2018, and then a longer-term FERC process to address resiliency. 
The Department of Energy's Section 403 filing noted a clause in the current price formation are part of the reason that nuclear units, the most resilient and cost-effective 0 emission resources in PJM are being lost to premature retirements. Given our size of our PJM fleet, each dollar or megawatt hour of distortion caused by a flood market design undermines the Genco's economics by approximately $135 million per year on an unhedged basis. We believe that DOE's focus on price formation will lead to a successful process of FERC that will eliminate these distortions by the summer of 2018. We have not reflected the value of these reforms in our forecast that we are showing you today, but we do believe they could be a significant positive for us starting in 2018. 
Finally, we are executing on our management plan, focused on strengthening our operation and continuing to find efficiencies. To that end, we lowered our cost by $250 million on a run-rate basis in 2020, primarily at the Genco, including today's announcement we're in a cost -- our O&M cost, versus planned by over $700 million annually from initiatives identified since 2015. 
We continue to challenge our businesses to evaluate cost, and today's announcement savings are part of that ongoing effort. 
We're confident in our previous announced plan to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow at the Genco through 2020. That will fund our utility growth, grow the dividend and meet our debt reduction commitments. It is this deliberate work that positions us well to face some headwinds. After a series of mild summers and winters, we have seen decline in power market volatility, which is weighing on the forward price -- or power prices, impacting the Constellation business. Just as we experienced during periods of low volatility, we're again seeing less discipline by some of the wholesale and retail competitors in the market as they become more aggressive with their pricing. We have been through long discipline and low volatility periods before, and they end up in the same way. Those without discipline fail, that is when we can grow our market share by winning business at good margins or acquiring low businesses offered for sale. 
We expect volatility to return to the markets with normal weather conditions, which will benefit our Constellation and Generation business. In the meantime, we remain disciplined in our bidding strategy and remain behind our ratable hedging in our Generation. 
Last week, the Illinois power authority shifted its schedule for finalizing the procurement of the Illinois ZEC contracts by 1 month, from late December 2017 to late January of 2018. 
Based on our assumptions, this delay will shift $0.09 of EPS from 2017 to 2018. Even with the unanticipated EPS shift, we're narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.55 to $2.75 per share, keeping us on path to the midpoint of our original guidance at the utilities -- as the utilities outperformed our plan. 
Moving on to Slide 6, I want to highlight our excellent operational performance for the quarter. The color block chart continues to show strong quartile -- top quartile performance across all of the utilities in most categories, and particularly want to call out the tremendous improvements at PHI compared to last year. With the 22% improvement in reliability, with PHI on track for their best year ever in reliability and a 17% improvement in speed of restoration of outages, performance improvements like these really highlight the benefit going to our customers with the integration of PHI into Exelon. And finally, as in prior quarters, our best-in-class nuclear power fleets performed with very high reliability in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 7. Now let me turn to the proposed rule issued by Secretary Perry in September. The order is aimed at protecting our customers from outages resulting from man-made and natural interruptions on the gas system by preserving resilient generation sources, including nuclear. We commend the Secretary for focusing attention on the need to reform the energy market and ensure that our customers continue to benefit from the resilient system. FERC is currently considering the DOE's proposal, with the first round of comments filed on October 21, reply comments due on November 7 and the final order scheduled for December 11. 
We have shared our perspective on this important policy initiative. First, we think the FERC should direct PJM to evaluate and correct any deficiencies they see in energy price formation, which have put baseload generation assets at a disadvantage. We believe timely action on price formation could be implemented by as early as mid-2018. These reforms will be valuable first step in preserving resilient baseload generation as well as delivering economic and environmental benefits the nuclear power uniquely provide. We expect 135 terawatt hours of our generation output in PJM to benefit from price uplift that will layer in over the coming years as the existing hedges roll off. 
Second, we think FERC can take on -- take the time to fully evaluate market reforms that will ensure power supply resiliency. This is a multifaceted exercise that should take into account the cost and impact to our customers and economy of the long-term interruption of a natural gas fuel supply -- interruption of the natural gas and fuel supply. We believe these are important issues that need to be addressed for our country's future, but they require more analysis to ensure the right reforms are implemented. We are encouraged by the process being made at FERC and PJM, support for price-formation changes. Between these efforts and state initiatives, we're optimistic about the path to preserve nuclear power plants and their critical economic environmental and reliability roles that they have in the communities that we serve. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jack to take us through the numbers."

Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon's utilities less",2088,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon's utilities less Holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.49 per share. Versus our plan, utility results were slightly favorable due to lower O&M and reduced storm activity over the third quarter. Generation earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was hurt by mild weather that reduced Constellation load volumes and a lack of price volatility, which reduced optimization opportunities. We did offset some weakness for payable O&M timing. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our $0.85 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.06 per share lower than the third quarter of 2016. Overall, utilities benefited from improved earned ROEs and higher rate base, partly offset by adverse year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down primarily on lower power prices, lower load volumes due to mild weather and fewer optimization opportunities, partially offset by the addition of New York ZEC revenue and higher capacity prices. 
Turning to Slide 10. We are updating our 2017 guidance range. We had expected the Illinois Power Authority to finalize procurement for the ZEC programs in December, which based on our assumptions, would have contributed $0.09 of EPS in 2017 since the revenues are retroactive from the beginning of the program on June 1. However, last week, the Illinois Power Authority updated their schedule pushing the final contract date to January 30, 2018. The delayed timing has no impact on the amount we expect to receive or our free cash flow outlook. But it will change the timing of earnings recognition, shifting EPS into 2018. With that in mind, we are updating our 2017 EPS guidance range, tightening the top and bottom of the range by $0.05. So we're now at $2.55 to $2.75 per  share. The strong performance of utilities is allowing us to still target the midpoint of our original guidance range absorbing the $0.09 of ZEC timing impact. 
Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter in addition to the robust operational performance Chris already discussed. 
Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, we saw improvement at PHI compared to last quarter across all jurisdictions except ACE, where they rolled our favorable weather in the third quarter of 2016 for the less beneficial summer weather this year. Our efforts to improve operations and the contributions from rate cases resolved over the past year are driving a better-earned ROEs at PHI. For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10% but baited a bit from the last quarter with the less favorable year-over-year weather impacts at ComEd and PECO that you can see on Slide 9's waterfall. 
Overall Exelon utilities ROEs are still nearly 10%, including PHI. We're proud of the performance of our overall utility business, and we still see opportunity to improve our returns at the PHI utilities as we bring their performance to levels more consistent with the rest of our utilities. 
On Slide 12, we update the status of our rate cases. At Atlantic City Electric, we reached the settlement for the second case in a row. This settlement provides a 4% rate increase, with new rates implemented earlier than what would have occurred if the case was fully litigated. The timing rate making in New Jersey is helping us make beneficial investments for our customers. While still a work-in-progress, the investments are having an impact with outages down 33% and average customer outage time down 35% compared to 2011. We also received an order for Pepco Maryland that granted an electric distribution base rate increase of $32.4 million based on an allowed ROE of 9.5%. The approved electric delivery rates became effective on October 20, 2017. We filed rate cases in the third quarter for Delmarva Delaware Electric and Gas and expect orders by the third quarter of 2018. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's earned ROEs for allowed levels while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on Slides 34 to 42 in the Appendix. 
Turning to Slide 13. We regularly update you on our progress on the regulatory front, but another essential aspect of the business is effectively deploying capital on behalf of our customers. We're currently on course to deploy our targeted $5.3 billion of capital in 2017. We've highlighted on this slide 2 of the many notable projects we're developing to benefit our communities and customers. The first is Pepco's Waterfront Substation. This substation is part of the larger Capital Grid project and is currently under construction with expected completion in 2017. Once complete, it will improve reliability to existing customers and to support the planned growth in the Capitol Riverfront and Southwest Waterfront areas for the next 20 to 30 years. The other project I'd like to highlight is ComEd's Grand Prairie Gateway transmission line that was energized earlier this year. It's a $200 million, 60 mile-long transmission line in Northern Illinois that provides structural benefits to the market, resulting in lower energy and congestion charges to customers and an increased import capability of approximately 1,000 megawatts. Over the next 15 years, customers, collectively, will save over $120 million, and carbon emissions will be reduced by nearly 500,000 tons. These are just a couple of examples of how we continue to invest prudently across all our utilities and look forward to sharing more as we go forward. 
Slide 14 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. Before I get into the market developments impacting gross margins, let me first discuss the impacts from the shifts and revenue recognition for the Illinois ZECs from 2017 to 2018, which we also show in the waterfalls on Slide 21 in the Appendix. 
The capacity in ZEC line declines by $150 million in 2017 and increases by $150 million in 2018, offset by $50 million in other capacity declines, which I'll discuss in a moment. The rest of the bars helped to then isolate movements in underlying gross margin related to ZEC timing. 
In 2017, gross margin is down $50 million compared to last quarter, partially reflecting the effect of the mild summer and reduced optimization opportunities. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced from our generation to load matching strategy. 
Turning to 2018 and 2019. Separate from the Illinois ZEC timing, our gross margin is down $200 million for each year and can be bucketed into 2 categories. The first relates [indiscernible] business in our unhedged power position. We're lowering our assumptions from MISO and New York capacity prices based on recent spot year options and bilateral deals in the market. This lower the capacity in ZEC line by $50 million on a rounded basis from last quarter. For 2018, the line shows up as a positive $100 million after the timing uplift from $150 million of Illinois ZECs, while the $15 million decline in 2019 just reflects the lower outlook for the past 2 revenues. During the third quarter, we also saw declines in energy prices, including some adverse news and basis differentials in the PJM East's sum, which costs another $50 million in 2018 and '19. However, with the recent rally in power prices, we have already recovered about half of the $100 million of 2019 gross margin declines for Generation. We also see $100 million decline in gross margins in 2018 and 2019 from the Constellation business, reflected in a lower powered new business to go live. A series of mild summers and winters have contributed to reduced power market volatility, which, in turn, is impacting the competitiveness of our load business. As we've witnessed in prior periods of low price volatility, some of our competitors are mispricing risk in an effort to win business. In the wholesale load business, we're seeing other players mispricing risk as we consider the market risk from weather volatility, basis variability and the likely impact of energy market reforms that Chris talked about earlier. Against this backdrop, we are clearing our margins near the low end of historical realizations. In the C&I business, the consolidation of suppliers since the polar vortex has led to better margin discipline with our unit margins holding consistent with prior years. We are, however, seeing lower renewal rates compared to last couple of years, moving from something closer to 80% to the low 70s. At deep lower renewal rates, we still expect our volumes to be flat year-over-year, whereas, our previous guidance assumed higher renewal rates that will drive volume growth to Constellation from 2018 and 2019. Notably, even against the challenged market backdrop, we're holding volumes and margins flat, which is a testament to the strength of our retail platform and our disciplined approach to bidding business. The updated gross margins for 2018 and '19 incorporates C&I renewal rates from the low 70s and wholesale margins hovering around the bottom end of what we've realized over time. We've been through these periods of low load pricing -- lower load pricing in the past and has previously created opportunities for us. A return to normal weather will inject some power market volatility, which will positively impact forward power prices for Generation. Retailers and wholesalers in mispriced risk have consistently been driven from the business when we go from a period of low volatility to a volatility event. When the market corrects, we'll be there to win business at good margins and grow volumes and market share, just as we had in the past. Even against the current market backdrop, Constellation continues to generate strong earnings and free cash flow. Our gen-to-load matching strategy remains a competitive advantage relative to our peers, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our generation output to market in a disciplined manner. From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. Spot natural gas prices this year at $3 per Mcf, which is $0.50 higher than last year in spite of mild weather this past winter and summer. However, these higher prices have provided only modest uplift to spot power prices this summer, while the forward prices have decreased slightly. We think that a return to more normal weather and volatility in the market will help reverse this. And as Chris discussed, we see a path to power market reforms that represent real value uplift for us. We're maintaining additional link to be able to monetize these reforms. 
Turning to Slide 15. We continually challenge our organization to find operating efficiencies and focus on managing our cost. To that end, we're announcing another wave of O&M cost reductions, building on previous years' efforts. We will ramp these new initiatives over the next 2 years, as shown on the lower-right table, reaching a $250 million annual run rate in 2020. The savings will come primarily from ExGen and the corporate center. If you look at this initiative, together with the programs we've announced since 2015, we'll strip out over $700 million of annual run rate cost, providing significant earnings and free cash flow benefits. 
Turning to Slide 16. We appreciate that there of the many puts and takes this year at ExGen that have both benefited and weighed on our free cash flow outlook through 2020. When we take into account the movement in power price forwards through the end of October, updated gross margin outlook for Constellation, the benefit of further cost cuts, the early closure of TMI and exit of the EGTP plants and changes to base CapEx and working capital associated with all these business updates, we remain confident in the free cash flow outlook and capital allocation commitments we made at the beginning of the year. We're also committed to meeting or beating our 3x debt-to-EBITDA target for ExGen's balance sheet, which we will meet over our planning horizon. On the fourth quarter call, we will roll forward the free cash flow outlook for the next planning period. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

Turning to Slide 17, I want to take a moment to highlight the contributions made by Exelon and our employees to help the impact of -- by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Exelon utilities sent more than 2,200 employees and contractors and support personnel from our 6 utilities to help with the recovery efforts after Hurricane Irma. Our cruise traveled to Florida and Georgia where they, for more than 2 weeks, worked in very difficult conditions. We're very proud of our employees and the hard work that they do to help the communities come back from after these disasters. A very special thanks to all those who helped in the restoration and support efforts. Exelon employees also stepped up from the volunteer perspective. Our employees have donated their time and resources to communities impacted by the storms. We also had a number of our Constellation employees in Houston directly displaced by the storms, and to see coworkers come to their aid illustrates the value that we embody here at Exelon. 
Slide 18, we want to reinforce our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to our investors. We've continued to grow the utility's rate base at 6.5% and the regulated EPS to 6% to 8% annually through 2020, underpinning the capital investments that directly benefit the customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use free cash flow generated at the Genco to fund incremental equities at the utilities and pay down debt over the next 4 years at ExGen and the Holding Company. We are focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plant, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing our value through gen-to-load matching strategies. We continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit rate metrics and grow our dividend in a stable consistent manner. And as many of you are aware, our dividend growth program is for 2.5% annually from 2016 through 2018. We are working with our board and expect to provide an update on a multiyear outlook for the dividend growth plan as part of our planning and budgeting process that we're undertaking currently. 
Before I go to questions, I want to come back to where we started off in the call. We have a number of positives underlying our outlook. The utilities are growing and executing well. We are confident that the FERC actions around resiliency will facilitate needed power price reforms in PJM that will fairly compensate our generating assets. We continue to improve operations where we're finding ways to run our business more efficiently and taking out an additional $250 million in cost as discussed. And we're still on track to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow through 2020 at the ExGen that will support our utility growth, reduce our debt and facilitate growing our dividend. 
Thank you, again, for your interest, and now we're ready for your questions."

Yes, we are using the current forward curve for power. I think the basic thing to note in the retail side, and Jack said this in his script, when we did our planning at the first of the year, our renewal rates for C&I power were up close to 80%. As was the case back in 2012 and '13, we have seen a downturn in most renewal rates down close to the 70%. And we're marking this closer to that 70% number. I think the big thing though is back into '12 and '13, we saw power -- C&I power margins dipped below $2 per megawatt hour, and we've said historically, our origination margins for that business are somewhere between $2 and $4. We're still within that $2 to $4 range. So I think the big thing, the takeaway is, we're going to serve about $200 million-megawatt hours of load this year across our platform between retail and wholesale, and we expect to do the same thing next year. The thing is, we're just not going to achieve the growth that we expected in our C&I power business, and as Chris said and Jack said, the reason for that is, we don't think it's prudent to chase the market. And we're going to remain disciplined on what we think value is and that will serve us well historically and quite frankly, has allowed us to acquire companies a few times as well. So we'll continue to remain disciplined."

So we have the opportunity to capture any upside associated with price increases related to the reforms you're talking about. I think specifically though the retail, there's a couple of elements to that. The first one is, we've done some preliminary remodeling and we take into account kind of the seasonality as well as the differences between on and off peak. So we try to be more surgical in just saying we're going to buy back this. We have a view of the things we need to do. I think as it specifically relates to our retail contracts, there's 2 elements. One is, obviously, we have contracts from the books already. And we have some hedges on the books already, so there will be a feathering in effect to the value proposition of this. But most importantly, from our perspective, I think one of the things we offer our customers, and it's really important, is transparency. And what I mean by that is, when they're signing a contract with us, they completely understand what they're [indiscernible] and what the components of that are, whether they're fixed-price and the components that are going to be passed through in time. And I'm not sure that's always the case across the industry.

On the retail side, as we said, our renewal rates are lower than we expected them to be, but our margins are well within the range that we expect it. And that's very different when we had these challenges 5 years ago, where our margins and our renewal rates both dropped pretty appreciably. On the wholesale side, it's much more of a margin story, where the volumes are there but the margins are lower than they've been historically. I mean, it's a very competitive environment. Quite frankly, it's being driven by a lot of smaller players on the retail side and not the bigger players. On the wholesale side, we've seen kind of competition across the spectrum.

Now you know that's going to cycle during different growth periods, but that was the way we had the dividend set to grow. In the first couple of years, we were starting to get closer to that, giving that accomplished in the early 20s. And so that's when we came up with the growth policy at 2.5%. As you can see, the utilities are continuing to grow, although right now, it's taking cash infusion -- equity infusion from the Holdco through the Genco. But they're continuing to grow. So our stability of the dividend is very well anchored. Our growth -- potential growth for the dividend is well anchored. As we come through the last couple of years and started to see more reliable or consistent cash flows from the Genco on programs that compensate for the other benefits besides just the energy, you're seeing a potential that, that can be a dependable cash flow, that can be used for potential return of value to the shareholders. So that's the way we're looking at it, and we're presenting it to the board, that the cyclical nature of the commodity market will not leave us, but the certainty of certain elements on those revenue streams give us the opportunity to look at the world a little bit differently. So -- but that's how we'll continue to model it, and we've gained greater flexibility with programs like the ZEC."

If you've seen our fleeting, you know that we have a multiphase process where, in the first instance, we need to get analytics from the RTOs. Can they run without pipelines? What's the impact to the consumers? We can move from there to design basis for the system that we think is going to iterate between NERC, FERC and the Department of Energy for sometime after we get the data. In terms of how we ultimately implement that into the system, I think once we have the design basis, what we're trying to avoid, we will start looking at mitigation solutions, maybe the retention of additional fuel secured resources to avoid this outage risk. But I think it's premature to get there. One way you can think about is, though, if you take a look at the capacity performance program, we were able to value the cost of incremental reliability associated with dual fuel. So if the design basis ultimately ends up being we need 90 days of fuel, we have a mathematical way of calculating what's the market solution to get dual fuel resources to 90 days of fuel with it. That would probably the $8 or $10 of megawatt hour in terms of doing that, based on the cost we saw on CPAY. So that's one approach. But from our perspective, we need to drop back here, take a look at the data, make sure we have the right definition of resiliency, the right design basis and then we could come back to market solutions or other solutions that will ensure we have the resources to mitigate that risk and provide the security we need to provide for our customers and the nation."

Our adjusted EPS was $0.85 as well, reaching the midpoint of our guidance. Strong utility and Genco performance more than offset headwinds from the mild summer weather that impacted our PECO ACE utilities as well as volumes at Constellation. As we head into year-end, we have a lot to be encouraged about. Our regulatory utilities are continuing to execute very well, running ahead of plan for the year, and operationally, we're performing in quarter top quartile across most performance measures.
We are registering significant improvements at PHI, even relative to last year. We are doing exactly what we said we would do as part of our merger commitments, improving performance and reliability for our customers. We are executing on our CapEx program for 2017. We're excited about the valuable technologies investments we are deploying to our customers' benefit.
The FERC is making strides to address pressing resiliency needs for the power system, and we see that in a 2-step process, starting with empowering PJM to fix deficiencies in the power price formation by the summer of 2018, and then a longer-term FERC process to address resiliency.
The Department of Energy's Section 403 filing noted the flaws in the current price formation are part of the reason that nuclear units, the most resilient and cost-effective 0 emission resources in PJM, are being lost to premature retirements. Given our size of our PJM fleet, each dollar or megawatt hour of distortion caused by a flawed market design undermines the Genco's economics by approximately $135 million per year on an unhedged basis. We believe that DOE's focus on price formation will lead to a successful process at FERC that will eliminate these distortions by the summer of 2018. We have not reflected the value of these reforms in our forecast that we are showing you today, but we do believe they could be a significant positive for us starting in 2018.
Finally, we are executing on our management plan, focused on strengthening our operation and continuing to find efficiencies. To that end, we lowered our cost by $250 million on a run-rate basis in 2020, primarily at the Genco, including today's announcement we're in a cost -- our O&M cost, versus planned by over $700 million annually from initiatives identified since 2015.
We continue to challenge our businesses to evaluate cost, and today's announcement savings are part of that ongoing effort.
We're confident in our previous announced plan to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow at the Genco through 2020. That will fund our utility growth, grow the dividend and meet our debt reduction commitments. It is this deliberate work that positions us well to face some headwinds. After a series of mild summers and winters, we have seen decline in power market volatility, which is weighing on the forward price -- power prices, impacting the Constellation business. Just as we experienced during periods of low volatility, we're again seeing less discipline by some of the wholesale and retail competitors in the market as they become more aggressive with their pricing. We have been through low discipline, low volatility periods before, and they end up in the same way. Those without discipline fail. That is when we can grow our market share by winning business at good margins or acquiring low businesses offered for sale.
We expect volatility to return to the markets with normal weather conditions, which will benefit our Constellation and Generation business. In the meantime, we'll remain disciplined in our bidding strategy and remain behind our ratable hedging in our Generation.
Last week, the Illinois power authority shifted its schedule for finalizing the procurement of the Illinois ZEC contracts by 1 month, from late December 2017 to late January of 2018.
Based on our assumptions, this delay will shift $0.09 of EPS from 2017 to 2018. Even with the unanticipated EPS shift, we're narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.55 to $2.75 per share, keeping us on path to the midpoint of our original guidance at the utilities -- as the utilities outperformed our plan.
Moving on to Slide 6, I want to highlight our excellent operational performance for the quarter. The color block chart continues to show strong quartile -- top quartile performance across all of the utilities in most categories, and particularly want to call out the tremendous improvements at PHI compared to last year. With the 22% improvement in reliability, with PHI on track for their best year ever in reliability and a 17% improvement in speed of restoration of outages. Performance improvements like these really highlight the benefit going to our customers with the integration of PHI into Exelon. And finally, as in prior quarters, our best-in-class nuclear power fleets performed with very high reliability in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Now let me turn to the proposed rule issued by Secretary Perry in September. The order is aimed at protecting our customers from outages resulting from man-made and natural interruptions on the gas system by preserving resilient generation sources, including nuclear. We commend the Secretary for focusing attention on the need to reform the energy market and ensure that our customers continue to benefit from a resilient system. FERC is currently considering the DOE's proposal, with the first round of comments filed on October 21, reply comments due on November 7 and a final order scheduled for December 11.
We have shared our perspective on this important policy initiative. First, we think the FERC should direct PJM to evaluate and correct any deficiencies they see in energy price formation which have put baseload generation assets at a disadvantage. We believe timely action on price formation could be implemented by as early as mid-2018. These reforms will be valuable first step in preserving resilient baseload generation as well as delivering economic and environmental benefits that nuclear power uniquely provides. We expect 135 terawatt hours of our generation output in PJM to benefit from price uplift that will layer in over the coming years as the existing hedges roll off.
Second, we think FERC can take on -- take the time to fully evaluate market reforms that will ensure power supply resiliency. This is a multifaceted exercise that should take into account the cost and impact to our customers and economy of the long-term interruption of a natural gas fuel supply -- interruption of the natural gas and fuel supply. We believe these are important issues that need to be addressed for our country's future, but they require more analysis to ensure the right reforms are implemented. We are encouraged by the process being made at FERC and PJM, support for price-formation changes. Between these efforts and state initiatives, we're optimistic about the path to preserve nuclear power plants and their critical economic, environmental and reliability roles that they have in the communities that we serve.
I'll now turn the call over to Jack to take us through the numbers."
296181,539712575,1330541,"Exelon Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon's utilities less h",2090,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.
Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon's utilities less holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.49 per share. Versus our plan, utility results were slightly favorable due to lower O&M and reduced storm activity over the third quarter. Generation earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was hurt by mild weather that reduced Constellation load volumes and a lack of price volatility, which reduced optimization opportunities. We did offset some weakness with payable O&M timing.
Turning to Slide 9. Our $0.85 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.06 per share lower than the third quarter of 2016. Overall, utilities benefited from improved earned ROEs and higher rate base, partly offset by adverse year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down primarily on lower power prices, lower load volumes due to mild weather and fewer optimization opportunities, partially offset by the addition of New York ZEC revenue and higher capacity prices.
Turning to Slide 10. We are updating our 2017 guidance range. We had expected the Illinois Power Authority to finalize procurement for the ZEC programs in December, which based on our assumptions, would have contributed $0.09 of EPS in 2017 since the revenues are retroactive to the beginning of the program on June 1. However, last week, the Illinois Power Authority updated their schedule pushing the final contract date to January 30, 2018. The delayed timing has no impact on the amount we expect to receive or our free cash flow outlook. But it will change the timing of earnings recognition, shifting EPS into 2018. With that in mind, we are updating our 2017 EPS guidance range, tightening the top and bottom of the range by $0.05. So we're now at $2.55 to $2.75 per share. The strong performance of utilities is allowing us to still target the midpoint of our original guidance range absorbing the $0.09 of ZEC timing impact.
Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter in addition to the robust operational performance Chris already discussed.
Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, we saw improvement at PHI compared to last quarter across all jurisdictions except ACE, where they rolled off favorable weather in the third quarter of 2016 for the less beneficial summer weather this year. Our efforts to improve operations and the contributions from rate cases resolved over the past year are driving a better-earned ROEs at PHI. For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10% but abated a bit from the last quarter with the less favorable year-over-year weather impacts at ComEd and PECO that you can see on Slide 9's waterfall.
Overall, Exelon utilities ROEs are still nearly 10%, including PHI. We're proud of the performance of our overall utility business, and we still see opportunity to improve our returns at the PHI utilities as we bring their performance to levels more consistent with the rest of our utilities.
On Slide 12, we update the status of our rate cases. At Atlantic City Electric, we reached a settlement for the second case in a row. This settlement provides a 4% rate increase, with new rates implemented earlier than what would have occurred if the case was fully litigated. The timing rate making in New Jersey is helping us make beneficial investments for our customers. While still a work in progress, the investments are having an impact, with outages down 33% and average customer outage time down 35% compared to 2011. We also received an order for Pepco Maryland that granted an electric distribution base rate increase of $32.4 million based on an allowed ROE of 9.5%. The approved electric delivery rates became effective on October 20, 2017. We filed rate cases in the third quarter for Delmarva Delaware Electric and Gas and expect orders by the third quarter of 2018. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's earned ROEs for allowed levels while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on Slides 34 through 42 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 13. We regularly update you on our progress on the regulatory front, but another essential aspect of the business is effectively deploying capital on behalf of our customers. We're currently on course to deploy our targeted $5.3 billion of capital in 2017. We've highlighted on this slide 2 of the many notable projects we're developing to benefit our communities and customers. The first is Pepco's Waterfront Substation. This substation is part of the larger Capital Grid project and is currently under construction with expected completion in 2017. Once complete, it will improve reliability to existing customers and support the planned growth in the Capitol Riverfront and Southwest Waterfront areas for the next 20 to 30 years. The other project I'd like to highlight is ComEd's Grand Prairie Gateway transmission line that was energized earlier this year. It's a $200 million, 60 mile-long transmission line in Northern Illinois that provides structural benefits to the market, resulting in lower energy and congestion charges to customers and an increased import capability of approximately 1,000 megawatts. Over the next 15 years, customers collectively will save over $120 million, and carbon emissions will be reduced by nearly 500,000 tons. These are just a couple examples of how we continue to invest prudently across all our utilities and look forward to sharing more as we go forward.
Slide 14 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. Before I get into the market developments impacting gross margins, let me first discuss the impacts from the shifts in revenue recognition for the Illinois ZECs from 2017 to 2018, which we also show in the waterfalls on Slide 21 in the Appendix.
The capacity in ZEC line declines by $150 million in 2017 and increases by $150 million in 2018, offset by $50 million in other capacity declines, which I'll discuss in a moment. The rest of the bars helped to then isolate movements in underlying gross margin not related to ZEC timing.
In 2017, gross margin is down $50 million compared to last quarter, largely reflecting the effect of the mild summer and reduced optimization opportunities. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generation to load matching strategy.
Turning to 2018 and 2019. Separate from the Illinois ZEC timing, our gross margin is down $200 million for each year and can be bucketed into 2 categories. The first relates [indiscernible] business in our unhedged power position. We're lowering our assumptions from MISO and New York capacity prices based on recent spot year options and bilateral deals in the market. This lower the capacity in ZEC line by $50 million on a rounded basis from last quarter. For 2018, the line shows up as a positive $100 million after the timing uplift from $150 million of Illinois ZECs, while the $15 million decline in 2019 just reflects the lower outlook for the past 2 revenues. During the third quarter, we also saw declines in energy prices, including some adverse news and basis differentials in the PJM East's sum, which costs another $50 million in 2018 and '19. However, with the recent rally in power prices, we have already recovered about half of the $100 million of 2019 gross margin declines for Generation. We also see a $100 million decline in gross margins in 2018 and 2019 from the Constellation business, reflected in the lower powered new business to go line. A series of mild summers and winters have contributed to reduced power market volatility, which in turn is impacting the competitiveness of our load business. As we've witnessed in prior periods of low price volatility, some of our competitors are mispricing risk in an effort to win business. In the wholesale load business, we're seeing other players mispricing risk as we consider the market risk from weather volatility, basis variability and the likely impact of energy market reforms that Chris talked about earlier. Against this backdrop, we are clearing at margins near the low end of historical realizations.
In the C&I business, the consolidation of suppliers since the polar vortex has led to better margin discipline with our unit margins holding consistent with prior years. We are, however, seeing lower renewal rates compared to last couple of years, moving from something closer to 80% to the low 70s. At these lower renewal rates, we still expect our volumes to be flat year-over-year, whereas our previous guidance assumed higher renewal rates that will drive volume growth to Constellation from 2018 and 2019. Notably, even against a challenged market backdrop, we're holding volumes and margins flat, which is a testament to the strength of our retail platform and our disciplined approach to bidding business. The updated gross margins for 2018 and '19 incorporate C&I renewal rates in the low 70s and wholesale margins hovering around the bottom end of what we've realized over time. We've been through these periods of low load pricing -- lower load pricing in the past and has previously created opportunities for us. A return to normal weather will inject some power market volatility, which will positively impact forward power prices for Generation. Retailers and wholesalers who misprice risk have consistently been driven from the business when we go from a period of low volatility to a volatility event. When the market corrects, we'll be there to win business at good margins and grow volumes and market share, just as we had in the past.
Even against the current market backdrop, Constellation continues to generate strong earnings and free cash flow. Our gen-to-load matching strategy remains a competitive advantage relative to our peers, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our generation output to market in a disciplined manner. From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. Spot natural gas prices this year are $3 per Mcf, which is $0.50 higher than last year in spite of mild weather this past winter and summer. However, these higher prices have provided only modest uplift to spot power prices this summer, while the forward prices have decreased slightly. We think that a return to more normal weather and volatility in the market will help reverse this. And as Chris discussed, we see a path to power market reforms that represent real value uplift for us. We're maintaining additional link to be able to monetize these reforms.
Turning to Slide 15. We continually challenge our organization to find operating efficiencies and focus on managing our cost. To that end, we're announcing another wave of O&M cost reductions, building on previous years' efforts. We will ramp these new initiatives over the next 2 years, as shown on the lower-right table, reaching a $250 million annual run rate in 2020. The savings will come primarily from ExGen and the corporate center. If you look at this initiative, together with the programs we've announced since 2015, we'll strip out over $700 million of annual run rate cost, providing significant earnings and free cash flow benefits.
Turning to Slide 16. We appreciate that there have been many puts and takes this year at ExGen that have both benefited and weighed on our free cash flow outlook through 2020. When we take into account the movement in power price forwards through the end of October, updated gross margin outlook for Constellation, the benefit of further cost cuts, the early closure of TMI and exit of the EGTP plants and changes to base CapEx and working capital associated with all these business updates, we remain confident in the free cash flow outlook and capital allocation commitments we made at the beginning of the year. We're also committed to meeting or beating our 3x debt-to-EBITDA target for ExGen's balance sheet, which we will meet over our planning horizon. On the fourth quarter call, we will roll forward the free cash flow outlook for the next planning period.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

Turning to Slide 17, I want to take a moment to highlight the contributions made by Exelon and our employees to help the impact of -- by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Exelon utilities sent more than 2,200 employees and contractors and support personnel from our 6 utilities to help with the recovery efforts after Hurricane Irma. Our crews traveled to Florida and Georgia where they, for more than 2 weeks, worked in very difficult conditions. We're very proud of our employees and the hard work that they do to help the communities come back from -- after these disasters. A very special thanks to all those who helped in the restoration and support efforts. Exelon employees also stepped up from a volunteer perspective. Our employees have donated their time and resources to communities impacted by the storms. We also had a number of our Constellation employees in Houston directly displaced by the storms, and to see coworkers come to their aid illustrates the value that we embody here at Exelon.
Slide 18, we want to reinforce our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to our investors. We've continued to grow the utility's rate base at 6.5% and the regulated EPS to 6% to 8% annually through 2020, underpinning the capital investments that directly benefit the customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use free cash flow generated at the Genco to fund incremental equities at the utilities and pay down debt over the next 4 years at ExGen and the holding company. We are focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plant, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing our value through gen-to-load matching strategies. We continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit rate metrics and grow our dividend in a stable consistent manner. And as many of you are aware, our dividend growth program is for 2.5% annually from 2016 through 2018. We are working with our board and expect to provide an update on a multiyear outlook for the dividend growth plan as part of our planning and budgeting process that we're undertaking currently.
Before I go to questions, I want to come back to where we started off in the call. We have a number of positives underlying our outlook. The utilities are growing and executing well. We are confident that the FERC actions around resiliency will facilitate needed power price reforms in PJM that will fairly compensate our generating assets. We continue to improve operations where we're finding ways to run our business more efficiently and taking out an additional $250 million in cost as discussed. And we're still on track to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow through 2020 at the ExGen that will support our utility growth, reduce our debt and facilitate growing our dividend.

So we have the opportunity to capture any upside associated with price increases related to the reforms you're talking about.

The first one is, we've done some preliminary modeling and we take into account kind of the seasonality as well as the differences between on and off peak. So we try to be more surgical in just saying we're going to buy back this. We have a view of the things we need to do. I think as it specifically relates to our retail contracts, there's 2 elements. One is, obviously, we have contracts on the books already. And we have some hedges on the books already, so there will be a feathering in effect to the value proposition of this. But most importantly, from our perspective, I think one of the things we offer our customers, and it's really important, is transparency. And what I mean by that is, when they're signing a contract with us, they completely understand what they're [indiscernible] and what the components of that are that are fixed-price and the components that are going to be passed through in time. And I'm not sure that's always the case across the industry. So from our perspective, there's a lot of elements, and we are thinking about it, and we are really managing our portfolio from a natural long position as well as the seasonality in the products, and we're keeping the customer in mind."

On the retail side, as we said, our renewal rates are lower than we expected them to be, but our margins are well within the range that we expect it. And that's very different when we had these challenges 5 years ago, where our margins and our renewal rates both dropped pretty appreciably. On the wholesale side, it's much more of a margin story, where the volumes are there but the margins are lower than they've been historically. I mean, it's a very competitive environment. Quite frankly, it's being driven by a lot of smaller players on the retail side and not the bigger players. On the wholesale side, we've seen kind of competition across the spectrum.

So as we've talked about 4 years ago, 4.5 years ago now, as we restructure the dividend and put our strategy and our focus on really growing the utility business through the acquisition of BGE and then the acquisition of PHI, and it was to theoretically watch the growth in those businesses and have a 70% -- 65% to 75% dividend policy, theoretically, at the utilities. Now you know that's going to cycle during different growth periods, but that was the way we had the dividend set to grow. In the first couple of years, we were starting to get closer to that, giving that accomplished in the early 20s. And so that's when we came up with the growth policy at 2.5%. As you can see, the utilities are continuing to grow, although right now, it's taking cash infusion -- equity infusion from the holdco through the Genco. But they're continuing to grow. So our stability of the dividend is very well anchored. Our growth -- potential growth for the dividend is well anchored. As we come through the last couple of years and started to see more reliable or consistent cash flows from the Genco on programs that compensate for the other benefits besides just the energy, you're seeing a potential that, that can be a dependable cash flow, that can be used for potential return of value to the shareholders. So that's the way we're looking at it, and we're presenting it to the board, that the cyclical nature of the commodity market will not leave us, but the certainty of certain elements on those revenue streams give us the opportunity to look at the world a little bit differently. So -- but that's how we'll continue to model it, and we've gained greater flexibility with programs like the ZEC."

If you've seen our pleading, you know that we have a multiphase process where, in the first instance, we need to get analytics from the RTOs. Can they run without pipelines? What's the impact to the consumers? We can move from there to design basis for the system that we think is going to iterate between NERC, FERC and the Department of Energy for some time after we get the data. In terms of how we ultimately implement that into the system, I think once we have the design basis, what we're trying to avoid, we will start looking at mitigation solutions, maybe the retention of additional fuel secured resources to avoid this outage risk. But I think it's premature to get there. One way you can think about, though, if you take a look at the capacity performance program, we were able to value the cost of incremental reliability associated with dual fuel. So if the design basis ultimately ends up being we need 90 days of fuel, we have a mathematical way of calculating what the market solution to get dual fuel resources to 90 days of fuel would be. That would probably the $8 or $10 of megawatt hour in terms of doing that, based on the cost we saw on CPAY. So that's one approach. But from our perspective, we need to drop back here, take a look at the data, make sure we have the right definition of resiliency, the right design basis and then we could come back to market solutions or other solutions that will ensure we have the resources to mitigate that risk and provide the security we need to provide for our customers and the nation."

Our adjusted EPS was $0.85 as well, reaching the midpoint of our guidance. Strong utility and Genco performance more than offset headwinds from the mild summer weather that impacted our PECO ACE utilities as well as volumes at Constellation. As we head into year-end, we have a lot to be encouraged about. Our regulatory utilities are continuing to execute very well, running ahead of plan for the year, and operationally, we're performing in quarter top quartile across most performance measures.
We are registering significant improvements at PHI, even relative to last year. We are doing exactly what we said we would do as part of our merger commitments, improving performance and reliability for our customers. We are executing on our CapEx program for 2017. We're excited about the valuable technologies investments we are deploying to our customers' benefit.
The FERC is making strides to address pressing resiliency needs for the power system, and we see that in a 2-step process, starting with empowering PJM to fix deficiencies in the power price formation by the summer of 2018, and then a longer-term FERC process to address resiliency.
The Department of Energy's Section 403 filing noted the flaws in the current price formation are part of the reason that nuclear units, the most resilient and cost-effective 0 emission resources in PJM, are being lost to premature retirements. Given our size of our PJM fleet, each dollar or megawatt hour of distortion caused by a flawed market design undermines the Genco's economics by approximately $135 million per year on an unhedged basis. We believe that DOE's focus on price formation will lead to a successful process at FERC that will eliminate these distortions by the summer of 2018. We have not reflected the value of these reforms in our forecast that we are showing you today, but we do believe they could be a significant positive for us starting in 2018.
Finally, we are executing on our management plan, focused on strengthening our operation and continuing to find efficiencies. To that end, we lowered our cost by $250 million on a run-rate basis in 2020, primarily at the Genco, including today's announcement we're in a cost -- our O&M cost, versus planned by over $700 million annually from initiatives identified since 2015.
We continue to challenge our businesses to evaluate cost, and today's announcement savings are part of that ongoing effort.
We're confident in our previous announced plan to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow at the Genco through 2020. That will fund our utility growth, grow the dividend and meet our debt reduction commitments. It is this deliberate work that positions us well to face some headwinds. After a series of mild summers and winters, we have seen decline in power market volatility, which is weighing on the forward price -- power prices, impacting the Constellation business. Just as we experienced during periods of low volatility, we're again seeing less discipline by some of the wholesale and retail competitors in the market as they become more aggressive with their pricing. We have been through low discipline, low volatility periods before, and they end up in the same way. Those without discipline fail. That is when we can grow our market share by winning business at good margins or acquiring low businesses offered for sale.
We expect volatility to return to the markets with normal weather conditions, which will benefit our Constellation and Generation business. In the meantime, we'll remain disciplined in our bidding strategy and remain behind our ratable hedging in our Generation.
Last week, the Illinois power authority shifted its schedule for finalizing the procurement of the Illinois ZEC contracts by 1 month, from late December 2017 to late January of 2018.
Based on our assumptions, this delay will shift $0.09 of EPS from 2017 to 2018. Even with the unanticipated EPS shift, we're narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.55 to $2.75 per share, keeping us on path to the midpoint of our original guidance at the utilities -- as the utilities outperformed our plan.
Moving on to Slide 6, I want to highlight our excellent operational performance for the quarter. The color block chart continues to show strong quartile -- top quartile performance across all of the utilities in most categories, and particularly want to call out the tremendous improvements at PHI compared to last year. With the 22% improvement in reliability, with PHI on track for their best year ever in reliability and a 17% improvement in speed of restoration of outages. Performance improvements like these really highlight the benefit going to our customers with the integration of PHI into Exelon. And finally, as in prior quarters, our best-in-class nuclear power fleets performed with very high reliability in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 7. Now let me turn to the proposed rule issued by Secretary Perry in September. The order is aimed at protecting our customers from outages resulting from man-made and natural interruptions on the gas system by preserving resilient generation sources, including nuclear. We commend the Secretary for focusing attention on the need to reform the energy market and ensure that our customers continue to benefit from a resilient system. FERC is currently considering the DOE's proposal, with the first round of comments filed on October 21, reply comments due on November 7 and a final order scheduled for December 11.
We have shared our perspective on this important policy initiative. First, we think the FERC should direct PJM to evaluate and correct any deficiencies they see in energy price formation which have put baseload generation assets at a disadvantage. We believe timely action on price formation could be implemented by as early as mid-2018. These reforms will be valuable first step in preserving resilient baseload generation as well as delivering economic and environmental benefits that nuclear power uniquely provides. We expect 135 terawatt hours of our generation output in PJM to benefit from price uplift that will layer in over the coming years as the existing hedges roll off.
Second, we think FERC can take on -- take the time to fully evaluate market reforms that will ensure power supply resiliency. This is a multifaceted exercise that should take into account the cost and impact to our customers and economy of the long-term interruption of a natural gas fuel supply -- interruption of the natural gas and fuel supply. We believe these are important issues that need to be addressed for our country's future, but they require more analysis to ensure the right reforms are implemented. We are encouraged by the process being made at FERC and PJM, support for price-formation changes. Between these efforts and state initiatives, we're optimistic about the path to preserve nuclear power plants and their critical economic, environmental and reliability roles that they have in the communities that we serve.
I'll now turn the call over to Jack to take us through the numbers."
296181,539712575,1333389,"Exelon Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon's utilities less h",2090,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.
Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon's utilities less holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.49 per share. Versus our plan, utility results were slightly favorable due to lower O&M and reduced storm activity over the third quarter. Generation earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was hurt by mild weather that reduced Constellation load volumes and a lack of price volatility, which reduced optimization opportunities. We did offset some weakness with payable O&M timing.
Turning to Slide 9. Our $0.85 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.06 per share lower than the third quarter of 2016. Overall, utilities benefited from improved earned ROEs and higher rate base, partly offset by adverse year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down primarily on lower power prices, lower load volumes due to mild weather and fewer optimization opportunities, partially offset by the addition of New York ZEC revenue and higher capacity prices.
Turning to Slide 10. We are updating our 2017 guidance range. We had expected the Illinois Power Authority to finalize procurement for the ZEC programs in December, which based on our assumptions, would have contributed $0.09 of EPS in 2017 since the revenues are retroactive to the beginning of the program on June 1. However, last week, the Illinois Power Authority updated their schedule pushing the final contract date to January 30, 2018. The delayed timing has no impact on the amount we expect to receive or our free cash flow outlook. But it will change the timing of earnings recognition, shifting EPS into 2018. With that in mind, we are updating our 2017 EPS guidance range, tightening the top and bottom of the range by $0.05. So we're now at $2.55 to $2.75 per share. The strong performance of utilities is allowing us to still target the midpoint of our original guidance range absorbing the $0.09 of ZEC timing impact.
Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter in addition to the robust operational performance Chris already discussed.
Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, we saw improvement at PHI compared to last quarter across all jurisdictions except ACE, where they rolled off favorable weather in the third quarter of 2016 for the less beneficial summer weather this year. Our efforts to improve operations and the contributions from rate cases resolved over the past year are driving a better-earned ROEs at PHI. For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10% but abated a bit from the last quarter with the less favorable year-over-year weather impacts at ComEd and PECO that you can see on Slide 9's waterfall.
Overall, Exelon utilities ROEs are still nearly 10%, including PHI. We're proud of the performance of our overall utility business, and we still see opportunity to improve our returns at the PHI utilities as we bring their performance to levels more consistent with the rest of our utilities.
On Slide 12, we update the status of our rate cases. At Atlantic City Electric, we reached a settlement for the second case in a row. This settlement provides a 4% rate increase, with new rates implemented earlier than what would have occurred if the case was fully litigated. The timing rate making in New Jersey is helping us make beneficial investments for our customers. While still a work in progress, the investments are having an impact, with outages down 33% and average customer outage time down 35% compared to 2011. We also received an order for Pepco Maryland that granted an electric distribution base rate increase of $32.4 million based on an allowed ROE of 9.5%. The approved electric delivery rates became effective on October 20, 2017. We filed rate cases in the third quarter for Delmarva Delaware Electric and Gas and expect orders by the third quarter of 2018. We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's earned ROEs for allowed levels while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on Slides 34 through 42 in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 13. We regularly update you on our progress on the regulatory front, but another essential aspect of the business is effectively deploying capital on behalf of our customers. We're currently on course to deploy our targeted $5.3 billion of capital in 2017. We've highlighted on this slide 2 of the many notable projects we're developing to benefit our communities and customers. The first is Pepco's Waterfront Substation. This substation is part of the larger Capital Grid project and is currently under construction with expected completion in 2017. Once complete, it will improve reliability to existing customers and support the planned growth in the Capitol Riverfront and Southwest Waterfront areas for the next 20 to 30 years. The other project I'd like to highlight is ComEd's Grand Prairie Gateway transmission line that was energized earlier this year. It's a $200 million, 60 mile-long transmission line in Northern Illinois that provides structural benefits to the market, resulting in lower energy and congestion charges to customers and an increased import capability of approximately 1,000 megawatts. Over the next 15 years, customers collectively will save over $120 million, and carbon emissions will be reduced by nearly 500,000 tons. These are just a couple examples of how we continue to invest prudently across all our utilities and look forward to sharing more as we go forward.
Slide 14 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. Before I get into the market developments impacting gross margins, let me first discuss the impacts from the shifts in revenue recognition for the Illinois ZECs from 2017 to 2018, which we also show in the waterfalls on Slide 21 in the Appendix.
The capacity in ZEC line declines by $150 million in 2017 and increases by $150 million in 2018, offset by $50 million in other capacity declines, which I'll discuss in a moment. The rest of the bars helped to then isolate movements in underlying gross margin not related to ZEC timing.
In 2017, gross margin is down $50 million compared to last quarter, largely reflecting the effect of the mild summer and reduced optimization opportunities. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced on our generation to load matching strategy.
Turning to 2018 and 2019. Separate from the Illinois ZEC timing, our gross margin is down $200 million for each year and can be bucketed into 2 categories. The first relates [indiscernible] business in our unhedged power position. We're lowering our assumptions from MISO and New York capacity prices based on recent spot year options and bilateral deals in the market. This lower the capacity in ZEC line by $50 million on a rounded basis from last quarter. For 2018, the line shows up as a positive $100 million after the timing uplift from $150 million of Illinois ZECs, while the $15 million decline in 2019 just reflects the lower outlook for the past 2 revenues. During the third quarter, we also saw declines in energy prices, including some adverse news and basis differentials in the PJM East's sum, which costs another $50 million in 2018 and '19. However, with the recent rally in power prices, we have already recovered about half of the $100 million of 2019 gross margin declines for Generation. We also see a $100 million decline in gross margins in 2018 and 2019 from the Constellation business, reflected in the lower powered new business to go line. A series of mild summers and winters have contributed to reduced power market volatility, which in turn is impacting the competitiveness of our load business. As we've witnessed in prior periods of low price volatility, some of our competitors are mispricing risk in an effort to win business. In the wholesale load business, we're seeing other players mispricing risk as we consider the market risk from weather volatility, basis variability and the likely impact of energy market reforms that Chris talked about earlier. Against this backdrop, we are clearing at margins near the low end of historical realizations.
In the C&I business, the consolidation of suppliers since the polar vortex has led to better margin discipline with our unit margins holding consistent with prior years. We are, however, seeing lower renewal rates compared to last couple of years, moving from something closer to 80% to the low 70s. At these lower renewal rates, we still expect our volumes to be flat year-over-year, whereas our previous guidance assumed higher renewal rates that will drive volume growth to Constellation from 2018 and 2019. Notably, even against a challenged market backdrop, we're holding volumes and margins flat, which is a testament to the strength of our retail platform and our disciplined approach to bidding business. The updated gross margins for 2018 and '19 incorporate C&I renewal rates in the low 70s and wholesale margins hovering around the bottom end of what we've realized over time. We've been through these periods of low load pricing -- lower load pricing in the past and has previously created opportunities for us. A return to normal weather will inject some power market volatility, which will positively impact forward power prices for Generation. Retailers and wholesalers who misprice risk have consistently been driven from the business when we go from a period of low volatility to a volatility event. When the market corrects, we'll be there to win business at good margins and grow volumes and market share, just as we had in the past.
Even against the current market backdrop, Constellation continues to generate strong earnings and free cash flow. Our gen-to-load matching strategy remains a competitive advantage relative to our peers, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our generation output to market in a disciplined manner. From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals. Spot natural gas prices this year are $3 per Mcf, which is $0.50 higher than last year in spite of mild weather this past winter and summer. However, these higher prices have provided only modest uplift to spot power prices this summer, while the forward prices have decreased slightly. We think that a return to more normal weather and volatility in the market will help reverse this. And as Chris discussed, we see a path to power market reforms that represent real value uplift for us. We're maintaining additional link to be able to monetize these reforms.
Turning to Slide 15. We continually challenge our organization to find operating efficiencies and focus on managing our cost. To that end, we're announcing another wave of O&M cost reductions, building on previous years' efforts. We will ramp these new initiatives over the next 2 years, as shown on the lower-right table, reaching a $250 million annual run rate in 2020. The savings will come primarily from ExGen and the corporate center. If you look at this initiative, together with the programs we've announced since 2015, we'll strip out over $700 million of annual run rate cost, providing significant earnings and free cash flow benefits.
Turning to Slide 16. We appreciate that there have been many puts and takes this year at ExGen that have both benefited and weighed on our free cash flow outlook through 2020. When we take into account the movement in power price forwards through the end of October, updated gross margin outlook for Constellation, the benefit of further cost cuts, the early closure of TMI and exit of the EGTP plants and changes to base CapEx and working capital associated with all these business updates, we remain confident in the free cash flow outlook and capital allocation commitments we made at the beginning of the year. We're also committed to meeting or beating our 3x debt-to-EBITDA target for ExGen's balance sheet, which we will meet over our planning horizon. On the fourth quarter call, we will roll forward the free cash flow outlook for the next planning period.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Chris."

Turning to Slide 17, I want to take a moment to highlight the contributions made by Exelon and our employees to help the impact of -- by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Exelon utilities sent more than 2,200 employees and contractors and support personnel from our 6 utilities to help with the recovery efforts after Hurricane Irma. Our crews traveled to Florida and Georgia where they, for more than 2 weeks, worked in very difficult conditions. We're very proud of our employees and the hard work that they do to help the communities come back from -- after these disasters. A very special thanks to all those who helped in the restoration and support efforts. Exelon employees also stepped up from a volunteer perspective. Our employees have donated their time and resources to communities impacted by the storms. We also had a number of our Constellation employees in Houston directly displaced by the storms, and to see coworkers come to their aid illustrates the value that we embody here at Exelon.
Slide 18, we want to reinforce our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to our investors. We've continued to grow the utility's rate base at 6.5% and the regulated EPS to 6% to 8% annually through 2020, underpinning the capital investments that directly benefit the customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use free cash flow generated at the Genco to fund incremental equities at the utilities and pay down debt over the next 4 years at ExGen and the holding company. We are focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plant, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing our value through gen-to-load matching strategies. We continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit rate metrics and grow our dividend in a stable consistent manner. And as many of you are aware, our dividend growth program is for 2.5% annually from 2016 through 2018. We are working with our board and expect to provide an update on a multiyear outlook for the dividend growth plan as part of our planning and budgeting process that we're undertaking currently.
Before I go to questions, I want to come back to where we started off in the call. We have a number of positives underlying our outlook. The utilities are growing and executing well. We are confident that the FERC actions around resiliency will facilitate needed power price reforms in PJM that will fairly compensate our generating assets. We continue to improve operations where we're finding ways to run our business more efficiently and taking out an additional $250 million in cost as discussed. And we're still on track to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow through 2020 at the ExGen that will support our utility growth, reduce our debt and facilitate growing our dividend.
Thank you, again, for your interest, and now we're ready for your questions."

Yes, we are using the current forward curve for power. I think the big thing to note in the retail side, and Jack said this in his script, when we did our planning at the first of the year, our renewal rates for C&I power were up close to 80%. As was the case back in 2012 and '13, we have seen a downturn in most renewal rates down close to the 70%. And we're marking this closer to that 70% number. I think the big thing though is back in '12 and '13, we saw power -- C&I power margins dip below $2 per megawatt hour, and we've said historically, our origination margins for that business are somewhere between $2 and $4. We're still within that $2 to $4 range. So I think the big thing, the takeaway, is, we're going to serve about 200 million megawatt hours of load this year across our platform between retail and wholesale, and we expect to do the same thing next year. The thing is, we're just not going to achieve the growth that we expected in our C&I power business, and as Chris said and Jack said, the reason for that is, we don't think it's prudent to chase the market. And we're going to remain disciplined on what we think value is and that will serve us well historically and quite frankly, has allowed us to acquire companies a few times as well. So we'll continue to remain disciplined."

So we try to be more surgical in just saying we're going to buy back this. We have a view of the things we need to do. I think as it specifically relates to our retail contracts, there's 2 elements. One is, obviously, we have contracts on the books already. And we have some hedges on the books already, so there will be a feathering in effect to the value proposition of this.

When you look at it, it's really all driven by our load business. About 60% of it is on our retail C&I business and about 40% is associated with our wholesale polar business and there's really 2 elements that is different, one on each side. On the retail side, as we said, our renewal rates are lower than we expected them to be, but our margins are well within the range that we expect it. And that's very different when we had these challenges 5 years ago, where our margins and our renewal rates both dropped pretty appreciably. On the wholesale side, it's much more of a margin story, where the volumes are there but the margins are lower than they've been historically. I mean, it's a very competitive environment. Quite frankly, it's being driven by a lot of smaller players on the retail side and not the bigger players. On the wholesale side, we've seen kind of competition across the spectrum. But we're confident that we've captured the changes we need to make."

But with respect to the dividend, how do you think about the stability of cash in the various businesses?

So as we've talked about 4 years ago, 4.5 years ago now, as we restructure the dividend and put our strategy and our focus on really growing the utility business through the acquisition of BGE and then the acquisition of PHI, and it was to theoretically watch the growth in those businesses and have a 70% -- 65% to 75% dividend policy, theoretically, at the utilities. Now you know that's going to cycle during different growth periods, but that was the way we had the dividend set to grow. In the first couple of years, we were starting to get closer to that, giving that accomplished in the early 20s. And so that's when we came up with the growth policy at 2.5%. As you can see, the utilities are continuing to grow, although right now, it's taking cash infusion -- equity infusion from the holdco through the Genco. But they're continuing to grow. So our stability of the dividend is very well anchored. Our growth -- potential growth for the dividend is well anchored. As we come through the last couple of years and started to see more reliable or consistent cash flows from the Genco on programs that compensate for the other benefits besides just the energy, you're seeing a potential that, that can be a dependable cash flow, that can be used for potential return of value to the shareholders. So that's the way we're looking at it, and we're presenting it to the board, that the cyclical nature of the commodity market will not leave us, but the certainty of certain elements on those revenue streams give us the opportunity to look at the world a little bit differently. So -- but that's how we'll continue to model it, and we've gained greater flexibility with programs like the ZEC."

The advent of digitalization of the distribution system and the transmission system has offered us an opportunity for capital investments that directly benefit the customers and drive reliability. We have now put in communications backbones to reach smart meters to help us with fault isolators, fast reclosers, that's the kind of spend, along with replacing antiquated cable and updating the system with new components. Now as we go into the 2020 and beyond, there is a significant amount of work being done on what else can be done to develop into the smart city that we can better serve the communities while investing and driving efficiency into the systems. And the work that's being done on microgrids, the experimental work there, to see what's the societal benefit in certain microgrids in certain locations. What we can do to integrate with more of the community is there an assistance within the street light programs or assistance that we can provide with our infrastructure on the meter reading of water or gas or other types of systems, is where we'll be going.

If you've seen our pleading, you know that we have a multiphase process where, in the first instance, we need to get analytics from the RTOs. Can they run without pipelines? What's the impact to the consumers? We can move from there to design basis for the system that we think is going to iterate between NERC, FERC and the Department of Energy for some time after we get the data. In terms of how we ultimately implement that into the system, I think once we have the design basis, what we're trying to avoid, we will start looking at mitigation solutions, maybe the retention of additional fuel secured resources to avoid this outage risk. But I think it's premature to get there. One way you can think about, though, if you take a look at the capacity performance program, we were able to value the cost of incremental reliability associated with dual fuel. So if the design basis ultimately ends up being we need 90 days of fuel, we have a mathematical way of calculating what the market solution to get dual fuel resources to 90 days of fuel would be. That would probably the $8 or $10 of megawatt hour in terms of doing that, based on the cost we saw on CPAY. So that's one approach. But from our perspective, we need to drop back here, take a look at the data, make sure we have the right definition of resiliency, the right design basis and then we could come back to market solutions or other solutions that will ensure we have the resources to mitigate that risk and provide the security we need to provide for our customers and the nation."
