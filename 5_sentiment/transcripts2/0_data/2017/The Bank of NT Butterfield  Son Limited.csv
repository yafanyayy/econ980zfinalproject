Butterfield is a full-service banking and wealth manager, headquartered in Bermuda with operations here, the Cayman Islands, currency, The Bahamas, Switzerland and the U.K. 
In Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, we offer retail, private, corporate banking and trust and asset management services. In currency, we offer trust, private banking and asset management services. Our Bahamas and Switzerland offices provide personal trust services, while in the U.K. we offer residential property lending. 
Our long history in leading market shares and Bermuda and Cayman allowed us to secure a low-cost deposits, and originate high-quality, residential mortgages and commercial loans. Our core banking business, when combined with our growing capitalization and fee based businesses, helped Butterfield generate industry-leading returns on equity. 
We are aware of the unique environment, in which, we operate and maintain a conservative, liquid balance sheet to maximize safety and stability. 
Slide 4 highlights the second quarter results, and shows how all of these attributes combined to help produce solid core results and momentum, as we execute our strategic plan. Net interest margin expanded 8 basis points from the first quarter due to the repricing of the mortgage portfolio and increased yield on the liquid portfolio. The bank's diversified fee generating businesses produce stable, noninterest income, and the U.K. mortgage business had another strong quarter. Originating attracted, risk-adjusted assets in a continuing favorable credit environment. 
The second quarter also saw the successful staging of the 35th America’s Cup in Bermuda, where despite the failure of team USA to deliver another come-from-behind victory, the Island demonstrated it's ability to host a world-class sailing event, and Butterfield welcomed more than 800 clients and guests at cup-related events, providing tremendous business retention and development opportunities for the Bank. 
Turning to financial results, second quarter core earnings were $37.5 million, which was $1 million decrease from the last quarter, but a $5.4 million increase from the second quarter of 2016. Earnings were impacted by temporarily elevated expenses, that Michael Schrum will address in more detail. 
Despite higher than normal expenses, core return on equity of 21.6% demonstrates that our model and strategy are working. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum."
874003,529506407,1252485,"The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2017",2017-07-26,"Earnings Calls","The Bank of N.T.

Starting with net interest income on Slide 6. Second quarter increased $3.6 million over the prior quarter to $71.5 million. The increase was due mainly to improving yields on the Bermuda and Cayman mortgage books, as adjustable rates began to reset, following the recent fed rate moves. 
We also benefited on our cash and short-term liquidity portfolios, as a result of a higher short-term rates. Subdued pricing, in U.S. dollar term rates, kept the yield on our investment portfolio stable but we are cautiously optimistic that we should see a more constructive term rate structure and better deployment opportunities in the second half of 2017. 
Slide 7 lays out the performance of our various fee businesses during the quarter, which generated stable, capital efficient, noninterest income, despite some variability in the individual product lines. 
Banking fees, primarily driven by card transactions during the America’s Cup period, increased almost 9% in the quarter, an offset a decline in FX revenue. At 35%, Butterfield's fee income ratio is ahead of our peer average, and helps produce industry-leading returns on equity. As we've discussed, we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions in our core Wealth Management businesses, in high-quality jurisdictions, that will help us build additional scale. 
I'd like to spend some time on Slide 8, as I believe our elevated expenses warrant some comment, and an outline of our plans to return to a more normal level. 
The first thing I would like to iterate -- reiterate, is that we remain confident in our previous guidance of a core cost income ratio of 60% without further rate moves or acquisitions by the end this year. 
There are 4 items that are driving expenses higher in 2017; Marketing for the America’s Cup, Sarbanes-Oxley, investment income flying systems and capabilities, and the build out of our Halifax Nova Scotia Support Center. 
Second quarter marketing cost increased due to expenses related to the America’s Cup, which will not be recurring in the third quarter. Expenses related to Sarbanes-Oxley and investment and compliance systems picked up in the second quarter, but should start to level off by the end of 2017. 
Expenses related to the Halifax build out will likely continue through the end of the year, before fading in early 2018, and thereafter, we'll start to create operational efficiencies for the group. 
We continue to be very focused on expenses and expect to show significant progress by the end of the year, as projects conclude and we achieve the anticipated savings. 
Slide 9 highlights capital levels, showing both regulatory capital as well as leverage capital. As a result of our strong capital generation and high ROE, Butterfield increased it's depository capital ratio by 120 basis points, to 19.1%, a level well above both Bermuda regulatory requirements and the U.S. average. 
Our common equity to total asset ratio also increased by 50 basis points to 6.7%, and is now at the high-end of our target range. 
For the second quarter of 2017, the Board declared a dividend of $0.32 per common share, which reflects our ongoing balanced approach to capital management and commitment to providing shareholders with stable returns. 
Our capital management strategy is unchanged. We are investing in our existing businesses, and we look for trust and wealth acquisition opportunities in quality jurisdictions that, will allow us to grow our fee income. In the absence of any compelling acquisitions, we anticipate reviewing the dividend and other capital allocation strategies, in line with previous guidance and commitments. 
I will now hand over the call to Dan Frumkin to discuss the balance sheet."

As Michael Collins mentioned, we are aware of the unique environment in which we operate, and seek to maximize safety and stability by managing risk while maintaining sufficient capital in an efficient and liquid balance sheet. 
Slide 10 summarizes the bank's balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, and shows a slight decrease in total assets of $10.7 billion compared to $10.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017. 
During the quarter, we continue to maintain a highly liquid position, with 63% of our total assets comprised of cash and equivalents, short-term investments and investment assets. 
Loan balances remain flat from the prior quarter, due primarily to commercial and residential loan amortization, offset by growth in new residential mortgages, particularly in our U.K. mortgage business, where we had another solid quarter of a originations. 
Expected cash outflows related to 2 customers, one, who made substantial private equity investments, and one who funded a corporate restructuring, resulted in a majority of the decrease in interest-bearing deposits from the first quarter. 
Non-interest-bearing deposits increased by $66 million during the quarter. The cost of deposits was flat from the prior quarter at 11 basis points. 
Slide 11 provides a summary of our loan and investment portfolios. The size and proposition of our $3.6 billion loan portfolio is essentially unchanged from the first quarter, and is comprised primarily of residential mortgages. 
Nonperforming loans, which include gross nonaccrual loans and accrued loans past due 90 days or more, totaled $61.8 million as of June 30, 2017, which represents an increase of [indiscernible] $4 million from the first quarter. This is due to one $5 million relationship that is now in litigation.  No provision has been made on this new nonaccrual, as, at this juncture, the Bank believes it is protected by sufficient collateral. The net charge-off ratio remained at a low 1 basis point for the quarter. 
Our investment portfolio remains stable at $4.6 billion, as a lack of attractive pricing in the U.S. dollar term rate market, deterred any  significant rebalancing. We are cautiously optimistic that we'll have out opportunities to prudently deploy more capital into this market in the third quarter. 
At quarter end, approximately 92% of the investment portfolio was comprised of AAA rated securities. Overall we continue to be pleased with our asset quality and the strength of our balance sheet. 
On Slide 12, you will see our interest rate sensitivity. Butterfield remain significantly more sensitive to interest-rate increases versus our U.S. peers, as you can see on Slide 12. Looking at the graph on the upper right, a 200 points increase in rates will generated an uptick in net interest income of 12.7% versus our U.S. peers at 5.7%. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

You will see the commercial loans,  I think, reached some 4.9 to 4.92. So it's about 43 basis points quarter-on-quarter. There is some one-off noise in there, however. So I think the guidance of -- sort of 15 basis points to 20 basis points was the right guidance at the time. There was a bit of restructuring fees that came to us as a one-off. That was probably worth 5 basis points or 6 basis points of the increase. There was a day count issue between the first and second quarter. That was worth another 4 basis points, 5 basis points. And then, we had a bit of a transitory issues. We were restructuring a couple of low yielding credits. So actually, they come out at the average balances, as you'll see, they dropped. But they're back in, as you get to the tail end of June. So they'll be in the run rate as we go forward. Sort of all that taken together is probably half of the 43 basis points. Maybe a little bit more than half of the 43 basis points increase. So I think your thought process was about right. And again, we adjust commercial loans immediately after the base rate rises, other than the stuff tied to LIBOR, with some stuff, you know, 90-day notice stuff. But the reality is the rate was already embedded in there. Unlike our residential lending portfolio in Bermuda, where you know has a 90-day lag because we have to provide notice. So the second -- the last rate move won't bleed through into our Bermuda residential mortgages. And so, until September. So that's where we sit as we sit here today."

Obviously, as you know, we're getting ourselves compliant this year. All the documentation is done, et cetera, and the testing is about to begin. So this quarter was kind of a big quarter to get that over the line. Between stocks and compliance, you're probably looking at sort of 5 on the quarter. And then, that will probably stabilize at around the 2 mark in Q1. The timing around that is a little bit uncertain in terms of whether that -- some of that will be stabilizing in Q3, and some of that will be externalizing in Q4. And then finally, the build out of Halifax, which will start to generate operational efficiencies into 2018. But build out and duplicate headcount, as we on-board people there, we'll start to abate and start to generate actual net savings into 2018. So that's kind of -- the guidance is still the same.

Butterfield is a full-service bank and wealth manager, headquartered in Bermuda with operations here, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, The Bahamas, Switzerland and the U.K. 
In Bermuda and the Cayman Islands we offer retail, private and corporate banking and trust and asset management services. In Guernsey, we offer trust, private banking and asset management services. Our Bahamas and Switzerland offices provide personal trust services, while in the U.K. we offer residential property lending. 
Our long history in leading market shares in Bermuda and Cayman allow us to secure a low-cost deposits, and originate high-quality residential mortgages and commercial loans. Our core banking business, when combined with our growing capital efficient fee-based businesses, helped Butterfield generate industry-leading returns on equity. 
We are aware of the unique environment which we operate and maintain a conservative, liquid balance sheet to maximize safety and stability. 
Slide 4 highlights the second quarter results, and shows how all of these attributes combine to help produce solid core result and momentum, as we execute our strategic plan. Net interest margin expanded 8 basis points from the first quarter due to the repricing of the mortgage portfolio, and increased yield and the liquid portfolio. The bank's diversified fee-generating businesses produced stable, noninterest income and the U.K. mortgage business had another strong quarter. Originating attracted, risk-adjusted assets in a continuing favorable credit environment. 
The second quarter also saw the successful staging of the 35th America’s Cup in Bermuda, where despite the failure of team USA to deliver another come-from-behind victory, the Island demonstrated it's ability to host a world-class sailing event, and Butterfield welcomed more than 800 clients and guests at cup-related events, providing tremendous business retention and development opportunities for the Bank. 
Turning to financial result, second quarter core earnings were $37.5 million, which was $1 million decrease from the last quarter, but a $5.4 million increase from the second quarter of 2016. Earnings were impacted by temporarily and elevated expenses, that Michael Schrum will address in more detail. 
Despite higher than normal expenses, core return on equity of 21.6% demonstrates that our model and strategy are working. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum."

Starting with net interest income on Slide 6. Second quarter increased $3.6 million over the prior quarter to $71.5 million. The increase was due mainly to improving yields on the Bermuda and Cayman mortgage books, as adjustable rates began to reset following the recent Fed rate moves. 
We also benefited on our cash and short-term liquidity portfolios as a result of a higher short-term rates. Subdued pricing in U.S. dollar term rates kept the yield on our investment portfolio stable, but we are cautiously optimistic that we should see a more constructive term-rate structure and better deployment opportunities in the second half of 2017. 
Slide 7 lays out the performance of our various fee businesses during the quarter, which generated stable, capital efficient, noninterest income despite some variability in the individual product lines. 
Banking fees, primarily driven by card transactions, during the America’s Cup period increased almost 9% in the quarter and offset a decline in FX revenue. At 35%, Butterfield's fee income ratio is ahead of our peer average and helps produce industry-leading returns on equity. As we've discussed, we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions in our core Wealth Management businesses, in high-quality jurisdictions, that will help us build additional scale. 
I'd like to spend some time on Slide 8, as I believe our elevated expenses warrant some comment, and an outline of our plans to return to a more normal level. The first thing I would like to iterate -- reiterate is that we remain confident in our previous guidance of a core cost income ratio of around 60% without further rate moves or acquisitions by the end this year. 
There are 4 items that are driving expenses higher in 2017. Marketing for the America’s Cup, Sarbanes Oxley, investment in compliance systems and capabilities and the build out of our Halifax, Nova Scotia Support Center. 
Second quarter marketing cost increased due to expenses related to the America’s Cup, which will not be recurring in the third quarter. Expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley and investment in compliance systems picked up in the second quarter, but should start to level off by the end of 2017. 
Expenses related to the Halifax build out will likely continue through the end of the year, before fading in early 2018, and thereafter, we'll start to create operational efficiencies for the group. 
We continue to be very focused on expenses and expect to show significant progress by the end of the year as projects conclude and we achieve the anticipated savings. 
Slide 9 highlights capital levels, showing both Basel III regulatory capital as well as leverage capital. As a result of our strong capital generation and high ROE, Butterfield increased it's Basel III capital ratio by 120 basis points, to 19.1%. A level well above both Bermuda regulatory requirements and the U.S. average. 
Our common equity to total asset ratio also increased by 50 basis points to 6.7% and is now at the high-end of our target range. 
For the second quarter of 2017, the Board declared a dividend of $0.32 per common share, which reflects our ongoing balanced approach to capital management and commitment to providing shareholders with stable returns. 
Our capital management strategy is unchanged. We are investing in our existing businesses, and we look for trust and wealth acquisition opportunities in quality jurisdictions that will allow us to grow our fee income. In the absence of any compelling acquisitions, we anticipate reviewing the dividend and other capital allocation strategies in line with previous guidance and commitments. 
I will now hand over the call to Dan Frumkin to discuss the balance sheet."

As Michael Collins mentioned, we are aware of the unique environment in which we operate, and seek to maximize safety and stability by managing risk while maintaining sufficient capital in an efficient and liquid balance sheet. 
Slide 10 summarizes the bank's balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, and shows a slight decrease in total assets of $10.7 billion compared to $10.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we continue to maintain a highly liquid position with 63% of our total assets comprised of cash and equivalents, short-term investments and investment assets. 
Loan balances remain flat from the prior quarter, due primarily to commercial and residential loan amortization, offset by growth in new residential mortgages, particularly in our U.K. mortgage business, where we had another solid quarter of originations. 
Expected cash outflows related to 2 customers. One, who made substantial private equity investments, and one who funded a corporate restructuring, resulted in a majority of the decrease in interest-bearing deposits from the first quarter. 
Noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $66 million during the quarter. The cost of deposits was flat from the prior quarter at 11 basis points. 
Slide 11 provides a summary of our loan and investment portfolios. The size and composition of our $3.6 billion loan portfolio is essentially unchanged from the first quarter and is comprised primarily of residential mortgages. Nonperforming loans, which include gross nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due by 90 days or more, totaled $61.8 million as of June 30, 2017, which represents an increase of circa $4 million from the first quarter. This is due to one $5 million relationship that is now in litigation. No provision has been made on this new nonaccrual, as at this juncture, the Bank believes it is protected by sufficient collateral. The net charge-off ratio remained at a low 1 basis point for the quarter. 
Our investment portfolio remains stable at $4.6 billion, as a lack of attractive pricing in the U.S. dollar term rate market deterred any  significant rebalancing. We are cautiously optimistic that we'll have out opportunities to prudently deploy more capital into this market in the third quarter. At quarter end, approximately 92% of the investment portfolio was comprised of AAA rated securities. Overall we continue to be pleased with our asset quality and the strength of our balance sheet. 
On Slide 12, you will see our interest rate sensitivity. Butterfield remains significantly more sensitive to interest rate increases versus our U.S. peers, as you can see on Slide 12. Looking at the graph on the upper right, a 200 basis point increase in rates would generate an uptick in net interest income of 12.7% versus our U.S. peers at 5.7%. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

Yes, you'll see the commercial loans, I think reached from 4.49% to 4.92%. So it's about 43 basis points quarter-on-quarter. There is some one-off noise in there, however. So I think the guidance of -- sort of 15 basis points to 20 basis points was the right guidance at the time. There was a bit of restructuring fees that came to us as a one-off. That was probably worth 5 basis points or 6 basis points of the increase. There was a day count issue between the first and second quarter. That was worth another 4 basis points, 5 basis points. And then we had a bit of a transitory issues. We were restructuring a couple of low-yielding credits. So actually, they come out at the average balances, as you'll see, they drop. But they're back in, as you get to the tail end of June. So they'll be in the run rate as we go forward. So sort of all of that taken together is probably half of the 43 basis points. Maybe a little bit more than half of the 43 basis points increase. So I think your thought process was about right. And again, we adjust commercial loans immediately after the base rate rises, other than the stuff tied to LIBOR, with some stuff -- 90-day notice stuff. But the reality is the rate was already embedded in there. Unlike our residential lending portfolio in Bermuda, where you know it has a 90-day lag because we have to provide notice. So the second -- the last rate move won't bleed through into our Bermuda residential mortgages. And so, until September. So that's where we sit as we sit here today."

Obviously America’s Cup was a bump in Q2. That won't repeat. So between marketing and a bit of property-related expenses it's approaching to sort of $2 million mark in the quarter. So that's immediately out and normalizing in Q3. Between Sarbanes and compliance programs, we're running at pace to complete those programs. Obviously, as you know we're getting ourselves compliant this year. All the documentation is done, et cetera, and the testing is about to begin. So this quarter was kind of a big quarter to get that over the line. Between Sarbanes and compliance, you're probably looking at sort of $5 million on the quarter. And then, that will probably stabilize at around the $2 million mark in Q1. The timing around that is a little bit uncertain in terms of whether that -- some of that will be stabilizing in Q3 and some of that will be externalizing in Q4. And then finally, the build out of Halifax, which will start to generate operational efficiencies into 2018. But build out and duplicate headcount, as we on-board people there, we'll start to abate and start to generate actual net savings into 2018. So that's kind of -- the guidance is still the same.

But we -- and as you know, the investment portfolio is really, it's really there to manage the interest rate risk in a banking book. So we will continue to deploy as things mature. We've been a little bit patient I would say, this quarter. But I would say, if we don't see any constructive change in term rates, we'll continue to manage the risk profile of the investment book to offset the interest rates raise that really comes from the floating rate loan  book and the [indiscernible] deposits in the second half. So we will look for entry points but we will not start to change the interest rate risk profile materially off the Bank. We're still very asset sensitive, and as you can see, we've picked up quite a bit on the short end of the curve, so that's obviously helping as well."

I was wondering if you can just give some commentary on, when you raised the Butterfield bank rate or when loans repriced higher, particularly residential loans in Cayman, how does the payment for the borrower change when that happens? I'm really -- what I'm trying to get at is, clearly, you've been kind of running against this headwind of a lot of amortization in your different portfolios. And since there's not a lot of organic loan growth that tends to be pretty meaningful for you. So as rate goes higher, does the amortization schedule for these loans actually change in such a way that maybe we could actually see a little bit more loan growth than previously expected, as rates continue to move higher?"

So for one of the base rate moves in Bermuda, we didn't change the payment in Bermuda. So in essence, we extended amortization on those assets. In both jurisdictions, we've gone out with the mailer to all our customers that give them the opportunity to hold payments flat. But -- and again, that would extend the amortization. The take up on that offer has been last that we would have hoped. We think we would have difficulty unilaterally not changing the payments to hold the amortization based on conversations we've had with the regulators. So at this juncture, we adjust the payments to sort of hold the amortization. We don't adjust the amortization to hold the payment, if that makes sense. But we do have the ability for customers come in, and we have written and contacted all customers to ask whether they would like to hold their payments flat. And we'll revisited as we move forward. And again, as we come further off the bottom, we clearly have a lot of capacity based on our average loan-to-value profile in both portfolios to really help customers through this rate move by extending amortization. And as you rarely say, as long as this is the right thing to do for the customer, it clearly is beneficial for all the parties."

Butterfield is a full-service bank and wealth manager, headquartered in Bermuda with operations here, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, The Bahamas, Switzerland and the U.K. 
In Bermuda and the Cayman Islands we offer retail, private and corporate banking and trust and asset management services. In Guernsey, we offer trust, private banking and asset management services. Our Bahamas and Switzerland offices provide personal trust services, while in the U.K. we offer residential property lending. 
Our long history in leading market shares in Bermuda and Cayman allow us to secure low-cost deposits, and originate high-quality residential mortgages and commercial loans. Our core banking business, when combined with our growing capital efficient fee-based businesses, helped Butterfield generate industry-leading returns on equity. 
We are aware of the unique environment in which we operate and maintain a conservative, liquid balance sheet to maximize safety and stability. 
Slide 4 highlights the second quarter results, and shows how all of these attributes combine to help produce solid core result and momentum, as we execute our strategic plan. Net interest margin expanded 8 basis points from the first quarter due to the repricing of the mortgage portfolio, and increased yield on the liquid portfolio. The bank's diversified fee-generating businesses produced stable, noninterest income and the U.K. mortgage business had another strong quarter. Originating attractive, risk-adjusted assets in a continuing favorable credit environment. 
The second quarter also saw the successful staging of the 35th America’s Cup in Bermuda, where despite the failure of team USA to deliver another come-from-behind victory, the island demonstrated its ability to host a world-class sailing event, and Butterfield welcomed more than 800 clients and guests at cup-related events, providing tremendous business retention and development opportunities for the Bank. 
Turning to financial result, second quarter core earnings were $37.5 million, which was $1 million decrease from the last quarter, but a $5.4 million increase from the second quarter of 2016. Earnings were impacted by temporarily elevated expenses, that Michael Schrum will address in more detail. 
Despite higher than normal expenses, core return on equity of 21.6% demonstrates that our model and strategy are working. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum."

Starting with net interest income on Slide 6. Second quarter increased $3.6 million over the prior quarter to $71.5 million. The increase was due mainly to improving yields on the Bermuda and Cayman mortgage books, as adjustable rates began to reset following the recent Fed rate moves. 
We also benefited on our cash and short-term liquidity portfolios as a result of higher short-term rates. Subdued pricing in U.S. dollar term rates kept the yield on our investment portfolio stable, but we are cautiously optimistic that we should see a more constructive term-rate structure and better deployment opportunities in the second half of 2017. 
Slide 7 lays out the performance of our various fee businesses during the quarter, which generated stable, capital efficient, noninterest income despite some variability in the individual product lines. 
Banking fees, primarily driven by card transactions, during the America’s Cup period increased almost 9% in the quarter and offset a decline in FX revenue. At 35%, Butterfield's fee income ratio is ahead of our peer average and helps produce industry-leading returns on equity. As we've discussed, we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions in our core Wealth Management businesses, in high-quality jurisdictions, that will help us build additional scale. 
I'd like to spend some time on Slide 8, as I believe our elevated expenses warrant some comment, and an outline of our plans to return to a more normal level. The first thing I would like to iterate -- reiterate is that we remain confident in our previous guidance of a core cost income ratio of around 60% without further rate moves or acquisitions by the end this year. 
There are 4 items that have been driving expenses higher in 2017. Marketing for the America’s Cup, Sarbanes Oxley, investment in compliance systems and capabilities and the build out of our Halifax, Nova Scotia Support Center. 
Second quarter marketing cost increased due to expenses related to the America’s Cup, which will not be recurring in the third quarter. Expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley and investment in compliance systems picked up in the second quarter, but should start to level off by the end of 2017. 
Expenses related to the Halifax build out will likely continue through the end of the year, before fading in early 2018, and thereafter, will start to create operational efficiencies for the group. 
We continue to be very focused on expenses and expect to show significant progress by the end of the year as projects conclude and we achieve the anticipated savings. 
Slide 9 highlights capital levels, showing both Basel III regulatory capital as well as leverage capital. As a result of our strong capital generation and high ROE, Butterfield increased its Basel III capital ratio by 120 basis points, to 19.1%. A level well above both Bermuda regulatory requirements and the U.S. average. 
Our common equity to total asset ratio also increased by 50 basis points to 6.7% and is now at the high-end of our target range. 
For the second quarter of 2017, the Board declared a dividend of $0.32 per common share, which reflects our ongoing balanced approach to capital management and commitment to providing shareholders with stable returns. 
Our capital management strategy is unchanged. We are investing in our existing businesses, and we look for trust and wealth acquisition opportunities in quality jurisdictions that will allow us to grow our fee income. In the absence of any compelling acquisitions, we anticipate reviewing the dividend and other capital allocation strategies in line with previous guidance and commitments. 
I will now hand over the call to Dan Frumkin to discuss the balance sheet."

As Michael Collins mentioned, we are aware of the unique environment in which we operate, and seek to maximize safety and stability by managing risk while maintaining sufficient capital in an efficient and liquid balance sheet. 
Slide 10 summarizes the bank's balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, and shows a slight decrease in total assets of $10.7 billion compared to $10.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we continue to maintain a highly liquid position with 63% of our total assets comprised of cash and equivalents, short-term investments and investment assets. 
Loan balances remain flat from the prior quarter, due primarily to commercial and residential loan amortization, offset by growth in new residential mortgages, particularly in our U.K. mortgage business, where we had another solid quarter of originations. 
Expected cash outflows related to 2 customers. One, who made substantial private equity investments, and one who funded a corporate restructuring, resulted in a majority of the decrease in interest-bearing deposits from the first quarter. 
Noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $66 million during the quarter. The cost of deposits was flat from the prior quarter at 11 basis points. 
Slide 11 provides a summary of our loan and investment portfolios. The size and composition of our $3.6 billion loan portfolio is essentially unchanged from the first quarter and is comprised primarily of residential mortgages. Nonperforming loans, which include gross nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due by 90 days or more, totaled $61.8 million as of June 30, 2017, which represents an increase of circa $4 million from the first quarter. This is due to one $5 million relationship that is now in litigation. No provision has been made on this new nonaccrual, as at this juncture the Bank believes it is protected by sufficient collateral. The net charge-off ratio remained at a low 1 basis point for the quarter. 
Our investment portfolio remains stable at $4.6 billion, as a lack of attractive pricing in the U.S. dollar term rate market deterred any significant rebalancing. We are cautiously optimistic that we'll have out opportunities to prudently deploy more capital into this market in the third quarter. At quarter end, approximately 92% of the investment portfolio was comprised of AAA rated securities. Overall we continue to be pleased with our asset quality and the strength of our balance sheet. 
On Slide 12, you will see our interest rate sensitivity. Butterfield remains significantly more sensitive to interest rate increases versus our U.S. peers, as you can see on Slide 12. Looking at the graph on the upper right, a 200 basis point increase in rates would generate an uptick in net interest income of 12.7% versus our U.S. peers at 5.7%. 
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

Yes, you'll see the commercial loans, I think reached from 4.49% to 4.92%. So it's about 43 basis points quarter-on-quarter. There is some one-off noise in there, however. So I think the guidance of -- sort of 15 basis points to 20 basis points was the right guidance at the time. There was a bit of restructuring fees that came to us as a one-off. That was probably worth 5 basis points or 6 basis points of the increase. There was a day count issue between the first and second quarter. That was worth another 4 basis points, 5 basis points. And then we had a bit of transitory issues. We were restructuring a couple of low-yielding credits. So actually, they come out at the average balances, as you'll see, they drop. But they're back in, as you get to the tail end of June. So they'll be in the run rate as we go forward. So sort of all of that taken together is probably half of the 43 basis points. Maybe a little bit more than half of the 43 basis points increase. So I think your thought process was about right. And again, we adjust commercial loans immediately after the base rate rises, other than the stuff tied to LIBOR, with some stuff -- 90-day notice stuff. But the reality is the rate was already embedded in there. Unlike our residential lending portfolio in Bermuda, where you know it has a 90-day lag because we have to provide notice. So the second -- the last rate move won't bleed through into our Bermuda residential mortgages until September. So that's where we sit as we sit here today."

All the documentation is done, et cetera, and the testing is about to begin. So this quarter was kind of a big quarter to get that over the line. Between SOX and compliance, you're probably looking at sort of $5 million on the quarter. And then, that will probably stabilize at around the $2 million mark in Q1. The timing around that is a little bit uncertain in terms of whether that -- some of that will be stabilizing in Q3 and some of that will be stabilizing in Q4. And then finally, the build out of Halifax, which will start to generate operational efficiencies into 2018. But build out and duplicate headcount, as we on-board people there, we'll start to abate and start to generate actual net savings into 2018. So that's kind of -- the guidance is still the same.

I was wondering if you can just give some commentary on, when you raised the Butterfield bank rate or when loans repriced higher, particularly residential loans in Cayman, how does the payment for the borrower change when that happens? And really what I'm trying to get at is, clearly, you've been kind of running against this headwind of a lot of amortization in your different portfolios. And since there's not a lot of organic loan growth that tends to be pretty meaningful for you. So as rate goes higher, does the amortization schedule for these loans actually change in such a way that maybe we could actually see a little bit more loan growth than previously expected, as rates continue to move higher?"

So for one of the base rate moves in Bermuda, we didn't change the payment in Bermuda. So in essence, we extended amortization on those assets. In both jurisdictions, we've gone out with the mailer to all our customers that give them the opportunity to hold payments flat. But -- and again, that would extend the amortization. The take up on that offer has been less than we would have hoped. We think we would have difficulty unilaterally not changing the payments to hold the amortization based on conversations we've had with the regulators. So at this juncture, we adjust the payments to sort of hold the amortization. We don't adjust the amortization to hold the payment, if that makes sense. But we do have the ability for customers to come in, and we have written and contacted all customers to ask whether they would like to hold their payments flat. And we'll revisit it as we move forward. And again, as we come further off the bottom, we clearly have a lot of capacity based on our average loan-to-value profile in both portfolios to really help customers through this rate move by extending amortization. And as you rightly say, as long as it is the right thing to do for the customer, it clearly is beneficial for all parties."

Butterfield is a full-service bank and wealth manager, headquartered in Bermuda with operations here, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, The Bahamas, Switzerland and the U.K. 
In Bermuda and the Cayman Islands we offer retail, private and corporate banking and trust and asset management services. In Guernsey, we offer trust, private banking and asset management services. Our Bahamas and Switzerland offices provide personal trust services, while in the U.K. we offer residential property lending. 
Our long history in leading market shares in Bermuda and Cayman allow us to secure low-cost deposits, and originate high-quality residential mortgages and commercial loans. Our core banking business, when combined with our growing capital efficient fee-based businesses, helped Butterfield generate industry-leading returns on equity. 
We are aware of the unique environment in which we operate and maintain a conservative, liquid balance sheet to maximize safety and stability. 
Slide 4 highlights the second quarter results, and shows how all of these attributes combine to help produce solid core result and momentum, as we execute our strategic plan. Net interest margin expanded 8 basis points from the first quarter due to the repricing of the mortgage portfolio, and increased yield on the liquid portfolio. The bank's diversified fee-generating businesses produced stable, noninterest income and the U.K. mortgage business had another strong quarter. Originating attractive, risk-adjusted assets in a continuing favorable credit environment. 
The second quarter also saw the successful staging of the 35th America’s Cup in Bermuda, where despite the failure of team USA to deliver another come-from-behind victory, the island demonstrated its ability to host a world-class sailing event, and Butterfield welcomed more than 800 clients and guests at cup-related events, providing tremendous business retention and development opportunities for the Bank. 
Turning to financial result, second quarter core earnings were $37.5 million, which was $1 million decrease from the last quarter, but a $5.4 million increase from the second quarter of 2016. Earnings were impacted by temporarily elevated expenses, that Michael Schrum will address in more detail. 
Despite higher than normal expenses, core return on equity of 21.6% demonstrates that our model and strategy are working. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum."

Starting with net interest income on Slide 6. Second quarter increased $3.6 million over the prior quarter to $71.5 million. The increase was due mainly to improving yields on the Bermuda and Cayman mortgage books, as adjustable rates began to reset following the recent Fed rate moves. 
We also benefited on our cash and short-term liquidity portfolios as a result of higher short-term rates. Subdued pricing in U.S. dollar term rates kept the yield on our investment portfolio stable, but we are cautiously optimistic that we should see a more constructive term-rate structure and better deployment opportunities in the second half of 2017. 
Slide 7 lays out the performance of our various fee businesses during the quarter, which generated stable, capital efficient, noninterest income despite some variability in the individual product lines. 
Banking fees, primarily driven by card transactions, during the America’s Cup period increased almost 9% in the quarter and offset a decline in FX revenue. At 35%, Butterfield's fee income ratio is ahead of our peer average and helps produce industry-leading returns on equity. As we've discussed, we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions in our core Wealth Management businesses, in high-quality jurisdictions, that will help us build additional scale. 
I'd like to spend some time on Slide 8, as I believe our elevated expenses warrant some comment, and an outline of our plans to return to a more normal level. The first thing I would like to iterate -- reiterate is that we remain confident in our previous guidance of a core cost income ratio of around 60% without further rate moves or acquisitions by the end this year. 
There are 4 items that have been driving expenses higher in 2017. Marketing for the America’s Cup, Sarbanes Oxley, investment in compliance systems and capabilities and the build out of our Halifax, Nova Scotia Support Center. 
Second quarter marketing cost increased due to expenses related to the America’s Cup, which will not be recurring in the third quarter. Expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley and investment in compliance systems picked up in the second quarter, but should start to level off by the end of 2017. 
Expenses related to the Halifax build out will likely continue through the end of the year, before fading in early 2018, and thereafter, will start to create operational efficiencies for the group. 
We continue to be very focused on expenses and expect to show significant progress by the end of the year as projects conclude and we achieve the anticipated savings. 
Slide 9 highlights capital levels, showing both Basel III regulatory capital as well as leverage capital. As a result of our strong capital generation and high ROE, Butterfield increased its Basel III capital ratio by 120 basis points, to 19.1%. A level well above both Bermuda regulatory requirements and the U.S. average. 
Our common equity to total asset ratio also increased by 50 basis points to 6.7% and is now at the high-end of our target range. 
For the second quarter of 2017, the Board declared a dividend of $0.32 per common share, which reflects our ongoing balanced approach to capital management and commitment to providing shareholders with stable returns. 
Our capital management strategy is unchanged. We are investing in our existing businesses, and we look for trust and wealth acquisition opportunities in quality jurisdictions that will allow us to grow our fee income. In the absence of any compelling acquisitions, we anticipate reviewing the dividend and other capital allocation strategies in line with previous guidance and commitments. 
I will now hand over the call to Dan Frumkin to discuss the balance sheet."

As Michael Collins mentioned, we are aware of the unique environment in which we operate, and seek to maximize safety and stability by managing risk while maintaining sufficient capital in an efficient and liquid balance sheet. 
Slide 10 summarizes the bank's balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, and shows a slight decrease in total assets of $10.7 billion compared to $10.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we continue to maintain a highly liquid position with 63% of our total assets comprised of cash and equivalents, short-term investments and investment assets. 
Loan balances remain flat from the prior quarter, due primarily to commercial and residential loan amortization, offset by growth in new residential mortgages, particularly in our U.K. mortgage business, where we had another solid quarter of originations. 
Expected cash outflows related to 2 customers. One, who made substantial private equity investments, and one who funded a corporate restructuring, resulted in a majority of the decrease in interest-bearing deposits from the first quarter. 
Noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $66 million during the quarter. The cost of deposits was flat from the prior quarter at 11 basis points. 
Slide 11 provides a summary of our loan and investment portfolios. The size and composition of our $3.6 billion loan portfolio is essentially unchanged from the first quarter and is comprised primarily of residential mortgages. Nonperforming loans, which include gross nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due by 90 days or more, totaled $61.8 million as of June 30, 2017, which represents an increase of circa $4 million from the first quarter. This is due to one $5 million relationship that is now in litigation. No provision has been made on this new nonaccrual, as at this juncture the Bank believes it is protected by sufficient collateral. The net charge-off ratio remained at a low 1 basis point for the quarter. 
Our investment portfolio remains stable at $4.6 billion, as a lack of attractive pricing in the U.S. dollar term rate market deterred any significant rebalancing. We are cautiously optimistic that we'll have out opportunities to prudently deploy more capital into this market in the third quarter. At quarter end, approximately 92% of the investment portfolio was comprised of AAA rated securities. Overall we continue to be pleased with our asset quality and the strength of our balance sheet. 
On Slide 12, you will see our interest rate sensitivity. Butterfield remains significantly more sensitive to interest rate increases versus our U.S. peers, as you can see on Slide 12. Looking at the graph on the upper right, a 200 basis point increase in rates would generate an uptick in net interest income of 12.7% versus our U.S. peers at 5.7%. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy with a focus on growth and shareholder returns. We will also continue to focus on expenses, which should further boost our returns and benefit our shareholders. 
Finally, as announced in yesterday's earnings release, it is my privilege to assume the role of Chairman of the Butterfield Board in addition to my current duties as Chief Executive Officer. 
As we continue to successfully execute against our strategy, I look forward to working with my fellow Board members, including newly named, Lead Independent Director, David Zwiener, and engaging the wide range of expertise they all possess. 
On behalf of the entire Board, I also want to extend my gratitude to Barclay Simmons for his service to the Bank as a Director and Chairman through our IPO and secondary offering, and to Wolf Schoellkopf, for his services as Director since 2010. 
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Yes, you'll see the commercial loans, I think reached from 4.49% to 4.92%. So it's about 43 basis points quarter-on-quarter. There is some one-off noise in there, however. So I think the guidance of -- sort of 15 basis points to 20 basis points was the right guidance at the time. There was a bit of restructuring fees that came to us as a one-off. That was probably worth 5 basis points or 6 basis points of the increase. There was a day count issue between the first and second quarter. That was worth another 4 basis points, 5 basis points. And then we had a bit of transitory issues. We were restructuring a couple of low-yielding credits. So actually, they come out at the average balances, as you'll see, they drop. But they're back in, as you get to the tail end of June. So they'll be in the run rate as we go forward. So sort of all of that taken together is probably half of the 43 basis points. Maybe a little bit more than half of the 43 basis points increase. So I think your thought process was about right. And again, we adjust commercial loans immediately after the base rate rises, other than the stuff tied to LIBOR, with some stuff -- 90-day notice stuff. But the reality is the rate was already embedded in there. Unlike our residential lending portfolio in Bermuda, where you know it has a 90-day lag because we have to provide notice. So the second -- the last rate move won't bleed through into our Bermuda residential mortgages until September. So that's where we sit as we sit here today."

All the documentation is done, et cetera, and the testing is about to begin. So this quarter was kind of a big quarter to get that over the line. Between SOX and compliance, you're probably looking at sort of $5 million on the quarter. And then, that will probably stabilize at around the $2 million mark in Q1. The timing around that is a little bit uncertain in terms of whether that -- some of that will be stabilizing in Q3 and some of that will be stabilizing in Q4. And then finally, the build out of Halifax, which will start to generate operational efficiencies into 2018. But build out and duplicate headcount, as we on-board people there, we'll start to abate and start to generate actual net savings into 2018. So that's kind of -- the guidance is still the same.

I was wondering if you can just give some commentary on, when you raised the Butterfield bank rate or when loans repriced higher, particularly residential loans in Cayman, how does the payment for the borrower change when that happens?

And since there's not a lot of organic loan growth that tends to be pretty meaningful for you.

In both jurisdictions, we've gone out with the mailer to all our customers that give them the opportunity to hold payments flat. But -- and again, that would extend the amortization. The take up on that offer has been less than we would have hoped. We think we would have difficulty unilaterally not changing the payments to hold the amortization based on conversations we've had with the regulators. So at this juncture, we adjust the payments to sort of hold the amortization. We don't adjust the amortization to hold the payment, if that makes sense. But we do have the ability for customers to come in, and we have written and contacted all customers to ask whether they would like to hold their payments flat. And we'll revisit it as we move forward. And again, as we come further off the bottom, we clearly have a lot of capacity based on our average loan-to-value profile in both portfolios to really help customers through this rate move by extending amortization. And as you rightly say, as long as it is the right thing to do for the customer, it clearly is beneficial for all parties."

I'll give a brief overview of our strategy, execution, accomplishments and financial results in 2016. Michael Schrum and Dan Frumkin will then go in to further detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. 
Starting with Slide 3, while many of you are familiar with Butterfield, I'd like to provide an overview of the bank and reiterate what we believe to be our core attributes and competitive strengths. 
Butterfield is a full-service bank and trust company, with a leading market share and pricing power in our banking jurisdictions at Bermuda and Cayman. We offer Community Banking services, composed of Retail and Corporate Banking to individuals, local businesses, captive insurers, reinsurance companies, trust companies and hedge funds. Our banking products include personal and business deposits, residential and commercial mortgages, small business loans, credit and debit cards, merchant acquiring, mobile and online banking and cash management. 
Butterfield's award-winning Wealth Management business located in Bermuda, Cayman, Guernsey, Switzerland and the Bahamas, provides trust, private banking, asset management and custody services to ultra-high net-worth individuals and family offices based in Asia, Europe and Latin America. 
As an additional service, Butterfield Mortgages Limited provides residential mortgages on properties in Central London for our international clients with an interest in establishing their presence in the U.K. 
Butterfield's strong capital generation and high returns are driven by a number of factors, including recurring fee income, low-cost deposits, high yield in floating rate loans, a conservative capital efficient investment portfolio and our presence in income tax neutral jurisdictions. 
In 2016, we achieved a core return on average common tangible equity of 20%, an attractive return considering that 2/3 of our assets are held in cash and securities, which are invested primarily in lower risk U.S. Government and Federal Agencies. 
Our strategy is simple. We expect to continue to produce higher risk-adjusted returns relative to our U.S. regional bank peers, due to our unique business model. A leading market share, high barriers to entry and pricing power in each of our banking jurisdictions will generate excess capital that will be used to pay dividends and build our Wealth Management business through trust acquisitions 
With a long and recognized history of structuring trust for mobile, ultra-high network families, we are well-positioned to service the global private wealth business, emanating from Asia, Europe and Latin America. 
Turning to Slide 4, our Community Banking and Wealth Management businesses performed well in 2016, leading to a 22% increase in core net income. During the year, we successfully repositioned the bank by acquiring HSBC Bermudez Wealth Management business and completing the whine down of our U.K. private bank. The integration of HSBC Wealth and the conversion of our deposit-taking U.K. Bank into a mortgage company for ultra-high network clients were both executed on time and within budget. 
In September of 2016, the bank completed a successful initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which enhanced trading liquidity for shareholders and provided the bank with access to international capital. 
Following the IPO, we deployed $212 million of capital to repurchase preference shares, saving $15 million of annual preferred dividends and government guarantee fees, funds that will be used for the benefit of our common shareholders. 
The Board has declared a common dividend of $0.32 per share for Q4, 2016, which is triple the $0.10 quarterly dividend paid to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
This morning, we reported strong results for the full year, with 2016 net income of $115.9 million, up 49% over 2015. 
Excluding noncore items, core net income rose from $113.9 million in 2015 to $138.6 million in 2016, an increase of 22%. 
2016 core earnings per share was $2.48. 
2016 was an important year for Butterfield. We made good progress in executing our strategy, producing healthy returns, while acquiring HSBC Bermuda's Wealth business, winding down our U.K. bank, listing on the New York Stock Exchange, redeeming the preference shares and increasing the Q4 dividend to $0.32 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum, our Chief Financial Officer, to talk more about our financial results."

I'll now take you through some details of our 2016 financial results, with emphasis on the fourth quarter. 
For further reference, we've also attached an expanded quarterly appendix at the end of this presentation, as well as a full quarterly reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures used. 
On Slide 6, we show a summary income statement and a quarterly trend. Butterfield posted net income for the fourth quarter of $35.4 million and core net income of $37.1 million. This represents growth in both net interest income and fee income, as well as a net reduction in credit costs and expenses in the quarter. 
We saw continued growth in deposits and a marked increase in liquidity returns. The core efficiency ratio for the quarter was 65.5% and $63.8% for the full year. 
Turning to Slide 7. The growth in net interest income in the current quarter is in line with recent trends. As we continue to deploy excess liquidity in to longer-dated U.S. Agency Securities, primarily in the held-till-maturity category, we saw attractive entry points in rates shortly after the U.S. election. 
The new and high yielding securities have already stabilized investments yields in the quarter, and positively contributed to our running book yield. 
We also took the opportunity to reprice the entire dollar loan book, following the Fed rate hike in mid-December. 
Residential mortgages impact follows a 90-day notice period from the 15th of December, 2016. 
On the customer deposit side, we've held rates, while continuing to win market share. Our cost of deposits in the quarter was 13 basis points, which continues to remain significantly below U.S. regional peers, at around 27 basis points. 
The overall net interest margin improved by 6 basis points to 2.45% in the quarter, consistent with the improved liquidity returns and returns on the new held-to-maturity investment additions. 
Highlighted on Slide 8 is the steady upward trend in noninterest income over the past 4 years, driven by both core market share growth as well as the impact of the addition and retention of acquired fee businesses. 
The fourth quarter is normally a busy period for tourism-related foreign exchange and banking fees in our Cayman Business, as well as seasonal holiday activity in the Cards business in Bermuda and Cayman. 
As the management fees increased in the quarter, as underlying portfolio valuations improved. We also saw an uptick in brokerage and asset management fees, due to new assets under management. This was achieved by targeted marketing to recapture redemption proceeds from the banks owned preference share capital retirement. 
Throughout the past 3 years, our core fee income ratio has remained above 35%, and reached 36.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This compares favorably to similar-sized US banks with a median fee income ratio at around 25%. These annuity-like fees continue to represent a capital efficient and important revenue flow for the bank. 
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to make good progress with expenses. Expenses decreased from prior quarter due to a best-in-cost of legacy option expenses in the third quarter. This was offset in the fourth quarter by tail core expenses from the U.K. restructure, as well as higher than usual costs for customer compliance for our reviews. 
In addition, we've now started to make premium payments to the Bermuda Deposit Insurance Scheme. And finally, we now have some new costs associated with being a U.S. public company. 
For the full year, the core cost efficiency ratio improved by 230 basis points to 63.8%. 
On the capital management slide, on Slide 10, you will note that to continue to manage capital resources in a conservative and prudent manner. During the quarter, we retired the expense of 8% preferred share capital issue, which will make an additional $16 million available to common shareholders annually. 
At 31 December, total regulatory capital stood at 17.6% with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at 15.3%. 
These ratios remain well above regulatory minimum, under the standardized Basel III regime operating in our core operating segments. 
Our leverage capital ratio at 5.9% is now in line with our target range. We continue to operate below the median of comparable U.S. banks, due to the relatively lower credit risk density of our balance sheet. The ex-cash leverage ratio was more comparable at 7.3% at the end of the year. 
Finally, on the capital side, we declared our first quarterly dividend after the IPO and preference share capital redemption of $0.32 per share. This represents a more than 3 folds increase from the prior quarters and equates to $1.28 per share on an annualized basis. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Risk Officer, Dan Frumkin, to talk about the balance sheet."

As both Michael Collins and Michael Schrum highlighted, Butterfield continues to generate strong profits and deliver on our promises to shareholders. As part of our overall strategy, we continue to focus on maintaining our efficient and liquid balance sheet, while strategically managing the bank's risk profile. 
Turning now to Slide 11. As of December 31, 2016, our total assets were $11.1 billion, a slight increase over the $11 billion in Quarter 3. 
For the year, assets were up $0.8 billion, attributable largely to the acquired deposits that were invested in securities, offset by the exiting of the U.K. deposit taking operation and changes in the USD, Great British Pound exchange rates throughout the year. 
Growth was supplemented by business as usual activities, as can be seen on the deposit growth in Quarter 4. 
Loans declined by $260 million in Quarter 4, driven mainly by a $200 million repayment of a government overdraft, as the government successfully issued a bond in early Quarter 4. 
In addition, the annual reduction in loans of $430 million was driven by the above repayment. The changes in USD, GBP exchange rates reducing loan balances by $101 million during the year, and a lack of opportunities to lend in our core markets. 
A factor in lower new loan volume was the U.K. restructure that distracted the team originating new U.K. mortgages. 
We continue to maintain a highly liquid position with 65%, or $7.2 billion, of our total assets comprising cash, short-term securities, reverse repurchase agreements and investments. 
The bank continues to benefit from an attractive core deposit base, with a combination of interest-bearing and non-interest bearing accounts. As of the end of 2016, our total deposits were $10 billion, which is $357 million increase from Quarter 3, and an increase of $850 million from year-end 2015. 
The growth in deposits was driven primarily by the HSBC acquisition. Though, this was reduced by the effects of the wind down of the U.K. deposit taking and asset management businesses, and the FX effect on Sterling-denominated deposits in currency of Bermuda. 
The Quarter 4 growth was driven organically, as the HSBC acquisition occurred earlier in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 12, the bank continues to maintain a conservative balance sheet. Our loan portfolio remains largely residential mortgages, which are individually, manually underwritten. The bank has benefited from a stabilizing macroeconomic environment, with a reduction of both nonperforming and nonaccrual loans. 
Net charge-off rates remained low when compared to our U.S. peers. This is driven by the fact that almost all lending at the bank is secured, and that the loan-to-value profile on the residential mortgage book is conservative. 
New residential mortgage originations in Bermuda are limited per policy to a maximum of 80% loan-to-value. While in the U.K., we limit new residential mortgages to a maximum 65% loan-to-value. 
The investment portfolio is 87% Triple A rated securities, and 100% investment grade. The bank continues to maintain a highly liquid and conservative balance sheet. 
Turning to Slide 13. You can see the bank remains more asset sensitive than U.S. peers. This asset sensitivity is after increasing the size of the HTM investment portfolio and the increasing duration on the overall investment portfolio during Quarter 4. 
You can see the spot HTM balances at year-end is above the average balance for the quarter, as investments were made late in the quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

Before we open for questions, I would just like to reiterate our key highlights of the year and how they are evidence of our ongoing ability to execute our strategy for the benefit of our shareholders. 
We continue to make excellent headway in support of our strategic plan, with the acquisition and seamless integration of HSBC Bermuda's Private Banking, Investment Management and Trust Business, in further ends of our goal to scale, our Trust and Management business in core markets. In line with our focus, we've restructured our U.K. operations to focus on our competitive strength in the residential property lending business there. 
And of course, we successfully completed our initial public offering of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on September 16, which in turn, funded the redemption of our 2008 preference share issue in the fourth quarter. 
Our result in the fourth quarter and for the full year were strong, with sustainable earnings performances as evidenced by the 49% increase in net income, and 22% increase in core earnings. 
And Butterfield continuously recognized in honor for our leadership in core markets and key business units. Everything we have accomplished in 2016 has established an exceptionally solid foundation for future growth as an independent bank and trust company. We look forward to continuing to service our customers and provide strong and stable returns to our shareholders by focusing on our core markets, maintaining our leading position in Bermuda and the Cayman islands and scaling our Trust and Asset Management business."

But I think it's fair to say that given the fact that it will usually end up with a capital markets transactions, those balances will go up and down. And I think, the $3.6 billion you see today, absent the government loan and absent the Sterling move, which was $300 million out of the $400 million decline in the quarter, I think that's kind of the core loan book that will consistently stay flat. But we'll continue to work with the government. And I think to your point, there are more opportunities to do bridge financing."

I think it's a little early for any one outside the U.S, and particularly, Bermuda and Cayman currently to fully see what's going to happen in terms of the Trump Tax Policies and what the impact is going to be. I'd say broader picture, although, it is early, obviously, broader adjustment tax would be a net negative for Bermuda. There is some sense that services like reinsurance potentially could be carved out. But we'll have to wait and see what happens there. I would also say that reinsurance and captive insurance companies are in Bermuda for a lot of different reasons. These are global companies, and won't necessarily be completely dictated in terms of moving or deciding to have a different strategy just based on tax. They are here because of the market and the infrastructure. And then secondly, I think, the overall tax policy, if that were to decrease down to 20% -- 15% or 20%, there would be less -- there would be compression between what you'd see in terms of tax cost in the U.S. and outside Bermuda. But again, these are global companies that do 2/3 of their premiums outside of the U.S. So I wouldn't necessarily see all of them or a lot of them setting up in the U.S. for 1/3 of their earnings. I think overall, from a regulatory perspective, they're obviously not in the U.S. So we look at what's happening in the U.S. We look at what's happening with Brexit. I think that most impactful part of all this is, if there is infrastructure spending, if there is a reduction in tax and there is inflationary aspects to that, then obviously, our interest rates sensitivity would be really important to the story. So I think in summary, I think it's wait and see. I don't think there is any reason to be overly concerned at this point. There is a lot of moving parts. But we sense that all of its moving towards a different interest rate cycle, which will help us."

But it is an expensive capital structure to run. I think we're pretty much where we are in the 6% to 6.5%. Obviously, as rates go up, some of that leverage, some of the AFS securities may impact TCE to TA as well. So we'd like to run with a little bit of a buffer over the 6%. And then as we go through sort of a couple more quarters, we've agreed with the Board, we'll come back and talk about dividend policy and, et cetera. And if the fourth quarter this year. So let's get through a couple of quarters with the new dividend."

I think in Bermuda and Cayman, as we flagged all along, the opportunities for us to go that book are somewhat muted. And again, from a risk prospective, the majority of our loans amortized. So we sort of have to run fast to stand still. So I think Michael's guidance is right. I think it'll be flat to slightly up, as we make our way throughout the year, with the biggest swing factor being, what Alex highlighted, which is the Government of Bermuda potentially borrowing in-between bond issues."

I'll give a brief overview of our strategy, execution, accomplishments and financial results in 2016. Michael Schrum and Dan Frumkin will then go into further detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial results.
Starting with Slide 3, while many of you are familiar with Butterfield, I'd like to provide an overview of the bank and reiterate what we believe to be our core attributes and competitive strengths.
Butterfield is a full-service bank and trust company, with a leading market share and pricing power in our banking jurisdictions at Bermuda and Cayman. We offer Community Banking services, composed of Retail and Corporate Banking to individuals, local businesses, captive insurers, reinsurance companies, trust companies and hedge funds. Our banking products include personal and business deposits, residential and commercial mortgages, small business loans, credit and debit cards, merchant acquiring, mobile and online banking and cash management.
Butterfield's award-winning Wealth Management business located in Bermuda, Cayman, Guernsey, Switzerland and the Bahamas, provides trust, private banking, asset management and custody services to ultra-high net worth individuals and family offices based in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
As an additional service, Butterfield Mortgages Limited provides residential mortgages on properties in Central London for our international clients with an interest in establishing a presence in the U.K.
Butterfield's strong capital generation and high returns are driven by a number of factors, including recurring fee income, low-cost deposits, high-yielding floating rate loans, a conservative capital-efficient investment portfolio and our presence in income tax neutral jurisdictions.
In 2016, we achieved a core return on average common tangible equity of 20%, an attractive return considering that 2/3 of our assets are held in cash and securities, which are invested primarily in lower risk U.S. Government and Federal Agencies.
Our strategy is simple. We expect to continue to produce high risk-adjusted returns relative to our U.S. regional bank peers, due to our unique business model. A leading market share, high barriers to entry and pricing power in each of our banking jurisdictions will generate excess capital that will be used to pay dividends and build our Wealth Management business through trust acquisitions.
With a long and recognized history of structuring trust for mobile, ultra-high net worth families, we are well positioned to service the global private wealth business, emanating from Asia, Europe and Latin America.
Turning to Slide 4, our Community Banking and Wealth Management businesses performed well in 2016, leading to a 22% increase in core net income. During the year, we successfully repositioned the bank by acquiring HSBC Bermuda's Wealth Management business and completing the wind down of our U.K. private bank. The integration of HSBC Wealth and the conversion of our deposit-taking U.K. Bank into a mortgage company for ultra-high net worth clients were both executed on time and within budget.
In September 2016, the bank completed a successful initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which enhanced trading liquidity for shareholders and provided the bank with access to international capital.
Following the IPO, we deployed $212 million of capital to repurchase preference shares, saving $16 million of annual preferred dividends and government guarantee fees, funds that will be used for the benefit of our common shareholders.
The Board has declared a common dividend of $0.32 per share for Q4 2016, which is triple the $0.10 quarterly dividend paid to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2015.
This morning, we reported strong results for the full year, with 2016 net income of $115.9 million, up 49% over 2015.
Excluding noncore items, core net income rose from $113.9 million in 2015 to $138.6 million in 2016, an increase of 22%.
2016 core earnings per share was $2.48.
2016 was an important year for Butterfield. We made good progress in executing our strategy, producing healthy returns, while acquiring HSBC Bermuda's Wealth business, winding down our U.K. bank, listing on the New York Stock Exchange, redeeming the preference shares and increasing the Q4 dividend to $0.32 per share.
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum, our Chief Financial Officer, to talk more about our financial results."

Butterfield & Son Limited","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning to everyone on the call.I'll now take you through some details of our 2016 financial results, with emphasis on the fourth quarter.For further reference, we've also attached an expanded quarterly appendix at the end",790,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning to everyone on the call.
I'll now take you through some details of our 2016 financial results, with emphasis on the fourth quarter.
For further reference, we've also attached an expanded quarterly appendix at the end of this presentation, as well as a full quarterly reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures used.
On Slide 6, we show a summary income statement and a quarterly trend. Butterfield posted net income for the fourth quarter of $35.4 million and core net income of $37.1 million. This represents growth in both net interest income and fee income, as well as a net reduction in credit costs and expenses in the quarter.
We saw continued growth in deposits and a marked increase in liquidity returns. The core efficiency ratio for the quarter was 65.5% and $63.8% for the full year.
Turning to Slide 7. The growth in net interest income in the current quarter is in line with recent trends. As we continue to deploy excess liquidity in to longer-dated U.S. Agency Securities, primarily in the held-to-maturity category, we saw attractive entry points in rates shortly after the U.S. election.
The new and high-yielding securities have already stabilized investment yields in the quarter, and positively contributed to our running book yield.
We also took the opportunity to reprice the entire dollar loan book, following the Fed rate hike in mid-December.
Residential mortgages impact follows a 90-day notice period from the 15th of December, 2016.
On the customer deposit side, we've held rates, while continuing to win market share. Our cost of deposits in the quarter was 13 basis points, which continues to remain significantly below U.S. regional peers, at around 27 basis points.
The overall net interest margin improved by 6 basis points to 2.45% in the quarter, consistent with the improved liquidity returns and returns on the new held-to-maturity investment additions.
Highlighted on Slide 8 is the steady upward trend in noninterest income over the past 4 years, driven by both core market share growth as well as the impact of the addition and retention of acquired fee businesses.
The fourth quarter is normally a busy period for tourism-related foreign exchange and banking fees in our Cayman Business, as well as seasonal holiday activity in the Cards business in Bermuda and Cayman.
As the management fees increased in the quarter, as underlying portfolio valuations improved. We also saw an uptick in brokerage and asset management fees, due to new assets under management. This was achieved by targeted marketing to recapture redemption proceeds from the banks' owned preference share capital retirement.
Throughout the past 3 years, our core fee income ratio has remained above 35%, and reached 36.7% in fourth quarter of 2016. This compares favorably to similar-sized US banks with a median fee income ratio at around 25%. These annuity-like fees continue to represent a capital efficient and important revenue flow for the bank.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to make good progress with expenses. Expenses decreased from prior quarter due to the vesting cost of legacy option expenses in the third quarter. This was offset in the fourth quarter by tail core expenses from the U.K. restructure, as well as higher than usual costs for customer compliance for our reviews.
In addition, we have now started to make premium payments to the Bermuda Deposit Insurance scheme. And finally, we now have some new costs associated with being a U.S. public company.
For the full year, the core cost-efficiency ratio improved by 230 basis points to 63.8%.
On the Capital Management slide, on Slide 10, you'll note that we continue to manage capital resources in a conservative and prudent manner. During the quarter, we retired the expensive 8% preferred share capital issue, which will make an additional $16 million available to common shareholders annually.
At 31 December, total regulatory capital stood at 17.6% with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at 15.3%.
These ratios remain well above regulatory minimum, under the standardized Basel III regime operating in our core operating segments.
Our leverage capital ratio at 5.9% is now in line with our target range. We continue to operate below the median of comparable U.S. banks, due to the relatively lower credit risk density of our balance sheet. The ex-cash leverage ratio was more comparable at 7.3% at the end of the year.
Finally, on the capital side, we declared our first quarterly dividend after the IPO and preference share capital redemption of $0.32 per share. This represents a more than threefold increase from the prior quarters and equates to $1.28 per share on an annualized basis.
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Risk Officer, Dan Frumkin, to talk about the balance sheet."

As both Michael Collins and Michael Schrum highlighted, Butterfield continues to generate strong profits and deliver on our promises to shareholders. As part of our overall strategy, we continue to focus on maintaining our efficient and liquid balance sheet, while strategically managing the bank's risk profile.
Turning now to Slide 11. As of December 31, 2016, our total assets were $11.1 billion, a slight increase over the $11 billion in Quarter 3.
For the year, assets were up $0.8 billion, attributable largely to the acquired deposits that were invested in securities, offset by the exiting of the U.K. deposit-taking operation and changes in the USD, Great British Pound exchange rates throughout the year.
Growth was supplemented by normal business as usual activities, as can be seen from the deposit growth in quarter 4.
Loans declined by $260 million in quarter 4, driven mainly by a $200 million repayment of a government overdraft, as the government successfully issued a bond in early quarter 4.
In addition, the annual reduction in loans of $430 million was driven by the above repayment. The changes in USD, GBP exchange rates reducing loan balances by $101 million during the year, and a lack of opportunities to lend in our core markets.
A factor in lower new loan volume was the U.K. restructure that distracted the team originating new U.K. mortgages.
We continue to maintain a highly liquid position with 65%, or $7.2 billion of our total assets comprising cash, short-term securities, reverse repurchase agreements and investments.
The bank continues to benefit from an attractive core deposit base, with a combination of interest-bearing and noninterest bearing accounts. As of the end of 2016, our total deposits were $10 billion, which is $357 million increase from quarter 3, and an increase of $850 million from year-end 2015.
The growth in deposits was driven primarily by the HSBC acquisition. Though, this was reduced by the effects of the wind down of the U.K. deposit taking and Asset Management businesses, and the FX effect on Sterling-denominated deposits in Guernsey and Bermuda.
The quarter 4 growth was driven organically, as the HSBC acquisition occurred earlier in 2016.
Turning to Slide 12, the bank continues to maintain a conservative balance sheet. Our loan portfolio remains largely residential mortgages, which are individually, manually underwritten. The bank has benefited from a stabilizing macroeconomic environment, with a reduction of both nonperforming and nonaccrual loans.
Net charge-off rates remained low when compared to our U.S. peers. This is driven by the fact that almost all lending at the bank is secured, and that the loan-to-value profile on the residential mortgage book is conservative.
New residential mortgage originations in Bermuda are limited per policy to a maximum 80% loan-to-value. While in the U.K., we limit new residential mortgages to a maximum 65% loan-to-value.
The investment portfolio is 87% AAA rated securities, and 100% investment grade. The bank continues to maintain a highly liquid and conservative balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 13. You can see the bank remains more asset sensitive than U.S. peers. This asset sensitivity is after increasing the size of the HTM investment portfolio and increasing duration on the overall investment portfolio during quarter 4.
You can see the spot HTM balances at year-end is above the average balance for the quarter, as investments were made late in the quarter.
Now i will turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

Before we open for questions, I would just like to reiterate our key highlights of the year and how they are evidence of our ongoing ability to execute our strategy for the benefit of our shareholders.
We continue to make excellent headway in support of our strategic plan, with the acquisition and seamless integration of HSBC Bermuda's Private Banking, Investment Management and Trust business, in further ends of our goal-to-scale, our Trust and Management business in core markets. In line with our focus, we've restructured our U.K. operations to focus on our competitive strength in the residential property lending business there.
And of course, we successfully completed our initial public offering of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on September 16, which in turn, funded the redemption of our 2008 preference share issue in the fourth quarter.
Our results in the fourth quarter and for the full year were strong, with sustainable earnings performance as evidenced by the 49% increase in net income, and 22% increase in core earnings.
And Butterfield continues to be recognized in honor for our leadership in core markets and key business units. Everything we have accomplished in 2016 has established an exceptionally solid foundation for our future growth as an independent bank and trust company. We look forward to continuing to service our customers and provide strong and stable returns to our shareholders by focusing on our core markets, maintaining our leading position in Bermuda and the Cayman islands and scaling our Trust and Asset Management business."

But I think it's fair to say that given the fact that it will usually end up with a capital markets transactions, those balances will go up and down. And I think, the $3.6 billion you see today, absent the government loan and absent the Sterling move, which was $300 million out of the $400 million in decline in the quarter, I think that's kind of the core loan book that will consistently stay flat. But we'll continue to work with the government. And I think to your point, there are more opportunities to do bridge financing."

It's obviously something near and dear to our hearts that we're keeping an eye on. I think it's a little early for any one outside of the U.S, and particularly, Bermuda and Cayman, Guernsey to fully see what's going to happen in terms of the Trump tax policies and what the impact is going to be. I'd say broader picture, although, it is early, obviously, a border adjustment tax would be a net negative for Bermuda. There is some sense that services like reinsurance potentially could be carved out. But it's -- we'll have to wait and see what happens there. I would also say that reinsurance and captive insurance companies are in Bermuda for a lot of different reasons. These are global companies, and won't necessarily be completely dictated in terms of moving or deciding to have a different strategy just based on tax. They are here because of the market and the infrastructure. And then secondly, I think, the overall tax policy, if that were to decrease down to -- 15% or 20%, there would be less -- there would be compression, I think between what you'd see in terms of tax cost in the U.S. and outside Bermuda. But again, these are global companies that do 2/3 of their premiums outside the U.S. So I wouldn't necessarily see all of them or a lot of them setting up in the U.S. for 1/3 of their earnings. I think overall, from a regulatory perspective, we're obviously not in the U.S. So we look at what's happening in the U.S. We look at what's happening with Brexit. I think the most impactful part of all this is, if there is infrastructure spending, if there is a reduction in tax and there is inflationary aspects to that, then obviously, our interest rate sensitivity would be really important to the story. So I think in summary, I think it's a wait and see. I don't think there's any reason to be overly concerned at this point. There's a lot of moving parts. But we sense that all of it's moving towards a different interest rate cycle, which will help us."

Obviously, as rates go up, some of that leverage, some of the AFS securities may impact the TCE to TA as well. So we'd like to run with a little bit of a buffer over the 6%.

I think we've said consistently that we have a very different business model than most of the U.S. regional banks. And that with -- basically with capital flows, deposit 3x GDP in Bermuda and Cayman, we're always going to have a lot of deposits that we're going to have to invest elsewhere.

I think in Bermuda and Cayman, as we flagged all along, the opportunities for us to grow that book are somewhat muted. And again, from a risk prospective, the majority of our loans amortized. So we sort of have to run fast to stand still. So I think Michael's guidance is right. I think it'll be flat to slightly up, as we make our way throughout the year, with the biggest swing factor being, what Alex highlighted, which is the Government of Bermuda potentially borrowing in between bond issues."

So we don't want a lot of company administration or mutual fund administration. And we've stay discipline.

I'll give a brief overview of our strategy, execution, accomplishments and financial results in 2016. Michael Schrum and Dan Frumkin will then go into further detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial results.
Starting with Slide 3, while many of you are familiar with Butterfield, I'd like to provide an overview of the bank and reiterate what we believe to be our core attributes and competitive strengths.
Butterfield is a full-service bank and trust company, with a leading market share and pricing power in our banking jurisdictions, Bermuda and Cayman. We offer Community Banking services, composed of Retail and Corporate Banking, to individuals, local businesses, captive insurers, reinsurance companies, trust companies and hedge funds. Our banking products include personal and business deposits, residential and commercial mortgages, small business loans, credit and debit cards, merchant acquiring, mobile and online banking and cash management.
Butterfield's award-winning Wealth Management business, located in Bermuda, Cayman, Guernsey, Switzerland and the Bahamas, provides trust, private banking, asset management and custody services to ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices based in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
As an additional service, Butterfield Mortgages Limited provides residential mortgages on properties in Central London for our international clients with an interest in establishing a presence in the U.K.
Butterfield's strong capital generation and high returns are driven by a number of factors, including recurring fee income, low-cost deposits, high-yielding floating-rate loans, a conservative capital-efficient investment portfolio and our presence in income tax-neutral jurisdictions.
In 2016, we achieved a core return on average common tangible equity of 20%, an attractive return considering that 2/3 of our assets are held in cash and securities, which are invested primarily in low-risk U.S. government and federal agencies.
Our strategy is simple. We expect to continue to produce high risk-adjusted returns relative to our U.S. regional bank peers due to our unique business model. A leading market share, high barriers to entry and pricing power in each of our banking jurisdictions will generate excess capital that will be used to pay dividends and build our Wealth Management business through trust acquisitions.
With a long and recognized history of structuring trusts for mobile, ultra-high-net-worth families, we are well positioned to service the global private wealth business emanating from Asia, Europe and Latin America.
Turning to Slide 4, our Community Banking and Wealth Management businesses performed well in 2016, leading to a 22% increase in core net income. During the year, we successfully repositioned the bank by acquiring HSBC Bermuda's Wealth Management business and completing the wind down of our U.K. private bank. The integration of HSBC Wealth and the conversion of our deposit-taking U.K. Bank into a mortgage company for ultra-high-net-worth clients were both executed on time and within budget.
In September 2016, the bank completed a successful initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which enhanced trading liquidity for shareholders and provided the bank with access to international capital.
Following the IPO, we deployed $212 million of capital to repurchase preference shares, saving $16 million of annual preferred dividends and government guarantee fees, funds that will be used for the benefit of our common shareholders.
The board has declared a common dividend of $0.32 per share for Q4 2016, which is triple the $0.10 quarterly dividend paid to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2015.
This morning, we reported strong results for the full year, with 2016 net income of $115.9 million, up 49% over 2015.
Excluding noncore items, core net income rose from $113.9 million in 2015 to $138.6 million in 2016, an increase of 22%.
2016 core earnings per share was $2.48.
2016 was an important year for Butterfield. We made good progress in executing our strategy, producing healthy returns while acquiring HSBC Bermuda's Wealth business, winding down our U.K. bank, listing on the New York Stock Exchange, redeeming the preference shares and increasing the Q4 dividend to $0.32 per share.
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum, our Chief Financial Officer, to talk more about our financial results."

I'll now take you through some details of our 2016 financial results, with emphasis on the fourth quarter.
For further reference, we've also attached an expanded quarterly appendix at the end of this presentation, as well as a full quarterly reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures used.
On Slide 6, we show a summary income statement and a quarterly trend. Butterfield posted net income for the fourth quarter of $35.4 million and core net income of $37.1 million. This represents growth in both net interest income and fee income, as well as a net reduction in credit costs and expenses in the quarter.
We saw continued growth in deposits and a marked increase in liquidity returns. The core efficiency ratio for the quarter was 65.5% and 63.8% for the full year.
Turning to Slide 7. The growth in net interest income in the current quarter is in line with recent trends. As we continue to deploy excess liquidity into longer-dated U.S. agency securities, primarily in the held-to-maturity category, we saw attractive entry points in rates shortly after the U.S. election.
The new and higher-yielding securities have already stabilized investment yields in the quarter and positively contributed to our running book yield.
We also took the opportunity to reprice the entire dollar loan book, following the Fed rate hike in mid-December.
Residential mortgages impact follows a 90-day notice period from the 15th of December, 2016.
On the customer deposit side, we've held rates while continuing to win market share. Our cost of deposits in the quarter was 13 basis points, which continues to remain significantly below U.S. regional peers, at around 27 basis points.
The overall net interest margin improved by 6 basis points to 2.45% in the quarter, consistent with the improved liquidity returns and returns on the new held-to-maturity investment additions.
Highlighted on Slide 8 is the steady upward trend in noninterest income over the past 4 years, driven by both core market share growth as well as the impact of the addition and retention of acquired fee businesses.
The fourth quarter is normally a busy period for tourism-related foreign exchange and banking fees in our Cayman Business, as well as seasonal holiday activity in the Cards business in Bermuda and Cayman.
Asset management fees increased in the quarter as underlying portfolio valuations improved. We also saw an uptick in brokerage and asset management fees due to new assets under management. This was achieved by targeted marketing to recapture redemption proceeds from the banks' own preference share capital retirement.
Throughout the past 3 years, our core fee income ratio has remained above 35% and reached 36.7% in fourth quarter of 2016. This compares favorably to similar-sized U.S. banks with a median fee income ratio at around 25%. These annuity-like fees continue to represent a capital efficient and important revenue flow for the bank.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to make good progress with expenses. Expenses decreased from prior quarter due to the vesting cost of legacy option expenses in the third quarter. This was offset in the fourth quarter by tail core expenses from the U.K. restructure, as well as higher-than-usual costs for customer compliance [ for our ] reviews.
In addition, we have now started to make premium payments to the Bermuda Deposit Insurance scheme. And finally, we now have some new costs associated with being a U.S. public company.
For the full year, the core cost-efficiency ratio improved by 230 basis points to 63.8%.
On the Capital Management side, on Slide 10, you'll note that we continue to manage capital resources in a conservative and prudent manner. During the quarter, we retired the expensive 8% preferred share capital issue, which will make an additional $16 million available to common shareholders annually.
At 31 December, total regulatory capital stood at 17.6% with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at 15.3%.
These ratios remain well above regulatory minimum under the standardized Basel III regime operating in our core operating segments.
Our leverage capital ratio at 5.9% is now in line with our target range. We continue to operate below the median of comparable U.S. banks due to the relatively lower credit-risk density of our balance sheet. The ex cash leverage ratio was more comparable at 7.3% at the end of the year.
Finally, on the capital side, we declared our first quarterly dividend after the IPO and preference share capital redemption of $0.32 per share. This represents a more than threefold increase from the prior quarters and equates to $1.28 per share on an annualized basis.
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Risk Officer, Dan Frumkin, to talk about the balance sheet."

As both Michael Collins and Michael Schrum highlighted, Butterfield continues to generate strong profits and deliver on our promises to shareholders. As part of our overall strategy, we continue to focus on maintaining our efficient and liquid balance sheet while strategically managing the bank's risk profile.
Turning now to Slide 11. As of December 31, 2016, our total assets were $11.1 billion, a slight increase over the $11 billion in quarter 3.
For the year, assets were up $0.8 billion, attributable largely to the acquired deposits that were invested in securities, offset by the exiting of the U.K. deposit-taking operation and changes in the USD-Great British Pound exchange rates throughout the year.
Growth was supplemented by normal business-as-usual activities, as can be seen from the deposit growth in quarter 4.
Loans declined by $260 million in quarter 4, driven mainly by a $200 million repayment of a government overdraft as the government successfully issued a bond in early quarter 4.
In addition, the annual reduction in loans of $430 million was driven by the above repayment, the changes in USD-GBP exchange rates reducing loan balances by $101 million during the year, and a lack of opportunities to lend in our core markets.
A factor in lower new loan volume was the U.K. restructure that distracted the team originating new U.K. mortgages.
We continue to maintain a highly liquid position with 65% or $7.2 billion of our total assets comprising cash, short-term securities, reverse repurchase agreements and investments.
The bank continues to benefit from an attractive core deposit base with a combination of interest-bearing and noninterest bearing accounts. As of the end of 2016, our total deposits were $10 billion, which is a $357 million increase from quarter 3 and an increase of $850 million from year-end 2015.
The growth in deposits was driven primarily by the HSBC acquisition, though this was reduced by the effects of the wind-down of the U.K. deposit taking and Asset Management businesses, and the FX effect on Sterling-denominated deposits in Guernsey and Bermuda.
The quarter 4 growth was driven organically, as the HSBC acquisition occurred earlier in 2016.
Turning to Slide 12, the bank continues to maintain a conservative balance sheet. Our loan portfolio remains largely residential mortgages, which are individually, manually underwritten. The bank has benefited from a stabilizing macroeconomic environment, with a reduction of both nonperforming and nonaccrual loans.
Net charge-off rates remained low when compared to our U.S. peers. This is driven by the fact that almost all lending at the bank is secured and that the loan-to-value profile on the residential mortgage book is conservative.
New residential mortgage originations in Bermuda are limited per policy to a maximum 80% loan-to-value. While in the U.K., we limit new residential mortgages to a maximum 65% loan-to-value.
The investment portfolio is 87% AAA-rated securities and 100% investment grade. The bank continues to maintain a highly liquid and conservative balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 13. You can see the bank remains more asset sensitive than U.S. peers. This asset sensitivity is after increasing the size of the HTM investment portfolio and increasing duration on the overall investment portfolio during quarter 4.
You can see the spot HTM balances at year-end is above the average balance for the quarter, as investments were made late in the quarter.
Now I will turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

Before we open for questions, I would just like to reiterate our key highlights of the year and how they are evidence of our ongoing ability to execute our strategy for the benefit of our shareholders.
We continue to make excellent headway in support of our strategic plan with the acquisition and seamless integration of HSBC Bermuda's Private Banking, Investment Management and Trust business in furtherance of our goal to scale our trust and management business in core markets. In line with our focus, we've restructured our U.K. operations to focus on our competitive strength in the residential property lending business there.
And of course, we successfully completed our initial public offering of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on September 16, which in turn, funded the redemption of our 2008 preference share issue in the fourth quarter.
Our results in the fourth quarter and for the full year were strong with sustainable earnings performance as evidenced by the 49% increase in net income and 22% increase in core earnings.
And Butterfield continues to be recognized in honor for our leadership in core markets and key business units. Everything we have accomplished in 2016 has established an exceptionally solid foundation for our future growth as an independent bank and trust company. We look forward to continuing to service our customers and provide strong and stable returns to our shareholders by focusing on our core markets, maintaining our leading position in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands and scaling our trust and asset management business."

And I think the $3.6 billion you see today, absent the government loan and absent the Sterling move, which was $300 million out of the $400 million in decline in the quarter, I think that's kind of the core loan book that will consistently stay flat. But we'll continue to work with the government. And I think to your point, there are more opportunities to do bridge financing."

It's obviously something near and dear to our hearts that we're keeping an eye on. I think it's a little early for anyone outside of the U.S, and particularly Bermuda and Cayman, Guernsey, to fully see what's going to happen in terms of the Trump tax policies and what the impact is going to be. I'd say broader picture, although it is early, obviously, a border-adjustment tax would be a net negative for Bermuda. There is some sense that services like reinsurance potentially could be carved out. But it's -- we'll have to wait and see what happens there. I would also say that reinsurance and captive insurance companies are in Bermuda for a lot of different reasons. These are global companies and won't necessarily be completely dictated in terms of moving or deciding to have a different strategy just based on tax. They are here because of the market and the infrastructure. And then secondly, I think, the overall tax policy, if that were to decrease down to -- 15% or 20%, there would be less -- there would be compression, I think, between what you'd see in terms of tax cost in the U.S. and outside Bermuda. But again, these are global companies that do 2/3 of their premiums outside the U.S. So I wouldn't necessarily see all of them or a lot of them setting up in the U.S. for 1/3 of their earnings. I think overall, from a regulatory perspective, we're obviously not in the U.S. So we look at what's happening in the U.S. We look at what's happening with Brexit. I think the most impactful part of all this is, if there is infrastructure spending, if there is a reduction in tax and there is inflationary aspects to that, then obviously, our interest rate sensitivity would be really important to the story. So I think in summary, I think it's a wait and see. I don't think there's any reason to be overly concerned at this point. There's a lot of moving parts. But we sense that all of it's moving towards a different interest rate cycle, which will help us."

I'll give a brief overview of our strategy, execution, accomplishments and financial results in 2016. Michael Schrum and Dan Frumkin will then go into further detail on our fourth quarter and full year financial results.
Starting with Slide 3, while many of you are familiar with Butterfield, I'd like to provide an overview of the bank and reiterate what we believe to be our core attributes and competitive strengths.
Butterfield is a full-service bank and trust company, with a leading market share and pricing power in our banking jurisdictions, Bermuda and Cayman. We offer Community Banking services, composed of Retail and Corporate Banking, to individuals, local businesses, captive insurers, reinsurance companies, trust companies and hedge funds. Our banking products include personal and business deposits, residential and commercial mortgages, small business loans, credit and debit cards, merchant acquiring, mobile and online banking and cash management.
Butterfield's award-winning Wealth Management business, located in Bermuda, Cayman, Guernsey, Switzerland and the Bahamas, provides trust, private banking, asset management and custody services to ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices based in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
As an additional service, Butterfield Mortgages Limited provides residential mortgages on properties in Central London for our international clients with an interest in establishing a presence in the U.K.
Butterfield's strong capital generation and high returns are driven by a number of factors, including recurring fee income, low-cost deposits, high-yielding floating-rate loans, a conservative capital-efficient investment portfolio and our presence in income tax-neutral jurisdictions.
In 2016, we achieved a core return on average common tangible equity of 20%, an attractive return considering that 2/3 of our assets are held in cash and securities, which are invested primarily in low-risk U.S. government and federal agencies.
Our strategy is simple. We expect to continue to produce high risk-adjusted returns relative to our U.S. regional bank peers due to our unique business model. A leading market share, high barriers to entry and pricing power in each of our banking jurisdictions will generate excess capital that will be used to pay dividends and build our Wealth Management business through trust acquisitions.
With a long and recognized history of structuring trusts for mobile, ultra-high-net-worth families, we are well positioned to service the global private wealth business emanating from Asia, Europe and Latin America.
Turning to Slide 4, our Community Banking and Wealth Management businesses performed well in 2016, leading to a 22% increase in core net income. During the year, we successfully repositioned the bank by acquiring HSBC Bermuda's Wealth Management business and completing the wind down of our U.K. private bank. The integration of HSBC Wealth and the conversion of our deposit-taking U.K. Bank into a mortgage company for ultra-high-net-worth clients were both executed on time and within budget.
In September 2016, the bank completed a successful initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which enhanced trading liquidity for shareholders and provided the bank with access to international capital.
Following the IPO, we deployed $212 million of capital to repurchase preference shares, saving $16 million of annual preferred dividends and government guarantee fees, funds that will be used for the benefit of our common shareholders.
The board has declared a common dividend of $0.32 per share for Q4 2016, which is triple the $0.10 quarterly dividend paid to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2015.
This morning, we reported strong results for the full year, with 2016 net income of $115.9 million, up 49% over 2015.
Excluding noncore items, core net income rose from $113.9 million in 2015 to $138.6 million in 2016, an increase of 22%.
2016 core earnings per share was $2.48.
2016 was an important year for Butterfield. We made good progress in executing our strategy, producing healthy returns while acquiring HSBC Bermuda's Wealth business, winding down our U.K. bank, listing on the New York Stock Exchange, redeeming the preference shares and increasing the Q4 dividend to $0.32 per share.
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum, our Chief Financial Officer, to talk more about our financial results."

I'll now take you through some details of our 2016 financial results, with emphasis on the fourth quarter.
For further reference, we've also attached an expanded quarterly appendix at the end of this presentation, as well as a full quarterly reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures used.
On Slide 6, we show a summary income statement and a quarterly trend. Butterfield posted net income for the fourth quarter of $35.4 million and core net income of $37.1 million. This represents growth in both net interest income and fee income, as well as a net reduction in credit costs and expenses in the quarter.
We saw continued growth in deposits and a marked increase in liquidity returns. The core efficiency ratio for the quarter was 65.5% and 63.8% for the full year.
Turning to Slide 7. The growth in net interest income in the current quarter is in line with recent trends. As we continue to deploy excess liquidity into longer-dated U.S. agency securities, primarily in the held-to-maturity category, we saw attractive entry points in rates shortly after the U.S. election.
The new and higher-yielding securities have already stabilized investment yields in the quarter and positively contributed to our running book yield.
We also took the opportunity to reprice the entire dollar loan book, following the Fed rate hike in mid-December.
Residential mortgages impact follows a 90-day notice period from the 15th of December, 2016.
On the customer deposit side, we've held rates while continuing to win market share. Our cost of deposits in the quarter was 13 basis points, which continues to remain significantly below U.S. regional peers, at around 27 basis points.
The overall net interest margin improved by 6 basis points to 2.45% in the quarter, consistent with the improved liquidity returns and returns on the new held-to-maturity investment additions.
Highlighted on Slide 8 is the steady upward trend in noninterest income over the past 4 years, driven by both core market share growth as well as the impact of the addition and retention of acquired fee businesses.
The fourth quarter is normally a busy period for tourism-related foreign exchange and banking fees in our Cayman Business, as well as seasonal holiday activity in the Cards business in Bermuda and Cayman.
Asset management fees increased in the quarter as underlying portfolio valuations improved. We also saw an uptick in brokerage and asset management fees due to new assets under management. This was achieved by targeted marketing to recapture redemption proceeds from the banks' own preference share capital retirement.
Throughout the past 3 years, our core fee income ratio has remained above 35% and reached 36.7% in fourth quarter of 2016. This compares favorably to similar-sized U.S. banks with a median fee income ratio at around 25%. These annuity-like fees continue to represent a capital efficient and important revenue flow for the bank.
Turning to Slide 9. We continue to make good progress with expenses. Expenses decreased from prior quarter due to the vesting cost of legacy option expenses in the third quarter. This was offset in the fourth quarter by tail core expenses from the U.K. restructure, as well as higher-than-usual costs for customer compliance [ for our ] reviews.
In addition, we have now started to make premium payments to the Bermuda Deposit Insurance scheme. And finally, we now have some new costs associated with being a U.S. public company.
For the full year, the core cost-efficiency ratio improved by 230 basis points to 63.8%.
On the Capital Management side, on Slide 10, you'll note that we continue to manage capital resources in a conservative and prudent manner. During the quarter, we retired the expensive 8% preferred share capital issue, which will make an additional $16 million available to common shareholders annually.
At 31 December, total regulatory capital stood at 17.6% with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at 15.3%.
These ratios remain well above regulatory minimum under the standardized Basel III regime operating in our core operating segments.
Our leverage capital ratio at 5.9% is now in line with our target range. We continue to operate below the median of comparable U.S. banks due to the relatively lower credit-risk density of our balance sheet. The ex cash leverage ratio was more comparable at 7.3% at the end of the year.
Finally, on the capital side, we declared our first quarterly dividend after the IPO and preference share capital redemption of $0.32 per share. This represents a more than threefold increase from the prior quarters and equates to $1.28 per share on an annualized basis.
Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Risk Officer, Dan Frumkin, to talk about the balance sheet."

As both Michael Collins and Michael Schrum highlighted, Butterfield continues to generate strong profits and deliver on our promises to shareholders. As part of our overall strategy, we continue to focus on maintaining our efficient and liquid balance sheet while strategically managing the bank's risk profile.
Turning now to Slide 11. As of December 31, 2016, our total assets were $11.1 billion, a slight increase over the $11 billion in quarter 3.
For the year, assets were up $0.8 billion, attributable largely to the acquired deposits that were invested in securities, offset by the exiting of the U.K. deposit-taking operation and changes in the USD-Great British Pound exchange rates throughout the year.
Growth was supplemented by normal business-as-usual activities, as can be seen from the deposit growth in quarter 4.
Loans declined by $260 million in quarter 4, driven mainly by a $200 million repayment of a government overdraft as the government successfully issued a bond in early quarter 4.
In addition, the annual reduction in loans of $430 million was driven by the above repayment, the changes in USD-GBP exchange rates reducing loan balances by $101 million during the year, and a lack of opportunities to lend in our core markets.
A factor in lower new loan volume was the U.K. restructure that distracted the team originating new U.K. mortgages.
We continue to maintain a highly liquid position with 65% or $7.2 billion of our total assets comprising cash, short-term securities, reverse repurchase agreements and investments.
The bank continues to benefit from an attractive core deposit base with a combination of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing accounts. As of the end of 2016, our total deposits were $10 billion, which is a $357 million increase from quarter 3 and an increase of $850 million from year-end 2015.
The growth in deposits was driven primarily by the HSBC acquisition, though this was reduced by the effects of the wind-down of the U.K. deposit-taking and Asset Management businesses, and the FX effect on Sterling-denominated deposits in Guernsey and Bermuda.
The quarter 4 growth was driven organically, as the HSBC acquisition occurred earlier in 2016.
Turning to Slide 12, the bank continues to maintain a conservative balance sheet. Our loan portfolio remains largely residential mortgages, which are individually, manually underwritten. The bank has benefited from a stabilizing macroeconomic environment, with a reduction of both nonperforming and nonaccrual loans.
Net charge-off rates remained low when compared to our U.S. peers. This is driven by the fact that almost all lending at the bank is secured and that the loan-to-value profile on the residential mortgage book is conservative.
New residential mortgage originations in Bermuda are limited per policy to a maximum 80% loan-to-value. While in the U.K., we limit new residential mortgages to a maximum 65% loan-to-value.
The investment portfolio is 87% AAA-rated securities and 100% investment grade. The bank continues to maintain a highly liquid and conservative balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 13. You can see the bank remains more asset sensitive than U.S. peers. This asset sensitivity is after increasing the size of the HTM investment portfolio and increasing duration on the overall investment portfolio during quarter 4.
You can see the spot HTM balances at year-end is above the average balance for the quarter, as investments were made late in the quarter.
Now I will turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

Before we open for questions, I would just like to reiterate our key highlights of the year and how they are evidence of our ongoing ability to execute our strategy for the benefit of our shareholders.
We continue to make excellent headway in support of our strategic plan with the acquisition and seamless integration of HSBC Bermuda's Private Banking, Investment Management and Trust business in furtherance of our goal to scale our trust and management business in core markets. In line with our focus, we've restructured our U.K. operations to focus on our competitive strength in the residential property lending business there.
And of course, we successfully completed our initial public offering of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on September 16, which in turn, funded the redemption of our 2008 preference share issue in the fourth quarter.
Our results in the fourth quarter and for the full year were strong with sustainable earnings performance as evidenced by the 49% increase in net income and 22% increase in core earnings.
And Butterfield continues to be recognized in honor for our leadership in core markets and key business units. Everything we have accomplished in 2016 has established an exceptionally solid foundation for our future growth as an independent bank and trust company. We look forward to continuing to service our customers and provide strong and stable returns to our shareholders by focusing on our core markets, maintaining our leading position in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands and scaling our trust and asset management business."

But I think it's fair to say that given the fact that it will usually end up with a capital markets transaction, those balances will go up and down. And I think the $3.6 billion you see today, absent the government loan and absent the Sterling move, which was $300 million out of the $400 million in decline in the quarter, I think that's kind of the core loan book that will consistently stay flat. But we'll continue to work with the government. And I think to your point, there are more opportunities to do bridge financing."

It's obviously something near and dear to our hearts that we're keeping an eye on. I think it's a little early for anyone outside of the U.S, and particularly Bermuda and Cayman, Guernsey, to fully see what's going to happen in terms of the Trump tax policies and what the impact is going to be. I'd say broader picture, although it is early, obviously, a border-adjustment tax would be a net negative for Bermuda. There is some sense that services like reinsurance potentially could be carved out. But it's -- we'll have to wait and see what happens there. I would also say that reinsurance and captive insurance companies are in Bermuda for a lot of different reasons. These are global companies and won't necessarily be completely dictated in terms of moving or deciding to have a different strategy just based on tax. They are here because of the market and the infrastructure. And then secondly, I think, the overall tax policy, if that were to decrease down to -- 15% or 20%, there would be less -- there would be compression, I think, between what you'd see in terms of tax cost in the U.S. and outside Bermuda. But again, these are global companies that do 2/3 of their premiums outside the U.S. So I wouldn't necessarily see all of them or a lot of them setting up in the U.S. for 1/3 of their earnings. I think overall, from a regulatory perspective, we're obviously not in the U.S. So we look at what's happening in the U.S. We look at what's happening with Brexit. I think the most impactful part of all this is, if there is infrastructure spending, if there is a reduction in tax and there is inflationary aspects to that, then obviously, our interest rate sensitivity would be really important to the story. So I think in summary, I think it's a wait and see. I don't think there's any reason to be overly concerned at this point. There's a lot of moving parts. But we sense that all of it's moving towards a different interest rate cycle, which will help us."

But it is an expensive capital structure to run. I think we're pretty much where we are in the 6% to 6.5%. Obviously, as rates go up, some of that leverage, some of the AFS securities may impact the TCE to TA as well. So we'd like to run with a little bit of a buffer over the 6%.

Though most of that was really explained by those 2 items, so really is -- has been relatively flat. We don't see it increasing. I think we've said consistently that we have a very different business model than most U.S. regional banks. And that with -- basically with capital flows, deposits 3x GDP in Bermuda and Cayman, we're always going to have a lot of deposits that we're going to have to invest elsewhere. And we're not interested in going outside of our home markets to find loans. I think that doesn't usually end well.

I think in Bermuda and Cayman, as we flagged all along, the opportunities for us to grow that book are somewhat muted. And again, from a risk perspective, the majority of our loans amortize. So we sort of have to run fast to stand still. So I think Michael's guidance is right. I think it'll be flat to slightly up as we make our way throughout the year, with the biggest swing factor being what Alex highlighted, which is the Government of Bermuda potentially borrowing in between bond issues."

And we've stayed disciplined. We've seen quite a few opportunities since we spoke last, and looked at a couple of them pretty seriously.

We're pleased to announce another strong quarter at Butterfield, as rate increases led to margin improvements, and expenses began to return to a more normal level. 
It was a little more than 1 year ago that we completed our initial public offering. And I'd like to thank our customers, employees and shareholders who have contributed to our success as a public company. 
Without your support, we could not have achieved the record results that are highlighted on Slide 4, with core net income increasing to $0.73 per share, net interest margin increasing to 2.81%, and core return on equity increasing to 22.2%. 
During the quarter, hurricanes caused significant damage to the communities in the Caribbean and Southern United States. We were fortunate, and we're not affected, but as residents of [indiscernible] communities ourselves, our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who was impacted. 
Today, we're also excited to announce an agreement to acquire Deutsche Bank's Global Trust Solutions Business, which will add scale and talent to our existing operations and add a profitable in and important private trust platform in Singapore. This transaction represents our fourth such acquisition in 3 years, and is consistent with our strategy to expand our capital efficient, fee-based trust business in select market. 
It also validates Butterfield's reputation as a leader in International Wealth Management and Trust Services, with a proven ability to integrate business from global financial leaders like Deutsche Bank. 
In addition to the acquisition, we're pleased to have entered into a partnership with Deutsche Bank's Wealth Management team, whereby Butterfield will provide trust solutions to Deutsche Bank's clients on an ongoing basis. We believe that working closely with Deutsche Bank will provide us with additional opportunities to expand our businesses, especially in Asia. 
Thinking together, we believe our strong financial results, combined with our success in growing out trust business, demonstrates our strategy to create shareholder value is working. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum."

On Slide 6, we show a healthy third quarter increase in net interest income to 74.3 million and a corresponding 15 basis points increase in net interest margin to 2.81% This continued margin expansion was due to higher short-term rates that boosted the returns on our liquidity and investment portfolios, as well as repricing that increased the yields on our loan book.
In aggregate, loan margins expanded by 5 basis points, as commercial loan yields increased by 19 basis points and consumer loan yields decreased by 1 basis point. 
The decline in consumer yields was due to lower yielding U.K. residential mortgage originations, replacing higher yielding amortization from the Bermuda and Cayman mortgage book. 
Slide 7 details the performance of our various fee businesses, which generated $38 .2 million of capital efficient noninterest income in the third quarter. 
Banking, trust and FX revenues were broadly flat, while we did see some growth in Asset Management. At 34%, Butterfield's fee income ratio is well above our peer average, and helps produce industry-leading returns on equity. 
We expect the acquisition of Global Trust Solutions business from Deutsche Bank will add new trust revenue, and will be accretive once integrated in the first half of 2018. 
We're also pleased to be acquiring a high-quality and profitable trust platform in Singapore, that will accelerate our plans to expand in that region. 
As you may have guessed by now, we're limited in what financial information we can disclose, but we can confirm that the transaction is within previously disclosed parameters in terms of size, expected return and earnings multiple. Upon completion of the transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, Butterfield will take over the ongoing management and administration of Global Trust Solutions business, comprising approximately 1,000 trust structures for some 900 private clients. 
Butterfield is also offering positions to all personnel who are fully dedicated to the Global Trust Solutions business based in the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Singapore, Switzerland and Mauritius, thereby, ensuring continuity of service for clients. 
Slide 8 highlights the progress we continue to make in bringing expenses down to a more normal level. We remain on track to deliver a core cost income ratio of approximately 60% over the coming quarters. 
As anticipated, third quarter marketing expenses decreased, as cost related to the Americas Cup events in Bermuda ended. 
Expenses related to our [indiscernible] program and investments in compliance systems continued as expected, but are anticipated to level off by the end of 2017. 
Expenses related to the Halifax Service Center buildout will likely continue through the end of the year, and thereafter, we'll start to create operational efficiencies and additional capacity. 
Professional fees were also elevated this quarter as we deployed resources to assist with the acquisition. We have included some of these specific third-party costs in noncore expenses consistent with previous acquisitions. And we have also included a line by line reconciliation to our U.S. GAAP financials in the Appendix to the presentation. 
Slide 9 highlights capital levels, showing both [indiscernible] regulatory capital and leverage capital. We recorded an increase in [indiscernible]of 3 capital ratio of 80 basis points to 19.9%, a level well above the Bermuda regulatory requirements. 
Our tangible common equity to total asset ratio also increased by 30 basis points to 7%, and remains at the high-end of our target range. 
Pro forma for the acquisition, which we expect to close in the first half of 2018, capital levels are expected to remain at the high-end of our target range. 
For the third quarter of 2017, the Board declared a dividend of $0.32 per common share, which reflects our ongoing balanced approach to capital management and commitment to providing shareholders with stable returns. We will be reviewing the dividend and other capital allocation strategies, consistent with last year, once we complete the 2018 planning cycle that is currently underway. 
I will now hand it over to Dan to discuss the balance sheet."

We are aware of the unique environment in which we operate and seek to maximize safety and stability by managing risk, while maintaining sufficient capital in an efficient and liquid balance sheet. 
Slide 10 summarizes the bank's balance sheet at the end of the third quarter, which, at $10.6 billion, was essentially flat from the second quarter of 2017. We continue to maintain a highly liquid position with 62% of our total assets comprised of cash and equivalents, short-term investments and investment assets. 
Loan balances remained flat from the prior quarter, due primarily to commercial and residential loan amortizations, offset by continued growth in the new residential mortgages, particularly in our U.K. Mortgage business. 
As we've discussed before, average deposit balances tend to fluctuate inter-quarter, as our largest trust customers manage our commercial interest. 
A summary of our loan and investment portfolios on Slide 11 shows the composition in size of the loan portfolio remaining broadly flat at $3.6 billion, and made up of essentially the same mix of assets. 
Nonperforming loans, which include gross nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more totaled $61.8 million, as of September 30, 2017, which is in line with last quarter's balance. 
The net charge-off ratio remained low at 2 basis points for the quarter. 
Our investment portfolio remains stable at $4.6 billion, as a lack of attractive pricing in the U.S. dollar term rate market deterred any significant rebalancing. We are cautiously optimistic that we'll have opportunities to prudently deploy additional excess deposits into this market in the near term at better rates. 
At quarter end, approximately 92% of the investment portfolio consisted of Triple A rated securities. 
Slide 12 summarizes the average balance sheet for the rest -- of the left side of our balance sheet, and highlights the client-driven quarter-to-quarter changes we tend to see. Slide 12 also illustrates our interest rate sensitivity relative to our U.S. peers, and shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates would generate an uptake in net interest income of 12.7% versus our peers at 6%. 
I will now turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

There's a little bit of noise in the noncore. But -- so, say a couple of 3 out of that base. And then going into next year, obviously, as we start to get some capacity out of the Halifax Center, that will be a tailwind, if you will, to offset some -- maybe some of the headwinds that we're seeing elsewhere."

Obviously, we talked about we can't disclose the financial terms of the transaction. But what we can say, going back to the acquisition criteria that we've laid out in the past, it really meets all the buckets. So in terms of size, under $50 million purchase price. We talked about price, 8x EBITDA or less. So it meets that, in terms of trailing EBITDA. The profile of this has to be at least 2/3 private trust. So -- as we talked about in the past, we're less interested or not interested really in fund administration and company secretarial work and that sort of stuff. It really is private trust we're after. This is obviously 100% private trust. And if you remember the locations, it has to be our existing jurisdictions, Switzerland, [indiscernible] Bermuda and Cayman, where we have scale. And as you pointed out, with the exception of Singapore. So Singapore, obviously, is a market we wanted to get into for a long time. And it goes back historically to our trust business from a lot of the Hong Kong families. So having a presence there is really important. It's not possible really to talk about market share in terms of trust in Singapore really any jurisdictions. It's -- information is private and confidential. It's really hard to get that sort of data. But I can tell you that Singapore is basically about -- acquisition comes with about 90 people in those jurisdictions. Singapore is about 15% of that, and it would represent about 20% of the revenue of that business. And overall, roughly, it's about 20, this acquisition is about 20%, 25% of the size of our existing trust business. So I think that gives you a little bit of a sense of the scale. So having a platform in Singapore will allow us to grow, but it's tough to actually talk about what sort of market share we would have there."

Thanks for the question. It's Michael Schrum. As you correctly pointed out, the U.K. mortgage origination, they're accretive from a net interest income prospective, but they tend to obviously, cause a downward pressure on the overall consumer margin, which in this quarter offset the margin expansion from the Bermuda book, which is an advertising book. So as we continue to see a growth opportunities in the U.K., that will tend to in the absence of any further rate hikes tend to have a flattish to slightly downward pressure on the overall consumer yields. In terms of the commercial, it just really this quarter, we had some significant margin expansion really product mix issues and so we had a hire utilization of commercial overdrafts, hire yields during the entire quarter, while term balances remained fairly stable. So its really a product mix layers on a commercial, which caused a significant uptick in the yields in our book. I think going foreword, on a commercial sighed, it's relatively small book, but I think we should expect that to sort of the flattish again absent any further funding cost increases."

We're pleased to announce another strong quarter at Butterfield, as rate increases led to margin improvements and expenses began to return to a more normal level. It was a little more than a year ago that we completed our initial public offering, and I'd like to thank our customers, employees and shareholders who have contributed to our success as a public company. Without your support, we could not have achieved the record results that are highlighted on Slide 4, with core net income increasing to $0.73 per share, net interest margin increasing to 2.81% and core return on equity increasing to 22.2%. 
During the quarter, hurricanes caused significant damage to communities in the Caribbean and Southern United States. We were fortunate and were not affected, but as residents of violent communities ourselves, our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who was impacted. 
Today, we're also excited to announce an agreement to acquire Deutsche Bank's Global Trust Solutions Business, which will add scale and talent to our existing operations and add a profitable and strategically important private trust platform in Singapore. This transaction represents our fourth such acquisition in 3 years and is consistent with our strategy to expand our capital efficient, fee-based trust business and select market. It also validates Butterfield's reputation as a leader in international wealth management and trust services, with a proven ability to integrate businesses from global financial leaders like Deutsche Bank. 
In addition to the acquisition, we're pleased to have entered into a partnership with Deutsche Bank's Wealth Management team, whereby Butterfield will provide trust solutions to Deutsche Bank's clients on an ongoing basis. We believe that working closely with Deutsche Bank will provide us with additional opportunities to expand our businesses, especially in Asia. 
Thinking together, we believe our strong financial results, combined with our success in growing our trust business, demonstrates that our strategy to create shareholder value is working.

On Slide 6, we show a healthy third quarter increase in net interest income to $74.3 million and a corresponding 15 basis point increase in net interest margin to 2.81%. This continued margin expansion was d",663,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 6, we show a healthy third quarter increase in net interest income to $74.3 million and a corresponding 15 basis point increase in net interest margin to 2.81%. This continued margin expansion was due to higher short-term rates that boosted the returns on our liquidity and investment portfolios as well as repricing that increased the yields on our loan book.
In aggregate, loan margins expanded by 5 basis points, as commercial loan yields increased by 19 basis points and consumer loan yields decreased by 1 basis point. The decline in consumer yields was due to lower-yielding U.K. residential mortgage originations, replacing higher-yielding amortization from the Bermuda and Cayman mortgage book. 
Slide 7 details the performance of our various fee businesses, which generated $38.2 million of capital-efficient noninterest income in the third quarter. 
Banking, trust and FX revenues were broadly flat, while we did see some growth in Asset Management. At 34%, Butterfield's fee income ratio is well above our peer average and helps produce industry-leading returns on equity. 
We expect the acquisition of Global Trust Solutions business from Deutsche Bank will add new trust revenue and will be accretive once integrated in the first half of 2018. We're also pleased to be acquiring a high-quality and profitable trust platform in Singapore that will accelerate our plans to expand in that region. 
As you may have guessed by now, we are limited in what financial information we can disclose, but we can confirm that the transaction is within previously disclosed parameters in terms of size expected return and earnings multiple. Upon completion of the transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, Butterfield will take over the ongoing management and administration of Global Trust Solutions business, comprising approximately 1,000 trust structures for some 900 private clients. 
Butterfield is also offering positions to all personnel who are fully dedicated to the Global Trust Solutions business based in the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Singapore, Switzerland and Mauritius, thereby ensuring continuity of service for clients. 
Slide 8 highlights the progress we continue to make in bringing expenses down to a more normal level. We remain on track to deliver our core cost-to-income ratio of approximately 60% over the coming quarters. 
As anticipated, third quarter marketing expenses decreased, as cost related to the America's Cup events in Bermuda ended. 
Expenses related to our Sarbanes Oxley program and investments in compliance systems continued as expected but are anticipated to level off by the end of 2017. Expenses related to the Halifax service center build-out will likely continue through the end of the year, and thereafter, we'll start to create operational efficiencies and additional capacity. 
Professional fees were also elevated this quarter as we deployed resources to assist with the acquisition. We have included some of these specific third party costs in noncore expenses, consistent with previous acquisitions. And we have also included a line-by-line reconciliation to our U.S. GAAP financials in the Appendix to the presentation. 
Slide 9 highlights capital levels, showing both Basel III regulatory capital and leverage capital. We recorded an increase in our Basel III capital ratio of 80 basis points to 19.9%, a level well above the Bermuda regulatory requirements. Our tangible common equity to total asset ratio also increased by 30 basis points to 7% and remains at the high end of our target range. Pro forma for the acquisition, which we expect to close in the first half of 2018, capital levels are expected to remain at the high end of our target range. 
For the third quarter of 2017, the board declared a dividend of $0.32 per common share, which reflects our ongoing balanced approach to capital management and commitment to providing shareholders with stable returns. We will be reviewing the dividend and other capital allocation strategies, consistent with last year, once we complete the 2018 planning cycle that is currently underway. 
I will now hand it over to Dan to discuss the balance sheet."

Butterfield & Son Limited","Executives","Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. We are aware of the unique environment in which we operate and seek to maximize safety and stability by managing risk while maintaining sufficient capital in an efficient and liquid balance sheet. Slide 10 sum",364,"Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. We are aware of the unique environment in which we operate and seek to maximize safety and stability by managing risk while maintaining sufficient capital in an efficient and liquid balance sheet. 
Slide 10 summarizes the bank's balance sheet at the end of the third quarter, which at $10.6 billion, was essentially flat from the second quarter of 2017. We continued to maintain a highly liquid position, with 62% of our total assets comprised of cash and equivalents, short-term investments and investment assets. Loan balances remained flat from the prior quarter, due primarily to commercial and residential loan amortizations, offset by continued growth in the new residential mortgages, particularly in our U.K. mortgage business. 
As we've discussed before, average deposit balances tend to fluctuate inter-quarter as our largest trust customers manage their commercial interests. 
A summary of our loan and investment portfolios on Slide 11 shows the composition and size of the loan portfolio remaining broadly flat at $3.6 billion and made up of essentially the same mix of assets. Nonperforming loans, which include gross nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more, totaled $61.8 million as of September 30, 2017, which is in line with last quarter's balance. The net charge-off ratio remained low at 2 basis points for the quarter. 
Our investment portfolio remains stable at $4.6 billion, as a lack of attractive pricing in the U.S. dollar term rate market deterred any significant rebalancing. We are cautiously optimistic that we will have opportunities to prudently deploy additional excess deposits into this market in the near term at better rates. 
At quarter-end, approximately 92% of the investment portfolio consisted of AAA-rated securities. 
Slide 12 summarizes the average balance sheet for the rest -- of the left side of our balance sheet and highlights the client-driven quarter-to-quarter changes we tend to see. Slide 12 also illustrates our interest rate sensitivity relative to our U.S. peers and shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates would generate an uptick in net interest income of 12.7% versus our peers at 6%. 
I will now turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

The third quarter, again, demonstrated the strength of the Butterfield franchise, with expanding net interest margin, stable fee revenue, continued low-cost deposits and core return on equity that remained above 20% for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our acquisition of Deutsche Bank's Global Trust Solutions business demonstrates our ability to transact with industry leaders and is expected to create additional opportunities for us as we continue to add scale to our international trust business. We also believe that Butterfield's partnership with Deutsche Bank Wealth Management will benefit both companies by deepening existing client relationships and helping, also, to create new ones.

So obviously, what we talked about, we can't disclose the financial terms of the transaction. But what we can say, going back to the acquisition criteria that we've laid out in the past, it really meets all the buckets. So in terms of size, under $50 million purchase price. We talked about price of 8x EBITDA or less, so it meets that in terms of trailing EBITDA. The profile of the business has to be at least 2/3 private trust. So as we talked about in the past, we're less interested or not interested, really, in fund administration and company secretarial work and that sort of stuff. It really is private trust we're after. This is obviously 100% private trust. And if you remember the locations have to be our existing jurisdictions, Switzerland, Guernsey, Bermuda, Cayman, where we have scale, and, as you pointed out, with the exception of Singapore. So Singapore, obviously, is a market we've wanted to get into for a long time, and it goes back historically to our trust business from a lot of the Hong Kong family. So having a presence there is really important. It's not possible, really, to talk about market share in terms of trust in Singapore, really, any jurisdictions. Its information is private and confidential, it's really hard to get that sort of data. But I can tell you that Singapore is basically about -- the acquisition comes with about 90 people in those jurisdictions. Singapore is about 15% of that, and it would represent about 20% of the revenue of that business. And overall, roughly, it's about 20%, this acquisition is about 20%, 25% of the size of our existing Trust business. So I think that gives you a little bit of a sense of the scale. So having a platform in Singapore will allow us to grow, but it's tough to actually talk about what sort of market share we would have there."

As you correctly pointed out, the U.K. mortgage origination, they're accretive from a net interest income prospective, but they tend to, obviously, cause a downward pressure on the overall consumer margin, which, in this quarter, offset the margin expansion from the Bermuda book, which is an amortizing book. So as we continue to see growth opportunities in the U.K., that will tend to, in the absence of any rate -- further rate hikes, tend to have a flattish to slightly downward pressure on the overall consumer yields. 
In terms of the commercial, it's really -- this quarter, we had some significant margin expansion, really a product mix issue. So we had a hire utilization of commercial overdrafts at hire yields during the entire quarter, while term balances remained fairly stable. So it's really a product mix there on the commercial, which caused a significant uptick in the yields on that book. I think going forward, on the commercial side, it's a relatively small book, but I think we should expect that to sort of be flattish, again, absent any further funding cost increases."

We have an acquisition similar to last year where we really came out of the gates in Q1, that would be the point at which we would want to look at all the capital allocation, including a buyback. I don't think our thoughts have changed in that area. I think tactically deploying some of the excess capital into sort of a tactical buyback still seems to be broadly acceptable and certainly would be accretive."

So -- but the profitability would be relatively similar. We'll have some costs in the near term because we're setting up 2 new -- we're in 2 new locations. So obviously, we haven't been in Singapore, we haven't been in Mauritius, so we can't combine those with the existing operations, Switzerland and Guernsey and Cayman, that makes that so much easier because we've got existing staff and systems in everything.

We're pleased to announce another strong quarter at Butterfield, as rate increases led to margin improvements and expenses began to return to a more normal level. It was a little more than a year ago that we completed our initial public offering, and I'd like to thank our customers, employees and shareholders who have contributed to our success as a public company. Without your support, we could not have achieved the record results that are highlighted on Slide 4, with core net income increasing to $0.73 per share, net interest margin increasing to 2.81% and core return on equity increasing to 22.2%. 
During the quarter, hurricanes caused significant damage to communities in the Caribbean and Southern United States. We were fortunate and were not affected, but as residents of violent communities ourselves, our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who was impacted. 
Today, we're also excited to announce an agreement to acquire Deutsche Bank's Global Trust Solutions Business, which will add scale and talent to our existing operations and add a profitable and strategically important private trust platform in Singapore. This transaction represents our fourth such acquisition in 3 years and is consistent with our strategy to expand our capital efficient, fee-based trust business in select markets. It also validates Butterfield's reputation as a leader in international wealth management and trust services, with a proven ability to integrate businesses from global financial leaders like Deutsche Bank. 
In addition to the acquisition, we're pleased to have entered into a partnership with Deutsche Bank's Wealth Management team, whereby Butterfield will provide trust solutions to Deutsche Bank's clients on an ongoing basis. We believe that working closely with Deutsche Bank will provide us with additional opportunities to expand our businesses, especially in Asia. 
Taken together, we believe our strong financial results, combined with our success in growing our trust business, demonstrates that our strategy to create shareholder value is working. 
I'll now turn over the call to Michael Schrum."

Butterfield & Son Limited","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 6, we show a healthy third quarter increase in net interest income to $74.3 million and a corresponding 15 basis point increase in net interest margin to 2.81%.

On Slide 6, we show a healthy third quarter increase in net interest income to $74.3 million and a corresponding 15 basis point increase in net interest margin to 2.81%. This continued margin expansion was due to higher short-term rates that boosted the returns on our liquidity and investment portfolios as well as repricing that increased the yields on our loan book.
In aggregate, loan margins expanded by 5 basis points, as commercial loan yields increased by 19 basis points and consumer loan yields decreased by 1 basis point. The decline in consumer yields was due to lower-yielding U.K. residential mortgage originations, replacing higher-yielding amortization from the Bermuda and Cayman mortgage book. 
Slide 7 details the performance of our various fee businesses, which generated $38.2 million of capital-efficient noninterest income in the third quarter. 
Banking, trust and FX revenues were broadly flat, while we did see some growth in Asset Management. At 34%, Butterfield's fee income ratio is well above our peer average and helps produce industry-leading returns on equity. 
We expect the acquisition of Global Trust Solutions business from Deutsche Bank will add new trust revenue and will be accretive once integrated in the first half of 2018. We're also pleased to be acquiring a high-quality and profitable trust platform in Singapore that will accelerate our plans to expand in that region. 
As you may have guessed by now, we are limited in what financial information we can disclose, but we can confirm that the transaction is within previously disclosed parameters in terms of size expected return and earnings multiple. Upon completion of the transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, Butterfield will take over the ongoing management and administration of Global Trust Solutions business, comprising approximately 1,000 trust structures for some 900 private clients. 
Butterfield is also offering positions to all personnel who are fully dedicated to the Global Trust Solutions business based in the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Singapore, Switzerland and Mauritius, thereby ensuring continuity of service for clients. 
Slide 8 highlights the progress we continue to make in bringing expenses down to a more normal level. We remain on track to deliver our core cost-to-income ratio of approximately 60% over the coming quarters. 
As anticipated, third quarter marketing expenses decreased, as costs related to the America's Cup events in Bermuda ended. 
Expenses related to our Sarbanes Oxley program and investments in compliance systems continued as expected but are anticipated to level off by the end of 2017. Expenses related to the Halifax service center build-out will likely continue through the end of the year, and thereafter, we'll start to create operational efficiencies and additional capacity. 
Professional fees were also elevated this quarter as we deployed resources to assist with the acquisition. We have included some of these specific third party costs in noncore expenses, consistent with previous acquisitions. And we have also included a line-by-line reconciliation to our U.S. GAAP financials in the Appendix to the presentation. 
Slide 9 highlights capital levels, showing both Basel III regulatory capital and leverage capital. We recorded an increase in our Basel III capital ratio of 80 basis points to 19.9%, a level well above the Bermuda regulatory requirements. Our tangible common equity to total asset ratio also increased by 30 basis points to 7% and remains at the high end of our target range. Pro forma for the acquisition, which we expect to close in the first half of 2018, capital levels are expected to remain at the high end of our target range. 
For the third quarter of 2017, the board declared a dividend of $0.32 per common share, which reflects our ongoing balanced approach to capital management and commitment to providing shareholders with stable returns. We will be reviewing the dividend and other capital allocation strategies, consistent with last year, once we complete the 2018 planning cycle that is currently underway. 
I will now hand it over to Dan to discuss the balance sheet."

We are aware of the unique environment in which we operate and seek to maximize safety and stability by managing risk while maintaining sufficient capital in an efficient and liquid balance sheet. 
Slide 10 summarizes the bank's balance sheet at the end of the third quarter, which at $10.6 billion, was essentially flat from the second quarter of 2017. We continued to maintain a highly liquid position, with 62% of our total assets comprised of cash and equivalents, short-term investments and investment assets. Loan balances remained flat from the prior quarter, due primarily to commercial and residential loan amortizations, offset by continued growth in the new residential mortgages, particularly in our U.K. mortgage business. 
As we've discussed before, average deposit balances tend to fluctuate inter-quarter as our largest trust customers manage their commercial interests. 
A summary of our loan and investment portfolios on Slide 11 shows the composition and size of the loan portfolio remaining broadly flat at $3.6 billion and made up of essentially the same mix of assets. Nonperforming loans, which include gross nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more, totaled $61.8 million as of September 30, 2017, which is in line with last quarter's balance. The net charge-off ratio remained low at 2 basis points for the quarter. 
Our investment portfolio remains stable at $4.6 billion, as a lack of attractive pricing in the U.S. dollar term rate market deterred any significant rebalancing. We are cautiously optimistic that we will have opportunities to prudently deploy additional excess deposits into this market in the near term at better rates. 
At quarter-end, approximately 92% of the investment portfolio consisted of AAA-rated securities. 
Slide 12 summarizes the average balance sheet for the rest -- of the left side of our balance sheet and highlights the client-driven quarter-to-quarter changes we tend to see. Slide 12 also illustrates our interest rate sensitivity relative to our U.S. peers and shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates would generate an uptick in net interest income of 12.7% versus our peers at 6%.

That gets us ample liquidity with additional repo lines behind to ensure that we -- that we're always on the conservative side of that spectrum where we should be. So we're just under the $2 billion in ending this quarter on cash and short-term investments. So if you thought, somewhat, another 200, 300 maybe, depending on loan demand and commitments and cash flow, there is some opportunity there.

So obviously, what we talked about, we can't disclose the financial terms of the transaction. But what we can say, going back to the acquisition criteria that we've laid out in the past, it really meets all the buckets. So in terms of size, under $50 million purchase price. We talked about price of 8x EBITDA or less, so it meets that in terms of trailing EBITDA. The profile of the business has to be at least 2/3 private trust. So as we've talked about in the past, we're less interested or not interested, really, in fund administration and company secretarial work and that sort of stuff. It really is private trust we're after. This is obviously 100% private trust. And if you remember the locations have to be our existing jurisdictions, Switzerland, Guernsey, Bermuda, Cayman, where we have scale, and, as you pointed out, with the exception of Singapore. So Singapore, obviously, is a market we've wanted to get into for a long time, and it goes back historically to our trust business from a lot of the Hong Kong family. So having a presence there is really important. It's not possible, really, to talk about market share in terms of trust in Singapore, really, any jurisdictions. Its information that's private and confidential, it's really hard to get that sort of data. But I can tell you that Singapore is basically about -- the acquisition comes with about 90 people in those jurisdictions. Singapore is about 15% of that, and it would represent about 20% of the revenue of that business. And overall, roughly, it's about 20%, this acquisition is about 20%, 25% of the size of our existing Trust business. So I think that gives you a little bit of a sense of the scale. So having a platform in Singapore will allow us to grow, but it's tough to actually talk about what sort of market share we would have there."

No great. Thanks for the question, Will. It's Michael Schrum. As you correctly pointed out, the U.K. mortgage origination, they're accretive from a net interest income prospective, but they tend to, obviously, cause a downward pressure on the overall consumer margin, which, in this quarter, offset the margin expansion from the Bermuda book, which is an amortizing book. So as we continue to see growth opportunities in the U.K., that will tend to, in the absence of any rate -- further rate hikes, tend to have a flattish to slightly downward pressure on the overall consumer yields. 
In terms of the commercial, it's really -- this quarter, we had some significant margin expansion, really a product mix issue. So we had a higher utilization of commercial overdrafts at higher yields during the entire quarter, while term balances remained fairly stable. So it's really a product mix there on the commercial, which caused a significant uptick in the yields on that book. I think going forward, on the commercial side, it's a relatively small book, but I think we should expect that to sort of be flattish, again, absent any further funding cost increases."

So -- but the profitability would be relatively similar. We'll have some costs in the near term because we're setting up 2 new -- we're in 2 new locations.

We're pleased to announce another strong quarter at Butterfield, as rate increases led to margin improvements and expenses began to return to a more normal level. It was a little more than a year ago that we completed our initial public offering, and I'd like to thank our customers, employees and shareholders who have contributed to our success as a public company. Without your support, we could not have achieved the record results that are highlighted on Slide 4, with core net income increasing to $0.73 per share, net interest margin increasing to 2.81% and core return on equity increasing to 22.2%. 
During the quarter, hurricanes caused significant damage to communities in the Caribbean and Southern United States. We were fortunate and were not affected, but as residents of violent communities ourselves, our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who was impacted. 
Today, we're also excited to announce an agreement to acquire Deutsche Bank's Global Trust Solutions Business, which will add scale and talent to our existing operations and add a profitable and strategically important private trust platform in Singapore. This transaction represents our fourth such acquisition in 3 years and is consistent with our strategy to expand our capital efficient, fee-based trust business in select markets. It also validates Butterfield's reputation as a leader in international wealth management and trust services, with a proven ability to integrate businesses from global financial leaders like Deutsche Bank. 
In addition to the acquisition, we're pleased to have entered into a partnership with Deutsche Bank's Wealth Management team, whereby Butterfield will provide trust solutions to Deutsche Bank's clients on an ongoing basis. We believe that working closely with Deutsche Bank will provide us with additional opportunities to expand our businesses, especially in Asia. 
Taken together, we believe our strong financial results, combined with our success in growing our trust business, demonstrates that our strategy to create shareholder value is working.

On Slide 6, we show a healthy third quarter increase in net interest income to $74.3 million and a corresponding 15 basis point increase in net interest margin to 2.81%. This continued margin expansion was due to higher short-term rates that boosted the returns on our liquidity and investment portfolios as well as repricing that increased the yields on our loan book.
In aggregate, loan margins expanded by 5 basis points, as commercial loan yields increased by 19 basis points and consumer loan yields decreased by 1 basis point. The decline in consumer yields was due to lower-yielding U.K. residential mortgage originations, replacing higher-yielding amortization from the Bermuda and Cayman mortgage book. 
Slide 7 details the performance of our various fee businesses, which generated $38.2 million of capital-efficient noninterest income in the third quarter. 
Banking, trust and FX revenues were broadly flat, while we did see some growth in Asset Management. At 34%, Butterfield's fee income ratio is well above our peer average and helps produce industry-leading returns on equity. 
We expect the acquisition of Global Trust Solutions business from Deutsche Bank will add new trust revenue and will be accretive once integrated in the first half of 2018. We're also pleased to be acquiring a high-quality and profitable trust platform in Singapore that will accelerate our plans to expand in that region. 
As you may have guessed by now, we are limited in what financial information we can disclose, but we can confirm that the transaction is within previously disclosed parameters in terms of size expected return and earnings multiple. Upon completion of the transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, Butterfield will take over the ongoing management and administration of Global Trust Solutions business, comprising approximately 1,000 trust structures for some 900 private clients. 
Butterfield is also offering positions to all personnel who are fully dedicated to the Global Trust Solutions business based in the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Singapore, Switzerland and Mauritius, thereby ensuring continuity of service for clients. 
Slide 8 highlights the progress we continue to make in bringing expenses down to a more normal level. We remain on track to deliver our core cost-to-income ratio of approximately 60% over the coming quarters. 
As anticipated, third quarter marketing expenses decreased, as costs related to the America's Cup events in Bermuda ended. 
Expenses related to our Sarbanes Oxley program and investments in compliance systems continued as expected but are anticipated to level off by the end of 2017. Expenses related to the Halifax service center build-out will likely continue through the end of the year, and thereafter, we'll start to create operational efficiencies and additional capacity. 
Professional fees were also elevated this quarter as we deployed resources to assist with the acquisition. We have included some of these specific third party costs in noncore expenses, consistent with previous acquisitions. And we have also included a line-by-line reconciliation to our U.S. GAAP financials in the Appendix to the presentation. 
Slide 9 highlights capital levels, showing both Basel III regulatory capital and leverage capital. We recorded an increase in our Basel III capital ratio of 80 basis points to 19.9%, a level well above the Bermuda regulatory requirements. Our tangible common equity to total asset ratio also increased by 30 basis points to 7% and remains at the high end of our target range. Pro forma for the acquisition, which we expect to close in the first half of 2018, capital levels are expected to remain at the high end of our target range. 
For the third quarter of 2017, the board declared a dividend of $0.32 per common share, which reflects our ongoing balanced approach to capital management and commitment to providing shareholders with stable returns. We will be reviewing the dividend and other capital allocation strategies, consistent with last year, once we complete the 2018 planning cycle that is currently underway. 
I will now hand it over to Dan to discuss the balance sheet."

We are aware of the unique environment in which we operate and seek to maximize safety and stability by managing risk while maintaining sufficient capital in an efficient and liquid balance sheet. 
Slide 10 summarizes the bank's balance sheet at the end of the third quarter, which at $10.6 billion, was essentially flat from the second quarter of 2017. We continued to maintain a highly liquid position, with 62% of our total assets comprised of cash and equivalents, short-term investments and investment assets. Loan balances remained flat from the prior quarter, due primarily to commercial and residential loan amortizations, offset by continued growth in the new residential mortgages, particularly in our U.K. mortgage business. 
As we've discussed before, average deposit balances tend to fluctuate inter-quarter as our largest trust customers manage their commercial interests. 
A summary of our loan and investment portfolios on Slide 11 shows the composition and size of the loan portfolio remaining broadly flat at $3.6 billion and made up of essentially the same mix of assets. Nonperforming loans, which include gross nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more, totaled $61.8 million as of September 30, 2017, which is in line with last quarter's balance. The net charge-off ratio remained low at 2 basis points for the quarter. 
Our investment portfolio remains stable at $4.6 billion, as a lack of attractive pricing in the U.S. dollar term rate market deterred any significant rebalancing. We are cautiously optimistic that we will have opportunities to prudently deploy additional excess deposits into this market in the near term at better rates. 
At quarter-end, approximately 92% of the investment portfolio consisted of AAA-rated securities. 
Slide 12 summarizes the average balance sheet for the rest -- of the left side of our balance sheet and highlights the client-driven quarter-to-quarter changes we tend to see. Slide 12 also illustrates our interest rate sensitivity relative to our U.S. peers and shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates would generate an uptick in net interest income of 12.7% versus our peers at 6%. 
I will now turn the call back over to Michael Collins for closing remarks."

Our acquisition of Deutsche Bank's Global Trust Solutions business demonstrates our ability to transact with industry leaders and is expected to create additional opportunities for us as we continue to add scale to our international trust business.

So obviously, what we talked about, we can't disclose the financial terms of the transaction. But what we can say, going back to the acquisition criteria that we've laid out in the past, it really meets all the buckets. So in terms of size, under $50 million purchase price. We talked about price of 8x EBITDA or less, so it meets that in terms of trailing EBITDA. The profile of the business has to be at least 2/3 private trust. So as we've talked about in the past, we're less interested or not interested, really, in fund administration and company secretarial work and that sort of stuff. It really is private trust we're after. This is obviously 100% private trust. And if you remember the locations have to be our existing jurisdictions, Switzerland, Guernsey, Bermuda, Cayman, where we have scale, and, as you pointed out, with the exception of Singapore. So Singapore, obviously, is a market we've wanted to get into for a long time, and it goes back historically to our trust business from a lot of the Hong Kong family. So having a presence there is really important. It's not possible, really, to talk about market share in terms of trust in Singapore, really, any jurisdictions. Its information that's private and confidential, it's really hard to get that sort of data. But I can tell you that Singapore is basically about -- the acquisition comes with about 90 people in those jurisdictions. Singapore is about 15% of that, and it would represent about 20% of the revenue of that business. And overall, roughly, it's about 20%, this acquisition is about 20%, 25% of the size of our existing Trust business. So I think that gives you a little bit of a sense of the scale. So having a platform in Singapore will allow us to grow, but it's tough to actually talk about what sort of market share we would have there."

No great. Thanks for the question, Will. It's Michael Schrum. As you correctly pointed out, the U.K. mortgage origination, they're accretive from a net interest income prospective, but they tend to, obviously, cause a downward pressure on the overall consumer margin, which, in this quarter, offset the margin expansion from the Bermuda book, which is an amortizing book. So as we continue to see growth opportunities in the U.K., that will tend to, in the absence of any rate -- further rate hikes, tend to have a flattish to slightly downward pressure on the overall consumer yields. 
In terms of the commercial, it's really -- this quarter, we had some significant margin expansion, really a product mix issue. So we had a higher utilization of commercial overdrafts at higher yields during the entire quarter, while term balances remained fairly stable. So it's really a product mix there on the commercial, which caused a significant uptick in the yields on that book. I think going forward, on the commercial side, it's a relatively small book, but I think we should expect that to sort of be flattish, again, absent any further funding cost increases."

We talked about if banking has efficiency ratios in the low 50s, trust would be sort of around 70%",223,"Thanks. It's Michael Collins. It's similar. I mean, I think that these sorts of businesses that we know very well, they're not necessarily scale businesses. We talked about if banking has efficiency ratios in the low 50s, trust would be sort of around 70%. So it somewhere in that sense. It is -- I think, we can say it's accretive, so that's important. But it's a very similar business, and I think we're excited. And I think we've talked about a little bit in the past that our focus is going from founder-owned trust company acquisitions, potentially, to more bank-owned trust company acquisitions, simply because we're probably a little bit more comfortable in terms of their having done their work to scrub the book and make sure what we're acquiring is as clean as it can possibly be. So -- but the profitability would be relatively similar. We'll have some costs in the near term because we're setting up 2 new -- we're in 2 new locations. So obviously, we haven't been in Singapore, we haven't been in Mauritius, so we can't combine those with the existing operations, Switzerland and Guernsey and Cayman, that makes that so much easier because we've got existing staff and systems in everything. So there'll be a little bit more cost in the near term, but nothing substantial."

So once it completes, and obviously, that's the hard work that's going on now, that will come through in the near term and, obviously, that tapers off and becomes a BAU.
