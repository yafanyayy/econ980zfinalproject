Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2016 was an exceptional year for Regency on all fronts. As I've said many times, Regency year end and year out performance are a direct results of 4 priority true principles. First, irreplaceable portfolio of high quality assets, driving superior [indiscernible] growth. 2016 [indiscernible] was a strong 3.5% representing the fifth consecutive year of growth after above this level. 
Second, development and redevelopment reinvestment strategy executed by an experienced and disciplined team who is in great centers to be meaningful to our NAV per share. In 2016, we profitability executed on our strategy starting $220 million of high-quality developments and redevelopments at anda attractive returns. 
Third, a [indiscernible] balance sheet that supports our growth allowing us uninterrupted access to capital at the most advantageous [indiscernible]. Throughout 2016 and in January of this year, we strengthened our balance sheet even further for the use of capital markets resulting in one of the most pristine balance sheets in business. 
Finally, Regency's talented, dedicated and deep team, best in the business. As always, I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication. The results of their exemplary efforts have led to average growth in Core FFO both the last 3 years of almost 8% frequent and total shareholder return over that same period, [indiscernible] profitable [indiscernible] peer group.
Before I turn the call over to Mac and Lisa, let me remind you why we are so excited about with pending [indiscernible] with Equity One. The transaction combines 2 high-quality highly complementary platforms and firmly establishes our position as the imminent national shopping center company. We're [indiscernible] unique advantages. [indiscernible] unparalleled portfolio with excellent mix of first class neighborhood and community centers both [indiscernible] focus. What's important as the manager deepens our concentration in affluent and infiltrated areas, with strong demographics, in fact leading retailers. Combined these factors will produce better merchandising and higher rental [indiscernible] rates, driving stronger organic growth. Also the 2 portfolios have significant overlap in many of the countries [indiscernible] attractive metro areas.

In addition, considerable value from an unmatched pipeline development and redevelopment opportunities will be unlocked by our [indiscernible] 
The merger preserves our balance sheet's strength and flexibility, maintaining our asses to fund multiple sources of capital at the lowest cost. The results of these compelling attributes will be a more diversified cash flow stream, with better NOI, better earnings and better Canadian growth potential.

For the year, we started 16 [ph] new projects, representing a total investment of more than $200 million, [indiscernible] 7.6 return. Despite significant competition for these projects, we continue to source and execute on our [indiscernible] opportunities in targeted markets that enhance our high-quality portfolio. 
I'll quickly highlight a couple of our recent developments. In December, we started shipping [indiscernible], a 280,000 square-foot center located within [indiscernible] New York, including Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack and Saks OFF 5TH. This location will create a true regional draw bringing [indiscernible] best in class [indiscernible] and shopping centers.

At year end 2016, [indiscernible] developments and redevelopments represent to total investments nearly $300 [ph] million, nearly [indiscernible] return of nearly 8%. Our ability to continue to execute on these great projects is a testament to our industry-leading international development platform, driven by [indiscernible] relationship, local market expertise and an attractive cost of capital. This is why we are able to consistently [indiscernible] investment opportunities. 
As we look forward to 2017, we are enthusiastic about the pipeline. To that end, we have great visibility to a couple of first half 2017 start. First, the [indiscernible] DC market and the second, a new Whole Foods opportunity both outside of Chicago. In addition, we have other processing opportunities in target markets like Seattle, Miami and Toronto. Likewise, we're particularly excited about the [indiscernible] we shared with you on our Equity One stream development pipeline to come.

Good morning, all. Our high-quality portfolio continues to grow extremely well. At year-end, our same-property percent leased was at 96%, including 93% for [indiscernible] This is especially impressive given the team's accomplishment in the face of a handful of retailer bankruptcies. The benefit of such a strong portfolio running historically high occupancy continued to translate into better merchandising and pricing power. Leasing spreads for the quarter were in the midteens including rent growth of more than 20% for [indiscernible]. This strength in core fundamentals led the same-property NOI growth for the year of 3.5% including nearly 4% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by growth in base rents. But as a reminder, for 2017, we do anticipate moderating same-property NOI growth impacted by last year's bankruptcy-related store closings. While we are largely backfill these anchor boxes, the new tenants won't be up and running until the second half of this year. 
Turning to the capital markets, maintaining a [indiscernible] balance sheet continues to be a foundational principle for Regency. And as we enter 2017, we have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. Subsequent to year-end, we issued our first ever 30-year bond, with proceeds of $300 million at 4.4% coupon. These proceeds will be used to fund the full redemption of our 6 5/8 % preferred stock. This issuance and redemption significantly improves free cash flow and fixed charge coverage.
At the same time, we also issued $350 million of 10-year bonds and 3.6% coupon. These proceeds will be used for certain transaction costs related to the pending merger, including the refinancing of some of the in-place Equity One short-term debt. 
Importantly, in the unlikely event that the merger does not close, these bonds include a mandatory redemption option. As a result of the 30-year bond offering and the status from the redemption of the preferred stock, we increased Core FFO guidance by $0.02. At the same time, you'll also note that we reduced NAREIT FFO guidance by $0.07, which is incorporating the one-time costs related to the preferred redemption.
More importantly, please note that we've not included any impact of the 10-year offering of the updated ranges as any merger-related impacts are currently excluded from all guidance metrics. We intend to update guidance to reflect the impact of the merger in the coming months. 
For acquisitions guidance, you will note that it has not changed from previous disclosure. But I did want to clarify that we do have a shopping center under contract in the Northeast, which we hope to close the coming months. And as a reminder, the majority of the remainder $90 million in proceeds from our March 2016 forward equity offering will be used to fund this acquisition. 
Before I hand to Hap and Mac, 2016 was a great year on many fronts and we look forward to a tremendous 2017, as we are extremely excited about the profits of not only closing the merger but especially integrating and operating the combined company.
That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2016 was an exceptional year for Regency on all fronts. As I've said many times, Regency's year in and year out performance is the direct result of 4 tried and true principles. First, irreplaceable portfolio of high quality assets, driving superior NOI growth. 2016 NOI was a strong 3.5%, representing the fifth consecutive year of growth at or above this level. 
Second, development and redevelopment driven investment strategy executed by an experienced and disciplined team who believes in great centers to add meaningfully to our NAV per share. In 2016, we profitability executed on our strategy, starting $220 million of high-quality developments and redevelopments at and attractive returns. 
Third, a fortress balance sheet that supports our growth, allowing us uninterrupted access to capital at the most advantageous pricing. Throughout 2016 and in January of this year, we strengthened our balance sheet even further for urgent use of capital markets resulting in one of the most pristine balance sheets in business. 
Finally, Regency's talented, dedicated and deep team, best in the business. As always, I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication. The results of their exemplary efforts have led to average growth in Core FFO over the last 3 years of almost 8% and total shareholder return over that same period at the top of our peer group. 
Before I turn the call over to Mac and Lisa, let me remind you why we are so excited about our pending merger with Equity One. The transaction combines 2 high-quality highly complementary platforms and firmly establishes our position as the preeminent national shopping center company, with several unique advantages. We will own an unparalleled portfolio with an excellent mix of first-class neighborhood and community centers, grocery-anchored focus. As important this merger deepens our concentrations in affluent and in-fill trade areas, with strong demographics that attract leading retailers. Combined, these factors will produce better merchandising and higher rental and occupancy rates, driving stronger organic growth. Also the 2 portfolios have significant overlap in many of the country's most attractive metro areas, providing us with enhanced brand presence, economies of scale, contributing to these transaction's substantial synergies. In addition, considerable value from an unmatched pipeline, development and redevelopment opportunities will be unlocked by our [indiscernible]. 
The merger preserves our balance sheet's strength and flexibility, maintaining our access to multiple sources of capital at the lowest cost. The results of these compelling attributes will be a more diversified cash flow stream, with better NOI, better earnings and better NAV growth potential. I cannot overstate our excitement and enthusiasm and look forward to closing the merger and creating substantial value for many years to come. 
I will now turn the call over the Mac Chandler."

Through the year, we started 16 new projects, representing a total investment of more than $200 million, at a [indiscernible] 7.6% return. Despite significant competition for the best projects, we continue to source and execute on our compelling opportunities in targeted markets that enhance our high-quality portfolio. 
I'll quickly highlight a couple of our recent developments. In December, we started Chimney Rock Crossing, a 218,000 square-foot center located within an affluent New York City suburb, anchored Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack and Saks OFF 5TH. This location will create a true regional draw bringing [indiscernible] best in class [indiscernible] centers. We took ownership of the property with complex entitlements in place and anchor leases substantially negotiated, which greatly mitigated risk. The Village at Riverstone, located within Houston's fastest growing master-planned community, also started in December. It will be a dominant[ph] Kroger anchor stand [ph], aligned with professional regional restaurants and restaurant providers, already more than 80% leased and committed before it starts construction. This project will be an outstanding addition to our premier Houston presence. These terrific new additions took more than $100 million [indiscernible]. At year end 2016, in-process developments and redevelopments represented a total investment of nearly $300 million, yielding a final return of nearly 8%. Our ability to continue to execute on these great projects is a testament to our industry-leading national development platform, driven by a dream relationships, local market expertise and attractive cost of capital. This is why we are able to consistently source [indiscernible] compelling investment opportunities. 
As we look forward to 2017, we are enthusiastic about our pipeline. To that end, we have great visibility to a couple of first half 2017 starts. First, the Wegmans-anchored center in the DC market and the second, a new Whole Foods opportunity located outside of Chicago. In addition, we have other promising opportunities progressing nicely in target markets like Seattle, Miami and Raleigh. Likewise, we're particularly excited about the prospect of sharing with you our vision of Equity One's redevelopment pipeline to come.
I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa."

At year-end, our same-property percent leased was at 96%, including 93% for shop space. This is especially impressive given that the team has accomplished this in the face of a handful of retailer bankruptcies. The benefit of such a strong portfolio running at historically high occupancy continued to translate into better merchandising and pricing power. Leasing spreads for the quarter were in the midteens, including rent growth of more than 20% for new deals. This strength in core fundamentals led to same-property NOI growth for the year of 3.5% including nearly 4% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by growth in base rents. But as a reminder, for 2017, we do anticipate moderating same-property NOI growth impacted by last year's bankruptcy-related store closings. While we are largely backfill these anchor boxes, the new tenants won't be up and running until the second half of this year. 
Turning to the capital markets, maintaining a fortress balance sheet continues to be a foundational principle for Regency. And as we enter 2017, we have the strongest balance sheet in the company history. Subsequent to year-end, we issued our first ever 30-year bond, with proceeds of $300 million at a 4.4% coupon. These proceeds will be used to fund the full redemption of our 6 5/8% preferred stock. This issuance and the redemption significantly improves free cash flow and fixed charge coverage.
At the same time, we also issued $350 million of 10-year bonds at a 3.6% coupon. These proceeds will be used for certain transaction costs related to the pending merger, including the refinancing of some of the in-place Equity One short-term debt. 
Importantly, in the unlikely event that the merger does not close, these bonds include a mandatory redemption option. As a result of the 30-year bond offering and the savings from the redemption of the preferred stock, we increased core FFO guidance by $0.02. At the same time, you'll also note that we reduced NAREIT FFO guidance by $0.07, which is incorporating the one-time cost related to the preferred redemption.
More importantly, please note that we've not included any impact of the 10-year offering in the updated ranges, as any merger-related impacts are currently excluded from all guidance metrics. We intend to update guidance to reflect the impact of the merger in the coming months. 
For acquisitions guidance, you will note that it has not changed from previous disclosure. But I did want to clarify that we do have a shopping center under contract in the Northeast, which we hope to close in the coming months. And as a reminder, the majority of the remaining $90 million in proceeds from our March 2016 forward equity offering will be used to fund this acquisition. 
To echo both Hap and Mac, 2016 was a great year on many fronts and we look forward to a tremendous 2017, as we are extremely excited about the prospects of not only closing the merger but especially integrating and operating the combined company.
That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions."

Really it's a risk adjusted return, that's really the big picture way of looking at it. The family that has owned the site for a decade or so spent a long time getting a very complex array of entitlements, including some very expensive off-sites in which were not only entitled but actually delivered to the site. So they also brought along with the opportunity, really all 4 anchor leases which were substantially negotiated in final lease form, 1 of them was actually signed. So from risk-adjusted basis, we were comfortable stepping into that project. The site was also 30% graded and has some very complex grading that went along with that and risky. And because they had taken on the first start of it, they have mitigated the risk out of the project and determined how much bad soil was there, which they moved and remediated. So when we stepped into it, it was not completely a layout but very much different than a typical development. And we felt that return was appropriate. Still a good 150 to probably 200 basis points of spread between that and where we can sell it today. It's got good growth, they did a good job negotiating the [indiscernible] releases so they have good growth, and good visibly towards the shops we're seeing. We're getting really good quality tenants with good growth. And we love the location a lot too. This is a high, high barrier-to-entry location, very affluent and this will be sort of a one-of-a-kind center.

Please refer to the documents filed by Regency Centers Corporation with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
In addition, on today's call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. In accordance with SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their respective and most directly comparable GAAP measures, which may be found in the tables included in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] Finally, please understand that given our pending merger with Equity One, we will be unable to answer any questions related to that transaction and refer you to our filings for the latest information. 
I will now turn the call over to Hap."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2016 was an exceptional year for Regency on all fronts. As I've said many times, Regency's year in and year out performance is the direct result of 4 tried and true principles. First, an irreplaceable portfolio of high quality assets, driving superior NOI growth. In 2016 NOI growth was a strong 3.5%, representing the fifth consecutive year of growth at or above this level. 
Second, a development and redevelopment driven investment strategy executed by an experienced and disciplined team producing great centers that add meaningfully to our NAV per share. In 2016, we profitability executed on our strategy, starting $220 million of high-quality developments and redevelopments at attractive returns. 
Third, a fortress balance sheet that supports our growth, allowing us uninterrupted access to capital at the most advantageous pricing. Throughout 2016 and in January of this year, we strengthened our balance sheet even further through the prudent use of the capital markets resulting in one of the most pristine balance sheets in the business. 
Finally, Regency's talented, dedicated and deep team, the best in the business. As always, I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication. The results of their exemplary efforts have led to average growth in Core FFO over the last 3 years of almost 8% and total shareholder return over that same period at the top of our peer group. 
Before I turn the call over to Mac and Lisa, let me remind you why we are so excited about our pending merger with Equity One. The transaction combines 2 high-quality, highly complementary platforms and firmly establishes our position as the preeminent national shopping center company with several unique advantages. We will own an unparalleled portfolio with an excellent mix of first-class neighborhood and community centers with a grocery-anchored focus. As important, this merger deepens our concentrations in affluent and infill trade areas with strong demographics to attract leading retailers. Combined, these factors will produce better merchandising and higher rental and occupancy rates, driving stronger organic growth. Also the 2 portfolios have significant overlap in many of the country's most attractive metro areas, providing us with enhanced brand presence and economies of scale, contributing to the transaction's substantial synergies. In addition, considerable value from an unmatched pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities will be unlocked by our experienced team. 
The merger preserves our balance sheet's strength and flexibility, maintaining our access to multiple sources of capital at the lowest cost. The result of these compelling attributes will be a more diversified cash flow stream, with better NOI, better earnings and better NAV growth potential. I cannot overstate our excitement and enthusiasm and we look forward to closing the merger and creating substantial value for many years to come. 
I will now turn the call over the Mac Chandler."

Despite significant competition",380,"Thanks, Hap, and good morning. 2016 was an impressive year for development and redevelopment. During the year, we started 16 new projects, representing a total investment of more than $200 million, at a blended 7.6% return. Despite significant competition for the best projects, we continue to source and execute on compelling opportunities in target markets that enhance our high-quality portfolio. 
I'll quickly highlight a couple of our recent developments. In December, we started Chimney Rock Crossing, a 218,000 square-foot center located within an affluent New York City suburb, anchored by Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack and Saks OFF 5TH. This location will create a true regional draw creating a dominant center with best in class anchors and shop tenants. We took ownership of the property with complex entitlements in place and anchor leases substantially negotiated, which greatly mitigated its risk. The Village at Riverstone, located within Houston's fastest growing master-planned community, also started in December. It will be a dominant Kroger-anchored center, aligned with leading national and regional restaurants and restaurant providers, already more than 80% leased and committed before even starting construction. This project will be an outstanding addition to our premier Houston presence. These terrific new additions total more than $100 million of net new investment. At year-end 2016, our in-process developments and redevelopments represented a total investment of nearly $300 million, yielding a blended return of nearly 8%. Our ability to continue to execute on these great projects is a testament to our industry-leading national development platform, which is driven by our enduring relationships, local market expertise and attractive cost of capital. This is why we are able to consistently source and deliver on the most compelling investment opportunities. 
As we look forward to 2017, I'm enthusiastic about our pipeline. To that end, we have great visibility into a couple of first half 2017 starts. The first, a Wegmans-anchored center in the DC market and the second, a Whole Foods opportunity located outside of Chicago. In addition, we have other promising opportunities that are progressing nicely in target markets like Seattle, Miami and Raleigh. Likewise, I'm particularly excited about the prospect of sharing with you our vision of Equity One's redevelopment pipeline in the months to come.
I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa."

Our high-quality portfolio continues to perform extremely well. At year-end, our same-property percent leased was at 96%, including 93% for shop spaces. This is especially impressive given the team has accomplished this",520,"Thank you, Mac. Good morning, all. Our high-quality portfolio continues to perform extremely well. At year-end, our same-property percent leased was at 96%, including 93% for shop spaces. This is especially impressive given the team has accomplished this in the face of a handful of retailer bankruptcies. The benefit of such a strong portfolio running at historically high occupancy continues to translate into better merchandising and pricing power. Leasing spreads for the quarter were in the mid-teens, including rent growth of more than 20% for new deals. This strength in core fundamentals led to same-property NOI growth for the year of 3.5% including nearly 4% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by growth in base rents. But as a reminder, for 2017, we do anticipate moderating same-property NOI growth impacted by last year's bankruptcy-related store closings. While we've largely backfilled these anchor boxes, the new tenants won't be up and running until the second half of this year. 
Turning to the capital markets, maintaining a fortress balance sheet continues to be a foundational principle for Regency. And as we enter 2017, we have the strongest balance sheet in the company history. Subsequent to year-end, we issued our first ever 30-year bond, with proceeds of $300 million at a 4.4% coupon. These proceeds will be used to fund the full redemption of our 6 5/8% preferred stock. This issuance and the redemption significantly improves free cash flow and fixed charge coverage.
At the same time, we also issued $350 million of 10-year bonds at a 3.6% coupon. These proceeds will be used for certain transaction costs related to the pending merger, including the refinancing of some of the in-place Equity One short-term debt. 
Importantly, in the unlikely event that the merger does not close, these bonds include a mandatory redemption option. As a result of the 30-year bond offering and the savings from the redemption of the preferred stock, we increased core FFO guidance by $0.02. At the same time, you'll also note that we reduced NAREIT FFO guidance by $0.07, which is incorporating the one-time costs related to the preferred redemption.
More importantly, please note that we have not included any impact of the 10-year offering in the updated ranges, as any merger-related impacts are currently excluded from all guidance metrics. We intend to update guidance to reflect the impact of the merger in the coming months. 
For acquisitions guidance, you will note that it has not changed from previous disclosure. But I did want to clarify that we do have a shopping center under contract in the Northeast, which we hope to close in the coming months. And as a reminder, the majority of the remaining $90 million in proceeds from our March 2016 forward equity offering will be used to fund this acquisition. 
To echo both Hap and Mac, 2016 was a great year on many fronts and we look forward to a tremendous 2017, as we are extremely excited about the prospects of not only closing the merger but especially integrating and operating the combined company.
That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions."

Really it's a risk adjusted return, that's really the big picture way of looking at it. The family that has owned the site for a decade or so spent a long time getting a very complex array of entitlements, including some very expensive off-sites, which were not only entitled but actually delivered to the site. So they also brought along with the opportunity, really, all 4 anchor leases, which were substantially negotiated in final lease form, 1 of them was actually signed. So from a risk-adjusted basis, we were comfortable stepping into that project. The site was also 30% graded and had some very complex grading that went along with that, and risky. And because they had taken on the first 1/3 of it, they had mitigated the risk out of the project and determined how much bad soil was there, which they moved and remediated. So when we stepped into it, it was not completely a layup [ph] but very much different than a typical development. And we felt that return was appropriate. Still a good 150 to probably 200 basis points of spread between that and where we can sell it today. It's got good growth, they did a good job negotiating the 4 anchor leases so they have good growth, and good visibly towards the shops leasing. And we're getting really good quality tenants with good growth. And we love the location a lot, too. This is a high, high barrier-to-entry location, very affluent and this will be sort of a one-of-a-kind center. It's the closest Whole Foods within a thirty-minute drive time, and we feel really good about the ability to attract a lot of very affluent customers, that's very good."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2016 was an exceptional year for Regency on all fronts. As I've said many times, Regency's year in and year out performance is the direct result of 4 tried and true principles. First, an irreplaceable portfolio of high quality assets, driving superior NOI growth. In 2016 NOI growth was a strong 3.5%, representing the fifth consecutive year of growth at or above this level. 
Second, a development and redevelopment driven investment strategy executed by an experienced and disciplined team producing great centers that add meaningfully to our NAV per share. In 2016, we profitability executed on our strategy, starting $220 million of high-quality developments and redevelopments at attractive returns. 
Third, a fortress balance sheet that supports our growth, allowing us uninterrupted access to capital at the most advantageous pricing. Throughout 2016 and in January of this year, we strengthened our balance sheet even further through the prudent use of the capital markets resulting in one of the most pristine balance sheets in the business. 
Finally, Regency's talented, dedicated and deep team, the best in the business. As always, I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication. The results of their exemplary efforts have led to average growth in Core FFO over the last 3 years of almost 8% and total shareholder return over that same period at the top of our peer group. 
Before I turn the call over to Mac and Lisa, let me remind you why we are so excited about our pending merger with Equity One. The transaction combines 2 high-quality, highly complementary platforms and firmly establishes our position as the preeminent national shopping center company with several unique advantages. We will own an unparalleled portfolio with an excellent mix of first-class neighborhood and community centers with a grocery-anchored focus. As important, this merger deepens our concentrations in affluent and infill trade areas with strong demographics to attract leading retailers. Combined, these factors will produce better merchandising and higher rental and occupancy rates, driving stronger organic growth. Also the 2 portfolios have significant overlap in many of the country's most attractive metro areas, providing us with enhanced brand presence and economies of scale, contributing to the transaction's substantial synergies. In addition, considerable value from an unmatched pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities will be unlocked by our experienced team. 
The merger preserves our balance sheet's strength and flexibility, maintaining our access to multiple sources of capital at the lowest cost. The result of these compelling attributes will be a more diversified cash flow stream, with better NOI, better earnings and better NAV growth potential. I cannot overstate our excitement and enthusiasm and we look forward to closing the merger and creating substantial value for many years to come. 
I will now turn the call over the Mac Chandler."

Despite significant competition",380,"Thanks, Hap, and good morning. 2016 was an impressive year for development and redevelopment. During the year, we started 16 new projects, representing a total investment of more than $200 million, at a blended 7.6% return. Despite significant competition for the best projects, we continue to source and execute on compelling opportunities in target markets that enhance our high-quality portfolio. 
I'll quickly highlight a couple of our recent developments. In December, we started Chimney Rock Crossing, a 218,000 square-foot center located within an affluent New York City suburb, anchored by Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack and Saks OFF 5TH. This location will create a true regional draw creating a dominant center with best in class anchors and shop tenants. We took ownership of the property with complex entitlements in place and anchor leases substantially negotiated, which greatly mitigated its risk. The Village at Riverstone, located within Houston's fastest growing master-planned community, also started in December. It will be a dominant Kroger-anchored center, aligned with leading national and regional restaurants and restaurant providers, already more than 80% leased and committed before even starting construction. This project will be an outstanding addition to our premier Houston presence. These terrific new additions total more than $100 million of net new investment. At year-end 2016, our in-process developments and redevelopments represented a total investment of nearly $300 million, yielding a blended return of nearly 8%. Our ability to continue to execute on these great projects is a testament to our industry-leading national development platform, which is driven by our enduring relationships, local market expertise and attractive cost of capital. This is why we are able to consistently source and deliver on the most compelling investment opportunities. 
As we look forward to 2017, I'm enthusiastic about our pipeline. To that end, we have great visibility into a couple of first half 2017 starts. The first, a Wegmans-anchored center in the DC market and the second, a Whole Foods opportunity located outside of Chicago. In addition, we have other promising opportunities that are progressing nicely in target markets like Seattle, Miami and Raleigh. Likewise, I'm particularly excited about the prospect of sharing with you our vision of Equity One's redevelopment pipeline in the months to come.
I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa."

Our high-quality portfolio continues to perform extremely well. At year-end, our same-property percent leased was at 96%, including 93% for shop spaces. This is especially impressive given the team has accomplished this",520,"Thank you, Mac. Good morning, all. Our high-quality portfolio continues to perform extremely well. At year-end, our same-property percent leased was at 96%, including 93% for shop spaces. This is especially impressive given the team has accomplished this in the face of a handful of retailer bankruptcies. The benefit of such a strong portfolio running at historically high occupancy continues to translate into better merchandising and pricing power. Leasing spreads for the quarter were in the mid-teens, including rent growth of more than 20% for new deals. This strength in core fundamentals led to same-property NOI growth for the year of 3.5% including nearly 4% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by growth in base rents. But as a reminder, for 2017, we do anticipate moderating same-property NOI growth impacted by last year's bankruptcy-related store closings. While we've largely backfilled these anchor boxes, the new tenants won't be up and running until the second half of this year. 
Turning to the capital markets, maintaining a fortress balance sheet continues to be a foundational principle for Regency. And as we enter 2017, we have the strongest balance sheet in the company history. Subsequent to year-end, we issued our first ever 30-year bond, with proceeds of $300 million at a 4.4% coupon. These proceeds will be used to fund the full redemption of our 6 5/8% preferred stock. This issuance and the redemption significantly improves free cash flow and fixed charge coverage.
At the same time, we also issued $350 million of 10-year bonds at a 3.6% coupon. These proceeds will be used for certain transaction costs related to the pending merger, including the refinancing of some of the in-place Equity One short-term debt. 
Importantly, in the unlikely event that the merger does not close, these bonds include a mandatory redemption option. As a result of the 30-year bond offering and the savings from the redemption of the preferred stock, we increased core FFO guidance by $0.02. At the same time, you'll also note that we reduced NAREIT FFO guidance by $0.07, which is incorporating the one-time costs related to the preferred redemption.
More importantly, please note that we have not included any impact of the 10-year offering in the updated ranges, as any merger-related impacts are currently excluded from all guidance metrics. We intend to update guidance to reflect the impact of the merger in the coming months. 
For acquisitions guidance, you will note that it has not changed from previous disclosure. But I did want to clarify that we do have a shopping center under contract in the Northeast, which we hope to close in the coming months. And as a reminder, the majority of the remaining $90 million in proceeds from our March 2016 forward equity offering will be used to fund this acquisition. 
To echo both Hap and Mac, 2016 was a great year on many fronts and we look forward to a tremendous 2017, as we are extremely excited about the prospects of not only closing the merger but especially integrating and operating the combined company.
That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions."

Really it's a risk adjusted return, that's really the big picture way of looking at it. The family that has owned the site for a decade or so spent a long time getting a very complex array of entitlements, including some very expensive off-sites, which were not only entitled but actually delivered to the site. So they also brought along with the opportunity, really, all 4 anchor leases, which were substantially negotiated in final lease form, 1 of them was actually signed. So from a risk-adjusted basis, we were comfortable stepping into that project. The site was also 30% graded and had some very complex grading that went along with that, and risky. And because they had taken on the first 1/3 of it, they had mitigated the risk out of the project and determined how much bad soil was there, which they moved and remediated. So when we stepped into it, it was not completely a layup [ph] but very much different than a typical development. And we felt that return was appropriate. Still a good 150 to probably 200 basis points of spread between that and where we can sell it today. It's got good growth, they did a good job negotiating the 4 anchor leases so they have good growth, and good visibly towards the shops leasing. And we're getting really good quality tenants with good growth. And we love the location a lot, too. This is a high, high barrier-to-entry location, very affluent and this will be sort of a one-of-a-kind center. It's the closest Whole Foods within a thirty-minute drive time, and we feel really good about the ability to attract a lot of very affluent customers, that's very good."

The combined portfolio is demonstrating its exceptional quality with another quarter of being 96% leased and producing over 3.5% same property NOI growth. Our developments and redevelopments continue to perform well. Substantial synergies are already being realized. These collective achievements are reflected in our increased earnings guidance.
I cannot overstate our team's excitement and enthusiasm with the merger and further enhancement to our core strategic colors. One, we own an unequal portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. Two, we have an industry leading development platform. Three, our business activity is supported by a fortress balance sheet. And four, we benefit from a special culture in a deep team of talented professionals. This compelling combination will grow cash flow and earnings, which in turn grow NAV, dividends and shareholder returns.
Now I would like to provide some perspective to the current challenging environment for many retailers and the negative headlines that had become part of our daily reading. Although we will certainly not be immune, there are compelling reasons why I feel that the sky is not falling and why I remain optimistic that well conceived, well located and well merchandised retail estate will succeed in this environment and Regency's outlook remains extremely bright.
During the 4 years I've been in the business, competition, retail bankruptcies and store closures have been integral parts of the landscape. We fully understand and appreciate that technology, particularly online shopping, and over abundance of space or combining with other factors to accelerate store rationalization. As a result, a number of lower quality centers will be losers. Centers, which way they struggle, will not even survive. However at the same time, it is important to keep in mind that winning retailers who excel at being relevant to their customers are continuing to expand at a notable pace as they will need bricks and mortar space to service and sell to their customers.
Regency's portfolio, a balance of shopping centers, where the winners will thrive. Centers that are convenient to the neighborhoods and communities with substantial purchasing power and supply constraints and our well merchandise to other highly productive winning retailers. The vast majority of our thread comes from best-in-class, local, regional and national tenants that offer a durable combination of convenience, necessity, service, value and better shopping experiences.
When disruption causes retailers in our portfolio to rationalize their store count, we have often found that our locations are must keep or the user vacates, bad news as typically good news as we are able to track a better user with higher ramps.
Finally, our experienced team has a proven track of navigating major disruptions in the cyclical and secular changes in our business. We employ those lessons learned in a rigorous and proactive approach to capital allocation, recycling and asset manager. These factors have all serve to reinforce our conviction that Regency's portfolio has never been better positioned to withstand the challenges and prospect from the opportunities that we encounter in the Shopping Center business, and there's no better evidence that Regency owns the winning shopping centers that have minimal exposure to recent bankruptcy as well as our substantial releasing success for those sites that did experience store closing.
Before I turn the call over to Mac, I would like to acknowledge as added responsibilities for transactions along with development as EVP of Investments. I'll now turn the call over to Mac."

I'm pleased to share our enthusiasm for the developments and redevelopments we have in process. They now reflect a total investment of over $500 million, including additional projects applied to the merger, which our team had successfully transitioned. Our in process development and redevelopments are expected to generate returns of 79% representing significant value creation. Regency's proven development platform has delivered over $1.5 billion development projects since 2009, at an average 8% return. Our industry's leading development team continues to source compelling opportunities as evidenced by our 2 latest development starts and we're excited about the opportunities acquired for the merger.
During the first quarter, we started 2 ground-up developments representing a total investment of approximately $60 million. The Field at Commonwealth is a Wegmans anchor 190,000 square-foot center located in Metro D.C.. Commonwealth will benefit from the flow in trade area with strong demographics, including household incomes averaging $140,000 as well as strong daytime population. Though construction has only just begun, the project is already 82% leased and committed. We anticipate project completion at mid-2018 at 7.5% stabilized yield.
Our second development start, Pinecrest Place, is located within the premier infield submarket of Miami, with significant barriers-to-entry. The 70,000 square-foot center will be anchored by a Whole Foods that is relocating from a nearby center and shadowing by Target. Similar to Wegmans, we continue to value the quality Whole Foods brings to a shopping center through high levels of foot traffic and sales volumes, which attracts the best restaurants inside shop retailers. Pinecrest is expected to stabilize in mid-2018, at a 7.3% return.
Please note that we increased our guidance for the year and now anticipates starting between $175 million and $275 million of development and redevelopment projects. While the best development opportunities are limited and competitive, Regency is well-positioned to capture more than our fair bare share of future projects, given our platform depth, enduring tenant relationships and demonstrated track record paired with our well capitalized and flexible balance sheet.
Turning to acquisitions and dispositions. We continue to control the Northeast acquisition opportunity we mentioned in our previous call, which we now hope to close in the second half of the year. In regards to dispositions, we have revised our guidance to $100 million to $200 million, commensurate with Regency's increased development and redevelopment spend. Importantly, our disposition strategy remains the same as we will continue to sell properties as needed to enhance portfolio quality while also funding new investments whether those are developments or redevelopments or attractive returns or acquisitions, our premier shopping centers with strong NOI growth profiles.
I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa."

I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter, and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line.Our first quarte",709,"Thank you, Mac. Good morning, all. I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter, and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line.
Our first quarter results were highlighted by combined same property NOI growth of 3.7%, driven almost entirely by baseline growth. It is important to note we are presenting same property NOI growth on a pro forma basis. The metrics are calculated as if all properties were owned and made the definition of same property for the full calendar year.
We remain highly leased. The combined same property portfolio is 96% leased with shop space at almost 92%. Taking into account the combination of the 2 portfolios, there's essentially no sequential change in the percent lease of the same property portfolio, and in fact, Small Shop occupancy is up 70 basis points year-over-year.
Overall, leasing spreads for the quarter were 8.2% with shop space leasing spreads showing continued strength at over 9%. Rent spreads on new leases in what was a relatively small sample size this quarter were substantially impacted by 1 anchor lease in the center that is targeted for sale. Without this 1 lease, new rent spreads were over 10%.
The bottom line is that we continue to see healthy demand when leases expire, and we also continue to have success despite the decreasing amount of remaining space left to lease, and that decreasing amount is often some of our most challenging spaces.
It is also an important to note, as Hap alluded to earlier, that 95% of closures from bankruptcies that occurred last year has been released or in final lease negotiations.
Our merger with Equity One closed on March 1, and our team has been focused on the successful integration allowing us to proceed towards our primary objective of the merger. One, achievement of enhanced same property NOI growth. Two, execution of a larger development and redevelopment program. And three, realization of synergies. All of these lead to accretive core FFO results.
I'm very pleased to report we've made tremendous progress towards achieving each of these objectives, and as Hap mentioned, reflected by our revised guidance ranges. The integration of the 2 platforms has gone very smoothly. We have clear visibility to achieving the $27 million of operational and overhead synergies that we projected.
Now I'd like to discuss our revised guidance in more detail. We have provided a full update to our guidance that reflects the merged company. Updated core FFO is expected to be $3.60 to $3.68, and NAREIT FFO of $3 to $3.10. NAREIT FFO includes the impacts of the one-time merger transaction costs estimated to be approximately $80 million in 2017 or $0.50 per share. You may recall when we announced the merger, we did communicate that we expected the merger to be accretive to core FFO before the incremental impacts of noncash purchase accounting adjustments. In our supplemental on Page 39, we have provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact to core FFO from these noncash items. It can be a bit complicated but I'll do my best to summarize for you now.
Our premerger stand-alone 2017 core FFO guidance midpoint was $3.47 per share. Our revised post merger midpoint is $3.64. If you exclude the incremental noncash impacts, adjusted core FFO at the midpoint is $3.53 per share. That represents a $0.06 to $0.07 per share increase of which the majority has resulted from accretion related to the merger.
We also increased our same property NOI growth guidance to a new range of 3.2% to 4%. The increase is primarily driven by our strong first quarter outperformance. I'd like to remind you that upon closing, we did increase same property growth guidance by approximately 80 basis points, simply as a result of the expected growth in the Equity One portfolio.
Before closing, I do want to call to your attention that next quarter same property NOI growth could fall below the low end of our range due to the timing of our CAM reconciliations. This is only a timing difference and does not impact full year expectations.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions."

The redevelopments could be a straightforward retail redevelopment in which case there's great NOI growth profiles going forward. We're also looking at more complex retail redevelopments and then also makes use formats. So we have anything on these large projects, to determine our packet, we're still in consider these various alternatives, but we're going to take a hard look at those in light of the fact that several of these projects take 2, 3 -- they take a few years down the road actually to get entitlements in hand even though they have great underlying entitlements. So we'll look at them just like we have for decades here in our development program. We'll look at risks, reward, timing of all that.

I remind you that we have the forward equity that we priced last March, a very nice attractive price of close to $80 a share that we can draw down to fund that acquisition, and then going forward, again, nothing's changed, same strategy we've always had. We will access the equity markets when it's priced attractively and I think -- we typically will say it's not our job to tell you what's NAV but I know right now that we're trading as discount to NAV, I think that's pretty obvious. So I would not say that our equity is attractively priced today. So today, we wouldn't be accessing that market. So we would be sourcing from dispositions to the extent: One, to fund our development spend, which is what our guidance incorporates and we do have an acquisition stamen. We find it very compelling investment opportunity, which has attractive and future NOI growth profile that is accretive to what we have.

Best -- we're seeing best retailers were making more disciplined leasing decisions, which I think, we think is very good, but it's also quality not quantity kind of attitude today. So overall, I think the side shop programs today is consistent to what we've seen in the past."

I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and with the completion of our merger with Equity One. The team has made extraordinary progress integrating the companies. The combined portfolio is demonstrating its exceptional quality with another quarter of being 96% leased and producing over 3.5% same property NOI growth. Our developments and redevelopments continue to perform well. Substantial synergies are already being realized. These collective achievements are reflected in our increased earnings guidance.
I cannot overstate our team's excitement and enthusiasm with the merger and further enhancement to our 4 strategic pillars. One, we own an unequal portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. Two, we have an industry leading development platform. Three, our business activity is supported by a fortress balance sheet. And four, we benefit from a special culture in a deep team of talented professionals. This compelling combination will grow cash flow and earnings, which in turn grow NAV, dividends and shareholder returns.
Now I would like to provide some perspective to the current challenging environment for many retailers and the negative headlines that have become part of our daily reading. Although we will certainly not be immune, there are compelling reasons why I feel that the sky is not falling and why I remain optimistic that well-conceived, well-located and well-merchandised retail real estate will succeed in this environment, and Regency's outlook remains extremely bright.
During the 4 years I've been in the business, competition, retail bankruptcies and store closures have been integral parts of the landscape. We fully understand and appreciate that technology, particularly online shopping, and an overabundance of space are combining with other factors to accelerate store rationalization. As a result, a number of lower-quality centers will be losers. Centers which will either struggle or not even survive. However at the same time, it is important to keep in mind that winning retailers who excel at being relevant to their customers are continuing to expand at a notable pace as they will need bricks and mortar space to service and sell to their customers.
Regency's portfolio is a balance of shopping centers, where the winners will thrive. Centers that are convenient to the neighborhoods and communities with substantial purchasing power and supply constraints and are well merchandised to other highly productive winning retailers. The vast majority of our threat comes from best-in-class, local, regional and national tenants that offer a durable combination of convenience, necessity, service, value and better shopping experiences.
When disruption causes retailers in our portfolio to rationalize their store count, we have often found that our locations are must-keep or if the user vacates, bad news is typically good news as we are able to track a better user with higher rents.
Finally, our experienced team has a proven track record of navigating major disruptions in the cyclical and secular changes in our business. We employ those lessons learned in a rigorous and proactive approach to capital allocation, recycling and asset management. These factors have all served to reinforce our conviction that Regency's portfolio has never been better positioned to withstand the challenges and prospect from the opportunities that we encounter in the shopping center business. And there's no better evidence that Regency owns the winning shopping centers that have minimal exposure to recent bankruptcy as well as our substantial releasing success for those sites that did experience store closings.
Before I turn the call over to Mac, I would like to acknowledge as added responsibilities for transactions along with development as EVP of Investments. I'll now turn the call over to Mac."

I'm pleased to share our enthusiasm for the developments and redevelopments we have in process. They now reflect a total investment of over $500 million, including additional projects acquired through the merger, which our team had successfully transitioned. Our in-process development and redevelopments are expected to generate returns of 79%, representing significant value creation. Regency's proven development platform has delivered over $1.5 billion in development projects since 2009, at an average 8% return. Our industry leading development team continues to source compelling opportunities as evidenced by our 2 latest development starts, and we're excited about the opportunities acquired through the merger.
During the first quarter, we started 2 ground-up developments, representing a total investment of approximately $60 million. The Field at Commonwealth is a Wegmans anchored 190,000 square-foot center located in Metro D.C. Commonwealth will benefit from an infill trade area with strong demographics, including household incomes averaging $140,000 as well as strong daytime population. Though construction has only just begun, the project is already 82% leased and committed. We anticipate project completion at mid-2018 at 7.5% stabilized yield.
Our second development start, Pinecrest Place, is located within a premier infill submarket of Miami, with significant barriers to entry. 70,000 square-foot center will be anchored by a Whole Foods that is relocating from a nearby center and shadowing anchored by Target. Similar to Wegmans, we continue to value the quality Whole Foods brings to a shopping center through high levels of foot traffic and sales volumes, which attracts the best restaurants and side-shop retailers. Pinecrest is expected to stabilize in mid-2018 at a 7.3% return.
Please note that we increased our guidance for the year and now anticipate starting between $175 million and $275 million of development and redevelopment projects. While the best development opportunities are limited and competitive, Regency is well positioned to capture more than our fair share of future projects, given our platform depth, enduring tenant relationships and demonstrated track record paired with our well-capitalized and flexible balance sheet.
Turning to acquisitions and dispositions. We continue to control the Northeast acquisition opportunity we mentioned in our previous call, which we now hope to close in the second half of the year. In regards to dispositions, we have revised our guidance to $100 million to $200 million, commensurate with Regency's increased development and redevelopment spend. Importantly, our disposition strategy remains the same as we will continue to sell properties as needed to enhance portfolio quality while also funding new investments whether those are developments or redevelopments or attractive returns or acquisitions of premier shopping centers with strong NOI growth profiles.
I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa."
816889,423071229,1199255,"Regency Centers Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 10, 2017",2017-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Regency Centers Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter, and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line.Our first quarter",699,"Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter, and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line.
Our first quarter results were highlighted by combined same-property NOI growth of 3.7%, driven almost entirely by baseline growth. It is important to note we are presenting same-property NOI growth on a pro forma basis. The metrics are calculated as if all properties were owned and made the definition of same-property for the full calendar year.
We remain highly leased. The combined same-property portfolio is 96% leased with shop space at almost 92%. Taking into account the combination of the 2 portfolios, there is essentially no sequential change in the percent lease of the same-property portfolio, and in fact, Small Shops occupancy is up 70 basis points year-over-year.
Overall, leasing spreads for the quarter were 8.2% with shop space leasing spread showing continued strength at over 9%. Rent spreads on new leases, in what was a relatively small sample size this quarter, were substantially impacted by one anchored lease in the center that is targeted for sale. Without this one lease, new rent spreads were over 10%.
The bottom line is that we continue to see healthy demand when leases expire, and we also continue to have success despite the decreasing amount of remaining space left to lease, and that decreasing amount is often some of our most challenging spaces.
It is also important to note, as Hap alluded to earlier, that 95% of closures from bankruptcies that occurred last year have been re-leased or in final lease negotiations.
Our merger with Equity One closed on March 1, and our team has been focused on a successful integration allowing us to proceed toward our primary objectives of the merger. One, achievement of enhanced same-property NOI growth. Two, execution of a larger development and redevelopment program. And three, realization of synergies. All of these lead to accretive core FFO results.
I'm very pleased to report we've made tremendous progress towards achieving each of these objectives, and, as Hap mentioned, reflected by our revised guidance ranges. The integration of the 2 platforms has gone very smoothly. We have clear visibility to achieving the $27 million of operational and overhead synergies that we projected.
Now I'd like to discuss our revised guidance in more detail. We have provided a full update to our guidance that reflects the merged company. Updated core FFO is expected to be $3.60 to $3.68, and NAREIT FFO of $3 to $3.10. NAREIT FFO includes the impacts of the one-time merger transaction costs estimated to be approximately $80 million in 2017 or $0.50 per share. You may recall when we announced the merger, we did communicate that we expected the merger to be accretive to core FFO before the incremental impacts of noncash purchase accounting adjustments. In our supplemental, on Page 39, we have provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact to core FFO from these noncash items. It can be a bit complicated, but I'll do my best to summarize for you now.
Our premerger stand-alone 2017 core FFO guidance midpoint was $3.47 per share. Our revised postmerger midpoint is $3.64. If you exclude the incremental noncash impacts, adjusted core FFO at the midpoint is $3.53 per share. That represents a $0.06 to $0.07 per share increase of which the majority has resulted from accretion related to the merger.
We also increased our same-property NOI growth guidance to a new range of 3.2% to 4%. The increase is primarily driven by our strong first quarter outperformance. I'd like to remind you that upon closing, we did increase same property growth guidance by approximately 80 basis points, simply as a result of the expected growth in the Equity One portfolio.
Before closing, I do want to call to your attention that next quarter same-property NOI growth could fall below the low end of our range due to the timing of our CAM reconciliations. This is only a timing difference and does not impact full-year expectations.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions."

Very well located, in the best markets, so we're very excited, just about the locational attributes. We will take a step back, that's what our teams are doing now, and we're looking at them. The redevelopments could be a straightforward retail redevelopment in which case there's great NOI growth profiles going forward. We're also looking at more complex retail redevelopments and then also mixed-use formats. So we haven't done anything on these large projects, to determine our path yet, we're still in -- considering these various alternatives, but we're going to take a hard look at those in light of the fact that several of these projects take 2, 3 -- they take a few years down the road, actually, to get entitlements in hand, even though they have great underlying entitlements. So we'll look at them just like we have for decades here in our development program. We'll look at risks, reward, timing of all that. If we do bring in a nonretail to use, we would typically go out and seek the best-in-class nonretail partners, such as a multifamily developer, and we have great relationships with the very best players -- partners, who are well capitalized and experienced."

Again, similar to what Mac said about developments, we haven't changed how we think about, basically, sources for our investment opportunities. If you think about how we provide guidance on our business model, it's not dependent on acquisitions. We do have one that is under our control/under contract in the Northeast, which has been for a while. I remind you that we have the forward equity that we priced last March, a very nice attractive price of close to $80 a share that we can draw down to fund that acquisition. And then going forward, again, nothing's changed, same strategy we've always had. We will access the equity markets when it's priced attractively, and I think -- we typically will say it's not our job to tell you what's NAV, but I know right now that we're trading at a discount to NAV. I think that's pretty obvious. So I would not say that our equity is attractively priced today. So today, we wouldn't be accessing that market. So we would be sourcing from dispositions to the extent: One, to fund our development spend, which is what our guidance incorporates, and we do have an acquisitions team. And we bought a very compelling investment opportunity which has attractive and future NOI growth profile that is accretive to what we have. So quality accretive, growth accretive. We could potentially increase our disposed to match fund that."

Target is one of the best stores in the chain for Target.

I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and with the completion of our merger with Equity One. The team has made extraordinary progress integrating the companies. The combined portfolio is demonstrating its exceptional quality with another quarter of being 96% leased and producing over 3.5% same property NOI growth. Our developments and redevelopments continue to perform well. Substantial synergies are already being realized. These collective achievements are reflected in our increased earnings guidance.
I cannot overstate our team's excitement and enthusiasm with the merger and further enhancement to our 4 strategic pillars. One, we own an unequalled portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. Two, we have an industry leading development platform. Three, our business activity is supported by a fortress balance sheet. And four, we benefit from a special culture in a deep team of talented professionals. This compelling combination will grow cash flow and earnings, which in turn grow NAV, dividends and shareholder returns.
Now I would like to provide some perspective to the current challenging environment for many retailers and the negative headlines that have become part of our daily reading. Although we will certainly not be immune, there are compelling reasons why I feel that the sky is not falling and why I remain optimistic that well-conceived, well-located and well-merchandised retail real estate will succeed in this environment, and Regency's outlook remains extremely bright.
During the 4 years I've been in the business, competition, retail bankruptcies and store closures have been integral parts of the landscape. We fully understand and appreciate that technology, particularly online shopping, and an overabundance of space are combining with other factors to accelerate store rationalization. As a result, a number of lower-quality centers will be losers, centers which will either struggle or not even survive. However at the same time, it is important to keep in mind that winning retailers who excel at being relevant to their customers are continuing to expand at a notable pace as they will need bricks and mortar space to service and sell to their customers.
Regency's portfolio is a balance of shopping centers, where the winners will thrive. Centers that are convenient to the neighborhoods and communities with substantial purchasing power and supply constraints and are well merchandised to other highly productive winning retailers. The vast majority of our threat comes from best-in-class, local, regional and national tenants that offer a durable combination of convenience, necessity, service, value and better shopping experiences.
When disruption causes retailers in our portfolio to rationalize their store count, we have often found that our locations are must-keep or if the user vacates, bad news is typically good news as we are able to attract a better user at higher rents.
Finally, our experienced team has a proven track record of navigating major disruptions in the cyclical and secular changes in our business. We employ those lessons learned in a rigorous and proactive approach to capital allocation, recycling and asset management. These factors have all served to reinforce our conviction that Regency's portfolio has never been better positioned to withstand the challenges and prosper from the opportunities that we encounter in the shopping center business. And there's no better evidence that Regency owns the winning shopping centers that have minimal exposure to recent bankruptcy as well as our substantial releasing success for those sites that did experience store closings.
Before I turn the call over to Mac, I would like to acknowledge his added responsibilities for transactions along with development as EVP of Investments. I'll now turn the call over to Mac."

I'm pleased to share our enthusiasm for the developments and redevelopments we have in process. They now reflect a total investment of over $500 million, including additional projects acquired through the merger, which our team had successfully transitioned. Our in-process development and redevelopments are expected to generate returns of 79%, representing significant value creation. Regency's proven development platform has delivered over $1.5 billion in development projects since 2009, at an average 8% return. Our industry leading development team continues to source compelling opportunities as evidenced by our 2 latest development starts, and we're excited about the opportunities acquired through the merger.
During the first quarter, we started 2 ground-up developments, representing a total investment of approximately $60 million. The Field at Commonwealth is a Wegmans anchored 190,000 square-foot center located in Metro D.C. Commonwealth will benefit from an affluent trade area with strong demographics, including household incomes averaging $140,000 as well as strong daytime population. Though construction has only just begun, the project is already 82% leased and committed. We anticipate project completion at mid-2018 at 7.5% stabilized yield.
Our second development start, Pinecrest Place, is located within a premier infill submarket of Miami, with significant barriers to entry. The 70,000 square-foot center will be anchored by a Whole Foods that is relocating from a nearby center and shadow anchored by Target. Similar to Wegmans, we continue to value the quality Whole Foods brings to a shopping center through high levels of foot traffic and sales volumes, which attracts the best restaurants and side-shop retailers. Pinecrest is expected to stabilize in mid-2018 at a 7.3% return.
Please note that we increased our guidance for the year and now anticipate starting between $175 million and $275 million of development and redevelopment projects. While the best development opportunities are limited and competitive, Regency is well positioned to capture more than our fair share of future projects, given our platform depth, enduring tenant relationships and demonstrated track record paired with our well-capitalized and flexible balance sheet.
Turning to acquisitions and dispositions. We continue to control the Northeast acquisition opportunity we mentioned in our previous call, which we now hope to close in the second half of the year. In regards to dispositions, we have revised our guidance to $100 million to $200 million, commensurate with Regency's increased development and redevelopment spend. Importantly, our disposition strategy remains the same as we will continue to sell properties as needed to enhance portfolio quality while also funding new investments whether those are developments or redevelopments at attractive returns or acquisitions of premier shopping centers with strong NOI growth profiles.
I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa."

I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter, and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line.Our first quarter",699,"Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter, and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line.
Our first quarter results were highlighted by combined same-property NOI growth of 3.7%, driven almost entirely by baseline growth. It is important to note we are presenting same-property NOI growth on a pro forma basis. The metrics are calculated as if all properties were owned and made the definition of same-property for the full calendar year.
We remain highly leased. The combined same-property portfolio is 96% leased with shop space at almost 92%. Taking into account the combination of the 2 portfolios, there is essentially no sequential change in the percent lease of the same-property portfolio, and in fact, small shop occupancy is up 70 basis points year-over-year.
Overall, leasing spreads for the quarter were 8.2% with shop space leasing spread showing continued strength at over 9%. Rent spreads on new leases, in what was a relatively small sample size this quarter, were substantially impacted by one anchor lease in the center that is targeted for sale. Without this one lease, new rent spreads were over 10%.
The bottom line is that we continue to see healthy demand when leases expire, and we also continue to have success despite the decreasing amount of remaining space left to lease, and that decreasing amount is often some of our most challenging spaces.
It is also important to note, as Hap alluded to earlier, that 95% of closures from bankruptcies that occurred last year have been re-leased or in final lease negotiations.
Our merger with Equity One closed on March 1, and our team has been focused on a successful integration allowing us to proceed toward our primary objectives of the merger. One, achievement of enhanced same-property NOI growth. Two, execution of a larger development and redevelopment program. And three, realization of synergies. All of these lead to accretive core FFO results.
I'm very pleased to report we've made tremendous progress towards achieving each of these objectives, and, as Hap mentioned, reflected by our revised guidance ranges. The integration of the 2 platforms has gone very smoothly. We have clear visibility to achieving the $27 million of operational and overhead synergies that we projected.
Now I'd like to discuss our revised guidance in more detail. We have provided a full update to our guidance that reflects the merged company. Updated core FFO is expected to be $3.60 to $3.68, and NAREIT FFO of $3 to $3.10. NAREIT FFO includes the impacts of the one-time merger transaction costs estimated to be approximately $80 million in 2017 or $0.50 per share. You may recall when we announced the merger, we did communicate that we expected the merger to be accretive to core FFO before the incremental impacts of noncash purchase accounting adjustments. In our supplemental, on Page 39, we have provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact to core FFO from these noncash items. It can be a bit complicated, but I'll do my best to summarize for you now.
Our premerger stand-alone 2017 core FFO guidance midpoint was $3.47 per share. Our revised postmerger midpoint is $3.64. If you exclude the incremental noncash impacts, adjusted core FFO at the midpoint is $3.53 per share. That represents a $0.06 to $0.07 per share increase of which the majority has resulted from accretion related to the merger.
We also increased our same-property NOI growth guidance to a new range of 3.2% to 4%. The increase is primarily driven by our strong first quarter outperformance. I'd like to remind you that upon closing, we did increase same property growth guidance by approximately 80 basis points, simply as a result of the expected growth in the Equity One portfolio.
Before closing, I do want to call to your attention that next quarter same-property NOI growth could fall below the low end of our range due to the timing of our CAM reconciliations. This is only a timing difference and does not impact full-year expectations.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions."

Very well located, in the best markets, so we're very excited, just about the locational attributes. We will take a step back, that's what our teams are doing now, and we're looking at them. The redevelopments could be a straightforward retail redevelopment in which case there's great NOI growth profiles going forward. We're also looking at more complex retail redevelopments and then also mixed-use formats. So we haven't done anything on these large projects to determine our path yet, we're still in -- considering these various alternatives, but we're going to take a hard look at those in light of the fact that several of these projects take 2, 3 -- they take a few years down the road, actually, to get entitlements in hand, even though they have great underlying entitlements. So we'll look at them just like we have for decades here in our development program. We'll look at risks, reward, timing of all that. If we do bring in a nonretail use, we would typically go out and seek the best-in-class nonretail partners, such as a multifamily developer, and we have great relationships with the very best players -- partners, who are well capitalized and experienced."

If you think about how we provide guidance on our business model, it's not dependent on acquisitions. We do have one that is under our control/under contract in the Northeast, which has been for a while. I remind you that we have the forward equity that we priced last March, a very nice attractive price of close to $80 a share that we can draw down to fund that acquisition. And then going forward, again, nothing's changed, same strategy we've always had. We will access the equity markets when it's priced attractively, and I think -- we typically will say it's not our job to tell you what's NAV, but I know right now that we're trading at a discount to NAV. I think that's pretty obvious. So I would not say that our equity is attractively priced today. So today, we wouldn't be accessing that market. So we would be sourcing from dispositions to the extent: One, to fund our development spend, which is what our guidance incorporates, and we do have an acquisitions team. And we bought a very compelling investment opportunity which has attractive and future NOI growth profile that is accretive to what we have. So quality accretive, growth accretive. We could potentially increase our disposed to match fund that."

Target is one of the best stores in the chain for Target. I will also say that the expansion that's underway with value-oriented retailers on the exterior of the mall, like Nordstrom Rack and TJX and Ross is going to be a great addition. You may also note that Dave & Buster's recently opened up in the center, and it's one of the top Dave & Buster's in the chain. The Macy's and the JCPenney's are 2 of the best locations in the mall. You may also be aware that Macy's is closed within -- I think, within 5 or 10 miles of Serramonte, 2 of their other stores, there was announced closings of those.

I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and with the completion of our merger with Equity One. The team has made extraordinary progress integrating the companies. The combined portfolio is demonstrating its exceptional quality with another quarter of being 96% leased and producing over 3.5% same property NOI growth. Our developments and redevelopments continue to perform well. Substantial synergies are already being realized. These collective achievements are reflected in our increased earnings guidance.
I cannot overstate our team's excitement and enthusiasm with the merger and further enhancement to our 4 strategic pillars. One, we own an unequalled portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. Two, we have an industry leading development platform. Three, our business activity is supported by a fortress balance sheet. And four, we benefit from a special culture in a deep team of talented professionals. This compelling combination will grow cash flow and earnings, which in turn grow NAV, dividends and shareholder returns.
Now I would like to provide some perspective to the current challenging environment for many retailers and the negative headlines that have become part of our daily reading. Although we will certainly not be immune, there are compelling reasons why I feel that the sky is not falling and why I remain optimistic that well-conceived, well-located and well-merchandised retail real estate will succeed in this environment, and Regency's outlook remains extremely bright.
During the 4 years I've been in the business, competition, retail bankruptcies and store closures have been integral parts of the landscape. We fully understand and appreciate that technology, particularly online shopping, and an overabundance of space are combining with other factors to accelerate store rationalization. As a result, a number of lower-quality centers will be losers, centers which will either struggle or not even survive. However at the same time, it is important to keep in mind that winning retailers who excel at being relevant to their customers are continuing to expand at a notable pace as they will need bricks and mortar space to service and sell to their customers.
Regency's portfolio is a balance of shopping centers, where the winners will thrive. Centers that are convenient to the neighborhoods and communities with substantial purchasing power and supply constraints and are well merchandised to other highly productive winning retailers. The vast majority of our threat comes from best-in-class, local, regional and national tenants that offer a durable combination of convenience, necessity, service, value and better shopping experiences.
When disruption causes retailers in our portfolio to rationalize their store count, we have often found that our locations are must-keep or if the user vacates, bad news is typically good news as we are able to attract a better user at higher rents.
Finally, our experienced team has a proven track record of navigating major disruptions in the cyclical and secular changes in our business. We employ those lessons learned in a rigorous and proactive approach to capital allocation, recycling and asset management. These factors have all served to reinforce our conviction that Regency's portfolio has never been better positioned to withstand the challenges and prosper from the opportunities that we encounter in the shopping center business. And there's no better evidence that Regency owns the winning shopping centers that have minimal exposure to recent bankruptcy as well as our substantial releasing success for those sites that did experience store closings.
Before I turn the call over to Mac, I would like to acknowledge his added responsibilities for transactions along with development as EVP of Investments. I'll now turn the call over to Mac."

I'm pleased to share our enthusiasm for the developments and redevelopments we have in process. They now reflect a total investment of over $500 million, including additional projects acquired through the merger, which our team had successfully transitioned. Our in-process development and redevelopments are expected to generate returns of 79%, representing significant value creation. Regency's proven development platform has delivered over $1.5 billion in development projects since 2009, at an average 8% return. Our industry leading development team continues to source compelling opportunities as evidenced by our 2 latest development starts, and we're excited about the opportunities acquired through the merger.
During the first quarter, we started 2 ground-up developments, representing a total investment of approximately $60 million. The Field at Commonwealth is a Wegmans anchored 190,000 square-foot center located in Metro D.C. Commonwealth will benefit from an affluent trade area with strong demographics, including household incomes averaging $140,000 as well as strong daytime population. Though construction has only just begun, the project is already 82% leased and committed. We anticipate project completion at mid-2018 at 7.5% stabilized yield.
Our second development start, Pinecrest Place, is located within a premier infill submarket of Miami, with significant barriers to entry. The 70,000 square-foot center will be anchored by a Whole Foods that is relocating from a nearby center and shadow anchored by Target. Similar to Wegmans, we continue to value the quality Whole Foods brings to a shopping center through high levels of foot traffic and sales volumes, which attracts the best restaurants and side-shop retailers. Pinecrest is expected to stabilize in mid-2018 at a 7.3% return.
Please note that we increased our guidance for the year and now anticipate starting between $175 million and $275 million of development and redevelopment projects. While the best development opportunities are limited and competitive, Regency is well positioned to capture more than our fair share of future projects, given our platform depth, enduring tenant relationships and demonstrated track record paired with our well-capitalized and flexible balance sheet.
Turning to acquisitions and dispositions. We continue to control the Northeast acquisition opportunity we mentioned in our previous call, which we now hope to close in the second half of the year. In regards to dispositions, we have revised our guidance to $100 million to $200 million, commensurate with Regency's increased development and redevelopment spend. Importantly, our disposition strategy remains the same as we will continue to sell properties as needed to enhance portfolio quality while also funding new investments whether those are developments or redevelopments at attractive returns or acquisitions of premier shopping centers with strong NOI growth profiles.
I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa."
816889,423071229,1205886,"Regency Centers Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 10, 2017",2017-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Regency Centers Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter, and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line.Our first quarter",699,"Thank you, Mac. Good morning all. I have to echo the gratification both Hap and Mac expressed on the performance of our portfolio in the first quarter, and especially the efforts of our team in guiding the merger across the finish line.
Our first quarter results were highlighted by combined same-property NOI growth of 3.7%, driven almost entirely by baseline growth. It is important to note we are presenting same-property NOI growth on a pro forma basis. The metrics are calculated as if all properties were owned and made the definition of same-property for the full calendar year.
We remain highly leased. The combined same-property portfolio is 96% leased with shop space at almost 92%. Taking into account the combination of the 2 portfolios, there is essentially no sequential change in the percent lease of the same-property portfolio, and in fact, small shop occupancy is up 70 basis points year-over-year.
Overall, leasing spreads for the quarter were 8.2% with shop space leasing spread showing continued strength at over 9%. Rent spreads on new leases, in what was a relatively small sample size this quarter, were substantially impacted by one anchor lease in the center that is targeted for sale. Without this one lease, new rent spreads were over 10%.
The bottom line is that we continue to see healthy demand when leases expire, and we also continue to have success despite the decreasing amount of remaining space left to lease, and that decreasing amount is often some of our most challenging spaces.
It is also important to note, as Hap alluded to earlier, that 95% of closures from bankruptcies that occurred last year have been re-leased or in final lease negotiations.
Our merger with Equity One closed on March 1, and our team has been focused on a successful integration allowing us to proceed toward our primary objectives of the merger. One, achievement of enhanced same-property NOI growth. Two, execution of a larger development and redevelopment program. And three, realization of synergies. All of these lead to accretive core FFO results.
I'm very pleased to report we've made tremendous progress towards achieving each of these objectives, and, as Hap mentioned, reflected by our revised guidance ranges. The integration of the 2 platforms has gone very smoothly. We have clear visibility to achieving the $27 million of operational and overhead synergies that we projected.
Now I'd like to discuss our revised guidance in more detail. We have provided a full update to our guidance that reflects the merged company. Updated core FFO is expected to be $3.60 to $3.68, and NAREIT FFO of $3 to $3.10. NAREIT FFO includes the impacts of the one-time merger transaction costs estimated to be approximately $80 million in 2017 or $0.50 per share. You may recall when we announced the merger, we did communicate that we expected the merger to be accretive to core FFO before the incremental impacts of noncash purchase accounting adjustments. In our supplemental, on Page 39, we have provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact to core FFO from these noncash items. It can be a bit complicated, but I'll do my best to summarize for you now.
Our premerger stand-alone 2017 core FFO guidance midpoint was $3.47 per share. Our revised postmerger midpoint is $3.64. If you exclude the incremental noncash impacts, adjusted core FFO at the midpoint is $3.53 per share. That represents a $0.06 to $0.07 per share increase of which the majority has resulted from accretion related to the merger.
We also increased our same-property NOI growth guidance to a new range of 3.2% to 4%. The increase is primarily driven by our strong first quarter outperformance. I'd like to remind you that upon closing, we did increase same property growth guidance by approximately 80 basis points, simply as a result of the expected growth in the Equity One portfolio.
Before closing, I do want to call to your attention that next quarter same-property NOI growth could fall below the low end of our range due to the timing of our CAM reconciliations. This is only a timing difference and does not impact full-year expectations.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions."

I guess the first thing I would say is these Equity One properties, the ones that are sort of the typical ones for redevelopment, are all tremendous properties. Very well located, in the best markets, so we're very excited, just about the locational attributes. We will take a step back, that's what our teams are doing now, and we're looking at them. The redevelopments could be a straightforward retail redevelopment in which case there's great NOI growth profiles going forward. We're also looking at more complex retail redevelopments and then also mixed-use formats. So we haven't done anything on these large projects to determine our path yet, we're still in -- considering these various alternatives, but we're going to take a hard look at those in light of the fact that several of these projects take 2, 3 -- they take a few years down the road, actually, to get entitlements in hand, even though they have great underlying entitlements. So we'll look at them just like we have for decades here in our development program. We'll look at risks, reward, timing of all that. If we do bring in a nonretail use, we would typically go out and seek the best-in-class nonretail partners, such as a multifamily developer, and we have great relationships with the very best players -- partners, who are well capitalized and experienced."

If you think about how we provide guidance on our business model, it's not dependent on acquisitions. We do have one that is under our control/under contract in the Northeast, which has been for a while. I remind you that we have the forward equity that we priced last March, a very nice attractive price of close to $80 a share that we can draw down to fund that acquisition. And then going forward, again, nothing's changed, same strategy we've always had. We will access the equity markets when it's priced attractively, and I think -- we typically will say it's not our job to tell you what's NAV, but I know right now that we're trading at a discount to NAV. I think that's pretty obvious. So I would not say that our equity is attractively priced today. So today, we wouldn't be accessing that market. So we would be sourcing from dispositions to the extent: One, to fund our development spend, which is what our guidance incorporates, and we do have an acquisitions team. And we bought a very compelling investment opportunity which has attractive and future NOI growth profile that is accretive to what we have. So quality accretive, growth accretive.

Yesterday afternoon, we reported another quarter of solid operating results. Our half quality portfolio shopping centers located in the affluent and densely filled trade areas continues to perform well. Leasing levels are nearly 96% with Small Shop leasing surpassing 92%. These healthy fundamentals produce year-to-date same property NOI growth of 3.5% in 4 to 5 future sustainable growth. With combined with our development and redevelopment expertise, fortress balance sheet and exceptional team, all of which were only made the stronger with the integration of Equity One. We are well-positioned to achieve our strategic objectives and great value for our shareholders.
At the same time, we remain very mindful that the retail landscape continues to change, including the ongoing evolution of grocery industry. Amazon announced purchase of Whole Foods, reinforces our conviction that our well located bricks and mortar presence that is convenient to the customer is a critical component of the success of any omnichannel platform.
The best grocers, which anchored the vast majority of our centers are more focused than ever while advancing their own technology, price and shopping experiences to service their customers and grow revenues and profits.
They benefited from extensive and a replaceable platforms in our target markets, with average sales of $650 per square-foot and healthy occupancy costs below 2%.
We will certainly not be immune to the changes occurring in the retail business and are keenly focused on the disruptors facing us today and those that we might face in the future.
We have a proven track record of successfully navigating and even profiting from industry challenges and will continue to adapt and make decisions that will enable our retail centers to not only survive but prosper over the long-term.
We are prepared to own, operate and invest in a world where the bifurcation between the winning and losing grocers and retailers will accelerate as with the growing separation between the better shopping centers and everything else.
That said, Regency's natural portfolio were the best-in-class retailers who want to locate the physical source, disciplined capital allocation strategy and experienced and team will position as extremely well for the future.

The quality of our portfolio and our team is truly evident in our second quarter results.
Portfolio occupancy remains at historically high levels though we experienced a slight dip in overall occupancy driven by 1 anticipated anchor move out. Our same property portfolio remains at and not nearly 96% leased.
What I'm especially pleased about is our shop occupancy, which jumped up above 92% and represents an impressive 30 basis point increase sequentially. We continue to experience steady demand for space from a wide variety of tenants across many categories, which include value retailers, fast casual restaurants, fitness operators, pet stores and services users among others. While retailers are gaining more deliberate and selective with their expansion plans, they continue to seek out the better locations, many of which are well merchandised centers.
Leasing spreads on new deals in the quarter were 14%, highlighted by strong anchor spreads of 26% and shop rent spreads over 12%.
Regarding bankruptcies, our exposure to store closures remains minimal. Announced 2017 store closures represent only 29 stores in our portfolio of over 9,000 tenants. We have successfully released or at least negotiation for 95% of the anchor spaces we have received back over the past 18 months.
Our second quarter results, very limited exposure to bankruptcy since store rationalizations as well as our success in releasing locations that do close, collectively demonstrates the differentiation of the Regency platform and confident and our ability to produce a sector leading NOI growth and operating fundamentals.

Our development and redevelopment activity remains robust as we saw compelling opportunities within our target markets and portfolio. Our in process projects that now exceeds $600 million of developments and redevelopments with expected returns of nearly 7.5% creating significant value that will drive future growth.
The second quarter, we started Mellody Farm, a $100 million ground-up development work located within a highly affluent suburb in Chicago. The 250,000 square-foot center is anchored by strong lineup, featuring Whole Foods, REI, Nordstrom Rack and HomeGoods. Preleasing the best-in-class restaurants and service providers is off to an impressive start.
Our development team is making significant progress in several exciting redevelopment projects within the portfolio. That customer need in La Jolla, California we were progressing with our approvals to densify the shopping center to take advantage of the vibrant growth in University Town Center and Market Common Clementine, located in Metro Washington, D.C., where we are working well with the community towards repositioning the existing office building to attract new retail and creative office tenants that will enhance the overall center.
We also continue to make progress within our now integrated Equity One portfolio, including Westwood Shopping Center, located in Bethesda; the Collection Harvard Square in Cambridge and Potrero Center in San Francisco, just to name a few. I look forward to sharing further details on these as well as other exciting opportunities on future calls.
Turning to disposition activity. Demand for the properties we sell remain steady across all markets. As a reminder, we review these disposition proceeds to fund new investment activities. As our development and redevelop spending ramps up through the remainder of 2017, our disposition shows well. We are maintaining our previous guidance of $100 million to $200 million of dispositions.
In regards to acquisitions, we remain under contract with the Northeast opportunity we have mentioned in the past. This is an acquisition of exceptional ground-up development that we will close upon construction completion and anchor right commitments. This opportunity may close late this year, but appears more likely to close early next year. Lastly, we are currently evaluating several compelling acquisition opportunities located in priority target markets and any of these opportunities will further enhance our portfolio quality and NOI growth profile.

In addition to solid operating results from our high-quality portfolio and an impressive roster of in-process developments, we make enhancements to our already sector leading balance sheet by extending our maturity duration and lowering our overall effective interest rate.
During the quarter, we completed a successful reopening of our 10 and 30-year unsecured notes that we originally issued in January. We opportunistically released $300 million across the 2 tranches to retire high coupon mortgage debt, preferred stock and pay down our line of credit balance. While the suffering was completed in the weeks following the news of the Amazon, Whole Foods of margin, which in most of you know that's a significant volatility in the equity markets, it is important to note that we experienced minimal impact to demand or pricing.
We are extremely gratified by the support shown from the fixed income investment community to Regency's platform and our high-quality and well allocated portfolio. A quick to note on the merger integration, the team has made exceptional progress, highlight of our operating results including a meaningful increase in shop space percent leased during the quarter. We are well on our way to achieving the $27 million in merger-related synergies that we originally projected.
Turning to guidance. As a result of retiring the secured mortgages, we incurred a one-time cost of approximately $12 million in the second quarter. We will also expense the noncash preferred issuance charges of approximately $2.5 million in the third quarter, this is related to the redemption of those preferred securities. These one-time items will reduce net income and NAREIT FFO per share by approximately $0.09 for the full year as reflected in our revised guidance. And additionally, we revised our net interest expense guidance to reflect these transactions.
As Mac discussed, our disposition timing is tied to our spending is an majority of our dispositions are now expected to occur in the second half of the year. Due to this later and originally projected timing and therefore, greater than expected contribution to NOI, from this start at these dispositions. We have increased the bottom end of our core FFO guidance range.
And also related to investment spending, we've extended the maturity of our outspending forward equity issuance to the end of the year as this better align the timing of the forward equity of our future funding needs.
And finally, given the solid results in the quarter and year-to-date, we are reaffirming our 2017 same property NOI guidance as we expect this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year.
That concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions."

Westwood is a project that we're very excited about and we're getting it out and very carefully. In protest at, Bethesda with the existing giant would love to be a part of a redevelopment property. So we are -- and we have changed sort of the mix of the project to reflect market conditions and right now we're evaluating that considering selling some air rights to builders who undo townhomes, apartments or seniors or some combination of the 3. So it's slightly different mix. We're probably suggesting less retail than Equity One that proposed. But we really -- we think any of the day, this is dynamic location with the time that does very well that will be a part of whatever future project that we ultimately decide on. And we also think because of the underlying entitlements, we should be in a position to start that project late next year. So come together, but we don't have this amendment to announce to that. Less some of that one is more of a Potrero. In any event, it's going to take 3 to 5 years to entitle it even with the great underlying entitlements that we have a. We changed architects with that project and we are in the midst of setting all the different potentials. There's tremendous amount of density available to us and we're not quite ready to make announcements. That's going to take longer for us to ultimately program and ultimately approve. So I wouldn't plan on something like that for 3 to 5 years from starting. Our collection at Cambridge, that's more of a near-term project. It takes 3 steps to take development to work stores the first step, and now we're working on the second step, which is planning commission but it should be in the position to start late next year as well and that's a little more straightforward where we know it's going to be a combination of retail and office. And we'll redevelop some of the buildings and then raise and rebuild others to create a cohesive a project in a terrific location. So in light of the overall changes from the landscape of environment, we're still very disciplined about the amount of shops that we propose about the anchors that we suggests and we're only working with the best in class tenants. We recognized that when you bring in other uses such as multifamily, it takes some time to find the right partner and we're patient about doing that, and we want to make sure our risk-adjusted returns are appropriate but at this point, we don't have really good guidance on those returns because we're still evaluating a lot of different possibilities."

One of the strategic benefits was an enhanced same property NOI growth rate. It's hard to exclude redevelopments, because that is a piece of it. And then on March 1, when we closed, we significantly increased our same property NOI growth guidance for the year. And that enhanced same property NOI growth for '17 and also for the next couple of years is coming from a variety of things. One, the Equity One had just done a very good job of acquiring properties that were -- that had lease rent rules essentially with leases below markets. So there was just inherent upside as it leases were rolling, and we're beginning to achieve some of that. They have done a fantastic job in the very recent past of actually leasing up their shop space, but there were still room and as evidenced by our results this quarter. So some of it is coming from there. And then they were great operators, but I'm a little biased, and I think we've got the best team in the business. And I think that we can apply our expertise in the field to enhancing those contractual rent steps and again increasing occupancy. So you asked me to exclude redevelopment, but that's also a piece of it, because I also believe that, that best team in the business applies to our ability to create value at these shopping centers. And again, the Equity One team has built a really nice portfolio of properties that essentially increased our venue of opportunities to create value. So all of that will continue to enhance our same property NOI growth for at least the next couple of years, and then we'll get to a much more stabilized run rate."

Yesterday afternoon, we reported another quarter of solid operating results. Our high-quality portfolio of shopping centers located in affluent and dense infill trade areas continues to perform well. Leasing levels are nearly 96%, with Small Shop leasing surpassing 92%. 
These healthy fundamentals produced year-to-date same property NOI growth of 3.5% and fortify our future sustainable growth. When combined with our development and redevelopment expertise, fortress  balance sheet and exceptional team, all of which were only made stronger with the integration of Equity One, we are well positioned to achieve our strategic objectives and create value for our shareholders. 
At the same time, we remain very mindful that the retail landscape continues to change, including the ongoing evolution of the grocery industry. Amazon's announced purchase of Whole Foods reinforces our conviction that a well located bricks and mortar presence that is convenient to the customer is a critical component of the success of any omni-channel platform.
The best grocers, which anchor the vast majority of our centers, are more focused than ever on advancing their own technology, pricing and shopping experiences to service their customers and grow revenues and profits.
They benefit from extensive and irreplaceable platforms in our target markets, with average sales of over $650 per square-foot and healthy occupancy costs below 2%.
We will certainly not be immune to the changes occurring in the retail business and are keenly focused on the disruptors facing us today and those that we might face in the future.
We have a proven track record of successfully navigating and even profiting from industry challenges and will continue to adapt and make decisions that will enable our retail centers to not only survive but prosper over the long term.
We are prepared to own, operate and invest in a world where the bifurcation between the winning and losing grocers and retailers will accelerate as will the growing separation between the better shopping centers and everything else.
That said, Regency's unequaled national portfolio, where the best-in-class retailers will want to locate their physical stores, disciplined capital allocation strategy and experienced elite team position us extremely well for the future.

The quality of our portfolio and our team is truly evident in our second quarter results.
Portfolio occupancy remains at historically high levels. Though we experienced a slight dip in overall occupancy, driven by 1 anticipated anchor move-out, our same property portfolio remains at nearly 96% leased.
What I'm especially pleased about is our shop occupancy, which jumped back above 92% and represents an impressive 30 basis point increase sequentially. 
We continue to experience steady demand for space from a wide variety of tenants across many categories, which include value retailers, fast casual restaurants, fitness operators, pet stores and service users among others. While retailers are being more deliberate and selective with their expansion plans, they continue to seek out the better locations, many of which are at our well-merchandised centers.
Leasing spreads on new deals in the quarter were 14%, highlighted by strong anchor spreads of 26% and shop rent spreads over 12%.
Regarding bankruptcies, our exposure to store closures remains minimal. Announced 2017 store closures represent only 20 stores in our portfolio of over 9,000 tenants. We have successfully re-leased or in lease negotiation for 95% of the anchor spaces we received back over the past 18 months.
Our second quarter results, very limited exposure to bankruptcy since store rationalizations as well as our success in re-leasing locations that do close, collectively demonstrate the differentiation of the Regency platform and leaves us confident in our ability to produce sector-leading NOI growth and operating fundamentals.

Our development and redevelopment activity remains robust as we saw compelling opportunities within our target markets and portfolio. Our in-process projects now exceed $600 million of developments and redevelopments, with expected returns of nearly 7.5%, creating significant value that will drive future growth.
During the second quarter, we started Mellody Farm, a $100 million ground-up development located within a highly affluent suburb of Chicago. The 250,000 square-foot center is anchored by strong lineup, featuring Whole Foods, REI, Nordstrom Rack and HomeGoods. Pre-leasing to best-in-class restaurants and service providers is off to an impressive start.
Our development team is making significant progress in several exciting redevelopment projects within the portfolio. At Costa Verde in La Jolla, California, we are progressing with our approvals to densify the shopping center to take advantage of the vibrant growth in University Town Center. At Market Common Clarendon, located in Metro Washington, D.C, we are working well with the community towards repositioning the existing office building to attract new retail and creative office tenants that will enhance the overall center.
We also continue to make progress within our now integrated Equity One portfolio, including Westwood Shopping Center, located in Bethesda; The Collection at Harvard Square in Cambridge and Potrero Center in San Francisco, just to name a few. I look forward to sharing further details on these as well as other exciting opportunities on future calls.
Turning to disposition activity. Demand for the properties we're selling remains steady across all markets. As a reminder, we will use disposition proceeds to fund our new investment activities. As our development and redevelopment spending ramps up through the remainder of 2017, our dispositions should as well. We are maintaining our previous guidance of $100 million to $200 million of dispositions.
In regards to acquisitions, we remain under contract for the Northeast opportunity we have mentioned in the past. This is an acquisition of exceptional ground-up development that we will close upon construction completion and anchor rent commencement. 
This opportunity may close late this year, but it appears more likely to close early next year. 
Lastly, we are currently evaluating several compelling acquisition opportunities located in priority target markets. And any of these opportunities will further enhance our portfolio quality and NOI growth profile.

In addition to solid operating results from our high-quality portfolio and an impressive roster of in-process developments, we made enhancements to our already sector-leading balance sheet by extending our maturity duration and lowering our overall effective interest rate.
During the quarter, we completed a successful reopening of our 10 and 30-year unsecured notes that we originally issued in January. We opportunistically raised $300 million across the 2 tranches to retire our high coupon mortgage debt, preferred stock and pay down our line of credit balance. 
While this offering was completed in the week following the news of the Amazon-Whole Foods merger, which as most of you know led to significant volatility in the equity markets, it is important to note that we experienced minimal impact to demand or pricing.
We were extremely gratified by the support shown from the fixed income investment community to Regency's platform and our high-quality and well-located portfolio. 
A quick note on the merger integration. The team has made exceptional progress, highlighted by our operating results, including a meaningful increase in shop space percent leased during the quarter. We are well on our way to achieving the $27 million in merger-related synergies that we originally projected.
Turning to guidance. As a result of retiring the secured mortgages, we incurred one-time costs of approximately $12 million in the second quarter. We will also expense the noncash preferred issuance charges of approximately $2.5 million in the third quarter. This is related to the redemption of those preferred securities. 
These one-time items will reduce net income and NAREIT FFO per share by approximately $0.09 for the full year, as reflected in our revised guidance. And additionally, we've revised our net interest expense guidance to reflect these transactions.
 
As Mac discussed, our disposition timing is tied to our investment spending needs, and the majority of our dispositions are now expected to occur in the second half of the year. Due to this later than originally projected timing and therefore greater-than-expected contribution to NOI from these targeted dispositions, we have increased the bottom end of our core FFO guidance range. 
And also related to investment spending, we've extended the maturity of our outstanding forward equity issuance to the end of the year as this better aligns the timing of the forward equity with our future funding needs.
And finally, given the solid results in the quarter and year-to-date, we are reaffirming our 2017 same-property NOI guidance as we expect this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions."

We expect it would remove any uncertainty about new store openings. It appears like it's going to allow Whole Foods to reduce their costs and be more price competitive. And obviously, Amazon's direct and indirect industry presence will continue to grow. But they're paying over $40 million of stores, so we don't expect them to do anything that would impair this wonderful brand that the Whole Foods has. So we don't expect to convert them to 40,000 square foot warehouse. But I'm sure, they're going to use some of the store for pickup, delivery, et cetera from an Amazon standpoint. And honestly, it reinforces our conviction about the importance of retailers being able to conveniently service their customers through bricks and mortar. It is and it remains the most efficient way to deliver the last mile."

So we are -- we have changed sort of the mix of the project to reflect market conditions. And right now we're evaluating that, considering selling some air rights to builders who want to do townhomes, apartments or seniors or some combination of the 3. So it's a slightly different mix. We're probably suggesting less retail than Equity One had proposed. But we really -- we think at the end of the day, this is a dynamic location with the giant that does very well that will be part of whatever future project that we ultimately decide on. And we also think because of the underlying entitlements, we should be in a position to start that project late next year. So coming together, but we don't have at this time anymore to announce on that. I'd say let's jump to Potrero. That one is more of a longer-range project. In any event, it's going to take 3 to 5 years to entitle it even with the great underlying entitlements that we have. We've changed architects in that project, and we're in the midst of setting all the different potentials. There's tremendous amount of density available to us, and we're not quite ready to make any announcements on that one. That's going to take longer for us to ultimately program and ultimately approve. So I wouldn't plan on something like that for 3 to 5 years from starting. Harvard Collection at Cambridge, that's more of a near-term project. It takes 3 steps to get the entitlements. We're through the first step. And now we're working on the second step, which is the planning commission. That should be in a position to start late next year as well. And that's a little more straightforward, where we know it's going to be a combination of retail and office. And we'll redevelop some of the buildings and then raise and rebuild others to create a cohesive project in a terrific location. So in light of the overall changes from the landscape environment, we're still very disciplined about the amount of shops that we propose, about the anchors that we suggest, and we're only working with the best-in-class tenants. We recognize that when you bring in other uses such as multifamily, it takes some time to find the right partner, and we're patient about doing that and we want to make sure our risk-adjusted returns are appropriate. But at this point, we don't have really good guidance on those returns because we're still evaluating a lot of different possibilities."

One of the strategic benefits was an enhanced same-property NOI growth rate. It's hard to exclude redevelopments because that is a piece of it. And then on March 1, when we closed, we significantly increased our same-property NOI growth guidance for the year. And that enhanced same-property NOI growth for '17 and also for the next couple of years is coming from a variety of things. One, Equity One had just done a very good job of acquiring properties that were -- that had lease rent rolls essentially, with leases below market. And so there was just inherent upside as leases are rolling. And we're beginning to achieve some of that. They have done a fantastic job in the very recent past of actually leasing up their shop space, but there were still room and as evidenced by our results this quarter. So some of it is coming from there. And then, they were great operators, but I'm a little biased, and I think we've got the best team in the business. And I think that we can apply our expertise in the field to enhancing those contractual rent steps and, again, increasing occupancy. So you asked me to exclude redevelopment, but that's also a piece of it because I also believe that, [ that theme ] in the business applies to our ability to create value at these shopping centers. And again, the Equity One team has built a really nice portfolio of properties that essentially increased our venue of opportunities to create value. So all of that will continue to enhance our same-property NOI growth for at least the next couple of years. And then we'll get to a much more stable -- stabilized run rate."

Yesterday afternoon, we reported another quarter of solid operating results. Our high-quality portfolio of shopping centers located in affluent and dense infill trade areas continues to perform well. Leasing levels are nearly 96%, with Small Shop leasing surpassing 92%. 
These healthy fundamentals produced year-to-date same property NOI growth of 3.5% and fortify future sustainable growth. When combined with our development and redevelopment expertise, fortress  balance sheet and exceptional team, all of which were only made stronger with the integration of Equity One, we are well positioned to achieve our strategic objectives and create value for our shareholders. 
At the same time, we remain very mindful that the retail landscape continues to change, including the ongoing evolution of the grocery industry. Amazon's announced purchase of Whole Foods reinforces our conviction that a well-located bricks and mortar presence that is convenient to the customer is a critical component of the success of any omni-channel platform.
The best grocers, which anchor the vast majority of our centers, are more focused than ever on advancing their own technology, pricing and shopping experiences to service their customers and grow revenues and profits.
They benefit from extensive and irreplaceable platforms in our target markets, with average sales of over $650 per square foot and healthy occupancy costs below 2%.
We will certainly not be immune to the changes occurring in the retail business and are keenly focused on the disruptors facing us today and those that we might face in the future.
We have a proven track record of successfully navigating and even profiting from industry challenges and will continue to adapt and make decisions that will enable our retail centers to not only survive but prosper over the long term.
We are prepared to own, operate and invest in a world where the bifurcation between the winning and losing grocers and retailers will accelerate as will the growing separation between the better shopping centers and everything else.
That said, Regency's unequaled national portfolio, where the best-in-class retailers will want to locate their physical stores, disciplined capital allocation strategy and experienced and deep team position us extremely well for the future.

The quality of our portfolio and our team is truly evident in our second quarter results.
Portfolio occupancy remains at historically high levels. Though we experienced a slight dip in overall occupancy, driven by 1 anticipated anchor move-out, our same property portfolio remains at nearly 96% leased.
What I'm especially pleased about is our shop occupancy, which jumped back above 92% and represents an impressive 30 basis point increase sequentially. 
We continue to experience steady demand for space from a wide variety of tenants across many categories, which include value retailers, fast-casual restaurants, fitness operators, pet stores and service users, among others. While retailers are being more deliberate and selective with their expansion plans, they continue to seek out the better locations, many of which are at our well-merchandised centers.
Leasing spreads on new deals in the quarter were 14%, highlighted by strong anchor spreads of 26% and shop rent spreads over 12%.
Regarding bankruptcies, our exposure to store closures remains minimal. Announced 2017 store closures represent only 20 stores in our portfolio of over 9,000 tenants. We have successfully re-leased or in lease negotiation for 95% of the anchor spaces we have received back over the past 18 months.
Our second quarter results, very limited exposure to bankruptcy since store rationalizations as well as our success in re-leasing locations that do close, collectively demonstrate the differentiation of the Regency platform and leaves us confident in our ability to produce sector-leading NOI growth and operating fundamentals.

Our development and redevelopment activity remains robust, as we saw compelling opportunities within our target markets and portfolio. Our in-process projects now exceed $600 million of developments and redevelopments, with expected returns of nearly 7.5%, creating significant value that will drive future growth.
During the second quarter, we started Mellody Farm, a $100 million ground-up development located within a highly affluent suburb of Chicago. The 250,000 square-foot center is anchored by strong lineup, featuring Whole Foods, REI, Nordstrom Rack and HomeGoods. Preleasing the best-in-class restaurants and service providers is off to an impressive start.
Our development team is making significant progress in several exciting redevelopment projects within the portfolio. At Costa Verde in La Jolla, California, we are progressing with our approvals to densify the shopping center to take advantage of the vibrant growth in the University Town Center. At Market Common Clarendon, located in Metro Washington, D.C, we are working well with the community towards repositioning the existing office building to attract new retail and creative office tenants that will enhance the overall center.
We also continue to make progress within our now integrated Equity One portfolio, including Westwood Shopping Center, located in Bethesda; The Collection at Harvard Square in Cambridge; and Potrero Center in San Francisco, just to name a few. I look forward to sharing further details on these as well as other exciting opportunities on future calls.
Turning to disposition activity. Demand for the properties we're selling remains steady across all markets. As a reminder, we will use disposition proceeds to fund our new investment activities. As our development and redevelopment spending ramps up through the remainder of 2017, our dispositions should as well. We are maintaining our previous guidance of $100 million to $200 million of dispositions.
In regards to acquisitions, we remain under contract for the Northeast opportunity we had mentioned in the past. This is an acquisition of exceptional ground-up development that we will close upon construction completion and anchor rent commencement. 
This opportunity may close late this year but appears more likely to close early next year. 
Lastly, we are currently evaluating several compelling acquisition opportunities located in priority target markets. And any of these opportunities would further enhance our portfolio quality and NOI growth profile.

In addition to solid operating results from our high-quality portfolio and an impressive roster of in-process developments, we made enhancements to our already sector-leading balance sheet by extending our maturity duration and lowering our overall effective interest rate.
During the quarter, we completed a successful reopening of our 10 and 30-year unsecured notes that we originally issued in January. We opportunistically raised $300 million across the 2 tranches to retire high-coupon mortgage debt, preferred stock and pay down our line of credit balance. 
While this offering was completed in the week following the news of the Amazon-Whole Foods merger, which as most of you know led to significant volatility in the equity markets, it is important to note that we experienced minimal impact to demand or pricing.
We were extremely gratified by the support shown from the fixed-income investment community for  Regency's platform and our high-quality and well-located portfolio. 
A quick note on the merger integration. The team has made exceptional progress, highlighted by our operating results, including a meaningful increase in shop space percent leased during the quarter. We are well on our way to achieving the $27 million in merger-related synergies that we originally projected.
Turning to guidance. As a result of retiring the secured mortgages, we incurred onetime costs of approximately $12 million in the second quarter. We will also expense the noncash preferred issuance charges of approximately $2.5 million in the third quarter. This is related to the redemption of those preferred securities. 
These onetime items will reduce net income and NAREIT FFO per share by approximately $0.09 for the full year, as reflected in our revised guidance. And additionally, we've revised our net interest expense guidance to reflect these transactions.
 
As Mac discussed, our disposition timing is tied to our investment spending needs, and the majority of our dispositions are now expected to occur in the second half of the year. Due to this later than originally projected timing and therefore greater-than-expected contribution to NOI from these targeted dispositions, we have increased the bottom end of our core FFO guidance range. 
And also related to investment spending, we've extended the maturity of our outstanding forward equity issuance to the end of the year, as this better aligns the timing of the forward equity with our future funding needs.
And finally, given the solid results in the quarter and year-to-date, we are reaffirming our 2017 same-property NOI guidance, as we expect this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions."

Whole Foods is doing everything we've asked them to do. They will be prepared to commence with their store once we deliver it. We're still upgrading at this point. But the shop leasing is going well. We've had a lot of demand. We're negotiated over 25,000 square feet in leases right now. So we like the progress. it's still very early, but all signs point to a successful project.

But we -- they're paying over $40 million a stores, so we don't expect them to do anything that would impair this wonderful brand that the Whole Foods has. So we don't expect it to be -- convert them to 40,000 square foot warehouse. But I'm sure, they're going to use some of the store to -- for pickup, delivery, et cetera, from an Amazon standpoint.

So we are -- we have changed sort of the mix of the project to reflect market conditions. And right now we're evaluating that, considering selling some air rights to builders who want to do townhomes, apartments or seniors or some combination of the 3, so a slightly different mix. We're probably suggesting less retail than Equity One had proposed. But we really -- we think at the end of the day this is a dynamic location with a Giant that does very well that will be part of whatever future project that we ultimately decide on. And we also think because of the underlying entitlements, we should be in a position to start that project late next year. So coming together, but we don't have at this time anymore to announce on that. I'd say let's jump to Potrero. That one is more of a longer-range project. In any event, it's going to take 3 to 5 years to entitle it, even with the great underlying entitlements that we have. We've changed architects on that project, and we're in the midst of setting all the different potentials. There's tremendous amount of density available to us, and we're not quite ready to make any announcements on that one. That's going to take longer for us to ultimately program and ultimately approve. So I would plan on something like that for 3 to 5 years from starting. Harvard Collection at Cambridge, that's more of a near-term project. It takes 3 steps to get the entitlements. We're through the first step. And now we're working on the second step, which is the planning commission. That should be in a position to start late next year as well. And that's a little more straightforward, where we know it's going to be a combination of retail and office. And we'll redevelop some of the buildings and then raze and rebuild others to create a cohesive project in a terrific location. So in [ large ] of the overall changes from the landscape environment, we're still very disciplined about the amount of shops that we propose, about the anchors that we suggest and we're only working with the best-in-class tenants. We recognize that when you bring in other uses such as multifamily it takes some time to find the right partner, and we're patient about doing that, and we want to make sure our risk-adjusted returns are appropriate. But at this point, we don't have really good guidance on those returns because we're still evaluating a lot of different possibilities."

And the operators that operate it in the grocery industry, they knew that as well. So they were -- had already -- they were already talking about it, already strategically thinking about how they can compete, how they cannot just maintain their share but also grow their share in this new ultra-competitive environment. The only thing that changed is potentially the pace of that change, and I think that they're aware of that. And when the announcement was made, there's no doubt in my mind that every grocery operator called an immediate management meeting and sat down at the table and said ""what do we need to do differently? What do we need to do faster?"" But to think that they weren't already focused on competing in the world of e-commerce, as Hap said, these are really sophisticated operators with irreplaceable platforms."

When we initially talked about it, one of the strategic benefits was an enhanced same-property NOI growth rate. It's hard to exclude redevelopments because that is a piece of it. And then on March 1, when we closed, we significantly increased our same-property NOI growth guidance for the year. And that enhanced same-property NOI growth for '17 and also for the next couple of years is coming from a variety of things. One, Equity One had just done a very good job of acquiring properties that were -- that had lease rent rolls, essentially, with leases below market. And so there was just inherent upside as leases are rolling. And we're beginning to achieve some of that. They had done a fantastic job in the very recent past of actually leasing up their shop space, but there were still room and -- as evidenced by our results this quarter. So some of it's coming from there. And then, they were great operators, but I'm a little biased, and I think we've got the best team in the business. And I think that we can apply our expertise in the field to enhancing those contractual rent steps and, again, increasing occupancy. You asked me to exclude redevelopment, but that's also a piece of it because I also believe that best team in the business applies to our ability to create value at these shopping centers. And again, the Equity One team has built a really nice portfolio of properties that essentially increased our venue of opportunities to create value. So all of that will continue to enhance our same-property NOI growth for at least the next couple of years. And then we'll get to a much more stable -- stabilized run rate."

Yesterday afternoon, we reported another quarter of solid operating results. Our high-quality portfolio of shopping centers located in affluent and dense infill trade areas continues to perform well. Leasing levels are nearly 96%, with Small Shop leasing surpassing 92%. 
These healthy fundamentals produced year-to-date same property NOI growth of 3.5% and fortify future sustainable growth. When combined with our development and redevelopment expertise, fortress  balance sheet and exceptional team, all of which were only made stronger with the integration of Equity One, we are well positioned to achieve our strategic objectives and create value for our shareholders. 
At the same time, we remain very mindful that the retail landscape continues to change, including the ongoing evolution of the grocery industry. Amazon's announced purchase of Whole Foods reinforces our conviction that a well-located bricks and mortar presence that is convenient to the customer is a critical component of the success of any omni-channel platform.
The best grocers, which anchor the vast majority of our centers, are more focused than ever on advancing their own technology, pricing and shopping experiences to service their customers and grow revenues and profits.
They benefit from extensive and irreplaceable platforms in our target markets, with average sales of over $650 per square foot and healthy occupancy costs below 2%.
We will certainly not be immune to the changes occurring in the retail business and are keenly focused on the disruptors facing us today and those that we might face in the future.
We have a proven track record of successfully navigating and even profiting from industry challenges and will continue to adapt and make decisions that will enable our retail centers to not only survive but prosper over the long term.
We are prepared to own, operate and invest in a world where the bifurcation between the winning and losing grocers and retailers will accelerate as will the growing separation between the better shopping centers and everything else.
That said, Regency's unequaled national portfolio, where the best-in-class retailers will want to locate their physical stores, disciplined capital allocation strategy and experienced and deep team position us extremely well for the future.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

The quality of our portfolio and our team is truly evident in our second quarter results.
Portfolio occupancy remains at historically high levels. Though we experienced a slight dip in overall occupancy, driven by 1 anticipated anchor move-out, our same property portfolio remains at nearly 96% leased.
What I'm especially pleased about is our shop occupancy, which jumped back above 92% and represents an impressive 30 basis point increase sequentially. 
We continue to experience steady demand for space from a wide variety of tenants across many categories, which include value retailers, fast-casual restaurants, fitness operators, pet stores and service users, among others. While retailers are being more deliberate and selective with their expansion plans, they continue to seek out the better locations, many of which are at our well-merchandised centers.
Leasing spreads on new deals in the quarter were 14%, highlighted by strong anchor spreads of 26% and shop rent spreads over 12%.
Regarding bankruptcies, our exposure to store closures remains minimal. Announced 2017 store closures represent only 20 stores in our portfolio of over 9,000 tenants. We have successfully re-leased or in lease negotiation for 95% of the anchor spaces we have received back over the past 18 months.
Our second quarter results, very limited exposure to bankruptcy since store rationalizations as well as our success in re-leasing locations that do close, collectively demonstrate the differentiation of the Regency platform and leaves us confident in our ability to produce sector-leading NOI growth and operating fundamentals.
I will now turn the call over to Mac."

Our development and redevelopment activity remains robust, as we saw compelling opportunities within our target markets and portfolio. Our in-process projects now exceed $600 million of developments and redevelopments, with expected returns of nearly 7.5%, creating significant value that will drive future growth.
During the second quarter, we started Mellody Farm, a $100 million ground-up development located within a highly affluent suburb of Chicago. The 250,000 square-foot center is anchored by strong lineup, featuring Whole Foods, REI, Nordstrom Rack and HomeGoods. Preleasing the best-in-class restaurants and service providers is off to an impressive start.
Our development team is making significant progress in several exciting redevelopment projects within the portfolio. At Costa Verde in La Jolla, California, we are progressing with our approvals to densify the shopping center to take advantage of the vibrant growth in the University Town Center. At Market Common Clarendon, located in Metro Washington, D.C, we are working well with the community towards repositioning the existing office building to attract new retail and creative office tenants that will enhance the overall center.
We also continue to make progress within our now integrated Equity One portfolio, including Westwood Shopping Center, located in Bethesda; The Collection at Harvard Square in Cambridge; and Potrero Center in San Francisco, just to name a few. I look forward to sharing further details on these as well as other exciting opportunities on future calls.
Turning to disposition activity. Demand for the properties we're selling remains steady across all markets. As a reminder, we will use disposition proceeds to fund our new investment activities. As our development and redevelopment spending ramps up through the remainder of 2017, our dispositions should as well. We are maintaining our previous guidance of $100 million to $200 million of dispositions.
In regards to acquisitions, we remain under contract for the Northeast opportunity we had mentioned in the past. This is an acquisition of exceptional ground-up development that we will close upon construction completion and anchor rent commencement. 
This opportunity may close late this year but appears more likely to close early next year. 
Lastly, we are currently evaluating several compelling acquisition opportunities located in priority target markets. And any of these opportunities would further enhance our portfolio quality and NOI growth profile.
I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa."

In addition to solid operating results from our high-quality portfolio and an impressive roster of in-process developments, we made enhancements to our already sector-leading balance sheet by extending our maturity",434,"Thank you, Mac, and good morning all. 
In addition to solid operating results from our high-quality portfolio and an impressive roster of in-process developments, we made enhancements to our already sector-leading balance sheet by extending our maturity duration and lowering our overall effective interest rate.
During the quarter, we completed a successful reopening of our 10 and 30-year unsecured notes that we originally issued in January. We opportunistically raised $300 million across the 2 tranches to retire high-coupon mortgage debt, preferred stock and pay down our line of credit balance. 
While this offering was completed in the week following the news of the Amazon-Whole Foods merger, which as most of you know led to significant volatility in the equity markets, it is important to note that we experienced minimal impact to demand or pricing.
We were extremely gratified by the support shown from the fixed-income investment community for  Regency's platform and our high-quality and well-located portfolio. 
A quick note on the merger integration. The team has made exceptional progress, highlighted by our operating results, including a meaningful increase in shop space percent leased during the quarter. We are well on our way to achieving the $27 million in merger-related synergies that we originally projected.
Turning to guidance. As a result of retiring the secured mortgages, we incurred onetime costs of approximately $12 million in the second quarter. We will also expense the noncash preferred issuance charges of approximately $2.5 million in the third quarter. This is related to the redemption of those preferred securities. 
These onetime items will reduce net income and NAREIT FFO per share by approximately $0.09 for the full year, as reflected in our revised guidance. And additionally, we've revised our net interest expense guidance to reflect these transactions.
 
As Mac discussed, our disposition timing is tied to our investment spending needs, and the majority of our dispositions are now expected to occur in the second half of the year. Due to this later than originally projected timing and therefore greater-than-expected contribution to NOI from these targeted dispositions, we have increased the bottom end of our core FFO guidance range. 
And also related to investment spending, we've extended the maturity of our outstanding forward equity issuance to the end of the year, as this better aligns the timing of the forward equity with our future funding needs.
And finally, given the solid results in the quarter and year-to-date, we are reaffirming our 2017 same-property NOI guidance, as we expect this positive momentum to continue through the remainder of the year.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we now welcome your questions."

So we are -- we have changed sort of the mix of the project to reflect market conditions. And right now we're evaluating that, considering selling some air rights to builders who want to do townhomes, apartments or seniors or some combination of the 3, so a slightly different mix. We're probably suggesting less retail than Equity One had proposed. But we really -- we think at the end of the day this is a dynamic location with a Giant that does very well that will be part of whatever future project that we ultimately decide on. And we also think because of the underlying entitlements, we should be in a position to start that project late next year. So coming together, but we don't have at this time anymore to announce on that. I'd say let's jump to Potrero. That one is more of a longer-range project. In any event, it's going to take 3 to 5 years to entitle it, even with the great underlying entitlements that we have. We've changed architects on that project, and we're in the midst of setting all the different potentials. There's tremendous amount of density available to us, and we're not quite ready to make any announcements on that one. That's going to take longer for us to ultimately program and ultimately approve. So I would plan on something like that for 3 to 5 years from starting. Harvard Collection at Cambridge, that's more of a near-term project. It takes 3 steps to get the entitlements. We're through the first step. And now we're working on the second step, which is the planning commission. That should be in a position to start late next year as well. And that's a little more straightforward, where we know it's going to be a combination of retail and office. And we'll redevelop some of the buildings and then raze and rebuild others to create a cohesive project in a terrific location. So in [ large ] of the overall changes from the landscape environment, we're still very disciplined about the amount of shops that we propose, about the anchors that we suggest and we're only working with the best-in-class tenants.

The only thing that changed is potentially the pace of that change, and I think that they're aware of that.

When we initially talked about it, one of the strategic benefits was an enhanced same-property NOI growth rate. It's hard to exclude redevelopments because that is a piece of it. And then on March 1, when we closed, we significantly increased our same-property NOI growth guidance for the year. And that enhanced same-property NOI growth for '17 and also for the next couple of years is coming from a variety of things. One, Equity One had just done a very good job of acquiring properties that were -- that had lease rent rolls, essentially, with leases below market. And so there was just inherent upside as leases are rolling. And we're beginning to achieve some of that. They had done a fantastic job in the very recent past of actually leasing up their shop space, but there were still room and -- as evidenced by our results this quarter. So some of it's coming from there. And then, they were great operators, but I'm a little biased, and I think we've got the best team in the business. And I think that we can apply our expertise in the field to enhancing those contractual rent steps and, again, increasing occupancy. You asked me to exclude redevelopment, but that's also a piece of it because I also believe that best team in the business applies to our ability to create value at these shopping centers. And again, the Equity One team has built a really nice portfolio of properties that essentially increased our venue of opportunities to create value. So all of that will continue to enhance our same-property NOI growth for at least the next couple of years. And then we'll get to a much more stable -- stabilized run rate."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are gratified to see that even with about challenging retail environment, Regency's portfolio continues to perform well with leasing levels over 96% and year-to-date same property NOI growth of 4%. Evidence that Regency’s well merchandised shopping centers located in trade areas with substantial buying power are positioned to attract better retailers, which are actively and selectively expanding their bricks-and-mortar footprint. 
In the ever-changing world of retail, it remains apparent that a well located in physical presence will continue to be critical to efficiently service customers. Following the close of Amazon's acquisitions of Whole Foods, Whole Foods reengaged and actively expanding, again. We believe this is a validation by the world's preeminent online platform that bricks-and-mortar is a critical component to a retailer success. And winning grocers, retailers, restaurants and service providers want to be located with other better operators in centers conveniently located in neighborhood and communities with strong purchasing power. 
While certainly not immune to accelerated store closures and that deliberate tenants are expanding, we remain extremely confident in Regency's ability to sustain growth in same property NOI, earnings, NAV and shareholder value at or near the top of our peer group as we benefit from the following. 
First, owning a high-quality portfolio, distinguished by trade areas with superior demographics and barriers to entry, highly productive groceries with average sales of $650 per square foot, relevant merchandising and place making and the necessity service convenience and value focus. 
Second, a conservative balance sheet that will be critically important -- will be critically important advantage in either allowing us to profit from compelling investment opportunities or endure challenging economic and financial conditions. And most important of all, Regency's exceptional and team guided by our special culture, coupled with our value add asset management development and redevelopment capabilities. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to let you know fortunate we are that of our properties and especially our people had relatively well in hurricanes Harvey and Irma and how much we appreciate their extraordinary efforts that enabled us to keep operating and to recover so quickly.

As Hap indicated, in spite of slower quarters that are garnering headlines and more deliberate pace new store openings, our portfolio continues to perform well as retailer demand for top-quality space remains healthy. 
In the third quarter, same property percent leased increased 20 basis points sequentially to 96.1%. And majority of this growth came from shop tenants where we experienced a 40 basis points increase in occupancy at 92.5% leased. New rents during the quarter were over 17% and we continue to have great success negotiating embedded in our new leasing transactions. Almost all new shop leases include annual rent steps averaging 2.5%. 
Tenant improvements and landlord work, as a percentage of average rent, continue to be in line with prior years. While move outs remains at historically low levels, we are certainly aware of the potential for future store closures and are monitoring tenant performance and health. 
As you know, we've been in a heightened retail bankruptcy environment for nearly 3 years. During this time, Regency's portfolio has continue to outperform posting same property NOI growth in excess of 3.5% with occupancy levels exceeding 96%. 
Our exposure to tenant bankruptcies and store closures has been minimal and have been we have received a spaces back, we've had success in pre-leasing to better operators at higher rents. We've leased or our in lease negotiation for nearly all of the spaces return to us following bankruptcy over the past 2 years. 
This year alone, out of our 9,000 plus tenants, we have only 21 store closures expected from While we're closely monitoring plans and have ongoing communication with our top retailers, our track record demonstrates the portfolio's ability to withstand and succeed in this ever evolving and challenging retail environment.

We continue to make excellent progress on developments and redevelopments, which are growing NOI and NAV and enhancing the quality of our portfolio and our in-process projects are performing well and attracting strong retailer demand as evidenced by gains and persons leased. 
For example, the diligent Tustin legacy in Organce County is 97% leased and committed. The majority of our tenants are now open both of which reported strong brand openings. In addition, our 2 projects in Northeast as well as our project in Metro DC are approaching 90% leased and committed. And at Serramonte Center in the Bay Area, our 250,000 square-foot expansion is substantially complete. All 6 of our opened, traffic is up and the overall center is performing well. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we started Midtown East, a anchored ground-up development in the affluent Midtown neighborhood of Riley. Midtown East will be first store in the state of North Carolina. 
Regency’s first class team continues to source compelling development opportunities and mine potential redevelopments as starts were in line with expectations. Although, the development landscape remains challenging, our industry-leading platform is well positioned to create value for both new development as well as redevelopment opportunities within our portfolio. We look forward to discussing future development and redevelopment opportunities in more detail at our Investor Day. 
Moving to dispositions that acquisitions, we are executing on our plan to sell 1% to 2% of our assets annually. Through October, we have closed approximately $45 million of properties and anticipate closing or an additional $180 million by only 2018. 
Looking back, we've been very successful implementing capital recycling to further enhance the quality of our portfolio by supplementing cash flow to fund the development and the development and are investing into attractive acquisition opportunities, offering superior future growth. This recycling has resulted in a fortified NOI growth with greater long-term value creation and reduced exposure to disruptors, as evidenced by the minimal impacts we've experienced from tenant bankruptcies. 
We plan to continue to execute on our capital recycling initiatives on the basis that mitigates and the impact from the embedded tax gains associated with our dispositions. 
On the acquisition front, valuations pricing are strong from the quality centers we own, develop and buy. As you can see from our increased to guidance, we have recently source compelling opportunities that meet our high standards for quality and growth and will match the timing of our targeted dispositions. 
The centers, which are at various stages of due diligence are located in our target markets of Seattle, San Diego and New York, all benefit from strong demographics, productive anchors and best-in-class shop tenants. 
These investments, along with the Northeast opportunity, we have mentioned in the past, our valued at approximately $225 million with anticipated closing dates spread over the next several months. I look forward to sharing more details on these premier centers in subsequent quarters after we have closed.

And I also want to reiterate our thanks to the team for their amazing efforts following the hurricanes. 
In the third quarter, we did take a one-time charge of approximately $1.9 million or $0.01 per share related to repair and cleanup work caused by these wickets. Consistent with the practice for nearly 10 years, gains and losses in our captive insurance program has been excluded from same property NOI. Therefore, the charges incurred this quarter are excluded from same property NOI and given the non-comparable nature of events, the charges also added back to core FFO. 
Turning to 2017 guidance. We are maintaining our same property NOI growth of 3.2% to 4% for the full year. The lower growth rate in the fourth quarter is driven by an anticipated decline in percentage rent driven by handful of minutes as well as and bad debt expense comps. Although we have experienced a moderate increase in bad debt expense year-to-date, it's important to remember that 2016 levels were far below historical norms and current projections our border in line with long-term averages. 
We've also decreased our net G&A guidance for the full year by approximately $4 million at the midpoint. With the merger, we plan to hire 70 new positions, but these additions took a little bit longer to fill than initially expected. We have now filled this position send expect next year's net G&A to be in the $67 million range. Despite this delay in hiring, the merger integration has progressed extremely well, and at $67 million of net G&A in 2018, we will realize the $27 million in synergies. 
Lastly, we have raised our full year NAREIT FFO and core FFO guidance, reflecting the later timing of our dispositions this year and the lower than expected net G&A expense.

We are gratified to see that even with the more challenging retail environment, Regency's portfolio continues to perform well with leasing levels over 96% and year-to-date same property",364,"Thanks, Laura. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are gratified to see that even with the more challenging retail environment, Regency's portfolio continues to perform well with leasing levels over 96% and year-to-date same property NOI growth of 4%, evidence that Regency’s well-merchandised shopping centers, located in trade areas with substantial buying power, are positioned to attract better retailers, which are actively and selectively expanding their bricks-and-mortar footprint. In the ever-changing world of retail, it remains apparent that a well-located physical presence will continue to be critical to efficiently service customers. 
Following the close of Amazon's acquisitions of Whole Foods, Whole Foods is reengaged and actively expanding, again. We believe this is a validation by the world's preeminent online platform that bricks-and-mortar is a critical component to a retailer success. And winning grocers, retailers, restaurants and service providers want to be located with other better operators in centers conveniently located in neighborhood and communities with strong purchasing power. 
While certainly not immune to accelerated store closures, in a more deliberate manner, tenants are expanding. We remain extremely confident in Regency's ability to sustain growth in same property NOI, earnings, NAV and shareholder value at or near the top of our peer group as we benefit from the following: First, owning a high-quality portfolio distinguished by trade areas with superior demographics and barriers to entry, highly productive grocers with average sales of $650 per square foot, relevant merchandising and placemaking, and a necessity service convenience and value focus. 
Second, a conservative balance sheet that will be critically important -- will be a critically important advantage in either allowing us to profit from compelling investment opportunities or endure challenging economic and financial conditions. And most important of all, Regency's exceptional and deep team, guided by our special culture, coupled with our value add asset management development and redevelopment capabilities.

As Hap indicated, in spite of store closures that are garnering headlines and a more deliberate pace new store openings, our portfolio continues to perform well as retailer demand for top-quality space remains healthy. 
In the third quarter, same property percent leased increased 20 basis points sequentially to 96.1%. The majority of this growth came from shop tenants where we experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy and at 92.5% leased. New rent spreads during the quarter were over 17% and we continue to have great success negotiating embedded rent steps in our new leasing transactions. Almost all new shop leases include annual rent steps averaging 2.5%. 
Tenant improvements and landlord work, as a percentage of average rent, continued to be in line with prior years. While move-outs remains at historic low levels, we are certainly aware of the potential for future store closures and are monitoring tenant performance and health. 
As you know, we've been in a heightened retail bankruptcy environment for nearly 3 years. During this time, Regency's portfolio has continued to outperform posting same property NOI growth in excess of 3.5% with occupancy levels exceeding 96%. Our exposure to tenant bankruptcies and store closures has been minimal. And when we have received spaces back, we've had success in re-leasing to better operators at higher rents. We have leased or are in lease negotiation for nearly all of the spaces returned to us, following bankruptcy over the past 2 years. 
This year alone, out of our 9,000-plus tenants, we have only 21 store closures expected from [ BK ]. While we're closely monitoring trends and have ongoing communication with our top retailers, our track record demonstrates the portfolio's ability to withstand and succeed in this ever-evolving and challenging retail environment.

We continue to make excellent progress on developments and redevelopments, which were growing NOI and NAV and enhancing the quality of our portfolio.

We continue to make excellent progress on developments and redevelopments, which were growing NOI and NAV and enhancing the quality of our portfolio. Our in-process projects are performing well and attracting strong retailer demand as evidenced by gains and percent leased. 
For example, The Village at Tustin Legacy in Orange County is 97% leased and committed. The majority of our tenants are now open including Starter Bros. and CVS, both of which reported strong brand openings. In addition, our 2 Whole Foods projects in the Northeast as well as our Wegmans project in Metro DC are approaching 90% leased and committed. And at Serramonte Center in the Bay Area, our 250,000 square foot expansion is substantially complete. 
All 6 of our new junior anchors have opened, traffic is up and the overall center is performing well. Subsequent to quarter end, we started Midtown East, a Wegmans' anchored ground-up development in the affluent Midtown neighborhood of Raleigh. Midtown East will be Wegmans first store in the state of North Carolina. 
Regency’s first-class team continues to source compelling development opportunities and mine potential redevelopments, as starts were in line with expectations. Although the development landscape remains challenging, our industry-leading platform is well positioned to create value for both new development as well as redevelopment opportunities within our portfolio. We look forward to discussing future development and redevelopment opportunities in more detail at our Investor Day. 
Moving to dispositions and acquisitions. We are executing on our plan to sell 1% to 2% of our assets annually. Through October, we have closed approximately $45 million of properties and anticipate closing on an additional $180 million by only 2018. Looking back, we have been very successful implementing capital recycling to further enhance the quality of our portfolio by supplementing cash flow to fund the development and redevelopment, and reinvesting into attractive acquisition opportunities offering superior future growth. 
This recycling has resulted in a fortified NOI growth profile with greater long-term value creation and reduced exposure to disruptors, as evidenced by the minimal impacts we have experienced from tenant bankruptcies. We plan to continue to execute on our capital recycling initiatives on a basis that mitigates earnings dilution and the impact from the embedded tax gains associated with our dispositions. 
On the acquisition front, valuations pricing are strong from the quality centers we own, develop and buy. As you can see from our increased to guidance, we have recently sourced compelling opportunities that meet our high standards for quality and growth, and will match the timing of our targeted dispositions. The centers, which are in various stages of due diligence, are located in our target markets of Seattle, San Diego and New York, all benefit from strong demographics, productive anchors and best-in-class shop tenants. 
These investments, along with the Northeast opportunity we have mentioned in the past, our valued at approximately $225 million with anticipated closing dates spread over the next several months. I look forward to sharing more details on these premier centers in subsequent quarters after we have closed.

And most importantly, I want to echo Hap's comments, we are so grateful that our team members are safe following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and that our property sustained minimal damage. And I also want to reiterate our thanks to the team for their amazing efforts following the hurricanes. 
In the third quarter, we did take a onetime charge of approximately $1.9 million or $0.01 per share related to repair and cleanup work caused by these hurricanes. Consistent with our practice for nearly 10 years, gains and losses in our captive insurance program have been excluded from same property NOI. Therefore, the charges incurred this quarter are excluded from same property NOI and given the non-comparable nature of events, the charges also added back to core FFO. 
Turning to 2017 guidance. We are maintaining our same property NOI growth of 3.2% to 4% for the full year. The lower growth rate in the fourth quarter is driven by an anticipated decline in percentage rent, driven by a handful of tenants, as well as the tough other income and bad debt expense comp. Although we have experienced a moderate increase in bad debt expense year-to-date, it's important to remember that 2016 levels were far below historical norms and current projections are more in line with long-term averages. 
We have also decreased our net G&A guidance for the full year by approximately $4 million at the midpoint. With the merger, we plan to hire 70 new positions, but these additions took just a little bit longer to fill than initially expected. We have now filled these positions and expect next year's net G&A to be in the $67 million range. Despite this delay in hiring, the merger integration has progressed extremely well. And at $67 million of net G&A in 2018, we will realize the $27 million in synergies. 
Lastly, we have raised our full year NAREIT FFO and core FFO guidance, reflecting the later timing of our dispositions this year and the lower-than-expected net G&A expense. 
This concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions."

But just from a general perspective, if you think about -- when we look at our same property NOI growth, an important thing that we can see, which you all can see, is that our base rank growth contribution to that in the first half of the year was in the mid-3s and that's accelerating in the back of the year to the high 3s. And some of that is driven by these anchor rent commencements. So I mean, I think, that that's one of the key factors. And from the capitals, we're seeing really healthy net effective rent growth.

I'll reiterate what -- how I started with my answer to Christy or to Katy in that our base rent growth is actually accelerating throughout the year, so the same property NOI growth moderation that we're seeing is some noise in some of the other line items. We're up against tough comps for other income as well as bad debt expense, and we're expecting a decline in percentage rent. And some of that -- once translated and transitioned the base rents, so that is driving some of that base rent growth, but we'll take base rent growth -- we'll take base rent over percentage rent any day.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are gratified to see that even with a more challenging retail environment, Regency's portfolio continues to perform well with leasing levels over 96% and year-to-date same property NOI growth of 4%, evidence that Regency’s well-merchandised shopping centers, located in trade areas with substantial buying power, are positioned to attract better retailers, which are actively but selectively expanding their bricks-and-mortar footprint. In the ever-changing world of retail, it remains apparent that a well-located physical presence will continue to be critical to efficiently service customers. 
Following the close of Amazon's acquisitions of Whole Foods, Whole Foods is reengaged and actively expanding, again. We believe this is a validation by the world's preeminent online platform that bricks-and-mortar is a critical component to a retailer's success. The winning grocers, retailers, restaurants and service providers want to be located with other better operators in centers conveniently located in neighborhood and communities with strong purchasing power. 
While certainly not immune to accelerated store closures and the more deliberate manner tenants are expanding. We remain extremely confident in Regency's ability to sustain growth in same property NOI, earnings, NAV and shareholder value at or near the top of our peer group as we benefit from the following: First, owning a high-quality portfolio distinguished by trade areas with superior demographics and barriers to entry, highly productive grocers with average sales of $650 per square foot, relevant merchandising and place-making, and a necessity, service, convenience and value focus. 
Second, a conservative balance sheet that will be critically important -- will be a critically important advantage in either allowing us to profit from compelling investment opportunities or endure challenging economic and financial conditions. And most important of all, Regency's exceptional and deep team, guided by our special culture, coupled with our value-add asset management, development and redevelopment capabilities. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to let you know how fortunate we are that our properties and, especially, our people fared relatively well in Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and how much we appreciate their extraordinary efforts that enabled us to keep operating and to recover so quickly. 
Jim?"

As Hap indicated, in spite of store closures that are garnering headlines and a more deliberate pace of new store openings, our portfolio continues to perform well as retailer demand for top-quality space remains healthy. 
In the third quarter, same property percent leased increased 20 basis points sequentially to 96.1%. The majority of this growth came from shop tenants where we experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy and are 92.5% leased. New rent spreads during the quarter were over 17% and we continue to have great success negotiating embedded rent steps in our new leasing transactions. Almost all new shop leases include annual rent steps averaging 2.5%. 
Tenant improvements and landlord work, as a percent of average rent, continued to be in line with prior years. While move-outs remains at historic low levels, we are certainly aware of the potential for future store closures and are monitoring tenant performance and health. 
As you know, we've been in a heightened retail bankruptcy environment for nearly 3 years. During this time, Regency's portfolio has continued to outperform, posting same property NOI growth in excess of 3.5% with occupancy levels exceeding 96%. Our exposure to tenant bankruptcies and store closures has been minimal. And when we have received spaces back, we've had success in re-leasing to better operators at higher rents. We have leased or are in lease negotiation for nearly all of the spaces returned to us, following bankruptcy over the past 2 years. 
This year alone, out of our 9,000-plus tenants, we have only 21 store closures expected from [ BK ]. While we're closely monitoring trends and have ongoing communication with our top retailers, our track record demonstrates the portfolio's ability to withstand and succeed in this ever-evolving and challenging retail environment.

We continue to make excellent progress on developments and redevelopments, which are growing NOI and NAV and enhancing the quality of our portfolio. Our in-process projects are performing well and attracting strong retailer demand",515,"Good morning, everyone. We continue to make excellent progress on developments and redevelopments, which are growing NOI and NAV and enhancing the quality of our portfolio. Our in-process projects are performing well and attracting strong retailer demand as evidenced by gains and percent leased. 
For example, The Village at Tustin Legacy in Orange County is 97% leased and committed. The majority of our tenants are now open including Starter Bros. and CVS, both of which reported strong grand openings. In addition, our 2 Whole Foods projects in the Northeast, as well as our Wegmans project in Metro DC, are approaching 90% leased and committed. And at Serramonte Center in the Bay Area, our 250,000 square foot expansion is substantially complete. 
All 6 of our new junior anchors have opened, traffic is up and the overall center is performing well. Subsequent to quarter end, we started Midtown East, a Wegmans' anchored ground-up development in the affluent Midtown neighborhood of Raleigh. Midtown East will be Wegmans first store in the state of North Carolina. 
Regency’s first-class team continues to source compelling development opportunities and mine potential redevelopments, as starts were in line with expectations. Although the development landscape remains challenging, our industry-leading platform is well positioned to create value from both new development as well as redevelopment opportunities within our portfolio. We look forward to discussing future development and redevelopment opportunities in more detail at our Investor Day. 
Moving to dispositions and acquisitions. We are executing on our plan to sell 1% to 2% of our assets annually. Through October, we have closed approximately $45 million of properties and anticipate closing on an additional $180 million by early 2018. Looking back, we have been very successful implementing capital recycling to further enhance the quality of our portfolio by supplementing cash flow to fund development and redevelopment and reinvesting into attractive acquisition opportunities offering superior future growth. 
This recycling has resulted in a fortified NOI growth profile with greater long-term value creation and reduced exposure to disruptors, as evidenced by the minimal impacts we have experienced from tenant bankruptcies. We plan to continue to execute on our capital recycling initiatives on a basis that mitigates earnings dilution and the impact from the embedded tax gains associated with our dispositions. 
On the acquisition front, valuations pricing are strong for the quality centers we own, develop and buy. As you can see from our increased guidance, we have recently sourced compelling opportunities that meet our high standards for quality and growth and will match the timing of our targeted dispositions. The centers, which are in various stages of due diligence, are located in our target markets of Seattle, San Diego and New York, all benefit from strong demographics, productive anchors and best-in-class shop tenants. 
These investments, along with the Northeast opportunity we have mentioned in the past, are valued at approximately $225 million with anticipated closing dates spread over the next several months. I look forward to sharing more details on these premier centers in subsequent quarters after we have closed. 
I will now turn the call over to Lisa."

And",356,"Thank you, Mac. The team posted another really good quarter. And most importantly, I want to echo Hap's comments, we are so grateful that our team members are safe following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and that our properties sustained minimal damage. And I also want to reiterate our thanks to the team for their amazing efforts following the hurricanes. 
In the third quarter, we did take a onetime charge of approximately $1.9 million or $0.01 per share related to repair and cleanup work caused by these hurricanes. Consistent with our practice for nearly 10 years, gains and losses in our captive insurance program have been excluded from same property NOI. Therefore, the charges incurred this quarter are excluded from same property NOI and given the non-comparable nature of events, the charges also added back to core FFO. 
Turning to 2017 guidance. We are maintaining our same property NOI growth of 3.2% to 4% for the full year. The lower growth rate in the fourth quarter is driven by an anticipated decline in percentage rent, driven by a handful of tenants, as well as a tough other income and bad debt expense comp. Although we have experienced a moderate increase in bad debt expense year-to-date, it's important to remember that 2016 levels were far below historical norms and current projections are more in line with the long-term averages. 
We have also decreased our net G&A guidance for the full year by approximately $4 million at the midpoint. With the merger, we planned to hire 70 new positions, but these additions took just a little bit longer to fill than initially expected. We have now filled these positions and expect next year's net G&A to be in the $67 million range. Despite this delayed hiring, the merger integration has progressed extremely well. And at $67 million of net G&A in 2018, we will realize the $27 million in synergies. 
Lastly, we have raised our full year NAREIT FFO and core FFO guidance, reflecting the later timing of our dispositions this year and the lower-than-expected net G&A expense. 
This concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are gratified to see that even with a more challenging retail environment, Regency's portfolio continues to perform well with leasing levels over 96% and year-to-date same property NOI growth of 4%, evidence that Regency’s well-merchandised shopping centers, located in trade areas with substantial buying power, are positioned to attract better retailers, which are actively but selectively expanding their bricks-and-mortar footprint. In the ever-changing world of retail, it remains apparent that a well-located physical presence will continue to be critical to efficiently service customers. 
Following the close of Amazon's acquisitions of Whole Foods, Whole Foods is reengaged and actively expanding, again. We believe this is a validation by the world's preeminent online platform that bricks-and-mortar is a critical component to a retailer's success. The winning grocers, retailers, restaurants and service providers want to be located with other better operators in centers conveniently located in neighborhood and communities with strong purchasing power. 
While certainly not immune to accelerated store closures and the more deliberate manner tenants are expanding. We remain extremely confident in Regency's ability to sustain growth in same property NOI, earnings, NAV and shareholder value at or near the top of our peer group as we benefit from the following: First, owning a high-quality portfolio distinguished by trade areas with superior demographics and barriers to entry, highly productive grocers with average sales of $650 per square foot, relevant merchandising and place-making, and a necessity, service, convenience and value focus. 
Second, a conservative balance sheet that will be critically important -- will be a critically important advantage in either allowing us to profit from compelling investment opportunities or endure challenging economic and financial conditions. And most important of all, Regency's exceptional and deep team, guided by our special culture, coupled with our value-add asset management, development and redevelopment capabilities. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to let you know how fortunate we are that our properties and, especially, our people fared relatively well in Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and how much we appreciate their extraordinary efforts that enabled us to keep operating and to recover so quickly.

As Hap indicated, in spite of store closures that are garnering headlines and a more deliberate pace of new store openings, our portfolio continues to perform well as retailer demand for top-quality space remains healthy. 
In the third quarter, same property percent leased increased 20 basis points sequentially to 96.1%. The majority of this growth came from shop tenants where we experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy and are 92.5% leased. New rent spreads during the quarter were over 17% and we continue to have great success negotiating embedded rent steps in our new leasing transactions. Almost all new shop leases include annual rent steps averaging 2.5%. 
Tenant improvements and landlord work, as a percent of average rent, continued to be in line with prior years. While move-outs remains at historic low levels, we are certainly aware of the potential for future store closures and are monitoring tenant performance and health. 
As you know, we've been in a heightened retail bankruptcy environment for nearly 3 years. During this time, Regency's portfolio has continued to outperform, posting same property NOI growth in excess of 3.5% with occupancy levels exceeding 96%. Our exposure to tenant bankruptcies and store closures has been minimal. And when we have received spaces back, we've had success in re-leasing to better operators at higher rents. We have leased or are in lease negotiation for nearly all of the spaces returned to us, following bankruptcy over the past 2 years. 
This year alone, out of our 9,000-plus tenants, we have only 21 store closures expected from [ BK ]. While we're closely monitoring trends and have ongoing communication with our top retailers, our track record demonstrates the portfolio's ability to withstand and succeed in this ever-evolving and challenging retail environment.

We continue to make excellent progress on developments and redevelopments, which are growing NOI and NAV and enhancing the quality of our portfolio. Our in-process projects are performing well and attracting strong retailer demand",515,"Good morning, everyone. We continue to make excellent progress on developments and redevelopments, which are growing NOI and NAV and enhancing the quality of our portfolio. Our in-process projects are performing well and attracting strong retailer demand as evidenced by gains and percent leased. 
For example, The Village at Tustin Legacy in Orange County is 97% leased and committed. The majority of our tenants are now open including Starter Bros. and CVS, both of which reported strong grand openings. In addition, our 2 Whole Foods projects in the Northeast, as well as our Wegmans project in Metro DC, are approaching 90% leased and committed. And at Serramonte Center in the Bay Area, our 250,000 square foot expansion is substantially complete. 
All 6 of our new junior anchors have opened, traffic is up and the overall center is performing well. Subsequent to quarter end, we started Midtown East, a Wegmans' anchored ground-up development in the affluent Midtown neighborhood of Raleigh. Midtown East will be Wegmans first store in the state of North Carolina. 
Regency’s first-class team continues to source compelling development opportunities and mine potential redevelopments, as starts were in line with expectations. Although the development landscape remains challenging, our industry-leading platform is well positioned to create value from both new development as well as redevelopment opportunities within our portfolio. We look forward to discussing future development and redevelopment opportunities in more detail at our Investor Day. 
Moving to dispositions and acquisitions. We are executing on our plan to sell 1% to 2% of our assets annually. Through October, we have closed approximately $45 million of properties and anticipate closing on an additional $180 million by early 2018. Looking back, we have been very successful implementing capital recycling to further enhance the quality of our portfolio by supplementing cash flow to fund development and redevelopment and reinvesting into attractive acquisition opportunities offering superior future growth. 
This recycling has resulted in a fortified NOI growth profile with greater long-term value creation and reduced exposure to disruptors, as evidenced by the minimal impacts we have experienced from tenant bankruptcies. We plan to continue to execute on our capital recycling initiatives on a basis that mitigates earnings dilution and the impact from the embedded tax gains associated with our dispositions. 
On the acquisition front, valuations pricing are strong for the quality centers we own, develop and buy. As you can see from our increased guidance, we have recently sourced compelling opportunities that meet our high standards for quality and growth and will match the timing of our targeted dispositions. The centers, which are in various stages of due diligence, are located in our target markets of Seattle, San Diego and New York, all benefit from strong demographics, productive anchors and best-in-class shop tenants. 
These investments, along with the Northeast opportunity we have mentioned in the past, are valued at approximately $225 million with anticipated closing dates spread over the next several months.

And most importantly, I want to echo Hap's comments, we are so grateful that our team members are safe following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and that our properties sustained minimal damage. And",356,"Thank you, Mac. The team posted another really good quarter. And most importantly, I want to echo Hap's comments, we are so grateful that our team members are safe following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and that our properties sustained minimal damage. And I also want to reiterate our thanks to the team for their amazing efforts following the hurricanes. 
In the third quarter, we did take a onetime charge of approximately $1.9 million or $0.01 per share related to repair and cleanup work caused by these hurricanes. Consistent with our practice for nearly 10 years, gains and losses in our captive insurance program have been excluded from same property NOI. Therefore, the charges incurred this quarter are excluded from same property NOI and given the non-comparable nature of events, the charges also added back to core FFO. 
Turning to 2017 guidance. We are maintaining our same property NOI growth of 3.2% to 4% for the full year. The lower growth rate in the fourth quarter is driven by an anticipated decline in percentage rent, driven by a handful of tenants, as well as a tough other income and bad debt expense comp. Although we have experienced a moderate increase in bad debt expense year-to-date, it's important to remember that 2016 levels were far below historical norms and current projections are more in line with the long-term averages. 
We have also decreased our net G&A guidance for the full year by approximately $4 million at the midpoint. With the merger, we planned to hire 70 new positions, but these additions took just a little bit longer to fill than initially expected. We have now filled these positions and expect next year's net G&A to be in the $67 million range. Despite this delayed hiring, the merger integration has progressed extremely well. And at $67 million of net G&A in 2018, we will realize the $27 million in synergies. 
Lastly, we have raised our full year NAREIT FFO and core FFO guidance, reflecting the later timing of our dispositions this year and the lower-than-expected net G&A expense. 
This concludes our prepared remarks and we now welcome your questions."

Some of these -- 4 out of the 5 of the acquisitions that we're targeting were off-market, as Hap said. So we've sourced these directly and we think that's a real competitive advantage."

I don't want to take any of our material that we plan to share at Investor Day. But we have done a lot of work for what we call our DNA project and would be very similar to what one house on the street has a [ TAP ] score. And we think that it's, as Hap mentioned and Mac both mentioned, it's really important the quality of the center and then that has to actually interact with the quality of the market. And we do have internal guidelines and thresholds and return thresholds related to those scores, if you will.
So we do look at it that way and we will share more detail when we have our Investor Day in January."

It's pretty early and they're not -- they play their cards very close to the vest by design, so we don't have a lot of great color to give you. What I can tell you is we've been working on a redevelopment in suburban Virginia, very good quality location. They've affirmed that lease. They've had time to think about it. They recently stepped up to it. So we're seeing good positive signs about that, a lot of good body language, but you're not going to get a lot of details at this point. But we have close relationships with them and their teams and their brokers throughout the markets, and they are engaged. So we're working on future opportunities, but still too early to say if their format is going to change dramatically. We hear lots of little things, but we haven't actually seen anything physically."
