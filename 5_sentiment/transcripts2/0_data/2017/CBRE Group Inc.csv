CBRE recorded double-digit adjusted earnings growth for the fourth quarter and the year with excellent performance in all 3 regional services businesses. These results are particularly noteworthy in a year of generally softer market-wide property sales volumes, virtually no carried interest income and tepid global economic growth. We set new records for the company in 2016 with more than $13 billion of revenue and nearly $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Credit for this belongs to our more than 75,000 professionals around the globe, who are deeply committed to producing great outcomes for our clients day in and day out.
In addition to achieving record financial performance, very importantly, we continued to advance our strategy. This strategy centers around delivering exceptional outcomes to our clients. Our people and the operating platform that supports them are the key elements to delivering these outcomes. Both advanced materially in 2016, and the impact is showing up on our results. CBRE is in a stronger competitive position than ever.
A good example of the strategic gains we made in 2016 is the work we did integrating the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, one of the largest and quite possibly, the most complex in the history of our sector. This effort involved massive client-facing line of business and back-office transformations. The result of having largely completed this very challenging work is that our occupier outsourcing business is much larger, much more capable of producing strong client outcomes and well positioned for strong, long-term growth. We now serve clients with employees on the ground in over 100 countries. We remain riveted on sustaining our progress with particular focus on areas such as technology and data analytics, where we can capitalize on the expertise and vast amounts of information we possess. For example, last month, we acquired Floored, a leading Software-as-a-Service platform that produces scalable interactive 3D visualization technologies for commercial real estate. Clients should expect continued visible advancements from us in the technology area.
Now Jim will take you through our financial results in detail."
4204816,415953374,1129460,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2017",2017-02-10,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE had very strong performance in 2016. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, we achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 for the company overall and for each of our regional service",1883,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE had very strong performance in 2016. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, we achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 for the company overall and for each of our regional services businesses. Second, our 17.9% margin of adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue exceeded the 17% target we established at the beginning of the year. This is especially noteworthy given the inclusion in 2016 of a full year contractual fee revenue from our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. Third, in 2016, we achieved a 17.8% return on invested capital.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a more detailed look at our full year results. In 2016, revenue rose 20% to $13.1 billion. Fee revenue increased 13% to $8.7 billion. Organic fee revenue growth was 5% in local currency, excluding contributions from all acquisitions. This is noteworthy in a year where sales and leasing volumes in the overall market declined. Adjusted EBITDA rose 10% to $1.6 billion or 13%, excluding the impact of currency movement and hedging. Adjusted EPS was up 12% to $2.30 a share or up 15%, excluding the impact of currency movement and hedging.
Full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion excludes $78.5 million for the cost-elimination program that ended in Q3 2016 and $125.7 million of integration costs related to the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, including $52.2 million that occurred in Q4. The benefits of our cost-elimination program will be evident when we review our fourth quarter margins.
Regarding integration costs, prior to year-end, we separated most of the legacy back-office support from the prior owner of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. We anticipate being completely separated from all such support over the next few months and ending integration-related adjustments to EBITDA from this acquisition by second quarter of 2017. To reiterate, the only material adjustment to EBITDA in Q4 was for the integration of our large acquisition, and this charge will end in Q2.
Please turn to Slide 7. We continue to take a prudent approach to both recruiting and M&A activity. For 2016, we added hundreds of producers globally, net of departures, but our overall recruitment level was down from the past few years. We have remained disciplined in underwriting recruitment opportunities at a time when we view some competitors as offering uneconomic terms. Similarly, we invested in only 4 infill M&A deals in 2016. As we have said on prior calls, valuations in the market deviated from our underwriting standards over the past several quarters. We continue to have a robust M&A pipeline but are willing to step aside when terms do not meet our standards.
We continue to invest in technology and data analytics. As Bob noted, we made another acquisition in this space just last month. In addition, we invest -- continue to invest in internal data and technology initiatives that will help our people deliver value for our clients.
Our balance sheet remains highly flexible. We have no required debt repayments until 2019. We ended 2016 with more than $3.5 billion of available liquidity, including nearly $700 million of cash and $2.8 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolver credit facility. At year-end, net debt was 1.2x adjusted EBITDA.
Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at full year revenue growth by line of business. Occupier outsourcing revenue rose 55% in local currency to $6.1 billion, while fee revenue increased 62% in local currency to $2.3 billion. The growth rate was 14% for both revenue and fee revenue without contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing revenue reached $2.7 billion, up 7% in local currency. Our capital markets business, property sales and mortgage services totaled $2.3 billion in revenue, reflecting 5% growth in local currency. Our business mix continued to shift towards more recurring revenue, with contractual fee revenue comprising approximately 42% of total fee revenue for the company, up from 37% in 2015.
Now please turn to Slide 9 as we shift our focus from full year to Q4 financial results. All references for the remainder of this presentation are in local currency, unless stated otherwise, and references to currency movement include the impact, if any, from hedging.
Fee revenue in Q4 increased 6% to $2.7 billion. Organic growth in fee revenue was 5%, comprising the vast majority of our growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter rose 10% to $568 million or 13% without the impact of all currency movements. This increase is notable coming on top of 26% growth in Q4 of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4% on fee revenue improved 110 basis points from Q4 2015. Adjusted earnings per share in U.S. dollars increased 15% to $0.93 for the quarter on top of 19% growth in Q4 2015. In addition, currency movement, including hedges, had a negative impact of $15.8 million to adjusted EBITDA and $0.03 to adjusted earnings per share when comparing current quarter results with Q4 2015. Without this impact from currency movement, adjusted earnings per share would have increased 19% in the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q4. As already noted earlier, all percentage increases are in local currency unless otherwise stated. Occupier outsourcing continued to produce strong growth. Fee revenue included -- including from our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, which is now included in both the current and the prior quarter year, increased 10% globally. Global property sales revenue increased 8%. Asia Pacific sales revenue rose 35%, reflecting strength in Australia, Greater China and Singapore as well as in the especially large transaction in Japan.
Sales revenue also rose solidly in EMEA, aided [ph] by robust growth in France as well as in Belgium and Germany. This more than offset a modest decline in the United Kingdom as investors continue to adjust to the post-Brexit environment. U.S. property sales revenue was largely unchanged compared with Q4 2015. We outperformed the market in the U.S. investment sales with 140 basis point increase in market share in Q4, according to Real Capital Analytics.
The commercial mortgage services business continued to perform very well, with revenue rising 32%. This growth was driven by strong gains from mortgage servicing rights as well as increased loan originations with U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and life insurance companies. Our loan servicing portfolio stood at $145 billion at year-end, up $10 billion from 2015. Global leasing revenue increased 6%. Asia-Pac posted double-digit growth with revenue gains in nearly all countries, most notably, Greater China, Japan and Singapore. EMEA saw solid growth of 6%, led by Germany, Italy and Poland. U.S. leasing revenue rose 4%. Valuation revenue increased 6% for the fourth quarter, paced [ph] by EMEA. Both revenue and fee revenue from property management services were up 4%.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding Q4 results for our 3 regional services businesses. We should note that M&A had an immaterial effect on growth rates in each of the regional businesses in Q4. The Americas, our largest business segment, posted a fee revenue increase of 7%. Asia Pacific, our fastest-growing region in Q4, achieved fee revenue growth of 21%, with strong performance across most of the region. EMEA produced fee revenue growth of 9%. The United Kingdom performed well, with fee revenue up 7%, led by occupier outsourcing. This solid performance in the wake of the Brexit vote tested the strength and diversity of CBRE service offering in the U.K.
We achieved significant operating leverage in each of the 3 regional services businesses supported by strong organic growth and our cost-elimination program, which ended in Q3. In U.S. dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 83% in Asia Pacific, 28% in EMEA and 22% in the Americas. After removing the effect of all foreign currency movements on year-to-year comparisons, adjusted EBITDA increased 74% in Asia Pacific, 46% in EMEA and 22% in the Americas.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional service segments. Fee revenue for this business was up 14% in 2016, excluding the direct contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Q4 2016 was the first full quarter where both the acquired and the existing outsourcing businesses were included in both current and prior year results. We achieved combined fee revenue growth of 10% in local currency in Q4. We expect more modest growth in the first half of 2017, with higher growth in the second half, leading to approximately 10% growth for the full year. In Q4, we signed 47 new outsourcing contracts and 40 expansions. Our city gains in the health care sector continued as well as we signed 9 total contracts with hospital systems like Baptist Memorial and Catholic Health Initiatives. Our global scale, first-rate capabilities and collaborative culture position us better than any other company to capitalize over time on the very large opportunity in this business.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business totaled $15 million for Q4 2016, down from a particularly strong prior year Q4. Q4 2015 included approximately $30 million of carried interest revenue versus almost none in the current period. In addition, we saw a decrease in co-investment returns and management fees in the securities business, reflecting the decline in the market for listed [ph] securities in Q4 compared with an increase in Q4 of the prior year.
Assets under management ended the year at $86.6 billion. In local currency, AUM for the year was up $2.1 billion but was down $2.4 billion when measured in U.S. dollars. Approximately 60% of our AUM, excluding securities, is denominated in euros and British pound sterling. With these currencies down by approximately 25% since mid-year 2014, the strong dollar continues to negatively impact this segment.
Our Global Investors business continues to attract significant capital from investors due to the strong performance of its investment programs. Equity commitments in Q4 rose to $2.6 billion, bringing total capital raise in 2016 to $8.3 billion, one of our strongest capital raises in recent years. Notably, our increased focus on open-ended core and core-plus investment programs, which we described at our Investment Day -- Investor Day, has shown good results, with CBRE funds in the top quartile for investment performance in the U.S. and EMEA.
Please turn to Slide 14 regarding our Development Services segment. Development Services had a record year in 2016 and another strong quarter in Q4, though earnings declined, as expected, from a particularly strong Q4 2015. For Q4 2016, this business produced $48 million of EBITDA. Development projects in process totaled $6.6 billion, down $100 million from year-end 2015. The pipeline totaled $4.2 billion, up $600 million from a year ago.
Please turn to Slide 15. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to highlight 2 key points regarding Q4. First, our regional services businesses performed very well, with 9% growth in fee revenue in local currency and 33% growth in adjusted EBITDA, excluding currency effects, including hedging. This growth is almost exclusively organic. Next, our leasing and capital markets businesses outperformed the market, with revenue growth in local currency of 6% and 13%, respectively.
Now please turn to Slide 16 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE enters 2017 in a great position following very strong performance in 2016. Our business has positive underlying momentum as the global economy continues to grow, albeit at a modest pace, and commercial real estate fundamentals remain sound. Our outlook is bolstered by the many advantages CBRE holds as a sector leader. Our talent base is deep, and our people are aligned with and energized by our strategy. Our operating platform is becoming stronger as we continue to invest in technology, data analytics and other strategic initiatives.
Our specific expectations for 2017 are based on following the assumptions. Number one, global economic growth will approximate 3%, according to the consensus view of economists. Number two, U.S. job growth will slow from 2016's pace but remain relatively solid. Number three, market-wide property sales volumes globally will be roughly in line with 2016 levels with continued volatility quarter-to-quarter. Against this backdrop, in local currency, we expect our capital markets businesses, property sales and mortgage services to increase revenue at a low to mid-single-digit rate and leasing revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting our ability to take market share in both business lines. We expect the occupier outsourcing business to achieve approximately 10% fee revenue growth in local currency with a weighting to the second half of the year. Combined adjusted EBITDA from real estate investment businesses is anticipated to be flat to slightly down from 2016 with improved performance from Global Investment Management, while Development Services comes down from a record level in 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue is expected to remain strong at approximately 17.5% to 18%. Overall, we expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. We anticipate growth to be constrained by a $0.06 per share headwind from adverse foreign currency movement. At the midpoint of our guidance range, the growth rate for earnings per share would be 4% in U.S. dollars or 7% in local currency, almost entirely from organic growth.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

If you look at last year, there was various press written about lower volumes, but it's worth keeping in mind that, that's relative to 2015, which was the strongest year in a decade, and last year was still very, very good by comparison to the previous decade other than 2015. We're going into this year with the assumption that interest rates will go up modestly and that capital flows into real estate and training velocity will be similar to last year."

We have what we call alliance directors or account managers responsible for each of those major relationships. They have teams of people that work on the relationships, and their job is to be closely involved with our clients, first, to make sure we're delivering great service to them on everything we hired them for, but also to be aware of everything they might need that we are well positioned to do for them going forward. So that work is actively underway now. We just finished the year in which we were very, very focused on completing the integration and very focused on making sure that the work that we had already been given by the clients was being executed well. And our client care program, which measures the results for clients, showed that we had improved our services to clients materially last year and their satisfaction materially. We expect, as this year unfolds, to shift quite a bit of our energy to marketing and expanding that business, which you should see come through in the numbers in the later part of the year. But part of that will be cross-selling, and part of that will be selling to new accounts and renewing accounts. So we're expecting to see good activity in that regard as the year unfolds."

CBRE recorded double-digit adjusted earnings growth for the fourth quarter and the year with excellent performance in all 3 regional services businesses. These results are particularly noteworthy in a year of generally softer market-wide property sales volumes, virtually no carried interest income and tepid global economic growth. We set new records for the company in 2016 with more than $13 billion of revenue and nearly $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Credit for this belongs to our more than 75,000 professionals around the globe, who are deeply committed to producing great outcomes for our clients day in and day out.
In addition to achieving record financial performance, very importantly, we continued to advance our strategy. This strategy centers around delivering exceptional outcomes to our clients. Our people and the operating platform that supports them are the key elements to delivering these outcomes. Both advanced materially in 2016, and the impact is showing up on our results. CBRE is in a stronger competitive position than ever.
A good example of the strategic gains we made in 2016 is the work we did integrating the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, one of the largest and quite possibly, the most complex in the history of our sector. This effort involved massive client-facing line of business and back-office transformations. The result of having largely completed this very challenging work is that our occupier outsourcing business is much larger, much more capable of producing strong client outcomes and well positioned for strong, long-term growth. We now serve clients with employees on the ground in over 100 countries. We remain riveted on sustaining our progress with particular focus on areas such as technology and data analytics, where we can capitalize on the expertise and vast amounts of information we possess. For example, last month, we acquired Floored, a leading Software-as-a-Service platform that produces scalable interactive 3D visualization technologies for commercial real estate. Clients should expect continued visible advancements from us in the technology area.
Now Jim will take you through our financial results in detail."

As Bob indicated, CBRE had very strong performance in 2016. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, we achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 for the company overall and for each of our regional service",1880,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE had very strong performance in 2016. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, we achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 for the company overall and for each of our regional services businesses. Second, our 17.9% margin of adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue exceeded the 17% target we established at the beginning of the year. This is especially noteworthy given the inclusion in 2016 of a full year contractual fee revenue from our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. Third, in 2016, we achieved a 17.8% return on invested capital.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a more detailed look at our full year results. In 2016, revenue rose 20% to $13.1 billion. Fee revenue increased 13% to $8.7 billion. Organic fee revenue growth was 5% in local currency, excluding contributions from all acquisitions. This is noteworthy in a year where sales and leasing volumes in the overall market declined. Adjusted EBITDA rose 10% to $1.6 billion or 13%, excluding the impact of currency movement and hedging. Adjusted EPS was up 12% to $2.30 a share or up 15%, excluding the impact of currency movement and hedging.
Full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion excludes $78.5 million for the cost-elimination program that ended in Q3 2016 and $125.7 million of integration costs related to the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, including $52.2 million that occurred in Q4. The benefits of our cost-elimination program will be evident when we review our fourth quarter margins.
Regarding integration costs, prior to year-end, we separated most of the legacy back-office support from the prior owner of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. We anticipate being completely separated from all such support over the next few months and ending integration-related adjustments to EBITDA from this acquisition by second quarter of 2017. To reiterate, the only material adjustment to EBITDA in Q4 was for the integration of our large acquisition, and this charge will end in Q2.
Please turn to Slide 7. We continue to take a prudent approach to both recruiting and M&A activity. For 2016, we added hundreds of producers globally, net of departures, but our overall recruitment level was down from the past few years. We have remained disciplined in underwriting recruitment opportunities at a time when we view some competitors as offering uneconomic terms. Similarly, we invested in only 4 infill M&A deals in 2016. As we have said on prior calls, valuations in the market deviated from our underwriting standards over the past several quarters. We continue to have a robust M&A pipeline but are willing to step aside when terms do not meet our standards.
We continue to invest in technology and data analytics. As Bob noted, we made another acquisition in this space just last month. In addition, we invest -- continue to invest in internal data and technology initiatives that will help our people deliver value for our clients.
Our balance sheet remains highly flexible. We have no required debt repayments until 2019. We ended 2016 with more than $3.5 billion of available liquidity, including nearly $700 million of cash and $2.8 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolver credit facility. At year-end, net debt was 1.2x adjusted EBITDA.
Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at full year revenue growth by line of business. Occupier outsourcing revenue rose 55% in local currency to $6.1 billion, while fee revenue increased 62% in local currency to $2.3 billion. The growth rate was 14% for both revenue and fee revenue without contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing revenue reached $2.7 billion, up 7% in local currency. Our capital markets business, property sales and mortgage services totaled $2.3 billion in revenue, reflecting 5% growth in local currency. Our business mix continued to shift towards more recurring revenue, with contractual fee revenue comprising approximately 42% of total fee revenue for the company, up from 37% in 2015.
Now please turn to Slide 9 as we shift our focus from full year to Q4 financial results. All references for the remainder of this presentation are in local currency, unless stated otherwise, and references to currency movement include the impact, if any, from hedging.
Fee revenue in Q4 increased 6% to $2.7 billion. Organic growth in fee revenue was 5%, comprising the vast majority of our growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter rose 10% to $568 million or 13% without the impact of all currency movements. This increase is notable coming on top of 26% growth in Q4 of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4% on fee revenue improved 110 basis points from Q4 2015. Adjusted earnings per share in U.S. dollars increased 15% to $0.93 for the quarter on top of 19% growth in Q4 2015. In addition, currency movement, including hedges, had a negative impact of $15.8 million to adjusted EBITDA and $0.03 to adjusted earnings per share when comparing current quarter results with Q4 2015. Without this impact from currency movement, adjusted earnings per share would have increased 19% in the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q4. As already noted earlier, all percentage increases are in local currency unless otherwise stated. Occupier outsourcing continued to produce strong growth. Fee revenue included -- including from our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, which is now included in both the current and the prior quarter year, increased 10% globally. Global property sales revenue increased 8%. Asia Pacific sales revenue rose 35%, reflecting strength in Australia, Greater China and Singapore as well as in the especially large transaction in Japan.
Sales revenue also rose solidly in EMEA, paced by robust growth in France as well as in Belgium and Germany. This more than offset a modest decline in the United Kingdom as investors continue to adjust to the post-Brexit environment. U.S. property sales revenue was largely unchanged compared with Q4 2015. We outperformed the market in the U.S. investment sales with 140 basis point increase in market share in Q4, according to Real Capital Analytics.
The commercial mortgage services business continued to perform very well, with revenue rising 32%. This growth was driven by strong gains from mortgage servicing rights as well as increased loan originations with U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and life insurance companies. Our loan servicing portfolio stood at $145 billion at year-end, up $10 billion from 2015. Global leasing revenue increased 6%. Asia-Pac posted double-digit growth with revenue gains in nearly all countries, most notably, Greater China, Japan and Singapore. EMEA saw solid growth of 6%, led by Germany, Italy and Poland. U.S. leasing revenue rose 4%. Valuation revenue increased 6% for the fourth quarter, paced by EMEA. Both revenue and fee revenue from property management services were up 4%.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding Q4 results for our 3 regional services businesses. We should note that M&A had an immaterial effect on growth rates in each of the regional businesses in Q4. The Americas, our largest business segment, posted a fee revenue increase of 7%. Asia Pacific, our fastest-growing region in Q4, achieved fee revenue growth of 21%, with strong performance across most of the region. EMEA produced fee revenue growth of 9%. The United Kingdom performed well, with fee revenue up 7%, led by occupier outsourcing. This solid performance in the wake of the Brexit vote tested the strength and diversity of CBRE service offering in the U.K.
We achieved significant operating leverage in each of the 3 regional services businesses supported by strong organic growth and our cost-elimination program, which ended in Q3. In U.S. dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 83% in Asia Pacific, 28% in EMEA and 22% in the Americas. After removing the effect of all foreign currency movements on year-to-year comparisons, adjusted EBITDA increased 74% in Asia Pacific, 46% in EMEA and 22% in the Americas.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional service segments. Fee revenue for this business was up 14% in 2016, excluding the direct contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Q4 2016 was the first full quarter where both the acquired and the existing outsourcing businesses were included in both current and prior year results. We achieved combined fee revenue growth of 10% in local currency in Q4. We expect more modest growth in the first half of 2017, with higher growth in the second half, leading to approximately 10% growth for the full year. In Q4, we signed 47 new outsourcing contracts and 40 expansions. Our city gains in the health care sector continued as well as we signed 9 total contracts with hospital systems like Baptist Memorial and Catholic Health Initiatives. Our global scale, first-rate capabilities and collaborative culture position us better than any other company to capitalize over time on the very large opportunity in this business.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business totaled $15 million for Q4 2016, down from a particularly strong prior year Q4. Q4 2015 included approximately $30 million of carried interest revenue versus almost none in the current period. In addition, we saw a decrease in co-investment returns and management fees in the securities business, reflecting the decline in the market for listed securities in Q4 compared with an increase in Q4 of the prior year.
Assets under management ended the year at $86.6 billion. In local currency, AUM for the year was up $2.1 billion but was down $2.4 billion when measured in U.S. dollars. Approximately 60% of our AUM, excluding securities, is denominated in euros and British pound sterling. With these currencies down by approximately 25% since mid-year 2014, the strong dollar continues to negatively impact this segment.
Our Global Investors business continues to attract significant capital from investors due to the strong performance of its investment programs. Equity commitments in Q4 rose to $2.6 billion, bringing total capital raise in 2016 to $8.3 billion, one of our strongest capital raises in recent years. Notably, our increased focus on open-ended core and core-plus investment programs, which we described at our Investment Day -- Investor Day, has shown good results, with CBRE funds in the top quartile for investment performance in the U.S. and EMEA.
Please turn to Slide 14 regarding our Development Services segment. Development Services had a record year in 2016 and another strong quarter in Q4, though earnings declined, as expected, from a particularly strong Q4 2015. For Q4 2016, this business produced $48 million of EBITDA. Development projects in process totaled $6.6 billion, down $100 million from year-end 2015. The pipeline totaled $4.2 billion, up $600 million from a year ago.
Please turn to Slide 15. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to highlight 2 key points regarding Q4. First, our regional services businesses performed very well, with 9% growth in fee revenue in local currency and 33% growth in adjusted EBITDA, excluding currency effects, including hedging. This growth is almost exclusively organic. Next, our leasing and capital markets businesses outperformed the market, with revenue growth in local currency of 6% and 13%, respectively.
Now please turn to Slide 16 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE enters 2017 in a great position following very strong performance in 2016. Our business has positive underlying momentum as the global economy continues to grow, albeit at a modest pace, and commercial real estate fundamentals remain sound. Our outlook is bolstered by the many advantages CBRE holds as a sector leader. Our talent base is deep, and our people are aligned with and energized by our strategy. Our operating platform is becoming stronger as we continue to invest in technology, data analytics and other strategic initiatives.
Our specific expectations for 2017 are based on following the assumptions. Number one, global economic growth will approximate 3%, according to the consensus view of economists. Number two, U.S. job growth will slow from 2016's pace but remain relatively solid. Number three, market-wide property sales volumes globally will be roughly in line with 2016 levels with continued volatility quarter-to-quarter. Against this backdrop, in local currency, we expect our capital markets businesses, property sales and mortgage services to increase revenue at a low to mid-single-digit rate and leasing revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting our ability to take market share in both business lines. We expect the occupier outsourcing business to achieve approximately 10% fee revenue growth in local currency with a weighting to the second half of the year. Combined adjusted EBITDA from real estate investment businesses is anticipated to be flat to slightly down from 2016 with improved performance from Global Investment Management, while Development Services comes down from a record level in 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue is expected to remain strong at approximately 17.5% to 18%. Overall, we expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. We anticipate growth to be constrained by a $0.06 per share headwind from adverse foreign currency movement. At the midpoint of our guidance range, the growth rate for earnings per share would be 4% in U.S. dollars or 7% in local currency, almost entirely from organic growth.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

CBRE recorded double-digit adjusted earnings growth for the fourth quarter and the year with excellent performance in all 3 regional services businesses. These results are particularly noteworthy in a year of generally softer market-wide property sales volumes, virtually no carried interest income and tepid global economic growth. We set new records for the company in 2016 with more than $13 billion of revenue and nearly $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Credit for this belongs to our more than 75,000 professionals around the globe, who are deeply committed to producing great outcomes for our clients day in and day out.
In addition to achieving record financial performance, very importantly, we continued to advance our strategy. This strategy centers around delivering exceptional outcomes to our clients. Our people and the operating platform that supports them are the key elements to delivering these outcomes. Both advanced materially in 2016, and the impact is showing up in our results. CBRE is in a stronger competitive position than ever.
A good example of the strategic gains we made in 2016 is the work we did integrating the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, one of the largest, and quite possibly, the most complex in the history of our sector. This effort involved massive client-facing line of business and back-office transformations. The result of having largely completed this very challenging work is that our occupier outsourcing business is much larger, much more capable of producing strong client outcomes and well positioned for strong, long-term growth. We now serve clients with employees on the ground in over 100 countries. We remain riveted on sustaining our progress with particular focus on areas such as technology and data analytics, where we can capitalize on the expertise and vast amounts of information we possess. For example, last month, we acquired Floored, a leading Software-as-a-Service platform that produces scalable interactive 3D visualization technologies for commercial real estate. Clients should expect continued visible advancements from us in the technology area.
Now Jim will take you through our financial results in detail."

As Bob indicated, CBRE had very strong performance in 2016. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, we achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 for the company overall and for each of our regional service",1880,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE had very strong performance in 2016. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, we achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 for the company overall and for each of our regional services businesses. Second, our 17.9% margin of adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue exceeded the 17% target we established at the beginning of the year. This is especially noteworthy given the inclusion in 2016 of a full year of contractual fee revenue from our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. Third, in 2016, we achieved a 17.8% return on invested capital.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a more detailed look at our full year results. In 2016, revenue rose 20% to $13.1 billion. Fee revenue increased 13% to $8.7 billion. Organic fee revenue growth was 5% in local currency, excluding contributions from all acquisitions. This is noteworthy in a year where sales and leasing volumes in the overall market declined. Adjusted EBITDA rose 10% to $1.6 billion, or 13% excluding the impact of currency movement and hedging. Adjusted EPS was up 12% to $2.30 a share, or up 15% excluding the impact of currency movement and hedging.
Full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion excludes $78.5 million for the cost-elimination program that ended in Q3 2016 and $125.7 million of integration costs related to the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, including $52.2 million that occurred in Q4. The benefits of our cost-elimination program will be evident when we review our fourth quarter margins.
Regarding integration costs, prior to year-end, we separated most of the legacy back-office support from the prior owner of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. We anticipate being completely separated from all such support over the next few months and ending integration-related adjustments to EBITDA from this acquisition by second quarter of 2017. To reiterate, the only material adjustment to EBITDA in Q4 was for the integration of our large acquisition, and this charge will end in Q2.
Please turn to Slide 7. We continue to take a prudent approach to both recruiting and M&A activity. For 2016, we added hundreds of producers globally, net of departures, but our overall recruitment level was down from the past few years. We have remained disciplined in underwriting recruitment opportunities at a time when we view some competitors as offering uneconomic terms. Similarly, we invested in only 4 infill M&A deals in 2016. As we have said on prior calls, valuations in the market deviated from our underwriting standards over the past several quarters. We continue to have a robust M&A pipeline but are willing to step aside when terms do not meet our standards.
We continue to invest in technology and data analytics. As Bob noted, we made another acquisition in this space just last month. In addition, we invest -- continue to invest in internal data and technology initiatives that will help our people deliver value for our clients.
Our balance sheet remains highly flexible. We have no required debt repayments until 2019. We ended 2016 with more than $3.5 billion of available liquidity, including nearly $700 million of cash and $2.8 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolver credit facility. At year-end, net debt was 1.2x adjusted EBITDA.
Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at full year revenue growth by line of business. Occupier outsourcing revenue rose 55% in local currency to $6.1 billion, while fee revenue increased 62% in local currency to $2.3 billion. The growth rate was 14% for both revenue and fee revenue without contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing revenue reached $2.7 billion, up 7% in local currency. Our capital markets business, property sales and mortgage services totaled $2.3 billion in revenue, reflecting 5% growth in local currency. Our business mix continued to shift towards more recurring revenue, with contractual fee revenue comprising approximately 42% of total fee revenue for the company, up from 37% in 2015.
Now please turn to Slide 9 as we shift our focus from full year to Q4 financial results. All references for the remainder of this presentation are in local currency, unless stated otherwise, and references to currency movement include the impact, if any, from hedging.
Fee revenue in Q4 increased 6% to $2.7 billion. Organic growth in fee revenue was 5%, comprising the vast majority of our growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter rose 10% to $568 million or 13% without the impact of all currency movements. This increase is notable coming on top of 26% growth in Q4 of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4% on fee revenue improved 110 basis points from Q4 2015. Adjusted earnings per share in U.S. dollars increased 15% to $0.93 for the quarter on top of 19% growth in Q4 2015. In addition, currency movement, including hedges, had a negative impact of $15.8 million to adjusted EBITDA and $0.03 to adjusted earnings per share when comparing current quarter results with Q4 2015. Without this impact from currency movement, adjusted earnings per share would have increased 19% in the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q4. As already noted earlier, all percentage increases are in local currency unless otherwise stated. Occupier outsourcing continued to produce strong growth. Fee revenue included -- including from our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, which is now included in both the current and the prior quarter year, increased 10% globally. Global property sales revenue increased 8%. Asia Pacific sales revenue rose 35%, reflecting strength in Australia, Greater China and Singapore as well as an especially large transaction in Japan.
Sales revenue also rose solidly in EMEA, paced by robust growth in France as well as in Belgium and Germany. This more than offset a modest decline in the United Kingdom as investors continue to adjust to the post-Brexit environment. U.S. property sales revenue was largely unchanged compared with Q4 2015. We outperformed the market in the U.S. investment sales with 140 basis point increase in market share in Q4, according to Real Capital Analytics.
The commercial mortgage services business continued to perform very well, with revenue rising 32%. This growth was driven by strong gains from mortgage servicing rights as well as increased loan originations with U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and life insurance companies. Our loan servicing portfolio stood at $145 billion at year-end, up $10 billion from 2015. Global leasing revenue increased 6%. Asia-Pac posted double-digit growth with revenue gains in nearly all countries, most notably, Greater China, Japan and Singapore. EMEA saw solid growth of 6%, led by Germany, Italy and Poland. U.S. leasing revenue rose 4%. Valuation revenue increased 6% for the fourth quarter, paced by EMEA. Both revenue and fee revenue from property management services were up 4%.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding Q4 results for our 3 regional services businesses. We should note that M&A had an immaterial effect on growth rates in each of the regional businesses in Q4. The Americas, our largest business segment, posted a fee revenue increase of 7%. Asia Pacific, our fastest-growing region in Q4, achieved fee revenue growth of 21%, with strong performance across most of the region. EMEA produced fee revenue growth of 9%. The United Kingdom performed well, with fee revenue up 7%, led by occupier outsourcing. This solid performance in the wake of the Brexit vote tested the strength and diversity of CBRE's service offering in the U.K.
We achieved significant operating leverage in each of the 3 regional services businesses, supported by strong organic growth and our cost-elimination program, which ended in Q3. In U.S. dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 83% in Asia Pacific, 28% in EMEA and 22% in the Americas. After removing the effect of all foreign currency movements on year-to-year comparisons, adjusted EBITDA increased 74% in Asia Pacific, 46% in EMEA and 22% in the Americas.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional service segments. Fee revenue for this business was up 14% in 2016, excluding the direct contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Q4 2016 was the first full quarter where both the acquired and the existing outsourcing businesses were included in both current and prior year results. We achieved combined fee revenue growth of 10% in local currency in Q4. We expect more modest growth in the first half of 2017, with higher growth in the second half, leading to approximately 10% growth for the full year. In Q4, we signed 47 new outsourcing contracts and 40 expansions. Our steady gains in the health care sector continued as well as we signed 9 total contracts with hospital systems like Baptist Memorial and Catholic Health Initiatives. Our global scale, first-rate capabilities and collaborative culture position us better than any other company to capitalize over time on the very large opportunity in this business.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business totaled $15 million for Q4 2016, down from a particularly strong prior year Q4. Q4 2015 included approximately $30 million of carried interest revenue versus almost none in the current period. In addition, we saw a decrease in co-investment returns and management fees in the securities business, reflecting the decline in the market for listed securities in Q4 compared with an increase in Q4 of the prior year.
Assets under management ended the year at $86.6 billion. In local currency, AUM for the year was up $2.1 billion, but was down $2.4 billion when measured in U.S. dollars. Approximately 60% of our AUM, excluding securities, is denominated in euros and British pound sterling. With these currencies down by approximately 25% since mid-year 2014, the strong dollar continues to negatively impact this segment.
Our Global Investors business continues to attract significant capital from investors due to the strong performance of its investment programs. Equity commitments in Q4 rose to $2.6 billion, bringing total capital raise in 2016 to $8.3 billion, one of our strongest capital raises in recent years. Notably, our increased focus on open-ended core and core-plus investment programs, which we described at our Investment Day -- Investor Day, has shown good results, with CBRE funds in the top quartile for investment performance in the U.S. and EMEA.
Please turn to Slide 14 regarding our Development Services segment. Development Services had a record year in 2016 and another strong quarter in Q4, though earnings declined, as expected, from a particularly strong Q4 2015. For Q4 2016, this business produced $48 million of EBITDA. Development projects in process totaled $6.6 billion, down $100 million from year-end 2015. The pipeline totaled $4.2 billion, up $600 million from a year ago.
Please turn to Slide 15. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to highlight 2 key points regarding Q4. First, our regional services businesses performed very well, with 9% growth in fee revenue in local currency and 33% growth in adjusted EBITDA, excluding currency effects, including hedging. This growth is almost exclusively organic. Next, our leasing and capital markets businesses outperformed the market, with revenue growth in local currency of 6% and 13%, respectively.
Now please turn to Slide 16 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE enters 2017 in a great position following very strong performance in 2016. Our business has positive underlying momentum as the global economy continues to grow, albeit at a modest pace, and commercial real estate fundamentals remain sound. Our outlook is bolstered by the many advantages CBRE holds as a sector leader. Our talent base is deep, and our people are aligned with and energized by our strategy. Our operating platform is becoming stronger as we continue to invest in technology, data analytics and other strategic initiatives.
Our specific expectations for 2017 are based on following the assumptions. Number one, global economic growth will approximate 3%, according to the consensus view of economists. Number two, U.S. job growth will slow from 2016's pace but remain relatively solid. Number three, market-wide property sales volumes globally will be roughly in line with 2016 levels, with continued volatility quarter-to-quarter. Against this backdrop, in local currency, we expect our capital markets businesses, property sales and mortgage services to increase revenue at a low to mid-single-digit rate and leasing revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting our ability to take market share in both business lines. We expect the occupier outsourcing business to achieve approximately 10% fee revenue growth in local currency with a weighting to the second half of the year. Combined adjusted EBITDA from real estate investment businesses is anticipated to be flat to slightly down from 2016, with improved performance from Global Investment Management, while Development Services comes down from a record level in 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue is expected to remain strong at approximately 17.5% to 18%. Overall, we expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. We anticipate growth to be constrained by a $0.06 per share headwind from adverse foreign currency movement. At the midpoint of our guidance range, the growth rate for earnings per share would be 4% in U.S. dollars or 7% in local currency, almost entirely from organic growth.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

So that could be a positive impact. So in general, we're expecting a good year, and we're expecting to perform well and take some more market share."

CBRE recorded double-digit adjusted earnings growth for the fourth quarter and the year with excellent performance in all 3 regional services businesses. These results are particularly noteworthy in a year of generally softer market-wide property sales volumes, virtually no carried interest income and tepid global economic growth. We set new records for the company in 2016 with more than $13 billion of revenue and nearly $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Credit for this belongs to our more than 75,000 professionals around the globe, who are deeply committed to producing great outcomes for our clients day in and day out.
In addition to achieving record financial performance, very importantly, we continued to advance our strategy. This strategy centers around delivering exceptional outcomes to our clients. Our people and the operating platform that supports them are the key elements to delivering these outcomes. Both advanced materially in 2016, and the impact is showing up in our results. CBRE is in a stronger competitive position than ever.
A good example of the strategic gains we made in 2016 is the work we did integrating the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, one of the largest, and quite possibly, the most complex in the history of our sector. This effort involved massive client-facing line of business and back-office transformations. The result of having largely completed this very challenging work is that our occupier outsourcing business is much larger, much more capable of producing strong client outcomes and well positioned for strong, long-term growth. We now serve clients with employees on the ground in over 100 countries. We remain riveted on sustaining our progress with particular focus on areas such as technology and data analytics, where we can capitalize on the expertise and vast amounts of information we possess. For example, last month, we acquired Floored, a leading Software-as-a-Service platform that produces scalable interactive 3D visualization technologies for commercial real estate. Clients should expect continued visible advancements from us in the technology area.
Now Jim will take you through our financial results in detail."

As Bob indicated, CBRE had very strong performance in 2016. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, we achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 for the company overall and for each of our regional service",1880,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE had very strong performance in 2016. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, we achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 for the company overall and for each of our regional services businesses. Second, our 17.9% margin of adjusted EBITDA on fee revenue exceeded the 17% target we established at the beginning of the year. This is especially noteworthy given the inclusion in 2016 of a full year of contractual fee revenue from our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. Third, in 2016, we achieved a 17.8% return on invested capital.
Please turn to Slide 6 for a more detailed look at our full year results. In 2016, revenue rose 20% to $13.1 billion. Fee revenue increased 13% to $8.7 billion. Organic fee revenue growth was 5% in local currency, excluding contributions from all acquisitions. This is noteworthy in a year where sales and leasing volumes in the overall market declined. Adjusted EBITDA rose 10% to $1.6 billion, or 13% excluding the impact of currency movement and hedging. Adjusted EPS was up 12% to $2.30 a share, or up 15% excluding the impact of currency movement and hedging.
Full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion excludes $78.5 million for the cost-elimination program that ended in Q3 2016 and $125.7 million of integration costs related to the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, including $52.2 million that occurred in Q4. The benefits of our cost-elimination program will be evident when we review our fourth quarter margins.
Regarding integration costs, prior to year-end, we separated most of the legacy back-office support from the prior owner of the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. We anticipate being completely separated from all such support over the next few months and ending integration-related adjustments to EBITDA from this acquisition by second quarter of 2017. To reiterate, the only material adjustment to EBITDA in Q4 was for the integration of our large acquisition, and this charge will end in Q2.
Please turn to Slide 7. We continue to take a prudent approach to both recruiting and M&A activity. For 2016, we added hundreds of producers globally, net of departures, but our overall recruitment level was down from the past few years. We have remained disciplined in underwriting recruitment opportunities at a time when we view some competitors as offering uneconomic terms. Similarly, we invested in only 4 infill M&A deals in 2016. As we have said on prior calls, valuations in the market deviated from our underwriting standards over the past several quarters. We continue to have a robust M&A pipeline but are willing to step aside when terms do not meet our standards.
We continue to invest in technology and data analytics. As Bob noted, we made another acquisition in this space just last month. In addition, we invest -- continue to invest in internal data and technology initiatives that will help our people deliver value for our clients.
Our balance sheet remains highly flexible. We have no required debt repayments until 2019. We ended 2016 with more than $3.5 billion of available liquidity, including nearly $700 million of cash and $2.8 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolver credit facility. At year-end, net debt was 1.2x adjusted EBITDA.
Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at full year revenue growth by line of business. Occupier outsourcing revenue rose 55% in local currency to $6.1 billion, while fee revenue increased 62% in local currency to $2.3 billion. The growth rate was 14% for both revenue and fee revenue without contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Leasing revenue reached $2.7 billion, up 7% in local currency. Our capital markets business, property sales and mortgage services totaled $2.3 billion in revenue, reflecting 5% growth in local currency. Our business mix continued to shift towards more recurring revenue, with contractual fee revenue comprising approximately 42% of total fee revenue for the company, up from 37% in 2015.
Now please turn to Slide 9 as we shift our focus from full year to Q4 financial results. All references for the remainder of this presentation are in local currency, unless stated otherwise, and references to currency movement include the impact, if any, from hedging.
Fee revenue in Q4 increased 6% to $2.7 billion. Organic growth in fee revenue was 5%, comprising the vast majority of our growth for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter rose 10% to $568 million or 13% without the impact of all currency movements. This increase is notable coming on top of 26% growth in Q4 of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4% on fee revenue improved 110 basis points from Q4 2015. Adjusted earnings per share in U.S. dollars increased 15% to $0.93 for the quarter on top of 19% growth in Q4 2015. In addition, currency movement, including hedges, had a negative impact of $15.8 million to adjusted EBITDA and $0.03 to adjusted earnings per share when comparing current quarter results with Q4 2015. Without this impact from currency movement, adjusted earnings per share would have increased 19% in the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q4. As already noted earlier, all percentage increases are in local currency unless otherwise stated. Occupier outsourcing continued to produce strong growth. Fee revenue included -- including from our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions, which is now included in both the current and the prior quarter year, increased 10% globally. Global property sales revenue increased 8%. Asia Pacific sales revenue rose 35%, reflecting strength in Australia, Greater China and Singapore as well as an especially large transaction in Japan.
Sales revenue also rose solidly in EMEA, paced by robust growth in France as well as in Belgium and Germany. This more than offset a modest decline in the United Kingdom as investors continue to adjust to the post-Brexit environment. U.S. property sales revenue was largely unchanged compared with Q4 2015. We outperformed the market in the U.S. investment sales with 140 basis point increase in market share in Q4, according to Real Capital Analytics.
The commercial mortgage services business continued to perform very well, with revenue rising 32%. This growth was driven by strong gains from mortgage servicing rights as well as increased loan originations with U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and life insurance companies. Our loan servicing portfolio stood at $145 billion at year-end, up $10 billion from 2015. Global leasing revenue increased 6%. Asia-Pac posted double-digit growth with revenue gains in nearly all countries, most notably, Greater China, Japan and Singapore. EMEA saw solid growth of 6%, led by Germany, Italy and Poland. U.S. leasing revenue rose 4%. Valuation revenue increased 6% for the fourth quarter, paced by EMEA. Both revenue and fee revenue from property management services were up 4%.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding Q4 results for our 3 regional services businesses. We should note that M&A had an immaterial effect on growth rates in each of the regional businesses in Q4. The Americas, our largest business segment, posted a fee revenue increase of 7%. Asia Pacific, our fastest-growing region in Q4, achieved fee revenue growth of 21%, with strong performance across most of the region. EMEA produced fee revenue growth of 9%. The United Kingdom performed well, with fee revenue up 7%, led by occupier outsourcing. This solid performance in the wake of the Brexit vote tested the strength and diversity of CBRE's service offering in the U.K.
We achieved significant operating leverage in each of the 3 regional services businesses, supported by strong organic growth and our cost-elimination program, which ended in Q3. In U.S. dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 83% in Asia Pacific, 28% in EMEA and 22% in the Americas. After removing the effect of all foreign currency movements on year-to-year comparisons, adjusted EBITDA increased 74% in Asia Pacific, 46% in EMEA and 22% in the Americas.
Please turn to Slide 12 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional service segments. Fee revenue for this business was up 14% in 2016, excluding the direct contributions from the acquired Global Workplace Solutions business. Q4 2016 was the first full quarter where both the acquired and the existing outsourcing businesses were included in both current and prior year results. We achieved combined fee revenue growth of 10% in local currency in Q4. We expect more modest growth in the first half of 2017, with higher growth in the second half, leading to approximately 10% growth for the full year. In Q4, we signed 47 new outsourcing contracts and 40 expansions. Our steady gains in the health care sector continued as well as we signed 9 total contracts with hospital systems like Baptist Memorial and Catholic Health Initiatives. Our global scale, first-rate capabilities and collaborative culture position us better than any other company to capitalize over time on the very large opportunity in this business.
Please turn to Slide 13 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this business totaled $15 million for Q4 2016, down from a particularly strong prior year Q4. Q4 2015 included approximately $30 million of carried interest revenue versus almost none in the current period. In addition, we saw a decrease in co-investment returns and management fees in the securities business, reflecting the decline in the market for listed securities in Q4 compared with an increase in Q4 of the prior year.
Assets under management ended the year at $86.6 billion. In local currency, AUM for the year was up $2.1 billion, but was down $2.4 billion when measured in U.S. dollars. Approximately 60% of our AUM, excluding securities, is denominated in euros and British pound sterling. With these currencies down by approximately 25% since mid-year 2014, the strong dollar continues to negatively impact this segment.
Our Global Investors business continues to attract significant capital from investors due to the strong performance of its investment programs. Equity commitments in Q4 rose to $2.6 billion, bringing total capital raise in 2016 to $8.3 billion, one of our strongest capital raises in recent years. Notably, our increased focus on open-ended core and core-plus investment programs, which we described at our Investment Day -- Investor Day, has shown good results, with CBRE funds in the top quartile for investment performance in the U.S. and EMEA.
Please turn to Slide 14 regarding our Development Services segment. Development Services had a record year in 2016 and another strong quarter in Q4, though earnings declined, as expected, from a particularly strong Q4 2015. For Q4 2016, this business produced $48 million of EBITDA. Development projects in process totaled $6.6 billion, down $100 million from year-end 2015. The pipeline totaled $4.2 billion, up $600 million from a year ago.
Please turn to Slide 15. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to highlight 2 key points regarding Q4. First, our regional services businesses performed very well, with 9% growth in fee revenue in local currency and 33% growth in adjusted EBITDA, excluding currency effects, including hedging. This growth is almost exclusively organic. Next, our leasing and capital markets businesses outperformed the market, with revenue growth in local currency of 6% and 13%, respectively.
Now please turn to Slide 16 for Bob's closing remarks."

CBRE enters 2017 in a great position following very strong performance in 2016.

CBRE enters 2017 in a great position following very strong performance in 2016. Our business has positive underlying momentum as the global economy continues to grow, albeit at a modest pace, and commercial real estate fundamentals remain sound. Our outlook is bolstered by the many advantages CBRE holds as a sector leader. Our talent base is deep, and our people are aligned with and energized by our strategy. Our operating platform is becoming stronger as we continue to invest in technology, data analytics and other strategic initiatives.
Our specific expectations for 2017 are based on following the assumptions. Number one, global economic growth will approximate 3%, according to the consensus view of economists. Number two, U.S. job growth will slow from 2016's pace but remain relatively solid. Number three, market-wide property sales volumes globally will be roughly in line with 2016 levels, with continued volatility quarter-to-quarter. Against this backdrop, in local currency, we expect our capital markets businesses, property sales and mortgage services to increase revenue at a low to mid-single-digit rate and leasing revenue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting our ability to take market share in both business lines. We expect the occupier outsourcing business to achieve approximately 10% fee revenue growth in local currency with a weighting to the second half of the year. Combined adjusted EBITDA from real estate investment businesses is anticipated to be flat to slightly down from 2016, with improved performance from Global Investment Management, while Development Services comes down from a record level in 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue is expected to remain strong at approximately 17.5% to 18%. Overall, we expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. We anticipate growth to be constrained by a $0.06 per share headwind from adverse foreign currency movement. At the midpoint of our guidance range, the growth rate for earnings per share would be 4% in U.S. dollars or 7% in local currency, almost entirely from organic growth.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to note that as we announced 2 weeks ago, Brad Burke will join us from Goldman Sachs in early June as Head of Investor Relations. Brad is well known to most of you, and he will make an excellent addition to our team. I will be working with Brad to hand over my primary IR duties to him over time, and following a transition period, we'll focus more fully on the company's corporate communications. Until Brad is on board, I will remain your primary IR contact.

Our financial performance in the first quarter continues to reflect strong operating momentum and the growing advantages we hold in the marketplace. Those of you who have been following CBRE closely know that we've been focused for some time on a strategy to make CBRE a more balanced and capable enterprise that produces highly differentiated outcomes for our clients. In support of this strategy, we have made targeted organic investments and acquisitions aimed at bolstering our talent base, service offering and operating platform. These investments have allowed us to significantly improve our ability to provide integrated solutions for our clients around the world as well as improving our digital and consultative capabilities. All of this has positioned us to better satisfy our clients and take market share. This was clearly evident in our first quarter results with excellent top and bottom line organic growth across our regional services businesses globally. This growth came against the backdrop of lower sales market volumes in many parts of the world. Our earnings were further enhanced by the steps we took in late 2015 and in 2016 to calibrate our costs while also investing in our strategy.
While we are always mindful not to read too much into first quarter performance, CBRE is in a strong competitive position, and we are intent on further pressing our advantages for the benefit of our clients, shareholders and employees. 
Now Jim will take you through our first quarter results in detail."

Let me start with 3 highlights. First, Q1 growth was almost entirely organic. This is being achieved in an overall market where global sales transaction volumes were down. Second, we increased our margin to 15.8% in Q1 2017 and grew adjusted EPS by 19% with high-quality earnings. Third, we continue to be highly disciplined in our approach to both recruiting and M&A. Since late 2015, we have repeatedly noted that M&A and recruiting had become pricey and less disciplined, just as the industry was beginning to experience lower market transaction volumes.
The market had moved away from our long-stated 5 to 6x EBITDA multiple for infill M&A. During this period, we shifted our focus to small, highly strategic, nontraditional acquisitions. This allowed us to strength our platform to support organic growth, create balance sheet capacity for future M&A and maintain a high teens return on invested capital. 
Continuing this trend year-to-date, we've acquired 3 modest in size but highly strategic enterprises. 2 are leading SaaS software platforms, and the third is a technology-enabled national financing platform. All 3 provide operating leverage and enhance our clients' offerings. I should note that we are now beginning to see early hopeful signs of greater discipline around M&A in the market. 
With regard to recruiting and retention, our disciplined approach is working. Top professionals are continuing to elect to join CBRE and remain with us because our operating platform, scale, brand and ability to deliver integrated solutions enable them to do more for their clients.
Please turn to Slide 6. All growth rate percentages cited throughout this presentation are in local currency unless stated otherwise. Our results for the quarter were strong. Gross revenue and fee revenue both rose 7% to $3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Virtually all of our growth was organic, providing continued clear evidence of gains in market share. EBITDA increased 21% to $307 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $303 million, both in U.S. dollars. This growth was particularly impressive considering EBITDA contributions from our Development Services business were down sharply, as expected, due to timing of gains and incentives.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.8% on fee revenue improved 40 basis points from Q1 2016. Adjusted earnings per share in U.S. dollars increased 19% to $0.43 for the quarter, driven by strong performance in the regional services businesses. The benefit of a lower tax rate was more than offset by the reduced gains from our Development Services segment.
Please turn to Slide 7 regarding the results for our 3 regional services businesses, which exhibited broad strength in Q1. Combined, they achieved 7% growth in fee revenue and 19% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue for our regional services segments was 15.2%, up 180 basis points from Q1 2016. Note that the impact of cost savings is particularly pronounced in our lightest quarter. In addition, Q1 '16 also included approximately $9 million of expense in cost of goods sold that did not recur in Q1 2017. 
The Americas, our largest business segment, posted fee revenue growth of 5%, while EMEA and Asia Pacific posted fee revenue growth of 10% and 8%, respectively. Virtually all of the growth was organic. 
In Asia Pacific, growth was particularly strong in Greater China, India and Singapore, while Germany, Spain and Switzerland set the pace for CBRE in EMEA.
In the United Kingdom, overall fee revenue rose 9%, with solid growth across virtually all business lines. Growth of 9% in leasing and 5% in sales reflected continued improvement in market sentiment following the Brexit vote and our market share gains. 
Strong organic growth, coupled with our proactive cost elimination program, which ended in Q3 2016, once again led to significant operating leverage in each of the 3 regional services businesses. 
In U.S. dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 18% in the Americas, 22% in EMEA and 58% in Asia Pacific. After removing the effect of all foreign currency movements, including prior year hedging, on a year-to-year comparison, the adjusted EBITDA growth rates were 18% in the Americas, 39% in EMEA and 10% in Asia Pacific. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q1. As already noted, all figures are in local currency unless stated otherwise. Occupier outsourcing produced fee revenue growth of 9%. Emblematic of the strong gains this business is making internationally, we achieved notable growth in Canada, India, Spain and the United Kingdom, among other countries. 
Our capital markets businesses, property sales and commercial mortgage services, continue to perform very well, producing 8% revenue growth on a combined basis. Commercial mortgage services grew at a double-digit clip, with revenue up 14% for the quarter. Our loan volume growth in Q1 was driven by increased originations with life insurance companies. Our loan servicing portfolio ended Q1 at approximately $150 billion, up about $18 billion or 14% from the year-earlier quarter.
Property sales revenue increased 6% despite, as Bob mentioned, a notable slowdown in global market volumes, especially in the United States. 
EMEA sales revenue increased 16%, aided by robust growth in France, Spain and Switzerland. Asia-Pac revenues dipped 4%. Improved performance in Greater China and Singapore was offset by a decline in Japan, which had an exceptionally strong Q1 of 2016 when sales rose by 67%.
The Americas saw sales revenue rise by 6%, bolstered by significant gains in Canada. Revenue growth of 2% in the U.S. stood in stark contrast with a 13% market volume decline, as reported by Real Capital Analytics. CBRE ticked up 130 basis points of market share according to RCA. 
It is also important to note that we completed more than 1,900 sales transactions in the U.S. in Q1. Of these, less than half are captured in RCA's statistics, as the remaining fall outside of their parameters for deal size, property type and user versus investor sales. This reflects the broad base of our service offering around property sales.
Leasing revenue rose 4% globally in Q1. It is important to note that our growth of 1% in the U.S. was on top of very strong growth of 20% in the U.S. in Q1 2016. Leasing for both Asia-Pac and EMEA recorded double-digit growth. 
We continue to have good momentum in our leasing business. Property management and valuation achieved solid growth for the quarter, fueled by double-digit increases in both business lines in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. Fee revenue increased 9% in the quarter for our occupier outsourcing business. We achieved solid organic growth in all 3 regions, as our value proposition has been materially strengthened by the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition. Notably, with the integration largely complete, we are now fully focused on the delivery of great client outcomes and the growth that naturally follows from high client satisfaction. 
This business maintained an active new business pipeline in Q1, highlighted by 52 contract expansions. Overseas contract activity was brisk, with 17 total contracts in EMEA and 12 in Asia Pacific. 16 total contracts were signed in the global health care sector, most of them reflecting expanded service scope for hospital systems in our client portfolio. 
International markets and the health care sector remain [ fertile ] growth opportunities that are particularly well suited to CBRE's scale, broad capabilities and collaborative culture.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Again, all percentage increases are in local currency unless stated otherwise. 
Adjusted EBITDA rose to $26 million for Q1 2017, up 19% in local currency, or 13%, after removing all effects in both years of foreign currency. Revenue was up 3%. Carried interest totaled $3.3 million compared with less than $2 million in the year-ago quarter. Asset management fees were relatively flat. 
It should be noted that currency translation continues to have a pronounced impact on the results for this business, as approximately 60% of the Assets Under Management, excluding securities, is denominated in euro and British pound Sterling.
The weakness of the Sterling continued to constrain growth of AUM when measured in U.S. dollars. 
AUM totaled $86.5 billion, up $900 million in local currency from Q1 2016. However, when measured in U.S. dollars, AUM decreased by $3.2 billion. 
The capital raising environment remains healthy, and our business continues to attract significant capital from investors due to the strong performance of its investment programs. Equity commitments for the trailing 12 months ended in Q1 2017 rose to $8.4 billion. 
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. As we had anticipated, EBITDA contributions from this business declined dramatically from $31.9 million in Q1 of 2016 to $2.8 million. The reduced contributions are a matter of timing of asset sales. Development Services has a continued strong flow of assets being brought to the market, and we expect to realize significant gains in the back half of the year.
Projects in process totaled $5.9 billion, down $1.2 billion from Q1 2016, while our pipeline increased by $2 billion to $5.1 billion. More than half of the pipeline is where fee-only projects, which typically do not include a co-investment or a promoted interest. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to emphasize 2 points regarding our performance in Q1. First, our regional services businesses had another outstanding quarter, with 7% growth in fee revenue and 19% growth in adjusted EBITDA, both in local currency.
Second, growth in the last 2 quarters was almost exclusively organic. This reflects the success of our integration of Global Workplace Solutions and our ability to drive market share gains in our transaction businesses. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

As we look ahead, we are increasingly energized about our market position and prospects. We operate in a sector with attractive underlying growth dynamics. The global economy continues to grow at a modest clip, and commercial real estate market fundamentals remain sound. This is a generally favorable macro environment for CBRE. 
Our business has positive momentum, and our people, supported by our increasingly robust operating platform, are well positioned to capitalize on this environment.
At the same time, it is important to remember that the first quarter is typically our seasonally lightest quarter for revenue and earnings, and the impact of our cost savings actions is particularly pronounced this quarter. As always, we caution against extrapolating first quarter performance to the full year, and we are not updating guidance only 3 months into the year.
With that, operator, we will open the lines for questions."

Reason being is that we came out of a very intense integration over the last 15 months, and the focus was integration, getting those accounts and those customer relationships where we wanted to get them, et cetera, et cetera, less than typically focused on growth. Obviously, that integration, as Jim commented in his remarks, is largely behind us now, and the focus has returned to more normal things, including growth. So we expect -- but the day you shift that focus, the growth doesn't show up. So we expected our growth to be more back-end loaded this year.

If you look at our departures relative to the headcount we have, particularly among our senior brokerage ranks, they're very, very low compared to our turnover in almost any other part of the business, and frankly, compared to turnover in almost any part of any major business. And there's a reason for that. And the reason for that is that we have a business that includes our operating platform, our brand, our clients, our global network that allowed brokers to come here or stay here and generate considerably more volume than they can generate elsewhere. So through all of what made the headlines, particularly last year, we had a great year for recruiting. We had a great year for retention, and that has continued into this year. Now our net recruiting numbers through the first quarter of this year are a lot like they were last year, which are strong relative to long-term historic metrics but down from 2014 and 2015."

But I think the general trends you described over the course of the quarter were a reasonable reflection. And we expect to continue to take market share throughout this year and end up the year with good, solid performance in that business. And it is worth noting that while the capital markets and investment sales, in general, are down from where they were, particularly in 2015 and before, 2016 and so far, this year, by historical measures, are still pretty good. And there is a massive amount of, really, capital that wants to be in commercial real estate for a bunch of reasons. Notably, they do get cash flow. Fundamentals are strong. Rents are in good shape. Vacancies are in good shape. There's pressure to grow in so many markets. As you've heard from us and our competitors, it's not a loose market for construction loans, which means there's not going to be a lot of new product coming on, and there's not a lot of new product in the pipeline, which means that you should see fundamentals remain strong. By the way, that's really good news for our development business. So we think it's going to be a solid year for investment sales, but it's not going to be crazy growth like we saw in some prior years."

Yes, the signing bonuses have an impact. But when you look at the total number of producers we have, and when you look at the top ranks of producers, the headlines don't match up with reality. Huge overwhelming number of our people look at the circumstances, say, over time, where can I do better? Where can I serve my clients better? Where can I do more business? And where do I feel comfortable with the culture and the colleagues and all of those things? And the M&A environment doesn't change that much.

Our financial performance in the first quarter continues to reflect strong operating momentum and the growing advantages we hold in the marketplace. Those of you who have been following CBRE closely know that we've been focused for some time on a strategy to make CBRE a more balanced and capable enterprise that produces highly differentiated outcomes for our clients. In support of this strategy, we have made targeted organic investments and acquisitions aimed at bolstering our talent base, service offering and operating platform. These investments have allowed us to significantly improve our ability to provide integrated solutions for our clients around the world as well as improving our digital and consultative capabilities. All of this has positioned us to better satisfy our clients and take market share. This was clearly evident in our first quarter results with excellent top and bottom line organic growth across our regional services businesses globally. This growth came against the backdrop of lower sales market volumes in many parts of the world. Our earnings were further enhanced by the steps we took in late 2015 and in 2016 to calibrate our costs while also investing in our strategy.
While we are always mindful not to read too much into first quarter performance, CBRE is in a strong competitive position, and we are intent on further pressing our advantages for the benefit of our clients, shareholders and employees.
Now Jim will take you through our first quarter results in detail."
4204816,427019697,1179855,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE had a very strong quarter. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, Q1 growth was almost entirely organic. This is being achieved in an overall market where global sales transaction volumes were",1644,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE had a very strong quarter. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, Q1 growth was almost entirely organic. This is being achieved in an overall market where global sales transaction volumes were down. Second, we increased our margin to 15.8% in Q1 2017 and grew adjusted EPS by 19% with high-quality earnings. Third, we continue to be highly disciplined in our approach to both recruiting and M&A. Since late 2015, we have repeatedly noted that M&A and recruiting had become pricey and less disciplined, just as the industry was beginning to experience lower market transaction volumes. The market had moved away from our long-stated 5 to 6x EBITDA multiple for infill M&A. During this period, we shifted our focus to small, highly strategic, nontraditional acquisitions. This allowed us to strengthen our platform to support organic growth, create balance sheet capacity for future M&A and maintain a high-teens return on invested capital. Continuing this trend, year-to-date, we have acquired 3 modest in size but highly strategic enterprises. Two are leading SaaS software platforms, and the third is a technology-enabled national financing platform. All 3 provide operating leverage and enhance our clients' offerings. I should note that we are now beginning to see early, hopeful signs of greater discipline around M&A in the market. 
With regard to recruiting and retention, our disciplined approach is working. Top professionals are continuing to elect to join CBRE and remain with us, because our operating platform, scale, brand and ability to deliver integrated solutions enable them to do more for their clients.
Please turn to Slide 6. All growth rate percentages cited throughout this presentation are in local currency, unless stated otherwise. Our results for the quarter were strong. Gross revenue and fee revenue both rose 7% to $3 billion and $1.9 billion respectively. Virtually all of our growth was organic, providing continued clear evidence of gains in market share. EBITDA increased 21% to $307 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $303 million, both in U.S. dollars. This growth was particularly impressive considering EBITDA contributions from our Development Services business were down sharply, as expected, due to timing of gains and incentives.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.8% on fee revenue improved 40 basis points from Q1 2016. Adjusted earnings per share in U.S. dollars increased 19% to $0.43 for the quarter, driven by strong performance in the regional services businesses. The benefit of a lower tax rate was more than offset by the reduced gains from our Development Services segment.
Please turn to Slide 7, regarding the results for our 3 regional services businesses, which exhibited broad strength in Q1. Combined, they achieved 7% growth in fee revenue and 19% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue for our regional services segments was 15.2%, up 180 basis points from Q1 2016. Note that the impact of cost savings is particularly pronounced in our lightest quarter. In addition, Q1 '16 also included approximately $9 million of expense in cost of goods sold that did not recur in Q1 2017. 
The Americas, our largest business segment, posted fee revenue growth of 5%, while EMEA and Asia Pacific posted fee revenue growth of 10% and 8% respectively. Virtually all of the growth was organic. 
In Asia Pacific, growth was particularly strong in Greater China, India and Singapore, while Germany, Spain and Switzerland set the pace for CBRE in EMEA.
In the United Kingdom, overall fee revenue rose 9%, with solid growth across virtually all business lines. Growth of 9% in leasing and 5% in sales reflected continued improvement in market sentiment following the Brexit vote and our market share gains. 
Strong organic growth, coupled with our proactive cost-elimination program, which ended in Q3 2016, once again led to significant operating leverage in each of the 3 regional services businesses.
In U.S. dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 18% in the Americas, 22% in EMEA and 58% in Asia Pacific. After removing the effect of all foreign currency movements, including prior year hedging, on a year-to-year comparison, the adjusted EBITDA growth rates were 18% in the Americas, 39% in EMEA and 10% in Asia Pacific. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q1. As already noted, all figures are in local currency unless stated otherwise. Occupier outsourcing produced fee revenue growth of 9%. Emblematic of the strong gains this business is making internationally, we achieved notable growth in Canada, India, Spain and the United Kingdom, among other countries. 
Our capital markets businesses, property sales and commercial mortgage services, continue to perform very well, producing 8% revenue growth on a combined basis. Commercial mortgage services grew at a double-digit clip, with revenue up 14% for the quarter. Our loan volume growth in Q1 was driven by increased originations with life insurance companies. Our loan servicing portfolio ended Q1 at approximately $150 billion, up about $18 billion or 14% from the year-earlier quarter.
Property sales revenue increased 6% despite, as Bob mentioned, a notable slowdown in global market volumes, especially in the United States. 
EMEA sales revenue increased 16%, aided by a robust growth in France, Spain and Switzerland. Asia Pac revenues dipped 4%. Improved performance in Greater China and Singapore was offset by a decline in Japan, which had an exceptionally strong Q1 of 2016 when sales rose by 67%.
The Americas saw sales revenue rise by 6%, bolstered by significant gains in Canada. Revenue growth of 2% in the U.S. stood in stark contrast with a 13% market volume decline, as reported by Real Capital Analytics. CBRE picked up 130 basis points of market share according to RCA. 
It is also important to note that we completed more than 1,900 sales transactions in the U.S. in Q1. Of these, less than half are captured in RCA's statistics, as the remaining fall outside of their parameters for deal size, property type and user versus investor sales. This reflects the broad base of our service offering around property sales.
Leasing revenue rose 4% globally in Q1. It is important to note that our growth of 1% in the U.S. was on top of very strong growth of 20% in the U.S. in Q1 2016. Leasing for both Asia-Pac and EMEA recorded double-digit growth. We continue to have good momentum in our leasing business. 
Property management and valuation achieved solid growth for the quarter, fueled by double-digit increases in both business lines in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. Fee revenue increased 9% in the quarter for our occupier outsourcing business. We achieved solid organic growth in all 3 regions, as our value proposition has been materially strengthened by the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition. Notably, with the integration largely complete, we are now fully focused on the delivery of great client outcomes and the growth that naturally follows from high client satisfaction. 
This business maintained an active new business pipeline in Q1, highlighted by 52 contract expansions. Overseas contract activity was brisk, with 17 total contracts in EMEA and 12 in Asia Pacific. 16 total contracts were signed in the global health care sector, most of them reflecting expanded service scope for hospital systems in our client portfolio. 
International markets and the health care sector remain fertile growth opportunities that are particularly well suited to CBRE's scale, broad capabilities and collaborative culture.
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Again, all percentage increases are in local currency unless stated otherwise. 
Adjusted EBITDA rose to $26 million for Q1 2017, up 19% in local currency, or 13% after removing all effects in both years of foreign currency. Revenue was up 3%. Carried interest totaled $3.3 million compared with less than $2 million in the year-ago quarter. Asset management fees were relatively flat.
It should be noted that currency translation continues to have a pronounced impact on the results for this business, as approximately 60% of the Assets Under Management, excluding securities, is denominated in euro and British pound Sterling.
The weakness of the Sterling continued to constrain growth of AUM when measured in U.S. dollars. 
AUM totaled $86.5 billion, up $900 million in local currency from Q1 2016. However, when measured in U.S. dollars, AUM decreased by $3.2 billion. 
The capital-raising environment remains healthy, and our business continues to attract significant capital from investors due to the strong performance of its investment programs. Equity commitments for the trailing 12 months ended in Q1 2017 rose to $8.4 billion. 
Please turn to Slide 11, regarding our Development Services segment. As we had anticipated, EBITDA contributions from this business declined dramatically from $31.9 million in Q1 of 2016 to $2.8 million. The reduced contributions are a matter of timing of asset sales. Development Services has a continued strong flow of assets being brought to the market, and we expect to realize significant gains in the back half of the year.
Projects in process totaled $5.9 billion, down $1.2 billion from Q1 2016, while our pipeline increased by $2 billion to $5.1 billion. More than half of the pipeline is for fee-only projects, which typically do not include a co-investment or a promoted interest. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to emphasize 2 points regarding our performance in Q1. First, our regional services businesses had another outstanding quarter, with 7% growth in fee revenue and 19% growth in adjusted EBITDA, both in local currency. Second, growth in the last 2 quarters was almost exclusively organic. This reflects the success of our integration of Global Workplace Solutions and our ability to drive market share gains in our transaction businesses. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

Our business has positive momentum, and our people, supported by our increasingly robust operating platform, are well positioned to capitalize on this environment.
At the same time, it is important to remember that the first quarter is typically our seasonally lightest quarter for revenue and earnings, and the impact of our cost savings actions is particularly pronounced this quarter.

Obviously, that integration, as Jim commented in his remarks, is largely behind us now, and the focus has returned to more normal things, including growth.

We decided to remain darn disciplined during that period, and we're really glad we did. By the way, I think it's clearly showing up in our numbers. But we still, on the hiring side, Mitch, hired hundreds of brokers, net of departures last year. If you look at our departures relative to the headcount we have, particularly among our senior brokerage ranks, they're very, very low compared to our turnover in almost any other part of the business, and frankly, compared to turnover in almost any part of any major business, and there's a reason for that. And the reason for that is that we have a business, it includes our operating platform, our brand, our clients, our global network that allows those brokers to come here or stay here and generate considerably more volume than they can generate elsewhere. So through all of what made the headlines, particularly last year, we had a great year for recruiting, we had a great year for retention, and that has continued into this year.

And it is worth noting that while the capital markets and investment sales, in general, are down from where they were, particularly in 2015 and before. 2016 and so far this year, by historical measures, are still pretty good. And there is a massive amount of -- or capital that wants to be in commercial real estate for a bunch of reasons. Notably, you do get cash flow. Fundamentals are strong. Rents are in good shape. Vacancies are in good shape. There's pressure to grow rents in many markets. As you've heard from us and our competitors, it's not a loose market for construction loans, which means there's not going to be a lot of new product coming on. And there's not a lot of new product in the pipeline, which means that you should see fundamentals remain strong. By the way, that's really good news for our Development business.

We talked about the volumes slowing down by 1/3 or so last year. That's been similar this year. I can tell you that the average production of the inbound brokers is larger than the average production of the outbound brokers. By the way, this is another 1 of the things that I think is showing up pretty clearly in our numbers. But we don't give those percentages specifically."

We adjust -- all of our adjustments in that area that you're asking about is to try to align the comp expense with the timing of when we realize those incentive gains. So when we're reversing an expense like we did in this quarter, it can be from a number of different quarters where, if you look back over the last few years, we made adjustments in the other direction.

But it is less than 10% of our Americas' revenues. Change is a good thing for us in general. When people are growing and adding space, that's good. When people are exiting spaces and looking for people to offload into, that's good. So retail is a good business for us, has been a good business, continues to be a good business. It's not dominant in our numbers. What we're seeing is a couple of trends. Number one, anything that has to do with experienced retail, food and beverage-oriented stuff, is, in fact, quite active. Secondly, anything that's tends to be in and around these work, live, play type areas in major cities, the more urban areas, is really active and doing well. So we expect that to continue throughout the year. We expect the change to continue. Obviously, e-commerce is having a big impact on that. We do have the opportunity to be consultants to the retailers that we work for, and we get called on to do that fairly regularly. That's part of what we do as well.

Our volume with Freddie was down a little bit. Our volume with Fannie was up a bit. So the real strength for us in Q1 was driven by the life insurance companies.

Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to note that, as we announced 2 weeks ago, Brad Burke will join us from Goldman Sachs in early June as Head of Investor Relations. Brad is well known to most of you and he will make an excellent addition to our team. I will be working with Brad to hand over my primary IR duties to him over time, and following a transition period, will focus more fully on the company's corporate communications. Until Brad is on board, I will remain your primary IR contact.

Our financial performance in the first quarter continues to reflect strong operating momentum and the growing advantages we hold in the marketplace. Those of you who have been following CBRE closely know that we've been focused for some time on a strategy to make CBRE a more balanced and capable enterprise that produces highly differentiated outcomes for our clients. In support of this strategy, we have made targeted organic investments and acquisitions aimed at bolstering our talent base, service offering and operating platform. These investments have allowed us to significantly improve our ability to provide integrated solutions for our clients around the world as well as improving our digital and consultative capabilities. All of this has positioned us to better satisfy our clients and take market share. This was clearly evident in our first quarter results with excellent top and bottom line organic growth across our regional services businesses globally. This growth came against the backdrop of lower sales market volumes in many parts of the world. Our earnings were further enhanced by the steps we took in late 2015 and in 2016 to calibrate our costs while also investing in our strategy.
While we are always mindful not to read too much into first quarter performance, CBRE is in a strong competitive position, and we are intent on further pressing our advantages for the benefit of our clients, shareholders and employees.
Now Jim will take you through our first quarter results in detail."

Let me start with 3 highlights. First, Q1 growth was almost entirely organic. This is being achieved in an overall market where global sales transaction volumes were down. Second, we increased our margin to 15.8% in Q1 2017 and grew adjusted EPS by 19% with high-quality earnings. Third, we continue to be highly disciplined in our approach to both recruiting and M&A. Since late 2015, we have repeatedly noted that M&A and recruiting had become pricey and less disciplined, just as the industry was beginning to experience lower market transaction volumes. The market had moved away from our long-stated 5 to 6x EBITDA multiple for infill M&A. During this period, we shifted our focus to small, highly strategic, nontraditional acquisitions. This allowed us to strengthen our platform to support organic growth, create balance sheet capacity for future M&A and maintain a high-teens return on invested capital. Continuing this trend, year-to-date, we have acquired 3 modest in size but highly strategic enterprises. Two are leading SaaS software platforms, and the third is a technology-enabled national financing platform. All 3 provide operating leverage and enhance our clients' offerings. I should note that we are now beginning to see early, hopeful signs of greater discipline around M&A in the market. 
With regard to recruiting and retention, our disciplined approach is working. Top professionals are continuing to elect to join CBRE and remain with us, because our operating platform, scale, brand and ability to deliver integrated solutions enable them to do more for their clients.
Please turn to Slide 6. All growth rate percentages cited throughout this presentation are in local currency, unless stated otherwise. Our results for the quarter were strong. Gross revenue and fee revenue both rose 7% to $3 billion and $1.9 billion respectively. Virtually all of our growth was organic, providing continued clear evidence of gains in market share. EBITDA increased 21% to $307 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $303 million, both in U.S. dollars. This growth was particularly impressive considering EBITDA contributions from our Development Services business were down sharply, as expected, due to timing of gains and incentives.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.8% on fee revenue improved 40 basis points from Q1 2016. Adjusted earnings per share in U.S. dollars increased 19% to $0.43 for the quarter, driven by strong performance in the regional services businesses. The benefit of a lower tax rate was more than offset by the reduced gains from our Development Services segment.
Please turn to Slide 7, regarding the results for our 3 regional services businesses, which exhibited broad strength in Q1. Combined, they achieved 7% growth in fee revenue and 19% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue for our regional services segments was 15.2%, up 180 basis points from Q1 2016. Note that the impact of cost savings is particularly pronounced in our lightest quarter. In addition, Q1 '16 also included approximately $9 million of expense in cost of goods sold that did not recur in Q1 2017. 
The Americas, our largest business segment, posted fee revenue growth of 5%, while EMEA and Asia Pacific posted fee revenue growth of 10% and 8% respectively. Virtually all of the growth was organic. 
In Asia Pacific, growth was particularly strong in Greater China, India and Singapore, while Germany, Spain and Switzerland set the pace for CBRE in EMEA.
In the United Kingdom, overall fee revenue rose 9%, with solid growth across virtually all business lines. Growth of 9% in leasing and 5% in sales reflected continued improvement in market sentiment following the Brexit vote and our market share gains. 
Strong organic growth, coupled with our proactive cost-elimination program, which ended in Q3 2016, once again led to significant operating leverage in each of the 3 regional services businesses.
In U.S. dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 18% in the Americas, 22% in EMEA and 58% in Asia Pacific. After removing the effect of all foreign currency movements, including prior year hedging, on a year-to-year comparison, the adjusted EBITDA growth rates were 18% in the Americas, 39% in EMEA and 10% in Asia Pacific. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q1. As already noted, all figures are in local currency unless stated otherwise. Occupier outsourcing produced fee revenue growth of 9%. Emblematic of the strong gains this business is making internationally, we achieved notable growth in Canada, India, Spain and the United Kingdom, among other countries. 
Our capital markets businesses, property sales and commercial mortgage services, continue to perform very well, producing 8% revenue growth on a combined basis. Commercial mortgage services grew at a double-digit clip, with revenue up 14% for the quarter. Our loan volume growth in Q1 was driven by increased originations with life insurance companies. Our loan servicing portfolio ended Q1 at approximately $150 billion, up about $18 billion or 14% from the year-earlier quarter.
Property sales revenue increased 6% despite, as Bob mentioned, a notable slowdown in global market volumes, especially in the United States. 
EMEA sales revenue increased 16%, aided by a robust growth in France, Spain and Switzerland. Asia Pac revenues dipped 4%. Improved performance in Greater China and Singapore was offset by a decline in Japan, which had an exceptionally strong Q1 of 2016 when sales rose by 67%.
The Americas saw sales revenue rise by 6%, bolstered by significant gains in Canada. Revenue growth of 2% in the U.S. stood in stark contrast with a 13% market volume decline, as reported by Real Capital Analytics. CBRE picked up 130 basis points of market share according to RCA. 
It is also important to note that we completed more than 1,900 sales transactions in the U.S. in Q1. Of these, less than half are captured in RCA's statistics, as the remaining fall outside of their parameters for deal size, property type and user versus investor sales. This reflects the broad base of our service offering around property sales.
Leasing revenue rose 4% globally in Q1. It is important to note that our growth of 1% in the U.S. was on top of very strong growth of 20% in the U.S. in Q1 2016. Leasing for both Asia-Pac and EMEA recorded double-digit growth. We continue to have good momentum in our leasing business. 
Property management and valuation achieved solid growth for the quarter, fueled by double-digit increases in both business lines in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. Fee revenue increased 9% in the quarter for our occupier outsourcing business. We achieved solid organic growth in all 3 regions, as our value proposition has been materially strengthened by the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition. Notably, with the integration largely complete, we are now fully focused on the delivery of great client outcomes and the growth that naturally follows from high client satisfaction. 
This business maintained an active new business pipeline in Q1, highlighted by 52 contract expansions. Overseas contract activity was brisk, with 17 total contracts in EMEA and 12 in Asia Pacific. 16 total contracts were signed in the global health care sector, most of them reflecting expanded service scope for hospital systems in our client portfolio. 
International markets and the health care sector remain fertile growth opportunities that are particularly well suited to CBRE's scale, broad capabilities and collaborative culture.
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Again, all percentage increases are in local currency unless stated otherwise. 
Adjusted EBITDA rose to $26 million for Q1 2017, up 19% in local currency, or 13% after removing all effects in both years of foreign currency. Revenue was up 3%. Carried interest totaled $3.3 million compared with less than $2 million in the year-ago quarter. Asset management fees were relatively flat.
It should be noted that currency translation continues to have a pronounced impact on the results for this business, as approximately 60% of the Assets Under Management, excluding securities, is denominated in euro and British pound Sterling.
The weakness of the Sterling continued to constrain growth of AUM when measured in U.S. dollars. 
AUM totaled $86.5 billion, up $900 million in local currency from Q1 2016. However, when measured in U.S. dollars, AUM decreased by $3.2 billion. 
The capital-raising environment remains healthy, and our business continues to attract significant capital from investors due to the strong performance of its investment programs. Equity commitments for the trailing 12 months ended in Q1 2017 rose to $8.4 billion. 
Please turn to Slide 11, regarding our Development Services segment. As we had anticipated, EBITDA contributions from this business declined dramatically from $31.9 million in Q1 of 2016 to $2.8 million. The reduced contributions are a matter of timing of asset sales. Development Services has a continued strong flow of assets being brought to the market, and we expect to realize significant gains in the back half of the year.
Projects in process totaled $5.9 billion, down $1.2 billion from Q1 2016, while our pipeline increased by $2 billion to $5.1 billion. More than half of the pipeline is for fee-only projects, which typically do not include a co-investment or a promoted interest. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to emphasize 2 points regarding our performance in Q1. First, our regional services businesses had another outstanding quarter, with 7% growth in fee revenue and 19% growth in adjusted EBITDA, both in local currency. Second, growth in the last 2 quarters was almost exclusively organic. This reflects the success of our integration of Global Workplace Solutions and our ability to drive market share gains in our transaction businesses. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

As we look ahead, we are increasingly energized about our market position and prospects. We operate in a sector with attractive underlying growth dynamics. The global economy continues to grow at a modest clip, and commercial real estate market fundamentals remain sound. This is a generally favorable macro environment for CBRE. Our business has positive momentum, and our people, supported by our increasingly robust operating platform, are well positioned to capitalize on this environment.
At the same time, it is important to remember that the first quarter is typically our seasonally lightest quarter for revenue and earnings, and the impact of our cost savings actions is particularly pronounced this quarter. As always, we caution against extrapolating first quarter performance to the full year, and we are not updating guidance only 3 months into the year.

We decided to remain darn disciplined during that period, and we're really glad we did. By the way, I think it's clearly showing up in our numbers. But we still, on the hiring side, Mitch, hired hundreds of brokers, net of departures last year. If you look at our departures relative to the headcount we have, particularly among our senior brokerage ranks, they're very, very low compared to our turnover in almost any other part of the business, and frankly, compared to turnover in almost any part of any major business, and there's a reason for that. And the reason for that is that we have a business, it includes our operating platform, our brand, our clients, our global network that allows those brokers to come here or stay here and generate considerably more volume than they can generate elsewhere. So through all of what made the headlines, particularly last year, we had a great year for recruiting, we had a great year for retention, and that has continued into this year. Now our net recruiting numbers through the first quarter of this year are a lot like they were last year, which are strong, relative to long-term historic metrics, but down from 2014 and 2015."

But I think the general trends you described over the course of the quarter were a reasonable reflection. And we expect to continue to take market share throughout this year and end up the year with good, solid performance in that business. And it is worth noting that while the capital markets and investment sales, in general, are down from where they were, particularly in 2015 and before. 2016 and so far this year, by historical measures, are still pretty good. And there is a massive amount of -- or capital that wants to be in commercial real estate for a bunch of reasons. Notably, you do get cash flow. Fundamentals are strong. Rents are in good shape. Vacancies are in good shape. There's pressure to grow rents in many markets. As you've heard from us and our competitors, it's not a loose market for construction loans, which means there's not going to be a lot of new product coming on. And there's not a lot of new product in the pipeline, which means that you should see fundamentals remain strong. By the way, that's really good news for our Development business. So we think it's going to be a solid year for investment sales, but it's not going to be crazy growth like we saw in some prior years."

Yes, the signing bonuses have an impact, but when you look at the total number of producers we have, and when you look at the top ranks of producers, the headlines don't match up with reality. A huge, overwhelming number of our people look at the circumstances and say, over time, where can I do better? Where can I serve my clients better? Where can I do more business? And where do I feel comfortable with the culture and the colleagues and all of those things? And the M&A environment doesn't change that much.

Our financial performance in the first quarter continues to reflect strong operating momentum and the growing advantages we hold in the marketplace. Those of you who have been following CBRE closely know that we've been focused for some time on a strategy to make CBRE a more balanced and capable enterprise that produces highly differentiated outcomes for our clients. In support of this strategy, we have made targeted organic investments and acquisitions aimed at bolstering our talent base, service offering and operating platform. These investments have allowed us to significantly improve our ability to provide integrated solutions for our clients around the world as well as improving our digital and consultative capabilities. All of this has positioned us to better satisfy our clients and take market share. This was clearly evident in our first quarter results with excellent top and bottom line organic growth across our regional services businesses globally. This growth came against the backdrop of lower sales market volumes in many parts of the world. Our earnings were further enhanced by the steps we took in late 2015 and in 2016 to calibrate our costs while also investing in our strategy.
While we are always mindful not to read too much into first quarter performance, CBRE is in a strong competitive position, and we are intent on further pressing our advantages for the benefit of our clients, shareholders and employees.
Now Jim will take you through our first quarter results in detail."
4204816,427019697,1183513,"CBRE Group, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2017",2017-04-27,"Earnings Calls","CBRE Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE had a very strong quarter. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, Q1 growth was almost entirely organic. This is being achieved in an overall market where global sales transaction volumes were",1644,"Thank you, Bob. Please turn to Slide 5. As Bob indicated, CBRE had a very strong quarter. Let me start with 3 highlights. First, Q1 growth was almost entirely organic. This is being achieved in an overall market where global sales transaction volumes were down. Second, we increased our margin to 15.8% in Q1 2017 and grew adjusted EPS by 19% with high-quality earnings. Third, we continue to be highly disciplined in our approach to both recruiting and M&A. Since late 2015, we have repeatedly noted that M&A and recruiting had become pricey and less disciplined, just as the industry was beginning to experience lower market transaction volumes. The market had moved away from our long-stated 5 to 6x EBITDA multiple for infill M&A. During this period, we shifted our focus to small, highly strategic, nontraditional acquisitions. This allowed us to strengthen our platform to support organic growth, create balance sheet capacity for future M&A and maintain a high-teens return on invested capital. Continuing this trend, year-to-date, we have acquired 3 modest in size but highly strategic enterprises. Two are leading SaaS software platforms, and the third is a technology-enabled national financing platform. All 3 provide operating leverage and enhance our clients' offerings. I should note that we are now beginning to see early, hopeful signs of greater discipline around M&A in the market. 
With regard to recruiting and retention, our disciplined approach is working. Top professionals are continuing to elect to join CBRE and remain with us, because our operating platform, scale, brand and ability to deliver integrated solutions enable them to do more for their clients.
Please turn to Slide 6. All growth rate percentages cited throughout this presentation are in local currency, unless stated otherwise. Our results for the quarter were strong. Gross revenue and fee revenue both rose 7% to $3 billion and $1.9 billion respectively. Virtually all of our growth was organic, providing continued clear evidence of gains in market share. EBITDA increased 21% to $307 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $303 million, both in U.S. dollars. This growth was particularly impressive considering EBITDA contributions from our Development Services business were down sharply, as expected, due to timing of gains and incentives.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.8% on fee revenue improved 40 basis points from Q1 2016. Adjusted earnings per share in U.S. dollars increased 19% to $0.43 for the quarter, driven by strong performance in the regional services businesses. The benefit of a lower tax rate was more than offset by the reduced gains from our Development Services segment.
Please turn to Slide 7, regarding the results for our 3 regional services businesses, which exhibited broad strength in Q1. Combined, they achieved 7% growth in fee revenue and 19% growth in adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue for our regional services segments was 15.2%, up 180 basis points from Q1 2016. Note that the impact of cost savings is particularly pronounced in our lightest quarter. In addition, Q1 '16 also included approximately $9 million of expense in cost of goods sold that did not recur in Q1 2017. 
The Americas, our largest business segment, posted fee revenue growth of 5%, while EMEA and Asia Pacific posted fee revenue growth of 10% and 8% respectively. Virtually all of the growth was organic. 
In Asia Pacific, growth was particularly strong in Greater China, India and Singapore, while Germany, Spain and Switzerland set the pace for CBRE in EMEA.
In the United Kingdom, overall fee revenue rose 9%, with solid growth across virtually all business lines. Growth of 9% in leasing and 5% in sales reflected continued improvement in market sentiment following the Brexit vote and our market share gains. 
Strong organic growth, coupled with our proactive cost-elimination program, which ended in Q3 2016, once again led to significant operating leverage in each of the 3 regional services businesses.
In U.S. dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 18% in the Americas, 22% in EMEA and 58% in Asia Pacific. After removing the effect of all foreign currency movements, including prior year hedging, on a year-to-year comparison, the adjusted EBITDA growth rates were 18% in the Americas, 39% in EMEA and 10% in Asia Pacific. 
Please turn to Slide 8 for a review of our major global lines of business in Q1. As already noted, all figures are in local currency unless stated otherwise. Occupier outsourcing produced fee revenue growth of 9%. Emblematic of the strong gains this business is making internationally, we achieved notable growth in Canada, India, Spain and the United Kingdom, among other countries. 
Our capital markets businesses, property sales and commercial mortgage services, continue to perform very well, producing 8% revenue growth on a combined basis. Commercial mortgage services grew at a double-digit clip, with revenue up 14% for the quarter. Our loan volume growth in Q1 was driven by increased originations with life insurance companies. Our loan servicing portfolio ended Q1 at approximately $150 billion, up about $18 billion or 14% from the year-earlier quarter.
Property sales revenue increased 6% despite, as Bob mentioned, a notable slowdown in global market volumes, especially in the United States. 
EMEA sales revenue increased 16%, aided by a robust growth in France, Spain and Switzerland. Asia Pac revenues dipped 4%. Improved performance in Greater China and Singapore was offset by a decline in Japan, which had an exceptionally strong Q1 of 2016 when sales rose by 67%.
The Americas saw sales revenue rise by 6%, bolstered by significant gains in Canada. Revenue growth of 2% in the U.S. stood in stark contrast with a 13% market volume decline, as reported by Real Capital Analytics. CBRE picked up 130 basis points of market share according to RCA. 
It is also important to note that we completed more than 1,900 sales transactions in the U.S. in Q1. Of these, less than half are captured in RCA's statistics, as the remaining fall outside of their parameters for deal size, property type and user versus investor sales. This reflects the broad base of our service offering around property sales.
Leasing revenue rose 4% globally in Q1. It is important to note that our growth of 1% in the U.S. was on top of very strong growth of 20% in the U.S. in Q1 2016. Leasing for both Asia-Pac and EMEA recorded double-digit growth. We continue to have good momentum in our leasing business. 
Property management and valuation achieved solid growth for the quarter, fueled by double-digit increases in both business lines in EMEA and Asia Pacific. 
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. Fee revenue increased 9% in the quarter for our occupier outsourcing business. We achieved solid organic growth in all 3 regions, as our value proposition has been materially strengthened by the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition. Notably, with the integration largely complete, we are now fully focused on the delivery of great client outcomes and the growth that naturally follows from high client satisfaction. 
This business maintained an active new business pipeline in Q1, highlighted by 52 contract expansions. Overseas contract activity was brisk, with 17 total contracts in EMEA and 12 in Asia Pacific. 16 total contracts were signed in the global health care sector, most of them reflecting expanded service scope for hospital systems in our client portfolio. 
International markets and the health care sector remain fertile growth opportunities that are particularly well suited to CBRE's scale, broad capabilities and collaborative culture.
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Again, all percentage increases are in local currency unless stated otherwise. 
Adjusted EBITDA rose to $26 million for Q1 2017, up 19% in local currency, or 13% after removing all effects in both years of foreign currency. Revenue was up 3%. Carried interest totaled $3.3 million compared with less than $2 million in the year-ago quarter. Asset management fees were relatively flat.
It should be noted that currency translation continues to have a pronounced impact on the results for this business, as approximately 60% of the Assets Under Management, excluding securities, is denominated in euro and British pound Sterling.
The weakness of the Sterling continued to constrain growth of AUM when measured in U.S. dollars. 
AUM totaled $86.5 billion, up $900 million in local currency from Q1 2016. However, when measured in U.S. dollars, AUM decreased by $3.2 billion. 
The capital-raising environment remains healthy, and our business continues to attract significant capital from investors due to the strong performance of its investment programs. Equity commitments for the trailing 12 months ended in Q1 2017 rose to $8.4 billion. 
Please turn to Slide 11, regarding our Development Services segment. As we had anticipated, EBITDA contributions from this business declined dramatically from $31.9 million in Q1 of 2016 to $2.8 million. The reduced contributions are a matter of timing of asset sales. Development Services has a continued strong flow of assets being brought to the market, and we expect to realize significant gains in the back half of the year.
Projects in process totaled $5.9 billion, down $1.2 billion from Q1 2016, while our pipeline increased by $2 billion to $5.1 billion. More than half of the pipeline is for fee-only projects, which typically do not include a co-investment or a promoted interest. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Before I turn the call back to Bob, I'd like to emphasize 2 points regarding our performance in Q1. First, our regional services businesses had another outstanding quarter, with 7% growth in fee revenue and 19% growth in adjusted EBITDA, both in local currency. Second, growth in the last 2 quarters was almost exclusively organic. This reflects the success of our integration of Global Workplace Solutions and our ability to drive market share gains in our transaction businesses. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

Our business has positive momentum, and our people, supported by our increasingly robust operating platform, are well positioned to capitalize on this environment.
At the same time, it is important to remember that the first quarter is typically our seasonally lightest quarter for revenue and earnings, and the impact of our cost savings actions is particularly pronounced this quarter.

Obviously, that integration, as Jim commented in his remarks, is largely behind us now, and the focus has returned to more normal things, including growth.

But we still, on the hiring side, Mitch, hired hundreds of brokers, net of departures last year. If you look at our departures relative to the headcount we have, particularly among our senior brokerage ranks, they're very, very low compared to our turnover in almost any other part of the business, and frankly, compared to turnover in almost any part of any major business, and there's a reason for that. And the reason for that is that we have a business, it includes our operating platform, our brand, our clients, our global network that allows those brokers to come here or stay here and generate considerably more volume than they can generate elsewhere. So through all of what made the headlines, particularly last year, we had a great year for recruiting, we had a great year for retention, and that has continued into this year.

And it is worth noting that while the capital markets and investment sales, in general, are down from where they were, particularly in 2015 and before. 2016 and so far this year, by historical measures, are still pretty good. And there is a massive amount of -- or capital that wants to be in commercial real estate for a bunch of reasons. Notably, you do get cash flow. Fundamentals are strong. Rents are in good shape. Vacancies are in good shape. There's pressure to grow rents in many markets. As you've heard from us and our competitors, it's not a loose market for construction loans, which means there's not going to be a lot of new product coming on. And there's not a lot of new product in the pipeline, which means that you should see fundamentals remain strong. By the way, that's really good news for our Development business.

We talked about the volumes slowing down by 1/3 or so last year. That's been similar this year. I can tell you that the average production of the inbound brokers is larger than the average production of the outbound brokers.

We adjust -- all of our adjustments in that area that you're asking about is to try to align the comp expense with the timing of when we realize those incentive gains. So when we're reversing an expense like we did in this quarter, it can be from a number of different quarters where, if you look back over the last few years, we made adjustments in the other direction.

But it is less than 10% of our Americas' revenues. Change is a good thing for us in general. When people are growing and adding space, that's good. When people are exiting spaces and looking for people to offload into, that's good. So retail is a good business for us, has been a good business, continues to be a good business. It's not dominant in our numbers. What we're seeing is a couple of trends. Number one, anything that has to do with experience retail, food and beverage-oriented stuff, is, in fact, quite active. Secondly, anything that's tends to be in and around these work, live, play type areas in major cities, the more urban areas, is really active and doing well. So we expect that to continue throughout the year. We expect the change to continue. Obviously, e-commerce is having a big impact on that. We do have the opportunity to be consultants to the retailers that we work for, and we get called on to do that fairly regularly. That's part of what we do as well.

Our volume with Freddie was down a little bit. Our volume with Fannie was up a bit. So the real strength for us in Q1 was driven by the life insurance companies. As you know, the numbers, quarter-to-quarter, can move around a bit with the agencies in particular. But overall, we expect it to be another solid year."

Results in the second quarter provide more evidence of the diversity and strength of our business. Adjusted EPS increased by 25%. Based on the robust results realized in the first half of the year, we are increasing full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.53 to $2.63.
Our regional services businesses continued to post strong results, led this quarter by broad-based strength in APAC and EMEA and double-digit growth from our global occupier outsourcing and capital markets businesses. Further, our regional services businesses together achieved solid margin expansion with the help of strong cost control.  As we reflect on this performance, a few key facts stand out. First, we are operating a well-balanced portfolio of market-leading businesses. Second, the quality of our people and globally-integrated capabilities, increasingly able by technology and data, are strengthening our competitive advantages. And finally, our prudent financial management has allowed us to improve profitability while making investments to further strengthen our position.
We've spoken with you about our strategy for making CBRE a better enterprise, one that is capable of producing superior client outcomes. This strategy is working and our people are continuing to execute at a high level.
Now Jim will take you through our second quarter results in detail."

As Bob noted, CBRE continued to produce great results in Q2. Let me start with a few highlights on Slide 5.
First, capital markets revenue, which includes property sales and commercial mortgage services combined, generated 12% revenue.
Second, our occupier outsourcing business continued to realize strong and steady fee revenue growth of 10% for the quarter, all of which was organic.
Third, margins on fee revenue increased 70 basis points to 16.4% in our combined regional services businesses.
Finally, we increased the pace of our M&A activity as more rational deal terms are returning to the market. Year-to-date, we closed 4 traditional infill acquisitions. In addition, we enhanced our market-leading technology platform by acquiring 2 Software-as-a-Service companies and making an equity investment in the third.
Please turn to Slide 6. CBRE produced solid top line organic growth in Q2. Gross revenue and fee revenue increased by 7% and 6%, respectively with virtually all of the growth being organic.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% in U.S. dollars to $413 million, outpacing fee revenue growth on expanding margins.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 25% in U.S. dollars to $0.65 for the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate improved to 27.2% in Q2 as we are taking steps to enhance the tax efficiency of our businesses and also realized a couple of one-time benefits in the quarter. The benefit of the improved tax rate is partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net gain of $0.04 for the quarter. We now expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29%.
Slide 7 summarizes our 3 regional services businesses, which together, produced a growth rate of 6% in fee revenue and 12% in adjusted EBITDA before FX impacts.
As Bob mentioned in the regions, our performance this quarter was led by Asia Pacific and EMEA. Asia Pacific posted an [ 18% ] increase in fee revenue with very strong growth in Australia, India, Japan and Singapore. EMEA fee revenue rose 13%, paced by significant gains in the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom where CBRE's activity levels continue to rebound strongly from the impact of last year's Brexit vote.
We had a soft quarter in the Americas with total fee revenue up 1%. A 15% increase in our occupier outsourcing business and a 9% increase in commercial mortgage services helped to offset relatively flat sales and a 6% decline in leasing revenues. Total adjusted EBITDA and operating leverage in the Americas were up modestly. This highlights the strength and diversification of our Americas business.
Slide 8 reviews our major global lines of business in Q2. Property sales revenue rose 13%, paced by robust growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA, which grew 45% and 42%, respectively. Asia Pacific saw a strong growth across the region, especially in Greater China, Japan and Singapore. EMEA's growth was led by the United Kingdom, where sales revenue surged 69% as well as a broad range of countries, including France, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands.
Americas sales revenue edged down 1% due primarily to a decrease in Canada. Our U.S. sales revenue was up slightly compared with an 8% decrease in the broader investment market according to preliminary estimates from Real Capital Analytics.
In Q2, our commercial mortgage services revenue increased by 10%. This business is more stable than property sales due in part to the recurring revenue generated by our now $154 billion loan servicing portfolio, which is up 16% from Q2 of last year.
Leasing revenue slipped 1% globally as growth of 10% in Asia Pac and 12% in EMEA was offset by weakness in the Americas. Leasing growth was particularly strong in Australia, India, Japan, Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom. The decrease in the Americas was primarily attributable to Manhattan, where we closed few very large deals which can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. The Manhattan leasing market remains relatively healthy and we maintain the leading position in the New York market. 
Our valuation business achieved solid growth of 7%, fueled by double-digit growth in EMEA, while property management grew fee revenue by 4%.
Please turn to Slide 9, regarding our occupier outsourcing business which is reported within the 3 regional service segments.  We continue to see steady growth in this business in Q2, with organic fee revenue up 10%. We experienced particularly strong growth in Canada, India, Mexico, Singapore and the United States.
The execution of our strategy has created the industry's premier outsourcing business, and is built on the strength of our entire diversified and integrated client offering. This business has grown organically at double digit annual rates for over a decade, which combined with strategic acquisitions, has enabled the more than 20-fold increase in revenue since 2006.  We are pursuing and increasingly winning global, multiservice mandates from major corporations like Adiant and Kimberly-Clark.  I'll expand on our new mandate from Kimberly-Clark, which while being one of many, illustrates CBRE's differentiated capabilities. 
Our mandate is to provide a transaction and project management services across Kimberly Clark's 65 million-square-foot portfolio of office, manufacturing, distribution and other facilities. For global clients like this, we might lease new offices for them in China, supervise construction in Continental Europe, dispose of surplus manufacturing facilities in Canada, and materially reduce facility-related operating expenses globally. We can also provide strategic advice on critically important real estate decisions, such as helping them to optimize their global supply chain or to develop a plan to transform their use of office space to attract top talent.  These are examples of our competitive advantages of scale, depth of offerings, broad expertise and ability to provide integrated solutions enabled by technology.
Please turn to Slide 10, regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Equity commitments climbed to $9 billion over the past 12 months, reflecting continued strong performance for our clients. AUM in the second quarter rose to $91.7 billion from $88.6 billion a year ago. In local currency, AUM increased by $2.6 billion. Note that our AUM does not yet include the effect of our Caledon Capital acquisition, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 6% in Q2 before adjusting for hedging impacts. After adjusting for hedging, Q2 was flat and year-to-date increased 4%.
Please turn to Slide 11, regarding our Development Services segment. This business continues to perform very well. Adjusted EBITDA contributions increased to $46.5 million from $18.5 million in Q2 '16. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is almost flat to prior year. We maintained a robust sales pipeline and continue to expect significant gains in the second half. Fee-only projects constitute half of our $6 billion total pipeline.
The realization of incentive income in our Department Services business can fluctuate in any given quarter but the longer-term performance has been outstanding. In addition, the business generates meaningful synergies with our services businesses.  I should note that our Development Services business, Trammell Crow Company, was named the U.S. Developer of the Year last month by NIOP, a testament to the quality of our people and operations.
Please turn to Slide 12. Algonquin my remarks about the quarter with 2 brief comments. First, Q2 results again highlight the benefit of our globally diversified business mix. Strong organic growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific as well as in global occupier outsourcing and capital markets more than offset the decline in transaction revenues in the Americas. This resulted in solid growth and operating leverage in our regional services businesses.
Second point I want to make is the strength of the company's balance sheet and free cash flow. Since acquiring Global Workplace Solutions for $1.5 billion less than 2 years ago, our leverage is essentially flat at 1.3x adjusted EBITDA.
Now please to turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

Our people around the world turned in an outstanding performance with earnings per share growth of 25% in the quarter, well ahead of the 10% average for S&P 500 companies that have reported. As I noted earlier, we have increased our outlook for 2017 adjusted EPS to a range of $2.53 to $2.63. At the midpoint of this range, this implies adjusted EPS growth of 12% for the full year.
Compared to our prior guidance given in February, we expect our leasing business to be slightly below and our capital markets business to be slightly above our initial expectations for the year. We expect fee revenue growth for occupier outsourcing business to be 10% or slightly higher. We expect adjusted EBITDA contributions from our Development Services and Investment Management businesses together to be flat to slightly up in 2017 versus our prior expectation of flat to slightly down.
Finally, the full year margins are now likely to be at the high-end of the previously guided 17.5% to 18% range despite a continued shift in business mix. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2017 is little changed from our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our expected benefit from a lower tax rate will be somewhat offset by growth in depreciation and amortization for a net benefit of about $0.02. We expect positive earnings growth in the second half from our regional services businesses and our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses. We enter the back-half of 2017 with a stable global economy and solid fundamentals in most commercial real estate markets.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

We do benefit a lot from that outsourcing business. The big percentage of the leasing rate we do comes from those clients while the brokers we hire come to us because they like the ability to work with those clients, which they wouldn't have otherwise. And so if you take that into account, that's a constant part of our business, right? It was there last year, it will be there this year, and it will be than the second half of next year. The second quarter Manhattan transaction circumstance will impact the full year, but we expect the leasing market overall to be a little less positive than we thought it was before even though the economies are generally doing nicely, there's a couple of things going on. In general, corporations are being very careful about costs. We're doing it and so are the other big corporations around the U.S. and around the world. And secondly, in a few markets, there have been limited circumstances were leases would have otherwise gotten done but there was an adequate big block of space to get them done, and so that's had a bit of an impact. But I'd say it's just a slight turn back from where we thought it was when we last reported."

So closed-end funds, open-end funds and even rates would do portfolio optimization, turnover 5% to 10% of their portfolio. That body of investors owns well more than twice the percentage of the market that they owned 10 years ago. And the rest of the market largely doesn't trade that much. Large families, government, institutions, various types of institutions. As we look out over some period of years, we see the opportunity for the volumes session potentially go up, go up quite a bit.

Based on the robust results realized in the first half of the year, we are increasing full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.53 to $2.63.
Our regional services businesses continued to post strong results, led this quarter by broad-based strength in APAC and EMEA and double-digit growth from our global occupier outsourcing and capital market businesses. Further, our regional services businesses together achieved solid margin expansion with the help of strong cost control. As we reflect on this performance, a few key facts stand out. First, we are operating a well-balanced portfolio of market-leading businesses. Second, the quality of our people and globally integrating capabilities, increasingly able by technology and data, are strengthening our competitive advantages. And finally, our prudent financial management has allowed us to improve profitability, while making investments to further strengthen our position.

As Bob noted, CBRE continued to produce great results in Q2. 
Let me start with a few highlights on Slide 5. First, capital markets revenue, which includes property sales and commercial mortgage services combined, generated 12% revenue growth.
Second, our occupier outsourcing business continued to realize strong and steady fee revenue growth of 10% for the quarter, all of which was organic.
Third, margins on fee revenue increased 70 basis points to 16.4% in our combined regional services businesses.
Finally, we increased the pace of our M&A activity as more rational deal terms are returning into the market. Year-to-date, we closed 4 traditional infill acquisitions. In addition, we enhanced our market-leading technology platform by acquiring 2 Software-as-a-Service companies and making an equity investment in the third.
Please turn to Slide 6. CBRE produced solid top line organic growth in Q2. Gross revenue and fee revenue increased by 7% and 6%, respectively, with virtually all of the growth being organic.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% in U.S. dollars to $413 million, outpacing fee revenue growth on expanding margins.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 25% in U.S. dollars to $0.65 for the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate improved to 27.2% in Q2 as we're taking steps to enhance the tax efficiency of our businesses and also realized a couple of one-time benefits in the quarter. The benefit of the improved tax rate is partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net gain of $0.04 for the quarter. We now expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29%.
Slide 7 summarizes our 3 regional services businesses, which, together, produced a growth rate of 6% in fee revenue and 12% in adjusted EBITDA before FX impacts.
As Bob mentioned in the regions, our performance this quarter was led by Asia Pac and EMEA. Asia Pac posted an 18% increase in fee revenue with very strong growth in Australia, India, Japan and Singapore. EMEA fee revenue rose 13%, paced by significant gains in the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, where CBRE's activity levels continue to rebound strongly from the impact of last year's Brexit vote.
We had a soft quarter in the Americas with total fee revenue up 1%. A 15% increase in our occupier outsourcing business and a 9% increase in commercial mortgage services helped to offset relatively flat sales and a 6% decline in leasing revenues. Total adjusted EBITDA and operating leverage in the Americas were up modestly. This highlights the strength and diversification of our Americas business.
Slide 8 reviews our major global lines of business in Q2. Property sales revenue rose 13%, paced by robust growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA, which grew 45% and 42%, respectively. Asia Pacific saw a strong growth across the region, especially in Greater China, Japan and Singapore. EMEA's growth was led by the United Kingdom, where sales revenue surged 69% as well as a broad range of countries, including France, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands.
Americas sales revenue edged down 1%, due primarily to a decrease in Canada. Our U.S. sales revenue was up slightly compared with an 8% decrease in the broader investment market according to preliminary estimates from Real Capital Analytics.
In Q2, our commercial mortgage services revenue increased by 10%. This business is more stable than property sales due in part to the recurring revenue generated by our now $154 billion loan servicing portfolio, which is up 16% from Q2 of last year.
Leasing revenue slipped 1% globally as growth of 10% in Asia Pac and 12% in EMEA was offset by weakness in the Americas. Leasing growth was particularly strong in Australia, India, Japan, Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom. The decrease in the Americas was primarily attributable to Manhattan, where we closed few very large deals, which can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. The Manhattan leasing market remains relatively healthy, and we maintain the leading position in the New York market.
Our valuation business achieved solid growth of 7%, fueled by double-digit growth in EMEA, while property management grew fee revenue by 4%.
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. We continue to see steady growth in this business in Q2, with our organic fee revenue up 10%. We experienced particularly strong growth in Canada, India, Mexico, Singapore and the United States.
The execution of our strategy has created the industry's premier outsourcing business, and is built on the strength of our entire diversified and integrated client offering. This business has grown organically at double digit annual rates for over a decade, which, combined with strategic acquisitions, has enabled a more than 20-fold increase in revenue since 2006. We're pursuing and increasingly winning global, multiservice mandates from major corporations like Adient and Kimberly-Clark. I'll expand on our new mandate from Kimberly-Clark, which, while being one of many, illustrates CBRE's differentiated capabilities.
Our mandate is to provide a transaction and project management services across Kimberly-Clark's 65 million-square-foot portfolio of office, manufacturing, distribution and other facilities. For global clients like this, we might lease new offices for them in China, supervise construction in Continental Europe, dispose of surplus manufacturing facilities in Canada, and materially reduce facility-related operating expenses globally. We can also provide strategic advice on critically important real estate decisions, such as helping them to optimize their global supply chain or to develop a plan to transform their use of office space to attract top talent. These are examples of our competitive advantages of scale, depth of offerings, broad expertise and ability to provide integrated solutions enabled by technology.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Equity commitments climbed to $9 billion over the past 12 months, reflecting continued strong performance for our clients. AUM in the second quarter rose to $91.7 billion from $88.6 billion a year ago. In local currency, AUM increased by $2.6 billion. Note that our AUM does not yet include the effect of our Caledon Capital acquisition, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 6% in Q2 before adjusting for hedging impacts. After adjusting for hedging, Q2 was flat and year-to-date increased 4%.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. This business continues to perform very well. Adjusted EBITDA contributions increased to $46.5 million from $18.5 million in Q2 '16. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is almost flat to prior year. We maintained a robust sales pipeline and continue to expect significant gains in the second half. Fee-only projects constitute half of our $6 billion total pipeline.
The realization of incentive income in our Department Services business can fluctuate in any given quarter, but the longer-term performance has been outstanding. In addition, the business generates meaningful synergies with our services businesses. I should note that our Development Services business, Trammell Crow Company, was named the U.S. Developer of the Year last month by NAIOP, a testament to the quality of our people and operations.
Please turn to Slide 12. I'll conclude my remarks about the quarter with 2 brief comments. First, Q2 results, again, highlight the benefit of our globally diversified business mix. Strong organic growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific as well as in global occupier outsourcing and capital markets more than offset a decline in transaction revenues in the Americas. This resulted in solid growth and operating leverage in our regional services businesses.
Second point I want to make is the strength of the company's balance sheet and free cash flow. Since acquiring Global Workplace Solutions for $1.5 billion less than 2 years ago, our leverage is essentially flat at 1.3x adjusted EBITDA.
Now please to turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

Our people around the world turned in an outstanding performance with earnings per share growth of 25% in the quarter, well ahead of the 10% average for S&P 500 companies that have reported. As I noted earlier, we have increased our outlook for 2017 adjusted EPS to a range of $2.53 to $2.63. At the midpoint of this range, this implies adjusted EPS growth of 12% for the full year.
Compared to our prior guidance given in February, we expect our leasing business to be slightly below and our capital markets business to be slightly above our initial expectations for the year. We expect fee revenue growth for our occupier outsourcing business to be 10% or slightly higher. We expect adjusted EBITDA contributions from our Development Services and Investment Management businesses together to be flat to slightly up in 2017 versus our prior expectation of flat to slightly down.
Finally, full year margins are now likely to be at the high-end of the previously guided 17.5% to 18% range despite a continued shift in business mix. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2017 is little changed from our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our expected benefit from a lower tax rate will be somewhat offset by growth in depreciation and amortization for a net benefit of about $0.02. We expect positive earnings growth in the second half from our regional services businesses and our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses. We enter the back-half of 2017 with a stable global economy and solid fundamentals in most commercial real estate markets.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

The second quarter Manhattan transaction circumstance will impact the full year, but we expect the leasing market overall to be a little less positive than we thought it was before even though the economy is generally doing nicely, there's a couple of things going on. In general, corporations are being very careful about costs. We're doing it and so are the other big corporations around the U.S. and around the world. And secondly, in a few markets, there have been limited circumstances where leases would have otherwise gotten done, but there was an adequate big blocks of space to get them done, and so that had a bit of an impact. But I'd say, it's just a slight turn back from where we thought it was when we last reported."

So on both sides, kind of, across the board in our capital markets business it was strong. The other piece I would mention is net sales, we're not talking about the mortgage origination and mortgage servicing, which is the other component of our capital markets business and -- we have a very, very strong recurring business there in mortgage servicing, which has been largely built organically over the last several years, almost a decade, with roughly $165 billion, that's up 16%, and that's also providing strong support to the overall capital markets' numbers."

But I think one part that we and the market sometimes miss around volumes in that business is that there is a, we believe, structural trend over time increasing the volumes of sales in the business, and that's being driven in large part by the fact that the owners who trade real estate are becoming a larger portion over the market. So closed-end funds, open-end funds, even REITs will do portfolio optimization, turnover 5% to 10% of their portfolio. That body of investors owns well more than twice the percentage of the market that they owned 10 years ago. And the rest of the market largely doesn't trade that much. Large families, government, institutions, various types of institutions. So as we look out over some period of years, we see the opportunity for the volumes to potentially go up quite a bit. But predicting what the volumes will be next year is a little hard. But I think it's important to understand kind of some of the underlying structural elements there beginning to hit the business."

Based on the robust results realized in the first half of the year, we are increasing full-year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.53 to $2.63.
Our regional services businesses continued to post strong results, led this quarter by broad-based strength in APAC and EMEA and double-digit growth from our global occupier outsourcing and capital market businesses. Further, our regional services businesses together achieved solid margin expansion with the help of strong cost control. As we reflect on this performance, a few key facts stand out. First, we are operating a well-balanced portfolio of market-leading businesses. Second, the quality of our people and globally integrated capabilities, increasingly abled by technology and data, are strengthening our competitive advantages. And finally, our prudent financial management has allowed us to improve profitability, while making investments to further strengthen our position.

As Bob noted, CBRE continued to produce great results in Q2. 
Let me start with a few highlights on Slide 5. First, capital markets revenue, which includes property sales and commercial mortgage services combined, generated 12% revenue growth.
Second, our occupier outsourcing business continued to realize strong and steady fee revenue growth of 10% for the quarter, all of which was organic.
Third, margins on fee revenue increased 70 basis points to 16.4% in our combined regional services businesses.
Finally, we increased the pace of our M&A activity as more rational deal terms are returning to the market. Year-to-date, we closed 4 traditional infill acquisitions. In addition, we enhanced our market-leading technology platform by acquiring 2 software-as-a-service companies and making an equity investment in a third.
Please turn to Slide 6. CBRE produced solid, top-line organic growth in Q2. Gross revenue and fee revenue increased by 7% and 6%, respectively, with virtually all of the growth being organic.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% in U.S. dollars to $413 million, outpacing fee revenue growth on expanding margins.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 25% in U.S. dollars to $0.65 for the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate improved to 27.2% in Q2 as we're taking steps to enhance the tax efficiency of our businesses and also realized a couple of one-time benefits in the quarter. The benefit of the improved tax rate is partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net gain of $0.04 for the quarter. We now expect our full-year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29%.
Slide 7 summarizes our 3 regional services businesses, which together produced a growth rate of 6% in fee revenue and 12% in adjusted EBITDA before FX impacts.
As Bob mentioned in the regions, our performance this quarter was led by Asia Pac and EMEA. Asia Pac posted an 18% increase in fee revenue with very strong growth in Australia, India, Japan and Singapore. EMEA fee revenue rose 13%, paced by significant gains in the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, where CBRE's activity levels continue to rebound strongly from the impact of last year's Brexit vote.
We had a soft quarter in the Americas with total fee revenue up 1%. A 15% increase in our occupier outsourcing business and a 9% increase in commercial mortgage services helped to offset relatively flat sales and a 6% decline in leasing revenues. Total adjusted EBITDA and operating leverage in the Americas were up modestly. This highlights the strength and diversification of our Americas business.
Slide 8 reviews our major global lines of business in Q2. Property sales revenue rose 13%, paced by robust growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA, which grew 45% and 42%, respectively. Asia Pacific saw a strong growth across the region, especially in Greater China, Japan and Singapore. EMEA's growth was led by the United Kingdom, where sales revenue surged 69%, as well as a broad range of countries, including France, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands.
Americas sales revenue edged down 1%, due primarily to a decrease in Canada. Our U.S. sales revenue was up slightly compared with an 8% decrease in the broader investment market according to preliminary estimates from Real Capital Analytics.
In Q2, our commercial mortgage services revenue increased by 10%. This business is more stable than property sales, due in part to the recurring revenue generated by our now $154 billion loan servicing portfolio, which is up 16% from Q2 of last year.
Leasing revenue slipped 1% globally as growth of 10% in Asia-Pac and 12% in EMEA was offset by weakness in the Americas. Leasing growth was particularly strong in Australia, India, Japan, Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom. The decrease in the Americas was primarily attributable to Manhattan, where we closed few very large deals, which can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. The Manhattan leasing market remains relatively healthy, and we maintain the leading position in the New York market.
Our valuation business achieved solid growth of 7%, fueled by double-digit growth in EMEA, while property management grew fee revenue by 4%.
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. We continue to see steady growth in this business in Q2, with organic fee revenue up 10%. We experienced particularly strong growth in Canada, India, Mexico, Singapore and the United States.
The execution of our strategy has created the industry's premier outsourcing business, and is built on the strength of our entire diversified and integrated client offering. This business has grown organically at double-digit annual rates for over a decade, which, combined with strategic acquisitions, has enabled a more than 20-fold increase in revenue since 2006. We're pursuing and increasingly winning global, multiservice mandates from major corporations like Adient and Kimberly-Clark. I'll expand on our new mandate from Kimberly-Clark, which, while being one of many, illustrates CBRE's differentiated capabilities.
Our mandate is to provide transaction and project management services across Kimberly-Clark's 65 million-square-foot portfolio of office, manufacturing, distribution and other facilities. For global clients like this, we might lease new offices for them in China, supervise construction in Continental Europe, dispose of surplus manufacturing facilities in Canada, and materially reduce facility-related operating expenses globally. We can also provide strategic advice on critically important real estate decisions, such as helping them to optimize their global supply chain or to develop a plan to transform their use of office space to attract top talent. These are examples of our competitive advantages of scale, depth of offerings, broad expertise and ability to provide integrated solutions enabled by technology.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Equity commitment climbed to $9 billion over the past 12 months, reflecting continued strong performance for our clients. AUM in the second quarter rose to $91.7 billion from $88.6 billion a year ago. In local currency, AUM increased by $2.6 billion. Note that our AUM does not yet include the effect of our Caledon Capital acquisition, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 6% in Q2 before adjusting for hedging impacts. After adjusting for hedging, Q2 was flat and year-to-date increased 4%.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. This business continues to perform very well. Adjusted EBITDA contributions increased to $46.5 million from $18.5 million in Q2 '16. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is almost flat to prior year. We maintain a robust sales pipeline and continue to expect significant gains in the second half. Fee-only projects constitute half of our $6 billion total pipeline.
The realization of incentive income in our Development Services business can fluctuate in any given quarter, but the longer-term performance has been outstanding. In addition, the business generates meaningful synergies with our services businesses. I should note that our Development Services business, Trammell Crow Company, was named the U.S. Developer of the Year last month by NAIOP, a testament to the quality of our people and operations.
Please turn to Slide 12. I'll conclude my remarks about the quarter with 2 brief comments. First, Q2 results again highlight the benefit of our globally diversified business mix. Strong organic growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific as well as in global occupier outsourcing and capital markets more than offset a decline in transaction revenues in the Americas. This resulted in solid growth and operating leverage in our regional services businesses.
Second point I want to make is the strength of the company's balance sheet and free cash flow. Since acquiring Global Workplace Solutions for $1.5 billion less than 2 years ago, our leverage is essentially flat at 1.3x adjusted EBITDA.
Now please to turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

Our people around the world turned in an outstanding performance with earnings per share growth of 25% in the quarter, well ahead of the 10% average for S&P 500 companies that have reported. As I noted earlier, we have increased our outlook for 2017 adjusted EPS to a range of $2.53 to $2.63. At the midpoint of this range, this implies adjusted EPS growth of 12% for the full year.
Compared to our prior guidance given in February, we expect our leasing business to be slightly below and our capital markets business to be slightly above our initial expectations for the year. We expect fee revenue growth for our occupier outsourcing business to be 10% or slightly higher. We expect adjusted EBITDA contributions from our Development Services and Investment Management businesses together to be flat to slightly up in 2017 versus our prior expectation of flat to slightly down.
Finally, full-year margins are now likely to be at the high end of the previously guided 17.5% to 18% range despite a continued shift in business mix. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2017 is little changed from our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our expected benefit from a lower tax rate will be somewhat offset by growth in depreciation and amortization for a net benefit of about $0.02. We expect positive earnings growth in the second half from our regional services businesses and our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses. We enter the back half of 2017 with a stable global economy and solid fundamentals in most commercial real estate markets.
With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions."

And so if you take that into account, that's a constant part of our business, right? It was there last year, it'll be there this year, and it'll be there in the second half of this year. The second quarter Manhattan transaction circumstance will impact the full year, but we expect the leasing market overall to be a little less positive than we thought it was before. Even though the economy is generally doing nicely, there's a couple of things going on. In general, corporations are being very careful about costs. We're doing it and so are the other big corporations around the U.S. and around the world. And secondly, in a few markets, there have been limited circumstances where leases would have otherwise gotten done, but there was inadequate big blocks of space to get them done, and so that's had a bit of an impact. But I'd say, it's just a slight turn back from where we thought it was when we last reported."

But I think one part that we and the market sometimes miss around volumes in that business is that there is a, we believe, a structural trend over time increasing the volumes of sales in the business, and that's being driven in large part by the fact that the owners who trade real estate are becoming a larger portion of the market. So closed-end funds, open-end funds, even REITs will do portfolio optimization, turn over 5% to 10% of their portfolio. That body of investors owns well more than twice the percentage of the market that they owned 10 years ago. And the rest of the market largely doesn't trade that much. Large families, government, institutions, various types of institutions. So as we look out over some period of years, we see the opportunity for the volumes to potentially go up quite a bit. But predicting what the volumes will be next year is a little hard. But I think it's important to understand kind of some of the underlying structural elements that are beginning to hit the business."

Results in the second quarter provide more evidence of the diversity and strength of our business. Adjusted EPS increased by 25%. Based on the robust results realized in the first half of the year, we are increasing full year guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.53 to $2.63.
Our regional services businesses continued to post strong results, led this quarter by broad-based strength in APAC and EMEA and double-digit growth from our global occupier outsourcing and capital market businesses. Further, our regional services businesses together achieved solid margin expansion with the help of strong cost control. As we reflect on this performance, a few key facts stand out. First, we are operating a well-balanced portfolio of market-leading businesses. Second, the quality of our people and globally integrated capabilities, increasingly abled by technology and data, are strengthening our competitive advantages. And finally, our prudent financial management has allowed us to improve profitability, while making investments to further strengthen our position.

As Bob noted, CBRE continued to produce great results in Q2. 
Let me start with a few highlights on Slide 5. First, capital markets revenue, which includes property sales and commercial mortgage services combined, generated 12% revenue growth.
Second, our occupier outsourcing business continued to realize strong and steady fee revenue growth of 10% for the quarter, all of which was organic.
Third, margins on fee revenue increased 70 basis points to 16.4% in our combined regional services businesses.
Finally, we increased the pace of our M&A activity as more rational deal terms are returning to the market. Year-to-date, we closed 4 traditional infill acquisitions. In addition, we enhanced our market-leading technology platform by acquiring 2 software-as-a-service companies and making an equity investment in a third.
Please turn to Slide 6. CBRE produced solid, top line organic growth in Q2. Gross revenue and fee revenue increased by 7% and 6%, respectively, with virtually all of the growth being organic.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% in U.S. dollars to $413 million, outpacing fee revenue growth on expanding margins.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 25% in U.S. dollars to $0.65 for the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate improved to 27.2% in Q2 as we're taking steps to enhance the tax efficiency of our businesses and also realized a couple of one-time benefits in the quarter. The benefit of the improved tax rate is partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net gain of $0.04 for the quarter. We now expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 29%.
Slide 7 summarizes our 3 regional services businesses, which together produced a growth rate of 6% in fee revenue and 12% in adjusted EBITDA before FX impacts.
As Bob mentioned in the regions, our performance this quarter was led by Asia Pac and EMEA. Asia Pac posted an 18% increase in fee revenue with very strong growth in Australia, India, Japan and Singapore. EMEA fee revenue rose 13%, paced by significant gains in the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, where CBRE's activity levels continue to rebound strongly from the impact of last year's Brexit vote.
We had a soft quarter in the Americas with total fee revenue up 1%. A 15% increase in our occupier outsourcing business and a 9% increase in commercial mortgage services helped to offset relatively flat sales and a 6% decline in leasing revenues. Total adjusted EBITDA and operating leverage in the Americas were up modestly. This highlights the strength and diversification of our Americas business.
Slide 8 reviews our major global lines of business in Q2. Property sales revenue rose 13%, paced by robust growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA, which grew 45% and 42%, respectively. Asia Pacific saw a strong growth across the region, especially in Greater China, Japan and Singapore. EMEA's growth was led by the United Kingdom, where sales revenue surged 69% as well as a broad range of countries, including France, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands.
Americas sales revenue edged down 1%, due primarily to a decrease in Canada. Our U.S. sales revenue was up slightly compared with an 8% decrease in the broader investment market according to preliminary estimates from Real Capital Analytics.
In Q2, our commercial mortgage services revenue increased by 10%. This business is more stable than property sales, due in part to the recurring revenue generated by our now $154 billion loan servicing portfolio, which is up 16% from Q2 of last year.
Leasing revenue slipped 1% globally as growth of 10% in Asia Pac and 12% in EMEA was offset by weakness in the Americas. Leasing growth was particularly strong in Australia, India, Japan, Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom. The decrease in the Americas was primarily attributable to Manhattan, where we closed few very large deals, which can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. The Manhattan leasing market remains relatively healthy, and we maintain the leading position in the New York market.
Our valuation business achieved solid growth of 7%, fueled by double-digit growth in EMEA, while property management grew fee revenue by 4%.
Please turn to Slide 9 regarding our occupier outsourcing business, which is reported within the 3 regional services segments. We continue to see steady growth in this business in Q2, with organic fee revenue up 10%. We experienced particularly strong growth in Canada, India, Mexico, Singapore and the United States.
The execution of our strategy has created the industry's premier outsourcing business, and is built on the strength of our entire diversified and integrated client offering. This business has grown organically at double-digit annual rates for over a decade, which, combined with strategic acquisitions, has enabled a more than 20-fold increase in revenue since 2006. We're pursuing and increasingly winning global, multiservice mandates from major corporations like Adient and Kimberly-Clark. I'll expand on our new mandate from Kimberly-Clark, which, while being one of many, illustrates CBRE's differentiated capabilities.
Our mandate is to provide transaction and project management services across Kimberly-Clark's 65 million-square-foot portfolio of office, manufacturing, distribution and other facilities. For global clients like this, we might lease new offices for them in China, supervise construction in Continental Europe, dispose of surplus manufacturing facilities in Canada, and materially reduce facility-related operating expenses globally. We can also provide strategic advice on critically important real estate decisions, such as helping them to optimize their global supply chain or to develop a plan to transform their use of office space to attract top talent. These are examples of our competitive advantages of scale, depth of offerings, broad expertise and ability to provide integrated solutions enabled by technology.
Please turn to Slide 10 regarding our Global Investment Management segment. Equity commitment climbed to $9 billion over the past 12 months, reflecting continued strong performance for our clients. AUM in the second quarter rose to $91.7 billion from $88.6 billion a year ago. In local currency, AUM increased by $2.6 billion. Note that our AUM does not yet include the effect of our Caledon Capital acquisition, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 6% in Q2 before adjusting for hedging impacts. After adjusting for hedging, Q2 was flat and year-to-date increased 4%.
Please turn to Slide 11 regarding our Development Services segment. This business continues to perform very well. Adjusted EBITDA contributions increased to $46.5 million from $18.5 million in Q2 '16. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is almost flat to prior year. We maintain a robust sales pipeline and continue to expect significant gains in the second half. Fee-only projects constitute half of our $6 billion total pipeline.
The realization of incentive income in our Development Services business can fluctuate in any given quarter, but the longer-term performance has been outstanding. In addition, the business generates meaningful synergies with our services businesses. I should note that our Development Services business, Trammell Crow Company, was named the U.S. Developer of the Year last month by NAIOP, a testament to the quality of our people and operations.
Please turn to Slide 12. I'll conclude my remarks about the quarter with 2 brief comments. First, Q2 results again highlight the benefit of our globally diversified business mix. Strong organic growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific as well as in global occupier outsourcing and capital markets more than offset a decline in transaction revenues in the Americas. This resulted in solid growth and operating leverage in our regional services businesses.
Second point I want to make is the strength of the company's balance sheet and free cash flow. Since acquiring Global Workplace Solutions for $1.5 billion less than 2 years ago, our leverage is essentially flat at 1.3x adjusted EBITDA.
Now please to turn to Slide 13 for Bob's closing remarks."

Our people around the world turned in an outstanding performance with earnings per share growth of 25% in the quarter, well ahead of the 10% average for S&P 500 companies that have reported. As I noted earlier, we have increased our outlook for 2017 adjusted EPS to a range of $2.53 to $2.63. At the midpoint of this range, this implies adjusted EPS growth of 12% for the full year.
Compared to our prior guidance given in February, we expect our leasing business to be slightly below and our capital markets business to be slightly above our initial expectations for the year. We expect fee revenue growth for our occupier outsourcing business to be 10% or slightly higher. We expect adjusted EBITDA contributions from our Development Services and Investment Management businesses together to be flat to slightly up in 2017 versus our prior expectation of flat to slightly down.
Finally, full year margins are now likely to be at the high end of the previously guided 17.5% to 18% range despite a continued shift in business mix. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2017 is little changed from our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our expected benefit from a lower tax rate will be somewhat offset by growth in depreciation and amortization for a net benefit of about $0.02. We expect positive earnings growth in the second half from our regional services businesses and our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses. We enter the back half of 2017 with a stable global economy and solid fundamentals in most commercial real estate markets.

A big percentage of the leasing work we do comes from those clients. A lot of the brokers we hire come to us because they like the ability to work with those clients, which they wouldn't have otherwise. And so if you take that into account, that's a constant part of our business, right? It was there last year, it'll be there this year, and it'll be there in the second half of this year. The second quarter Manhattan transaction circumstance will impact the full year, but we expect the leasing market overall to be a little less positive than we thought it was before. Even though the economy is generally doing nicely, there's a couple of things going on. In general, corporations are being very careful about costs. We're doing it and so are the other big corporations around the U.S. and around the world. And secondly, in a few markets, there have been limited circumstances where leases would have otherwise gotten done, but there was inadequate big blocks of space to get them done, and so that's had a bit of an impact. But I'd say, it's just a slight turn back from where we thought it was when we last reported."

But I think one part that we and the market sometimes miss around volumes in that business is that there is a, we believe, a structural trend over time increasing the volumes of sales in the business, and that's being driven in large part by the fact that the owners who trade real estate are becoming a larger portion of the market. So closed-end funds, open-end funds, even REITs will do portfolio optimization, turn over 5% to 10% of their portfolio. That body of investors owns well more than twice the percentage of the market that they owned 10 years ago. And the rest of the market largely doesn't trade that much. Large families, government, institutions, various types of institutions. So as we look out over some period of years, we see the opportunity for the volumes to potentially go up quite a bit.

As you've seen, CBRE produced another quarter of excellent results, with double-digit revenue growth and adjusted EPS up 28%. Our performance is the direct result of our focused strategy to produce exceptional outcomes for our clients and the commitment of our more than 75,000 professionals to executing our strategy.
The strength of our performance in the third quarter was broad based. Each of our 3 global regions produced solid growth, and trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is at an all-time high in each of the 3 global regions. 
Leasing returned to double-digit growth in the third quarter and was exceptionally strong in the United States. 
Revenue growth accelerated in our occupier outsourcing business as we continued to capitalize on our commanding position in this growing sector. 
Global property sales saw healthy growth despite a generally tepid market for transaction activity, reflecting the strength of our brand and our ability to take market share. 
Finally, we also had excellent performance in both of our real estate investment businesses: Global Investment Management and Development Services. 
Longer term, our outlook is supported by 3 significant industry trends that play to CBRE's strength as the world's largest commercial real estate services and investment company. The first is the growing demand for outsourced commercial real estate solutions. The second is the increased allocation by institutional investors to commercial real estate. The third trend is consolidation. Clients are awarding their work to fewer, more capable global service providers, which drives consolidation within our industry. We continue to make investments in our people, service offering and operating platform, particularly digital technology capabilities, to capture the opportunities created by these industry trends. 
With that, Jim will take you through our third quarter results in detail."

As Bob noted, CBRE continued to produce great results in Q3. Let me start with a few highlights on Slide 5. 
First, adjusted EBITDA growth was broad based, up in all 5 business segments and up 17% in total versus last year. 
Second, leasing revenue in the Americas increased 13%, led by the U.S., which is up 16%, as we continued to take market share. 
Third, adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue in our regional businesses was up 20 basis points to 15.9% despite a year-over-year decline in gains from mortgage servicing rights related to GSE lending. Excluding this impact, the margin on fee revenue in our regional businesses increased by 70 basis points. Margin on fee revenue for our entire business increased by 120 basis points overall to 17.7%. 
Fourth, we continued to deploy capital into attractive M&A opportunities. We have closed 9 acquisitions thus far this year and maintain an active pipeline. These investments enhance our core strategy and reflect our continued underwriting discipline.
Slide 6 summarizes our financial results. CBRE produced strong top line growth in Q3. Gross revenue and fee revenue increased by 10% and 9%, respectively, with virtually all growth being organic. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars to $412 million, reflecting positive operating leverage. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% in U.S. dollars to $0.64 for the quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate improved to 28.3% in Q3 '17 versus 33% in the prior year third quarter, and we continue to take steps to enhance our tax efficiency. The benefit of our lower tax rate in the quarter was mostly offset by increased depreciation and amortization when compared to prior year. 
You'll notice that we enhanced our segment-level and income statement reconciliation disclosures. We are also including a detailed history of revenue and EBITDA by segment as a supplemental disclosure posted on our website. These enhanced disclosures should further improve the overall financial transparency of our business for our investors. 
Slide 7 summarizes our 3 regional services businesses, which, as Bob mentioned, are all at record levels for adjusted EBITDA in the trailing 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 8% in the Americas, 12% in EMEA and 31% in Asia Pacific, excluding all currency effects. 
The regions together produced fee revenue growth of 10%. Asia Pacific was a notable performer in the quarter, posting an 18% fee revenue increase, supported by outsized growth in Greater China, India, Japan and Singapore. In the Americas, fee revenue increased 9%, with double-digit growth in occupier outsourcing and leasing. Brazil, Canada and the United States all exhibited strong overall growth. Growth of 8% in adjusted EBITDA in the Americas would have been 18%, excluding the gains from mortgage servicing rights. EMEA fee revenue rose 8%, paced by strong gains in the United Kingdom. 
Slide 8 reviews the performance of our major global lines of business in Q3. Revenue growth across these lines of business was almost entirely organic. As mentioned, leasing revenue rose 13% in the Americas and 16% in the U.S., paced by strong performance in New York City. Leasing increased by 4% in EMEA and 17% in Asia Pacific, where growth was especially strong in Australia, Greater China, India and Japan. 
Property sales revenue rose 9%, reflecting market share gains in an environment where global market volumes were relatively flat year-over-year. Our performance in property sales was paced by robust growth in Asia Pacific, which increased 33%, led by Australia, Greater China and Japan. 
Americas sales revenue improved 7% as robust gains in Brazil and Canada offset relatively flat revenue in the United States. CBRE extended its leading position in U.S. investment sales, with market share increasing by approximately 190 basis points versus last year's third quarter, according to Real Capital Analytics. 
EMEA sales revenue declined 2%, reflecting fewer, large transactions in Continental Europe, although growth remained strong in the U.K. 
Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 12%, driven almost entirely by lower gains on mortgage servicing rights related to our GSE businesses, which more than doubled in Q3 of the prior year. Notably, our loan servicing business saw a 24% increase in recurring revenue from our portfolio, which now totals $165 billion. We have begun to separately disclose our loan servicing revenue, which has more than doubled over the last 3 years and now represents nearly 30% of our year-to-date revenue from commercial mortgage services. Our supplemental disclosure includes a 3-year quarterly history of our loan servicing revenue, providing an enhanced view of this recurring revenue stream for our investors. 
Property management services produced solid fee revenue growth of 10% for the quarter. Revenue from our valuation business increased 4%. 
Slide 9 summarizes results for our occupier outsourcing business, where we continued to see strong growth, with fee revenue up 13% for the quarter. To illustrate our value proposition, let's look at a contract expansion we signed this quarter. 
Our client, CSC, was merging with a large division of Hewlett Packard Enterprises (sic) [ Hewlett Packard Enterprise ] to create DXC Technology. CBRE provided key support during the premerger period and subsequently expanded the relationship to include their entire 32-million-square-foot global portfolio for facilities management, transactions, project management and strategic consulting. In the most basic sense, for clients like DXC, we could be providing services that include managing the day-to-day operations of thousands of facilities and related capital improvement projects, advising on leasing new facilities and identifying and disposing of facilities that no longer meet the client's needs.
In summary, we dedicate an experienced leadership team to the client, supported by a global platform that includes market-leading technology, data analytics and the expertise of over 75,000 CBRE employees on the ground in over 100 countries. This is what we mean when we talk about our competitive advantages of scale, service scope and sector expertise. 
Slide 10 summarizes our Global Investment Management segment, where adjusted EBITDA increased 21% in Q3 and is up 10% year-to-date. Our Investment Management business continues to attract significant equity capital. Total commitments reached $9.4 billion over the past 12 months. AUM rose in the third quarter to $98.3 billion, up $10.4 billion from a year ago in U.S. dollars, or $2.6 billion, excluding the Caledon Capital acquisition, which was completed in August 2017. Positive FX movements added $2.2 billion to total AUM versus the prior year. 
Please turn to Slide 11, summarizing our Development Services segment. This business continues to produce outstanding results. Adjusted EBITDA contributions increased to $35.9 million from $15.7 million in Q3 2016. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is up 29% versus the prior year. I'll remind you that the timing of realizing incentive income can vary quarter-to-quarter. Our in-process and pipeline portfolios remain healthy, and we expect to realize meaningful income in the fourth quarter, though less than last year's fourth quarter. Our development pipeline stands at $5.4 billion, with fee-only and build-to-suit projects representing more than half of our pipeline.
Please turn to Slide 12. This quarter represents the 2-year anniversary of our closing on the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition and is a good time to reflect on our performance since then. Over this period, growth in employment and GDP has been slow and steady but not great, and property sales volumes have declined. Against this backdrop, I'd like to highlight 2 metrics. First, our trailing 12-month adjusted EPS has increased by 38% over the last 2 years compared to 5% growth in EPS for the S&P 500 over this period. Second, our leverage over this period has declined even after making a $1.5 billion acquisition. As of Q3, our leverage ratio is only 1x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA versus the 1.2x level we had immediately prior to our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. This reflects our strong cash flow and earnings growth over the past 2 years. We believe this performance highlights the strength of our company and our strategy. 
One housekeeping item before I turn the call back to Bob. We are moving our Annual Investor Day to early March of 2018. This will give us the benefit of having full year 2017 results when providing our outlook for 2018. We look forward to speaking with you again in early 2018. 
With that, please turn to Slide 13 as I turn the call over to Bob."

Last quarter, we updated our full year earnings guidance, and our results are generally trending above the midpoint of those expectations. We want to remind you that results in our regional services businesses in the fourth quarter of last year were exceptionally strong, with adjusted EBITDA up 30% from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA in our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses to decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter while still realizing an increase for the full year. To be clear, we continue to see healthy momentum across most of our businesses and regions, and we are increasing our full year 2017 guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.58 to $2.68.
We are very pleased with the strong performance we have delivered for our shareholders. The strength of our business, the quality of our people and the perception of our brand continue to improve. As a global market leader in commercial real estate services and investment, we are benefiting disproportionately from long-term trends that should support continued growth for our sector.
Please turn to Slide 14. Before we conclude, I want to take a moment to comment on CBRE's role in helping our clients respond to natural disasters. These capabilities were certainly put to the test this quarter with multiple events in the U.S., the Caribbean and Mexico City. Our disaster relief response teams mobilized quickly to keep our clients' facilities safe and operational. Our people often put their client responsibilities ahead of their own personal needs, and I can tell you that this extraordinary effort in a time of great need has not gone unnoticed by our customers. I want to thank everyone at CBRE who balanced their work commitments with their family and community obligations during the recent natural disasters.
With that, operator, we will open the line for questions."

As you've seen, CBRE produced another quarter of excellent results, with double-digit revenue growth and adjusted EPS up 28%. Our performance is the direct result of our focused strategy to produce exceptional outcomes for our clients and the commitment of our more than 75,000 professionals to executing our strategy.
The strength of our performance in the third quarter was broad based. Each of our 3 global regions produced solid growth, and trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is at an all-time high in each of the 3 global regions. 
Leasing returned to double-digit growth in the third quarter and was exceptionally strong in the United States. 
Revenue growth accelerated in our occupier outsourcing business as we continued to capitalize on our commanding position in this growing sector. 
Global property sales saw healthy growth despite a generally tepid market for transaction activity, reflecting the strength of our brand and our ability to take market share. 
Finally, we also had excellent performance in both of our real estate investment businesses: Global Investment Management and Development Services. 
Longer term, our outlook is supported by 3 significant industry trends that play to CBRE's strength as the world's largest commercial real estate services and investment company. The first is the growing demand for outsourced commercial real estate solutions. The second is the increased allocation by institutional investors to commercial real estate. The third trend is consolidation. Clients are awarding their work to fewer, more capable global service providers, which drives consolidation within our industry. We continue to make investments in our people, service offering and operating platform, particularly digital technology capabilities, to capture the opportunities created by these industry trends. 
With that, Jim will take you through our third quarter results in detail."

As Bob noted, CBRE continued to produce great results in Q3. Let me start with a few highlights on Slide 5. 
First, adjusted EBITDA growth was broad based, up in all 5 business segments and up 17% in total versus last year. 
Second, leasing revenue in the Americas increased 13%, led by the U.S., which is up 16%, as we continued to take market share. 
Third, adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue in our regional businesses was up 20 basis points to 15.9% despite a year-over-year decline in gains from mortgage servicing rights related to GSE lending. Excluding this impact, the margin on fee revenue in our regional businesses increased by 70 basis points. Margin on fee revenue for our entire business increased by 120 basis points overall to 17.7%. 
Fourth, we continued to deploy capital into attractive M&A opportunities. We have closed 9 acquisitions thus far this year and maintain an active pipeline. These investments enhance our core strategy and reflect our continued underwriting discipline.
Slide 6 summarizes our financial results. CBRE produced strong top line growth in Q3. Gross revenue and fee revenue increased by 10% and 9%, respectively, with virtually all growth being organic. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars to $412 million, reflecting positive operating leverage. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% in U.S. dollars to $0.64 for the quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate improved to 28.3% in Q3 '17 versus 33% in the prior year third quarter, and we continue to take steps to enhance our tax efficiency. The benefit of our lower tax rate in the quarter was mostly offset by increased depreciation and amortization when compared to prior year. 
You'll notice that we enhanced our segment-level and income statement reconciliation disclosures. We are also including a detailed history of revenue and EBITDA by segment as a supplemental disclosure posted on our website. These enhanced disclosures should further improve the overall financial transparency of our business for our investors. 
Slide 7 summarizes our 3 regional services businesses, which, as Bob mentioned, are all at record levels for adjusted EBITDA in the trailing 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 8% in the Americas, 12% in EMEA and 31% in Asia Pacific, excluding all currency effects. 
The regions together produced fee revenue growth of 10%. Asia Pacific was a notable performer in the quarter, posting an 18% fee revenue increase, supported by outsized growth in Greater China, India, Japan and Singapore. In the Americas, fee revenue increased 9%, with double-digit growth in occupier outsourcing and leasing. Brazil, Canada and the United States all exhibited strong overall growth. Growth of 8% in adjusted EBITDA in the Americas would have been 18%, excluding the gains from mortgage servicing rights. EMEA fee revenue rose 8%, paced by strong gains in the United Kingdom. 
Slide 8 reviews the performance of our major global lines of business in Q3. Revenue growth across these lines of business was almost entirely organic. As mentioned, leasing revenue rose 13% in the Americas and 16% in the U.S., paced by strong performance in New York City. Leasing increased by 4% in EMEA and 17% in Asia Pacific, where growth was especially strong in Australia, Greater China, India and Japan. 
Property sales revenue rose 9%, reflecting market share gains in an environment where global market volumes were relatively flat year-over-year. Our performance in property sales was paced by robust growth in Asia Pacific, which increased 33%, led by Australia, Greater China and Japan. 
Americas sales revenue improved 7% as robust gains in Brazil and Canada offset relatively flat revenue in the United States. CBRE extended its leading position in U.S. investment sales, with market share increasing by approximately 190 basis points versus last year's third quarter, according to Real Capital Analytics. 
EMEA sales revenue declined 2%, reflecting fewer, large transactions in Continental Europe, although growth remained strong in the U.K. 
Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 12%, driven almost entirely by lower gains on mortgage servicing rights related to our GSE businesses, which more than doubled in Q3 of the prior year. Notably, our loan servicing business saw a 24% increase in recurring revenue from our portfolio, which now totals $165 billion. We have begun to separately disclose our loan servicing revenue, which has more than doubled over the last 3 years and now represents nearly 30% of our year-to-date revenue from commercial mortgage services. Our supplemental disclosure includes a 3-year quarterly history of our loan servicing revenue, providing an enhanced view of this recurring revenue stream for our investors. 
Property management services produced solid fee revenue growth of 10% for the quarter. Revenue from our valuation business increased 4%. 
Slide 9 summarizes results for our occupier outsourcing business, where we continued to see strong growth, with fee revenue up 13% for the quarter. To illustrate our value proposition, let's look at a contract expansion we signed this quarter. 
Our client, CSC, was merging with a large division of Hewlett Packard Enterprises (sic) [ Hewlett Packard Enterprise ] to create DXC Technology. CBRE provided key support during the premerger period and subsequently expanded the relationship to include their entire 32-million-square-foot global portfolio for facilities management, transactions, project management and strategic consulting. In the most basic sense, for clients like DXC, we could be providing services that include managing the day-to-day operations of thousands of facilities and related capital improvement projects, advising on leasing new facilities and identifying and disposing of facilities that no longer meet the client's needs.
In summary, we dedicate an experienced leadership team to the client, supported by a global platform that includes market-leading technology, data analytics and the expertise of over 75,000 CBRE employees on the ground in over 100 countries. This is what we mean when we talk about our competitive advantages of scale, service scope and sector expertise. 
Slide 10 summarizes our Global Investment Management segment, where adjusted EBITDA increased 21% in Q3 and is up 10% year-to-date. Our Investment Management business continues to attract significant equity capital. Total commitments reached $9.4 billion over the past 12 months. AUM rose in the third quarter to $98.3 billion, up $10.4 billion from a year ago in U.S. dollars or $2.6 billion, excluding the Caledon Capital acquisition, which was completed in August 2017. Positive FX movements added $2.2 billion to total AUM versus the prior year. 
Please turn to Slide 11 summarizing our Development Services segment. This business continues to produce outstanding results. Adjusted EBITDA contributions increased to $35.9 million from $15.7 million in Q3 2016. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is up 29% versus the prior year. 
I'll remind you that the timing of realizing incentive income can vary quarter-to-quarter. Our in-process and pipeline portfolios remain healthy, and we expect to realize meaningful income in the fourth quarter, though less than last year's fourth quarter. 
Our development pipeline stands at $5.4 billion, with fee-only and build-to-suit projects representing more than half of our pipeline.
Please turn to Slide 12. 
This quarter represents the 2-year anniversary of our closing on the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition and is a good time to reflect on our performance since then. 
Over this period, growth in employment and GDP has been slow and steady but not great, and property sales volumes have declined. Against this backdrop, I'd like to highlight 2 metrics. First, our trailing 12-month adjusted EPS has increased by 38% over the last 2 years compared to 5% growth in EPS for the S&P 500 over this period. 
Second, our leverage over this period has declined even after making a $1.5 billion acquisition. As of Q3, our leverage ratio is only 1x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA versus the 1.2x level we had immediately prior to our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. This reflects our strong cash flow and earnings growth over the past 2 years. We believe this performance highlights the strength of our company and our strategy. 
One housekeeping item before I turn the call back to Bob. 
We are moving our Annual Investor Day to early March of 2018. This will give us the benefit of having full year 2017 results when providing our outlook for 2018. We look forward to speaking with you again in early 2018. 
With that, please turn to Slide 13 as I turn the call over to Bob."

2017 is proving to be another outstanding year for CBRE. Last quarter, we updated our full year earnings guidance, and our results are generally trending above the midpoint of those expectations. We want to remind you that results in our regional services businesses in the fourth quarter of last year were exceptionally strong, with adjusted EBITDA up 30% from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA in our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses to decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter while still realizing an increase for the full year. To be clear, we continue to see healthy momentum across most of our businesses and regions, and we are increasing our full year 2017 guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.58 to $2.68.
We are very pleased with the strong performance we have delivered for our shareholders. The strength of our business, the quality of our people and the perception of our brand continue to improve. As a global market leader in commercial real estate services and investment, we are benefiting disproportionately from long-term trends that should support continued growth for our sector.
Please turn to Slide 14. 
Before we conclude, I want to take a moment to comment on CBRE's role in helping our clients respond to natural disasters. These capabilities were certainly put to the test this quarter with multiple events in the U.S., the Caribbean and Mexico City. Our disaster relief response teams mobilized quickly to keep our clients' facilities safe and operational. Our people often put their client responsibilities ahead of their own personal needs, and I can tell you that this extraordinary effort in a time of great need has not gone unnoticed by our customers. I want to thank everyone at CBRE who balanced their work commitments with their family and community obligations during the natural disasters.
With that, operator, we will open the line for questions."

Client satisfaction has gone way up, which positions us well to sell new services to them and do more of what we're already doing for them. But in the vein of the question you're asking, I think it's worth noting that we have a lot of cross-sell opportunities all over our business when we do work with those big clients.

This will be the fourth or fifth year in a row where we've recruited, net of departure, several hundred producers around the world. Much like when we do infill acquisitions, we have an advantage in terms of the cost that we pay to recruit or the cost that we pay to retain because brokers that come to our platform or stay on our platform can produce more revenues for themselves and their company here than they do elsewhere. That's a well-proven dynamic. And so recruiting and retention are going well. I think the pressures are actually a little less this year than they were last year.

As you've seen, CBRE produced another quarter of excellent results, with double-digit revenue growth and adjusted EPS up 28%. Our performance is the direct result of our focused strategy to produce exceptional outcomes for our clients and the commitment of our more than 75,000 professionals to executing our strategy.
The strength of our performance in the third quarter was broad based. Each of our 3 global regions produced solid growth, and trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is at an all-time high in each of the 3 global regions. 
Leasing returned to double-digit growth in the third quarter and was exceptionally strong in the United States. 
Revenue growth accelerated in our occupier outsourcing business as we continue to capitalize on our commanding position in this growing sector. 
Global property sales saw healthy growth despite a generally tepid market for transaction activity, reflecting the strength of our brand and our ability to take market share. 
Finally, we also had excellent performance in both of our real estate investment businesses: Global Investment Management and Development Services. 
Longer term, our outlook is supported by 3 significant industry trends that play to CBRE's strength as the world's largest commercial real estate services and investment company. The first is the growing demand for outsourced commercial real estate solutions. The second is the increased allocation by institutional investors to commercial real estate. The third trend is consolidation. Clients are awarding their work to fewer, more capable global service providers, which drives consolidation within our industry. We continue to make investments in our people, service offering and operating platform, particularly digital technology capabilities, to capture the opportunities created by these industry trends. 
With that, Jim will take you through our third quarter results in detail."

As Bob noted, CBRE continued to produce great results in Q3. Let me start with a few highlights on Slide 5. 
First, adjusted EBITDA growth was broad based, up in all 5 business segments and up 17% in total versus last year. 
Second, leasing revenue in the Americas increased 13%, led by the U.S., which was up 16%, as we continued to take market share. 
Third, adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue in our regional businesses was up 20 basis points to 15.9% despite a year-over-year decline in gains from mortgage servicing rights related to GSE lending. Excluding this impact, the margin on fee revenue in our regional businesses increased by 70 basis points. Margin on fee revenue for our entire business increased by 120 basis points overall to 17.7%. 
Fourth, we continued to deploy capital into attractive M&A opportunities. We have closed 9 acquisitions thus far this year and maintain an active pipeline. These investments enhance our core strategy and reflect our continued underwriting discipline.
Slide 6 summarizes our financial results. CBRE produced strong top line growth in Q3. Gross revenue and fee revenue increased by 10% and 9%, respectively, with virtually all growth being organic. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars to $412 million, reflecting positive operating leverage. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% in U.S. dollars to $0.64 for the quarter. 
Our adjusted tax rate improved to 28.3% in Q3 '17 versus 33% in the prior year third quarter, and we continue to take steps to enhance our tax efficiency. The benefit of our lower tax rate in the quarter was mostly offset by increased depreciation and amortization when compared to prior year. 
You'll notice that we enhanced our segment-level and income statement reconciliation disclosures. We are also including a detailed history of revenue and EBITDA by segment as a supplemental disclosure posted on our website. These enhanced disclosures should further improve the overall financial transparency of our business for our investors. 
Slide 7 summarizes our 3 regional services businesses, which, as Bob mentioned, are all at record levels for adjusted EBITDA in the trailing 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 8% in the Americas, 12% in EMEA and 31% in Asia Pacific, excluding all currency effects. 
The regions together produced fee revenue growth of 10%. Asia Pacific was a notable performer in the quarter, posting an 18% fee revenue increase, supported by outsized growth in Greater China, India, Japan and Singapore. In the Americas, fee revenue increased 9%, with double-digit growth in occupier outsourcing and leasing. Brazil, Canada and the United States all exhibited strong overall growth. Growth of 8% in adjusted EBITDA in the Americas would have been 18%, excluding the gains from mortgage servicing rights. EMEA fee revenue rose 8%, paced by strong gains in the United Kingdom. 
Slide 8 reviews the performance of our major global lines of business in Q3. Revenue growth across these lines of business was almost entirely organic. As mentioned, leasing revenue rose 13% in the Americas and 16% in the U.S., paced by strong performance in New York City. Leasing increased by 4% in EMEA and 17% in Asia Pacific, where growth was especially strong in Australia, Greater China, India and Japan. 
Property sales revenue rose 9%, reflecting market share gains in an environment where global market volumes were relatively flat year-over-year. Our performance in property sales was paced by robust growth in Asia Pacific, which increased 33%, led by Australia, Greater China and Japan. 
Americas sales revenue improved 7% as robust gains in Brazil and Canada offset relatively flat revenue in the United States. CBRE extended its leading position in U.S. investment sales, with market share increasing by approximately 190 basis points versus last year's third quarter, according to Real Capital Analytics. 
EMEA sales revenue declined 2%, reflecting fewer, large transactions in Continental Europe, although growth remained strong in the U.K. 
Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 12%, driven almost entirely by lower gains on mortgage servicing rights related to our GSE businesses, which more than doubled in Q3 of the prior year. Notably, our loan servicing business saw a 24% increase in recurring revenue from our portfolio, which now totals $165 billion. We have begun to separately disclose our loan servicing revenue, which has more than doubled over the last 3 years and now represents nearly 30% of our year-to-date revenue from commercial mortgage services. Our supplemental disclosure includes a 3-year quarterly history of our loan servicing revenue, providing an enhanced view of this recurring revenue stream for our investors. 
Property management services produced solid fee revenue growth of 10% for the quarter. Revenue from our valuations business increased 4%. 
Slide 9 summarizes results for our occupier outsourcing business, where we continue to see strong growth, with fee revenue up 13% for the quarter. To illustrate our value proposition, let's look at a contract expansion we signed this quarter. 
Our client, CSC, was merging with a large division of Hewlett Packard Enterprises (sic) [ Hewlett Packard Enterprise ] to create DXC Technology. CBRE provided key support during the premerger period and subsequently expanded the relationship to include their entire 32-million-square-foot global portfolio for facilities management, transactions, project management and strategic consulting. In the most basic sense, for clients like DXC, we could be providing services that include managing the day-to-day operations of thousands of facilities and related capital improvement projects, advising on leasing new facilities and identifying and disposing of facilities that no longer meet the client's needs.
In summary, we dedicate an experienced leadership team to the client, supported by a global platform that includes market-leading technology, data analytics and the expertise of over 75,000 CBRE employees on the ground in over 100 countries. This is what we mean when we talk about our competitive advantages of scale, service scope and sector expertise. 
Slide 10 summarizes our Global Investment Management segment, where adjusted EBITDA increased 21% in Q3 and is up 10% year-to-date. Our Investment Management business continues to attract significant equity capital. Total commitments reached $9.4 billion over the past 12 months. AUM rose in the third quarter to $98.3 billion, up USD 10.4 billion from a year ago or $2.6 billion, excluding the Caledon Capital acquisition, which was completed in August 2017. Positive FX movements added $2.2 billion to total AUM versus the prior year. 
Please turn to Slide 11 summarizing our Development Services segment. This business continues to produce outstanding results. Adjusted EBITDA contributions increased to $35.9 million from $15.7 million in Q3 2016. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is up 29% versus the prior year. 
I'll remind you that the timing of realizing incentive income can vary quarter-to-quarter. Our in-process and pipeline portfolios remain healthy, and we expect to realize meaningful income in the fourth quarter, though less than last year's fourth quarter. 
Our development pipeline stands at $5.4 billion, with fee-only and build-to-suit projects representing more than half of our pipeline.
Please turn to Slide 12. 
This quarter represents the 2-year anniversary of our closing on the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition and is a good time to reflect on our performance since then. 
Over this period, growth in employment and GDP has been slow and steady but not great, and property sales volumes have declined. Against this backdrop, I'd like to highlight 2 metrics. First, our trailing 12-month adjusted EPS has increased by 38% over the last 2 years compared to 5% growth in EPS for the S&P 500 over this period. 
Second, our leverage over this period has declined even after making a $1.5 billion acquisition. As of Q3, our leverage ratio is only 1x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA versus the 1.2x level we had immediately prior to our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. This reflects our strong cash flow and earnings growth over the past 2 years. We believe this performance highlights the strength of our company and our strategy. 
One housekeeping item before I turn the call back to Bob. 
We are moving our Annual Investor Day to early March of 2018. This will give us the benefit of having full year 2017 results when providing our outlook for 2018. We look forward to speaking with you again in early 2018.

2017 is proving to be another outstanding year for CBRE. Last quarter, we updated our full year earnings guidance, and our results are generally trending above the midpoint of those expectations. We want to remind you that results in our regional services businesses in the fourth quarter of last year were exceptionally strong, with adjusted EBITDA up 30% from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA in our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses to decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter while still realizing an increase for the full year. To be clear, we continue to see healthy momentum across most of our businesses and regions, and we are increasing our full year 2017 guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.58 to $2.68.
We are very pleased with the strong performance we have delivered for our shareholders. The strength of our business, the quality of our people and the perception of our brand continue to improve. As a global market leader in commercial real estate services and investment, we are benefiting disproportionately from long-term trends that should support continued growth for our sector.
Please turn to Slide 14. 
Before we conclude, I want to take a moment to comment on CBRE's role in helping our clients respond to natural disasters. These capabilities were certainly put to the test this quarter with multiple events in the U.S., the Caribbean and Mexico City. Our disaster relief response teams mobilized quickly to keep our clients' facilities safe and operational. Our people often put their client responsibilities ahead of their own personal needs, and I can tell you that this extraordinary effort in a time of great need has not gone unnoticed by our customers. I want to thank everyone at CBRE who balanced their work commitments with their family and community obligations during the recent natural disasters.
With that, operator, we will open the line for questions."

But the fact of the matter is there's plenty of capital out there, and the product that's coming to market is well leased with good tenants, and we see that at market -- while transactions have certainly slowed down from their peak in 2015. It's still a healthy market out there, and we've had nice growth in our investment sales business around the world."

This will be the fourth or fifth year in a row where we've recruited, net of departure, several hundred producers around the world.

As you've seen, CBRE produced another quarter of excellent results, with double-digit revenue growth and adjusted EPS up 28%. Our performance is the direct result of our focused strategy to produce exceptional outcomes for our clients and the commitment of our more than 75,000 professionals to executing our strategy.
The strength of our performance in the third quarter was broad based. Each of our 3 global regions produced solid growth, and trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is at an all-time high in each of the 3 global regions. 
Leasing returned to double-digit growth in the third quarter and was exceptionally strong in the United States. 
Revenue growth accelerated in our occupier outsourcing business as we continue to capitalize on our commanding position in this growing sector. 
Global property sales saw healthy growth despite a generally tepid market for transaction activity, reflecting the strength of our brand and our ability to take market share. 
Finally, we also had excellent performance in both of our real estate investment businesses: Global Investment Management and Development Services. 
Longer term, our outlook is supported by 3 significant industry trends that play to CBRE's strength as the world's largest commercial real estate services and investment company. The first is the growing demand for outsourced commercial real estate solutions. The second is the increased allocation by institutional investors to commercial real estate. The third trend is consolidation. Clients are awarding their work to fewer, more capable global service providers, which drives consolidation within our industry. We continue to make investments in our people, service offering and operating platform, particularly digital technology capabilities, to capture the opportunities created by these industry trends. 
With that, Jim will take you through our third quarter results in detail."

As Bob noted, CBRE continued to produce great results in Q3. Let me start with a few highlights on Slide 5. First, adjusted EBITDA growth was broad based, up in all 5 business segments and up 17% in total versus last year. Second, leasing",1385,"Thank you, Bob. As Bob noted, CBRE continued to produce great results in Q3. Let me start with a few highlights on Slide 5. First, adjusted EBITDA growth was broad based, up in all 5 business segments and up 17% in total versus last year. Second, leasing revenue in the Americas increased 13%, led by the U.S., which was up 16%, as we continued to take market share. 
Third, adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue in our regional businesses was up 20 basis points to 15.9% despite a year-over-year decline in gains from mortgage servicing rights related to GSE lending. Excluding this impact, the margin on fee revenue in our regional businesses increased by 70 basis points. Margin on fee revenue for our entire business increased by 120 basis points overall to 17.7%. Fourth, we continued to deploy capital into attractive M&A opportunities. We have closed 9 acquisitions thus far this year and maintain an active pipeline. These investments enhance our core strategy and reflect our continued underwriting discipline.
Slide 6 summarizes our financial results. CBRE produced strong top line growth in Q3. Gross revenue and fee revenue increased by 10% and 9%, respectively, with virtually all growth being organic. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars to $412 million, reflecting positive operating leverage. Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% in U.S. dollars to $0.64 for the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate improved to 28.3% in Q3 '17 versus 33% in the prior year third quarter, and we continue to take steps to enhance our tax efficiency. The benefit of our lower tax rate in the quarter was mostly offset by increased depreciation and amortization when compared to prior year. 
You'll notice that we enhanced our segment-level and income statement reconciliation disclosures. We are also including a detailed history of revenue and EBITDA by segment as a supplemental disclosure posted on our website. These enhanced disclosures should further improve the overall financial transparency of our business for our investors. 
Slide 7 summarizes our 3 regional services businesses, which, as Bob mentioned, are all at record levels for adjusted EBITDA in the trailing 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 8% in the Americas, 12% in EMEA and 31% in Asia Pacific, excluding all currency effects. 
The regions together produced fee revenue growth of 10%. Asia Pacific was a notable performer in the quarter, posting an 18% fee revenue increase, supported by outsized growth in Greater China, India, Japan and Singapore. In the Americas, fee revenue increased 9%, with double-digit growth in occupier outsourcing and leasing. Brazil, Canada and the United States all exhibited strong overall growth. Growth of 8% in adjusted EBITDA in the Americas would have been 18%, excluding the gains from mortgage servicing rights. EMEA fee revenue rose 8%, paced by strong gains in the United Kingdom. 
Slide 8 reviews the performance of our major global lines of business in Q3. Revenue growth across these lines of business was almost entirely organic. As mentioned, leasing revenue rose 13% in the Americas and 16% in the U.S., paced by strong performance in New York City. Leasing increased by 4% in EMEA and 17% in Asia Pacific, where growth was especially strong in Australia, Greater China, India and Japan. 
Property sales revenue rose 9%, reflecting market share gains in an environment where global market volumes were relatively flat year-over-year. Our performance in property sales was paced by robust growth in Asia Pacific, which increased 33%, led by Australia, Greater China and Japan. 
Americas sales revenue improved 7% as robust gains in Brazil and Canada offset relatively flat revenue in the United States. CBRE extended its leading position in U.S. investment sales, with market share increasing by approximately 190 basis points versus last year's third quarter, according to Real Capital Analytics. EMEA sales revenue declined 2%, reflecting fewer, large transactions in Continental Europe, although growth remained strong in the U.K. 
Commercial mortgage origination revenue declined 12%, driven almost entirely by lower gains on mortgage servicing rights related to our GSE businesses, which more than doubled in Q3 of the prior year. Notably, our loan servicing business saw a 24% increase in recurring revenue from our portfolio, which now totals $165 billion. We have begun to separately disclose our loan servicing revenue, which has more than doubled over the last 3 years and now represents nearly 30% of our year-to-date revenue from commercial mortgage services. Our supplemental disclosure includes a 3-year quarterly history of our loan servicing revenue, providing an enhanced view of this recurring revenue stream for our investors. 
Property management services produced solid fee revenue growth of 10% for the quarter. Revenue from our valuations business increased 4%. 
Slide 9 summarizes results for our occupier outsourcing business, where we continue to see strong growth, with fee revenue up 13% for the quarter. To illustrate our value proposition, let's look at a contract expansion we signed this quarter. 
Our client, CSC, was merging with a large division of Hewlett Packard Enterprises (sic) [ Hewlett Packard Enterprise ] to create DXC Technology. CBRE provided key support during the premerger period and subsequently expanded the relationship to include their entire 32-million-square-foot global portfolio for facilities management, transactions, project management and strategic consulting. In the most basic sense, for clients like DXC, we could be providing services that include managing the day-to-day operations of thousands of facilities and related capital improvement projects, advising on leasing new facilities and identifying and disposing of facilities that no longer meet the client's needs.
In summary, we dedicate an experienced leadership team to the client, supported by a global platform that includes market-leading technology, data analytics and the expertise of over 75,000 CBRE employees on the ground in over 100 countries. This is what we mean when we talk about our competitive advantages of scale, service scope and sector expertise. 
Slide 10 summarizes our Global Investment Management segment, where adjusted EBITDA increased 21% in Q3 and is up 10% year-to-date. Our Investment Management business continues to attract significant equity capital. Total commitments reached $9.4 billion over the past 12 months. AUM rose in the third quarter to $98.3 billion, up USD 10.4 billion from a year ago or $2.6 billion, excluding the Caledon Capital acquisition, which was completed in August 2017. Positive FX movements added $2.2 billion to total AUM versus the prior year. 
Please turn to Slide 11 summarizing our Development Services segment. This business continues to produce outstanding results. Adjusted EBITDA contributions increased to $35.9 million from $15.7 million in Q3 2016. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA is up 29% versus the prior year. 
I'll remind you that the timing of realizing incentive income can vary quarter-to-quarter. Our in-process and pipeline portfolios remain healthy, and we expect to realize meaningful income in the fourth quarter, though less than last year's fourth quarter. 
Our development pipeline stands at $5.4 billion, with fee-only and build-to-suit projects representing more than half of our pipeline.
Please turn to Slide 12. This quarter represents the 2-year anniversary of our closing on the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition and is a good time to reflect on our performance since then. 
Over this period, growth in employment and GDP has been slow and steady but not great, and property sales volumes have declined. Against this backdrop, I'd like to highlight 2 metrics. First, our trailing 12-month adjusted EPS has increased by 38% over the last 2 years compared to 5% growth in EPS for the S&P 500 over this period. 
Second, our leverage over this period has declined even after making a $1.5 billion acquisition. As of Q3, our leverage ratio is only 1x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA versus the 1.2x level we had immediately prior to our acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions. This reflects our strong cash flow and earnings growth over the past 2 years. We believe this performance highlights the strength of our company and our strategy. 
One housekeeping item before I turn the call back to Bob. We are moving our Annual Investor Day to early March of 2018. This will give us the benefit of having full year 2017 results when providing our outlook for 2018. We look forward to speaking with you again in early 2018. 
With that, please turn to Slide 13 as I turn the call over to Bob."

Last quarter, we updated our full year earnings guidance, and our results are generally trending above the midpoint of those expectations. We want to remind you that results in our regional services businesses in the fourth quarter of last year were exceptionally strong, with adjusted EBITDA up 30% from the prior year. Additionally, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA in our combined Investment Management and Development Services businesses to decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter while still realizing an increase for the full year. To be clear, we continue to see healthy momentum across most of our businesses and regions, and we are increasing our full year 2017 guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.58 to $2.68.
We are very pleased with the strong performance we have delivered for our shareholders. The strength of our business, the quality of our people and the perception of our brand continue to improve. As a global market leader in commercial real estate services and investment, we are benefiting disproportionately from long-term trends that should support continued growth for our sector.
Please turn to Slide 14. Before we conclude, I want to take a moment to comment on CBRE's role in helping our clients respond to natural disasters. These capabilities were certainly put to the test this quarter with multiple events in the U.S., the Caribbean and Mexico City. Our disaster relief response teams mobilized quickly to keep our clients' facilities safe and operational. Our people often put their client responsibilities ahead of their own personal needs, and I can tell you that this extraordinary effort in a time of great need has not gone unnoticed by our customers. I want to thank everyone at CBRE who balanced their work commitments with their family and community obligations during the recent natural disasters.
With that, operator, we will open the line for questions."

This will be the fourth or fifth year in a row where we've recruited, net of departure, several hundred producers around the world. Much like when we do infill acquisitions, we have an advantage in terms of the cost that we pay to recruit or the cost that we pay to retain because brokers that come to our platform or stay on our platform can produce more revenues for themselves and their company here than they do elsewhere. That's a well-proven dynamic. And so recruiting and retention are going well. I think the pressures are actually a little less this year than they were last year. Things have settled out in the industry. And as Jim said, that's been the case for infill acquisitions as well. So we're seeing good opportunities, and we're executing well against those opportunities."
