With customer expectations changing faster than ever, it's important that we remain focused on the customer. Our strong financial position has enabled us to make significant investments over the past 5 years. Through these investments, we've been able to strengthen our foundation and grow our business. And as we move forward, this gives us a platform for enhanced capabilities to better serve customers and increase market share. While we're mindful of the ever-changing and challenging retail environment, it also presents us with many opportunities. 
Our focus in 2016 was to improve both the customer experience and our productivity. We've been pleased with our team's efforts to adjust our operating model to meet the changing needs of customers. These efforts, particularly around inventory management and operating efficiencies, have contributed positively to our results. Our fourth quarter comp sales decreased 0.9%. While this was consistent with recent trends, it was below our plan, particularly for our full-line store business.
Early in the year, our team took aggressive steps to realign inventory in response to changes in customer demand. As a result of these efforts, fourth quarter sales growth outpaced inventory growth by nearly 500 basis points. This enabled the flow of newness and resulted in fewer markdowns, which contributed to our gross profit increase of more than 100 basis points.
For our Nordstrom brand, inclusive of our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, comp sales decreased 2.7%. While we are not satisfied with these results, it's worth noting that we continue to see a greater share of our business shifting to regular price. Promotional sales in response to the competitive environment lessened relative to last year, demonstrating our momentum with growing relative brands, including limited distribution product.
For our Nordstrom Rack business, inclusive of online, comp sales increased 4.3% in the fourth quarter. For the year, our increase of 4.5% exceeded our plan. 
As we look ahead, we are focused on speed, convenience and personalization, culminating to our most important goal of improving service. We currently offer a number of ways to serve customers on their terms, wherever and however they shop. As an example, we began offering buy online, pick up in store back in 2008.
To make this a more convenient experience, we added curbside delivery in all of our U.S. full-line stores and enhanced the overall experience. In 2016, we had an encouraging increase in buy online, pick up in store sales volume of 45%.
In 2017, we are implementing several initiatives that are focused on our strategic pillars of product as well as service and experience.
From a merchandising perspective, we strive to offer a curated selection of the best brands. This includes limited distribution names such as IVY PARK, J.Crew, Good American as well as our Nordstrom exclusive brands. As we look for new opportunities through our vendor partnerships, we will continue to be purposeful in editing our assortment to facilitate newness and discovery.
In our full-price business, we completed a successful pilot of a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try out in our stores. Since the launch last fall in 6 Seattle area stores, we had over 10,000 customer reservations. Based on this strong response, we are planning to expand to 50 full-line stores this year. We will also continue to enhance our digital selling tools to support new ways of serving customers seamlessly across all channels.
In our off-price business, we are further integrating the digital and store experience. For example, we recently added a feature in the mobile app that allows customers to scan an item and buy it online if the color or size is not available in the store. In addition, last October, we tested a new store design to Rack, with improvements to the store layout and fitting room experience. This format will be incorporated in most of our 17 new stores planned this year.
Looking over the longer term, we know that changes in retail and customer expectations will continue at an accelerated pace. We have a high-quality store portfolio, which gives us an opportunity to fully leverage our local assets, our people, product and place, to solve customers' unmet needs. In that regard, last month, we asked one of our top leaders, Geevy Thomas, to head up our efforts to reimagine the customer experience. He brings over 30 years of experience in many areas of Nordstrom, including full-line stores, merchandising and most recently, at the Rack. He and his team will have the ability to move quickly and boldly to find and test new solutions for serving customers into the future.
In closing, we have good momentum in place, and we will continue to make changes to ensure we are best serving customers and improving our business now and into the future.
I'd like to now turn it over to Mike to give additional color on our current performance and outlook for 2017."
32215,419586359,1141205,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2017",2017-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake.

Our 2016 results demonstrated our team's speed and agility in responding to changes in business conditions and in making fundamental improvements to our operating model. Throughout the year, we took aggressive actions to prioritize our resources and optimize inventory turns. These efforts have translated into stabilized retail operating margins over the past 3 quarters combined. We also generated operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the year, well surpassing our 5-year historical average of $1.2 billion when excluding the sale of our credit card portfolio. This reflected working capital improvements, largely driven by a 2.5% reduction in inventory.
We also delivered free cash flow of $550 million for the year, which also benefited from a 20% reduction in CapEx from last year.
Our fourth quarter earnings exceeded our expectations, reflecting continued momentum in our inventory and expense execution. As Blake mentioned, our gross profit expansion of over 100 basis points had a meaningful positive impact on earnings. This reflects our strategies around product differentiation, which includes our ongoing efforts to grow limited distribution brands and private label. We believe that over the long run, these strategies support a sustainable regular price-selling business, which mitigates the impact of promotional activity in the marketplace.
We are encouraged that even through this current environment, we achieved record sales of $14.5 billion for the year. As we evolve with customers' changing expectations, we've made investments to fuel multiple growth areas.
Starting with our expansion into Canada. Our 5 full-line stores, including 2 which opened last fall, contributed total sales of $300 million in 2016. As we've previously shared, we believe this market represents a $1 billion opportunity, consisting of 6 full-line stores and 15 to 20 Rack stores.
Second, our total online business reached over $3 billion, growing roughly 30% on an annualized basis since 2010.
Third, our off-price business reached $4.5 billion and continues to be our largest source of new customers, gaining around 6 million in 2016.
And finally, we had a strong customer response to our expanded loyalty program, with 3.7 million customers joining through our nontender offer. We ended the year with a total of 7.8 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of over 55% from last year.
Looking forward, I'd like to spend some time discussing the evolution of our business model. As we evolve with changing customer expectations, our business has shifted from a four-wall model to one that supports multiple channels. This reflected significant investments to fuel growth over the past 5 years in both e-commerce and new markets. E-commerce now represents nearly 1 quarter of our business compared to 8% in 2010.
While we improve profitability in our core business during this time, this accelerated shift to e-commerce has impacted our overall profitability. This dynamic requires us to make fundamental changes in the way we operate. In 2016, we made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around technology, supply chain and marketing capabilities. Over the past 5 years, spending in these areas grew by 20% on average. 
In 2016, we were able to bend that trajectory, cutting the growth in half. This is just the beginning of our progress. As we head into 2017 and beyond, we will continue our efforts to reshape our business model to support long-term profitable growth.
The other element impacting our near-term profitability is our investments in new market opportunities such as Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook Canada and Trunk Club. We are beginning to realize benefits from these investments. In 2016, they collectively contributed $1.2 billion to our top line. Going forward, we expect improved operating performance as they begin to scale. 
In addition, 2017 includes preopening costs of roughly $30 million related to our Manhattan flagship store.
Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. Starting with the capital plan, we expect to invest roughly $3.4 billion over the next 5 years. This is approximately 4% of sales, lower than the 5-year historical average of 5% due to moderating store investments. With technology and supply chain as a key enabler of delivering customer experiences, roughly 40% of our plan is allocated towards modernizing our tech platform that will bring digital and mobile enhancements and expanding our fulfillment network. 
Also, as we shift to a cloud-based platform, the nature of our tech spending is transitioning from a build to a rent model. To get a holistic perspective on technology, we plan to incur in total a cash spend of roughly $540 million in 2017 or 3.5% of sales. While this is generally consistent with our run rate over the past couple of years, our goal is to continually increase our productivity to support accelerated delivery of customer-facing features.
In 2016, we were able to roll out features 3 to 4x faster versus a couple years ago, with further opportunity for improvement.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our 2017 financial outlook. We expect earnings per diluted share of $2.75 to $3, which incorporates total sales growth of 3% to 4% and flat comp sales. This assumes a continuation of negative trends in our full-line stores, offset by outsized online growth.
Our outlook incorporates relatively stable gross margins while taking into account the negative mix impact from Rack's growth. As we head into 2017, we are in a clean inventory position, with plans to maintain inventory growth in line with sales trends. Additionally, our focus on product differentiation, which includes limited distribution brands and our private label, supports our ongoing efforts to strengthen our regular-price selling [ph] business.
From an SG&A rate perspective, our outlook includes continued technology and fulfillment investments, supporting multichannel growth in addition to incremental costs related to Manhattan. Please also refer to our slides for further assumptions regarding our outlook.
We're pleased with our progress in prioritizing resources, improving our productivity and increasing our speed of execution. As we position our organization for future success, we still have work to do as we realign our resources and capabilities to better serve new and existing customers, consistent with the evolving expectation of the Nordstrom brand.
One more thing. As this is my last quarterly earnings call with Nordstrom, I'd like to thank both the research and investment community for their support and curiosity for our business. We have always strived to provide a differentiated experience for our customers, which also means evolving our business. The underlying value to both customers and shareholders is the brand that has been built by our customers and supported by company leadership.
As customers' expectations continue to evolve, I'm very confident that the leadership and strategy will continue to elevate the Nordstrom brand. Thank you.
Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

While we don't give quarterly guidance, clearly last year, in the first quarter, it was pretty disappointing. And that was a period of time when a lot of us changed expectations for the year. So I would expect going up against softer numbers at the beginning of the year might be a little bit helpful. But generally speaking, there's no other material change other than that the Anniversary Sale will go back to its normal cadence between Q2 and Q3. As far as the retail EBIT being down, I think that's a reflection of the soft business we continue to see in our full-line stores that's causing contraction there. Interestingly enough, in 2017, we're starting to see the profitability of the online business crossover to a higher margin than the store-based business. And as that continues to scale, we expect to see improvement. In addition to that, there's the investments that continue to keep a little pressure on that. In terms of the impact of any other reduced sales, most of that comp sales reduction has been coming from the full-line stores. And clearly, with a commission-based model, we tend to see some positive leverage that comes from that. And I think, in addition, as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to look for ways to readjust our operating model to make it more efficient."

Our full-line stores for a long time have been really productive stores, and our focus on productivity isn't changing.

Back -- the first part of your question on where we are with the margins, I mentioned a few minutes ago that we're definitely seeing those 2 lines crossing the margins in the e-commerce business are starting to surpass the margins in the store business. And that to your point is been about scale. The challenge with the whole model has been having an accelerating business that has a high variable growth component and a decelerating business that has a high fixed costs component, which both work against you. I think we made great progress in figuring out how to be more efficient on the e-commerce side, and we're starting to see that. And as Jamie mentioned, we're making some good progress on the store side, which leads us to the second part of your question. And that is when do you see stabilization? and It's tough to answer that until you reach equilibrium. And I don't think we've reached equilibrium in terms of what are store sales and e-commerce sales start to level out. And so until we reach that, I think you're going to be experiencing some of this. Now fortunately, that's just a portion of our model. We have a lot of things going on in the off-price side that's driving some really good growth, and we have some new markets that we've been expanding that's driving some really good growth. So as we continue to make those adjustments going forward and the investments we've made, we continue to believe that all those collectively will put us in a position that we can grow earnings."

Yes, clearly, we've got some headwinds that we've been experiencing for the last couple of years, and it's been well documented and reported on our around other people that do what we do in mall traffic and I think our overall category. What we're encouraged by, particularly in our most recent results, is a move away from a promotional stance. Our industry has been really promotional for the last couple of years, been driven by higher inventories, and that's not our business. And of course, we had to compete with that. But at that's cleaned up, that's impacted our results pretty positively. Our inventories are in good shape. The inventories got -- the industry's got much promotional. And as a result, we're selling a larger percentage of our sales at a regular price. And that's when we're the healthiest. When we can be bringing in a consistent flow of new merchandise for people to say, keep that merchandise turning and selling things at full price, good things happen. And we definitely sell.

We see opportunity to drive traffic through new experiences. I've mentioned some of the digital experiences that we've already rolled out. We've got a number of initiatives we're rolling out the next year or 2. Store reserves a good example where we can use our stores to really to connect our online experiences and our store businesses in a pretty profound way. So the blending of the digital experience across the customer's entire shopping journey is a place we've been investing in for some time, and we think we're in early innings on being able to maximize the foundation and the capabilities we have there. So we don't want to get into a lot of specifics on things we'll be rolling out this year, but we look forward to the next few quarters to be able to share with you some results."

We have roughly 120 [ph] full-line stores today. All of them make money. They're all cash flow positive, and we have, overall, a very healthy fleet of stores. We have over the last couple of years closed a few. We've announced 1 closure this year. I wouldn't -- that's probably a pretty good pace as we look out over the next 5 to 10 years that there's some stores in older centers that we think we can close that store and then consolidate that business into stores nearby that we're investing in. And so the way we were looking at our fleets has evolved for sure. For one thing, we look at stores that are the only story in the market, and they have a huge impact on our overall ability to gain market share of that market, because it's not just the business we do in the 4 walls of that store, it's also the online component. And so we look at a city. We've got 1 store that may only be 50%, 60%, 70% of the business we do in that city, much like you had the online components. So we think that we'll be looking at those stores differently in terms of how we invest in those stores. On the flipside, the fourth or fifth or sixth store in a market we might look at differently today than we did in the past in terms of rolling it in place in driving business. So you've got kind of 2 sides of the coin there. We think we have an opportunity to invest in those best stores in those malls that the developers are investing in and creating better experiences. They're doing great in the malls that are not being invested in or not, and those are some of the stores that you might see close. But overall, to the first part of your question, yes, [indiscernible] people said there's a shift away from buying things to experiences. And I think you can see that are around a lot of different parts of our industry and it's debatable whether that's a secular thing or a cyclical thing. We're focused on having something new for the customer that they didn't know they want to buy. And we think we can stick to our [indiscernible] and focus on [indiscernible] places of discovery, be in that place where you can find something new, that, that's the winning strategy over the long term."

I think the art of the brand's viability and desirability of a customer maybe has been shortened. And so there's quick ascension for brands that are really hot brand that they could follow up rather quickly, too. I think have a lot to do with the brand decisions around distribution, how ubiquitous sale are out there and what channel. So this is something the we look at all the time. We look at the level of promotional business being done at each brand, and we use that and kind of get that average. It's a big, big lever for us to not have to be taking unnecessary promotional markdown, so we are definitely interested in doing less promotional. And in some cases that means, we're going to not to be doing business with some vendors. So that's an ongoing thing. It's a big one for us. And I think the encouraging part of that is for as many brands, there maybe that become over promotional or [indiscernible], they're still new as they come along.

The idea that they were buying something and then put it in a closet for a couple of months until the weather change is not -- I mean, that's changed a lot over the years. That's just not a great scenario for us. So we feel like a lot of updating so we got a product in the store at the right time for customers. I would also say that there is more movement around seasonless kinds of product, things that can be worn all year long. We find -- and particularly, since we do a lot of business in southern states with warmer climates, that, that's where you see that happen to a greater degree. I mean, you still have weather drive a lot [indiscernible] some weather market round coats and what have you, and that's fairly protectable. In terms of the shopping happening at specific times of the year, that is true. Events, holidays would have a drive a lot of business. And I would say most recent example, for holidays and we've seen this for the last several years. It continues to get more and more contracted. We still do a lot of [indiscernible] in over a 6-week timeframe and gets it concentrated increasingly into that last week. And so we might -- we feel like the season is going very well than that last few days is amazing kind of how we make up for it. So the net of all that is we're still doing the business. It's just happening in a more concentrated time frame. So I think along the lines of what Jamie was talking about and how the service customer is it's important that we become increasingly efficient and super purposeful about how we allocate inventory, when, where. And so the supply chain logistics, all that becomes a very important part of what we're doing and we've got better reviews, too."

So we're making very good progress in that area. In terms of Trunk Club, we're a little bit disappointed in our sales pace there. We did, our earnings did -- were better than planned for 2016 as we've made some adjustments there. So I would say, in general, those businesses are roughly operating as expected.

One was that in 2016, there were some noncash amortization due to the sale of those credit receivables. And without getting into the complexity of accounting, there are certain assets we needed to recognize when we sold, and those got amortized over a relatively short period of time. We don't have that level of amortization in 2017. So that's one piece. The second piece is that now that we're less capital constrained and we have a great partner in TD Bank, we're able to do more things to grow that portfolio. And so what you're starting to see is some benefit of us changing that operating model and having more capital available to grow that business. And so we would expect, not only in 2017, but going forward to see continued growth there. In terms of the loyalty program, you may recall, we launched that nontender program back in May. It's been really successful. It definitely taught us that there's a lot of folks out there that would like to have relationship with us but don't want another credit card in their wallet, and I think that was really important to extend our relationship with our customers. Generally speaking, loyalty customers spend 3 to 4x more than non-loyalty customers. That is definitely true on the tender side. I think in the nontender, we still need to learn more about that. But I think as we go forward, some of the more significant things that we're going to be able to do is we need to integrate those 2 models on 1 platform. That will allow us to continue to offer more seamless experience and also continue to see some of those customers around the nontender gain greater benefit moving to tender. So we're excited about that. We're less than a year into it, and I think our plan is to continue to try new things to test to see how customers respond and to certainly further improve the experience of those customers."

And we've talk to you a lot about investments in, not only growing our e-commerce business and how we're addressing our stores, but really core to our strategy of how we leverage those assets across and to serve customers better. There's a lot of digital tools being rolled out to our stores. There's a lot more options of getting product for the customer be it [indiscernible] pickup in store, store reserves, same-day delivery, curbside pickup. That's been the channels. And we've continued with those. So we felt given the fast pace of change, in particular on the store side that we need additional efforts around that, and DV Simon really is to take a much more future back view of the role of stores in the digitally connected world. And we certainly view our local assets, and those assets as people, product and place as being hugely important in giving us a lot of options to serve our customers better. But DB's sign is really to look regardless of channels to be super customer focused and really looking at by market, how can we leverage the assets we have, digital and physical, to serve the customer really where she's going as opposed to how do we make what we do today a little better incrementally."

With customer expectations changing faster than ever, it's important that we remain focused on the customer. Our strong financial position has enabled us to make significant investments over the past 5 years. Through these investments, we've been able to strengthen our foundation and grow our business. And as we move forward, this gives us a platform for enhanced capabilities to better serve customers and increase market share. While we're mindful of the ever-changing and challenging retail environment, it also presents us with many opportunities. 
Our focus in 2016 was to improve both the customer experience and our productivity. We've been pleased with our team's efforts to adjust our operating model to meet the changing needs of customers. These efforts, particularly around inventory management and operating efficiencies, have contributed positively to our results. Our fourth quarter comp sales decreased 0.9%. While this was consistent with recent trends, it was below our plan, particularly for our full-line store business.
Early in the year, our team took aggressive steps to realign inventory in response to changes in customer demand. As a result of these efforts, fourth quarter sales growth outpaced inventory growth by nearly 500 basis points. This enabled the flow of newness and resulted in fewer markdowns, which contributed to our gross profit increase of more than 100 basis points.
For our Nordstrom brand, inclusive of our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, comp sales decreased 2.7%. While we are not satisfied with these results, it's worth noting that we continue to see a greater share of our business shifting to regular price. Promotional sales in response to the competitive environment lessened relative to last year, demonstrating our momentum with growing relative brands, including limited distribution product.
For our Nordstrom Rack business, inclusive of online, comp sales increased 4.3% in the fourth quarter. For the year, our increase of 4.5% exceeded our plan. 
As we look ahead, we are focused on speed, convenience and personalization, culminating to our most important goal of improving service. We currently offer a number of ways to serve customers on their terms, wherever and however they shop. As an example, we began offering buy online, pick up in store back in 2008.
To make this a more convenient experience, we added curbside delivery in all of our U.S. full-line stores and enhanced the overall experience. In 2016, we had an encouraging increase in buy online, pick up in store sales volume of 45%.
In 2017, we are implementing several initiatives that are focused on our strategic pillars of product as well as service and experience.
From a merchandising perspective, we strive to offer a curated selection of the best brands. This includes limited distribution names such as IVY PARK, J.Crew, Good American as well as our Nordstrom exclusive brands. As we look for new opportunities through our vendor partnerships, we will continue to be purposeful in editing our assortment to facilitate newness and discovery.
In our full-price business, we completed a successful pilot of a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try out in our stores. Since the launch last fall in 6 Seattle area stores, we had over 10,000 customer reservations. Based on this strong response, we are planning to expand to 50 full-line stores this year. We will also continue to enhance our digital selling tools to support new ways of serving customers seamlessly across all channels.
In our off-price business, we are further integrating the digital and store experience. For example, we recently added a feature in the mobile app that allows customers to scan an item and buy it online if the color or size is not available in the store. In addition, last October, we tested a new store design to Rack, with improvements to the store layout and fitting room experience. This format will be incorporated in most of our 17 new stores planned this year.
Looking over the longer term, we know that changes in retail and customer expectations will continue at an accelerated pace. We have a high-quality store portfolio, which gives us an opportunity to fully leverage our local assets, our people, product and place, to solve customers' unmet needs. In that regard, last month, we asked one of our top leaders, Geevy Thomas, to head up our efforts to reimagine the customer experience. He brings over 30 years of experience in many areas of Nordstrom, including full-line stores, merchandising and most recently, at the Rack. He and his team will have the ability to move quickly and boldly to find and test new solutions for serving customers into the future.
In closing, we have good momentum in place, and we will continue to make changes to ensure we are best serving customers and improving our business now and into the future.
I'd like to now turn it over to Mike to give additional color on our current performance and outlook for 2017."
32215,419586359,1141519,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2017",2017-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake.

Our 2016 results demonstrated our team's speed and agility in responding to changes in business conditions and in making fundamental improvements to our operating model. Throughout the year, we took aggressive actions to prioritize our resources and optimize inventory turns. These efforts have translated into stabilized retail operating margins over the past 3 quarters combined. We also generated operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the year, well surpassing our 5-year historical average of $1.2 billion when excluding the sale of our credit card portfolio. This reflected working capital improvements, largely driven by a 2.5% reduction in inventory.
We also delivered free cash flow of $550 million for the year, which also benefited from a 20% reduction in CapEx from last year.
Our fourth quarter earnings exceeded our expectations, reflecting continued momentum in our inventory and expense execution. As Blake mentioned, our gross profit expansion of over 100 basis points had a meaningful positive impact on earnings. This reflects our strategies around product differentiation, which includes our ongoing efforts to grow limited distribution brands and private label. We believe that over the long run, these strategies support a sustainable regular-price selling business, which mitigates the impact of promotional activity in the marketplace.
We are encouraged that even through this current environment, we achieved record sales of $14.5 billion for the year. As we evolve with customers' changing expectations, we've made investments to fuel multiple growth areas.
Starting with our expansion into Canada. Our 5 full-line stores, including 2 which opened last fall, contributed total sales of $300 million in 2016. As we've previously shared, we believe this market represents a $1 billion opportunity, consisting of 6 full-line stores and 15 to 20 Rack stores.
Second, our total online business reached over $3 billion, growing roughly 30% on an annualized basis since 2010.
Third, our off-price business reached $4.5 billion and continues to be our largest source of new customers, gaining around 6 million in 2016.
And finally, we had a strong customer response to our expanded loyalty program, with 3.7 million customers joining through our nontender offer. We ended the year with a total of 7.8 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of over 55% from last year.
Looking forward, I'd like to spend some time discussing the evolution of our business model. As we evolve with changing customer expectations, our business has shifted from a four-wall model to one that supports multiple channels. This reflected significant investments to fuel growth over the past 5 years in both e-commerce and new markets. E-commerce now represents nearly 1 quarter of our business compared to 8% in 2010.
While we improve profitability in our core business during this time, this accelerated shift to e-commerce has impacted our overall profitability. This dynamic requires us to make fundamental changes in the way we operate. In 2016, we made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around technology, supply chain and marketing capabilities. Over the past 5 years, spending in these areas grew by 20% on average. 
In 2016, we were able to bend that trajectory, cutting the growth in half. This is just the beginning of our progress. As we head into 2017 and beyond, we will continue our efforts to reshape our business model to support long-term profitable growth.
The other element impacting our near-term profitability is our investments in new market opportunities such as Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook Canada and Trunk Club. We are beginning to realize benefits from these investments. In 2016, they collectively contributed $1.2 billion to our top line. Going forward, we expect improved operating performance as they begin to scale. 
In addition, 2017 includes preopening costs of roughly $30 million related to our Manhattan flagship store.
Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. Starting with the capital plan, we expect to invest roughly $3.4 billion over the next 5 years. This is approximately 4% of sales, lower than the 5-year historical average of 5% due to moderating store investments. With technology and supply chain as a key enabler of delivering customer experiences, roughly 40% of our plan is allocated towards modernizing our tech platform that will bring digital and mobile enhancements and expanding our fulfillment network. 
Also, as we shift to a cloud-based platform, the nature of our tech spending is transitioning from a build to a rent model. To get a holistic perspective on technology, we plan to incur in total a cash spend of roughly $540 million in 2017 or 3.5% of sales. While this is generally consistent with our run rate over the past couple of years, our goal is to continually increase our productivity to support accelerated delivery of customer-facing features.
In 2016, we were able to roll out features 3 to 4x faster versus a couple years ago, with further opportunity for improvement.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our 2017 financial outlook. We expect earnings per diluted share of $2.75 to $3, which incorporates total sales growth of 3% to 4% and flat comp sales. This assumes a continuation of negative trends in our full-line stores, offset by outsized online growth.
Our outlook incorporates relatively stable gross margins while taking into account the negative mix impact from Rack's growth. As we head into 2017, we are in a clean inventory position, with plans to maintain inventory growth in line with sales trends. Additionally, our focus on product differentiation, which includes limited distribution brands and our private label, supports our ongoing efforts to strengthen our regular-price selling business.
From an SG&A rate perspective, our outlook includes continued technology and fulfillment investments, supporting multichannel growth in addition to incremental costs related to Manhattan. Please also refer to our slides for further assumptions regarding our outlook.
We're pleased with our progress in prioritizing resources, improving our productivity and increasing our speed of execution. As we position our organization for future success, we still have work to do as we realign our resources and capabilities to better serve new and existing customers, consistent with the evolving expectation of the Nordstrom brand.
One more thing. As this is my last quarterly earnings call with Nordstrom, I'd like to thank both the research and investment community for their support and curiosity for our business. We have always strived to provide a differentiated experience for our customers, which also means evolving our business. The underlying value to both customers and shareholders is the brand that has been built by our customers and supported by company leadership.
As customers' expectations continue to evolve, I'm very confident that the leadership and strategy will continue to elevate the Nordstrom brand. Thank you.
Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

While we don't give quarterly guidance, clearly last year, in the first quarter, it was pretty disappointing. And that was a period of time when a lot of us changed expectations for the year. So I would expect going up against softer numbers at the beginning of the year might be a little bit helpful. But generally speaking, there's no other material change other than that the Anniversary Sale will go back to its normal cadence between Q2 and Q3. As far as the retail EBIT being down, I think that's a reflection of the soft business we continue to see in our full-line stores that's causing contraction there. Interestingly enough, in 2017, we're starting to see the profitability of the online business crossover to a higher margin than the store-based business. And as that continues to scale, we expect to see improvement. In addition to that, there's the investments that continue to keep a little pressure on that. In terms of the impact of any other reduced sales, most of that comp sales reduction has been coming from the full-line stores. And clearly, with a commission-based model, we tend to see some positive leverage that comes from that. And I think, in addition, as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to look for ways to readjust our operating model to make it more efficient."

And the challenge with the whole model has been having an accelerating business that has a high variable growth component and a decelerating business that has a high fixed cost component, which both work against you. I think we've made great progress in figuring out how to be more efficient on the e-commerce side, and we're starting to see that. And as Jamie mentioned, we're making some good progress on the store side, which leads us to the second part of your question, and that is when do you see stabilization? And it's tough to answer that until you reach equilibrium. And I don't think we've reached equilibrium in terms of where store sales and e-commerce sales start to level out. And so until we reach that, I think you're going to be experiencing some of this. Now fortunately, that's just a portion of our model. We have a lot of things going on in the off-price side that's driving some really good growth, and we have some new markets that we've been expanding that's driving some really good growth. So as we continue to make those adjustments going forward and the investments we've made, we continue to believe that all those collectively will put us in a position that we can grow earnings."

This is Jamie. I'll take that one. Yes, clearly, we've got some headwinds that we've been experiencing for the last couple of years, and it's been well documented and reported on around other people that do what we do in mall traffic and I think our overall category. What we're encouraged by, particularly in our most recent results, is a move away from a promotional stance. Our industry has been really promotional for the last couple of years. It's been driven by higher inventories, and that's not our business. And of course, we had to compete with that. But as that's cleaned up, that's impacted our results pretty positively. Our inventories are in good shape. The inventories got -- the industry's gotten less promotional. And as a result, we're selling a larger percentage of our sales at a regular price, and that's when we're the healthiest. When we can be bringing in a consistent flow of new merchandise for people to see, keep that merchandise turning and selling things at full price, good things happen. And we definitely sell. We've turned the corner on that over the last quarter or so. Next step is to get transactions going. Transactions is a proxy for traffic, and it's been declining for the last couple of years. We see opportunities to drive traffic through new experiences. I've mentioned some of the digital experiences that we've already rolled out. We've got a number of initiatives we'd be rolling out in the next year or 2. Store reserve is a good example where we can use our stores to, really, to connect our online experiences and our store businesses in a pretty profound way. So this blending of the digital experience across the customer's entire shopping journey is a place we've been investing in for some time, and we think we're in early innings on being able to maximize the foundation, the capabilities that we have there. So we don't want to get into a lot of specifics on the things we'll be rolling out this year, but we look forward to, over the next few quarters, to be able to share with you some results."

We have roughly 120 full-line stores today. All of them make money. They're all cash flow positive. And we have, overall, a very healthy fleet of stores. We have, over the last couple of years, closed a few. We have announced one closure this year. I wouldn't -- that's probably a pretty good pace as we look out over the next 5 to 10 years, that there are some stores in older centers that we think we can close that store and then consolidate that business into stores nearby that we're investing in. And so the way that we're looking at our fleets, it has evolved for sure. For one thing, we look at stores that are the only store in a market, and they have a huge impact on our overall ability to gain market share of that market because it's not just the business we do in the 4 walls of that store, it's also the online component. And so if we look at a city and we've got one store, that may only be 50%, 60%, 70% of the business we do in that city, like much you had in the online components. So we think that we'll be looking at those stores differently in terms of how we invest in those stores. On the flipside, the fourth or fifth or sixth store in a market we might look at differently today than we did in the past in terms of the role that it plays in driving business. And so you've got kind of 2 sides of the coin there. We think we have an opportunity to invest in those best stores in those malls that the developers are investing in and are creating better experiences. They're doing great in the malls that are not being invested in -- or not, and those are some of the stores that you might see close. But overall, so the first part of your question, yes, and you've heard -- people said there's a shift away from buying things to experiences. And I think you can see that around a lot of different parts of our industry, and it's debatable whether that's a secular thing or a cyclical thing. We're focused on having something new for the customer that they didn't know they wanted to buy. And we think we can stick to our innovating and focus on being in that place of discovery, being in that place where you come to find something new, that that's the winning strategy over the long term."

There's -- I think the arc of a brand's viability and desirability by a customer maybe has been shortened. And so there's quick ascension for brands that are a really hot brand if they can follow up rather quickly too. And I think it has a lot to do with the brand's decisions around distribution and how ubiquitous they are out there and then what channel. So this is something that we look at all the time. We look at the level of promotional business being done at each brand, and we use that to kind of get to the average. It's a big, big lever for us to not have to be taking unnecessary promotional markdowns, so we are definitely interested in doing less promotional business, and in some cases, that means we're going to not to be doing business with some vendors. So that's an ongoing thing. It's a big one for us. And I think the encouraging part of that is for as many brands, there may be that become over-promotional in our minds. They're still new ones that come along that are super viable and a big interest to customers. And we've got a lot of positive examples to be applying energy towards, so that I guess I would say that our merchandising group is feeling pretty optimistic about knowing where to pour on the gas, so to speak.

The idea that they would buy something and then put it in her closet for a couple of months until the weather change is not -- I mean, that's changed a lot over the years. That's just not a great scenario for us. So we talk a lot about making sure we got the product in the store at the right time for customers. I would also say that there is more movement around seasonless kinds of product, things that can be worn all year long. We find -- and particularly, since we do a lot of business in Southern states with warmer climates, that that's where you see that happen to a greater degree. I mean, you still have weather that drives a lot of business in cold weather markets around coats and what-have-you, and that's fairly predictable. In terms of the shopping happening at specific times of the year, that is true. Events, holidays would have you drive a lot of business. And I would say, in the most recent example, holiday, and we've seen this for the last several years, it continues to get more and more contracted, where we still do a lot of business in over a 6-week time frame, and it gets concentrated increasingly into that last week. And so we might feel -- we feel like, well, the holiday season is going very well, then that last few days is amazing, kind of how we make up for it. So the net of all that is we're still doing the business. It's just happening in a more concentrated time frame. So I think along the lines of what Jamie was talking about and how to service customers is it's important that we become increasingly efficient and super purposeful about how we allocate inventory, when and where. And so the supply chain logistics, all that becomes a very important part of what we're doing, and we've gotten better at that over the years too."

And so it's a win for Nordstrom, Inc. and JWN, but that individual store might see a slight, in the short term, of a reduction in some of their key metrics.

So we're making very good progress in that area. In terms of Trunk Club, we're a little bit disappointed in our sales pace there. We did -- our earnings did -- were better than planned for 2016 as we've made some adjustments there. So I would say, in general, those businesses are roughly operating as expected.

One was that in 2016, there were some noncash amortization due to the sale of those credit receivables. And without getting into the complexity of accounting, there are certain assets we needed to recognize when we sold and those got amortized over a relatively short period of time. We don't have that level of amortization in 2017. So that's one piece. The second piece is that now that we're less capital-constrained and we have a great partner in TD Bank, we're able to do more things to grow that portfolio. And so what you're starting to see is some benefit of us changing that operating model and having more capital available to grow that business. And so we would expect, not only in 2017 but going forward, to see continued growth there. In terms of the loyalty program, you may recall, we launched that nontender program back in May. It's been really successful. It definitely taught us that there's a lot of folks out there that would like to have a relationship with us but don't want another credit card in their wallet. And I think that was really important to extend our relationship with our customers. Generally speaking, loyalty customers spend 3 to 4x more than non-loyalty customers. That is definitely true on the tender side. I think in the nontender, we still need to learn more about that. But I think as we go forward, some of the more significant things that we're going to be able to do is we need to integrate those 2 models on one platform. That will allow us to continue to offer more seamless experience and also continue to see some of those customers who are on the nontender gain greater benefit moving to tender. So we're excited about that. We're less than a year into it, and I think our plan is to continue to try new things, to test to see how customers respond and to certainly further improve the experience of those customers."

With customer expectations changing faster than ever, it's important that we remain focused on the customer. Our strong financial position has enabled us to make significant investments over the past 5 years. Through these investments, we've been able to strengthen our foundation and grow our business. And as we move forward, this gives us a platform for enhanced capabilities to better serve customers and increase market share. While we're mindful of the ever-changing and challenging retail environment, it also presents us with many opportunities. 
Our focus in 2016 was to improve both the customer experience and our productivity. We've been pleased with our team's efforts to adjust our operating model to meet the changing needs of customers. These efforts, particularly around inventory management and operating efficiencies, have contributed positively to our results. Our fourth quarter comp sales decreased 0.9%. While this was consistent with recent trends, it was below our plan, particularly for our full-line store business.
Early in the year, our team took aggressive steps to realign inventory in response to changes in customer demand. As a result of these efforts, fourth quarter sales growth outpaced inventory growth by nearly 500 basis points. This enabled the flow of newness and resulted in fewer markdowns, which contributed to our gross profit increase of more than 100 basis points.
For our Nordstrom brand, inclusive of our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, comp sales decreased 2.7%. While we are not satisfied with these results, it's worth noting that we continue to see a greater share of our business shifting to regular price. Promotional sales in response to the competitive environment lessened relative to last year, demonstrating our momentum with growing relative brands, including limited distribution product.
For our Nordstrom Rack business, inclusive of online, comp sales increased 4.3% in the fourth quarter. For the year, our increase of 4.5% exceeded our plan. 
As we look ahead, we are focused on speed, convenience and personalization, culminating to our most important goal of improving service. We currently offer a number of ways to serve customers on their terms, wherever and however they shop. As an example, we began offering buy online, pick up in store back in 2008.
To make this a more convenient experience, we added curbside delivery in all of our U.S. full-line stores and enhanced the overall experience. In 2016, we had an encouraging increase in buy online, pick up in store sales volume of 45%.
In 2017, we are implementing several initiatives that are focused on our strategic pillars of product as well as service and experience.
From a merchandising perspective, we strive to offer a curated selection of the best brands. This includes limited distribution names such as IVY PARK, J.Crew, Good American as well as our Nordstrom exclusive brands. As we look for new opportunities through our vendor partnerships, we will continue to be purposeful in editing our assortment to facilitate newness and discovery.
In our full-price business, we completed a successful pilot of a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try out in our stores. Since the launch last fall in 6 Seattle area stores, we had over 10,000 customer reservations. Based on this strong response, we are planning to expand to 50 full-line stores this year. We will also continue to enhance our digital selling tools to support new ways of serving customers seamlessly across all channels.
In our off-price business, we are further integrating the digital and store experience. For example, we recently added a feature in the mobile app that allows customers to scan an item and buy it online if the color or size is not available in the store. In addition, last October, we tested a new store design at the Rack, with improvements to the store layout and fitting room experience. This format will be incorporated in most of our 17 new stores planned this year.
Looking over the longer term, we know that changes in retail and customer expectations will continue at an accelerated pace. We have a high-quality store portfolio, which gives us an opportunity to fully leverage our local assets, our people, product and place, to solve customers' unmet needs. In that regard, last month, we asked one of our top leaders, Geevy Thomas, to head up our efforts to reimagine the customer experience. He brings over 30 years of experience in many areas of Nordstrom, including full-line stores, merchandising and most recently, at the Rack. He and his team will have the ability to move quickly and boldly to find and test new solutions for serving customers into the future.
In closing, we have good momentum in place, and we will continue to make changes to ensure we are best serving customers and improving our business now and into the future.
I'd like to now turn it over to Mike to give additional color on our current performance and outlook for 2017."
32215,419586359,1141636,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2017",2017-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake. Our 2016 results demonstrated our team's speed and agility in responding to changes in business conditions and in making fundamental improvements to our operating model.

Our 2016 results demonstrated our team's speed and agility in responding to changes in business conditions and in making fundamental improvements to our operating model. Throughout the year, we took aggressive actions to prioritize our resources and optimize inventory turns. These efforts have translated into stabilized retail operating margins over the past 3 quarters combined. We also generated operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the year, well surpassing our 5-year historical average of $1.2 billion when excluding the sale of our credit card portfolio. This reflected working capital improvements, largely driven by a 2.5% reduction in inventory.
We also delivered free cash flow of $550 million for the year, which also benefited from a 20% reduction in CapEx from last year.
Our fourth quarter earnings exceeded our expectations, reflecting continued momentum in our inventory and expense execution. As Blake mentioned, our gross profit expansion of over 100 basis points had a meaningful positive impact on earnings. This reflects our strategies around product differentiation, which includes our ongoing efforts to grow limited distribution brands and private label. We believe that over the long run, these strategies support a sustainable regular-price selling business, which mitigates the impact of promotional activity in the marketplace.
We are encouraged that even through this current environment, we achieved record sales of $14.5 billion for the year. As we evolve with customers' changing expectations, we've made investments to fuel multiple growth areas.
Starting with our expansion into Canada. Our 5 full-line stores, including 2 which opened last fall, contributed total sales of $300 million in 2016. As we've previously shared, we believe this market represents a $1 billion opportunity, consisting of 6 full-line stores and 15 to 20 Rack stores.
Second, our total online business reached over $3 billion, growing roughly 30% on an annualized basis since 2010.
Third, our off-price business reached $4.5 billion and continues to be our largest source of new customers, gaining around 6 million in 2016.
And finally, we had a strong customer response to our expanded loyalty program, with 3.7 million customers joining through our nontender offer. We ended the year with a total of 7.8 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of over 55% from last year.
Looking forward, I'd like to spend some time discussing the evolution of our business model. As we evolve with changing customer expectations, our business has shifted from a four-wall model to one that supports multiple channels. This reflected significant investments to fuel growth over the past 5 years in both e-commerce and new markets. E-commerce now represents nearly 1 quarter of our business compared to 8% in 2010.
While we improve profitability in our core business during this time, this accelerated shift to e-commerce has impacted our overall profitability. This dynamic requires us to make fundamental changes in the way we operate. In 2016, we made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around technology, supply chain and marketing capabilities. Over the past 5 years, spending in these areas grew by 20% on average. 
In 2016, we were able to bend that trajectory, cutting the growth in half. This is just the beginning of our progress. As we head into 2017 and beyond, we will continue our efforts to reshape our business model to support long-term profitable growth.
The other element impacting our near-term profitability is our investments in new market opportunities such as Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook Canada and Trunk Club. We are beginning to realize benefits from these investments. In 2016, they collectively contributed $1.2 billion to our top line. Going forward, we expect improved operating performance as they begin to scale. 
In addition, 2017 includes preopening costs of roughly $30 million related to our Manhattan flagship store.
Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. Starting with the capital plan, we expect to invest roughly $3.4 billion over the next 5 years. This is approximately 4% of sales, lower than the 5-year historical average of 5% due to moderating store investments. With technology and supply chain as a key enabler of delivering customer experiences, roughly 40% of our plan is allocated towards modernizing our tech platform that will bring digital and mobile enhancements and expanding our fulfillment network. 
Also, as we shift to a cloud-based platform, the nature of our tech spending is transitioning from a build to a rent model. To get a holistic perspective on technology, we plan to incur in total a cash spend of roughly $540 million in 2017 or 3.5% of sales. While this is generally consistent with our run rate over the past couple of years, our goal is to continually increase our productivity to support accelerated delivery of customer-facing features.
In 2016, we were able to roll out features 3 to 4x faster versus a couple years ago, with further opportunity for improvement.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our 2017 financial outlook. We expect earnings per diluted share of $2.75 to $3, which incorporates total sales growth of 3% to 4% and flat comp sales. This assumes a continuation of negative trends in our full-line stores, offset by outsized online growth.
Our outlook incorporates relatively stable gross margins while taking into account the negative mix impact from Rack's growth. As we head into 2017, we are in a clean inventory position, with plans to maintain inventory growth in line with sales trends. Additionally, our focus on product differentiation, which includes limited distribution brands and our private label, supports our ongoing efforts to strengthen our regular-price selling business.
From an SG&A rate perspective, our outlook includes continued technology and fulfillment investments, supporting multichannel growth in addition to incremental costs related to Manhattan. Please also refer to our slides for further assumptions regarding our outlook.
We're pleased with our progress in prioritizing resources, improving our productivity and increasing our speed of execution. As we position our organization for future success, we still have work to do as we realign our resources and capabilities to better serve new and existing customers, consistent with the evolving expectation of the Nordstrom brand.
One more thing. As this is my last quarterly earnings call with Nordstrom, I'd like to thank both the research and investment community for their support and curiosity for our business. We have always strived to provide a differentiated experience for our customers, which also means evolving our business. The underlying value to both customers and shareholders is the brand that has been built by our customers and supported by company leadership.
As customers' expectations continue to evolve, I'm very confident that the leadership and strategy will continue to elevate the Nordstrom brand. Thank you.
Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

While we don't give quarterly guidance, clearly last year, in the first quarter, it was pretty disappointing. And that was a period of time when a lot of us changed expectations for the year. So I would expect going up against softer numbers at the beginning of the year might be a little bit helpful. But generally speaking, there's no other material change other than that the Anniversary Sale will go back to its normal cadence between Q2 and Q3. As far as the retail EBIT being down, I think that's a reflection of the soft business we continue to see in our full-line stores that's causing contraction there. Interestingly enough, in 2017, we're starting to see the profitability of the online business crossover to a higher margin than the store-based business. And as that continues to scale, we expect to see improvement. In addition to that, there's the investments that continue to keep a little pressure on that. In terms of the impact of any other reduced sales, most of that comp sales reduction has been coming from the full-line stores. And clearly, with a commission-based model, we tend to see some positive leverage that comes from that. And I think, in addition, as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to look for ways to readjust our operating model to make it more efficient."

At the same time, the stores perhaps seem to be seeing a bit of slippage in the margin rate. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how that -- how the margin performance in each of those channels has evolved? And do you think we're likely to see some level of stabilization, let's say, in 2017, 2018? The guidance would seem to suggest you're still expecting some deterioration here.

This is Mike. Back -- the first part of your question on where we are with the margins, I mentioned a few minutes ago that we're definitely seeing those 2 lines crossing the margins and the e-commerce business are starting to surpass the margins in the store business. And that to your point has been about scale. And the challenge with the whole model has been having an accelerating business that has a high variable growth component and a decelerating business that has a high fixed cost component, which both work against you. I think we've made great progress in figuring out how to be more efficient on the e-commerce side, and we're starting to see that. And as Jamie mentioned, we're making some good progress on the store side, which leads us to the second part of your question, and that is when do you see stabilization? And it's tough to answer that until you reach equilibrium. And I don't think we've reached equilibrium in terms of where store sales and e-commerce sales start to level out. And so until we reach that, I think you're going to be experiencing some of this. Now fortunately, that's just a portion of our model. We have a lot of things going on in the off-price side that's driving some really good growth, and we have some new markets that we've been expanding that's driving some really good growth. So as we continue to make those adjustments going forward and the investments we've made, we continue to believe that all those collectively will put us in a position that we can grow earnings."

This is Jamie. I'll take that one. Yes, clearly, we've got some headwinds that we've been experiencing for the last couple of years, and it's been well documented and reported on around other people that do what we do in mall traffic and I think our overall category. What we're encouraged by, particularly in our most recent results, is a move away from a promotional stance. Our industry has been really promotional for the last couple of years. It's been driven by higher inventories, and that's not our business. And of course, we had to compete with that. But as that's cleaned up, that's impacted our results pretty positively. Our inventories are in good shape. The inventories got -- the industry's gotten less promotional. And as a result, we're selling a larger percentage of our sales at a regular price, and that's when we're the healthiest. When we can be bringing in a consistent flow of new merchandise for people to see, keep that merchandise turning and selling things at full price, good things happen. And we definitely felt we've turned the corner on that over the last quarter or so. Next step is to get transactions going. Transactions is a proxy for traffic, and it's been declining for the last couple of years. We see opportunities to drive traffic through new experiences. I've mentioned some of the digital experiences that we've already rolled out. We've got a number of initiatives we'd be rolling out in the next year or 2. Store reserve is a good example where we can use our stores to, really, to connect our online experiences and our store businesses in a pretty profound way. So this blending of the digital experience across the customer's entire shopping journey is a place we've been investing in for some time, and we think we're in early innings on being able to maximize the foundation and the capabilities that we have there. So we don't want to get into a lot of specifics on the things we'll be rolling out this year, but we look forward to, over the next few quarters, to be able to share with you some results."

We have roughly 120 full-line stores today. All of them make money. They're all cash flow positive. And we have, overall, a very healthy fleet of stores. We have, over the last couple of years, closed a few. We have announced one closure this year. I wouldn't -- that's probably a pretty good pace as we look out over the next 5 to 10 years, that there are some stores in older centers that we think we can close that store and then consolidate that business into stores nearby that we're investing in. And so the way that we're looking at our fleets, it has evolved for sure. For one thing, we look at stores that are the only store in a market, and they have a huge impact on our overall ability to gain market share of that market because it's not just the business we do in the 4 walls of that store, it's also the online component. And so if we look at a city and we've got one store, that may only be 50%, 60%, 70% of the business we do in that city, once you had in the online components. So we think that we'll be looking at those stores differently in terms of how we invest in those stores. On the flipside, the fourth or fifth or sixth store in a market we might look at differently today than we did in the past in terms of the role that it plays in driving business. And so you've got kind of 2 sides of the coin there. We think we have an opportunity to invest in those best stores in those malls that the developers are investing in and are creating better experiences. They're doing great. In the malls that are not being invested in -- are not, and those are some of the stores that you might see close. But overall, so the first part of your question, yes, and you've heard -- people said there's a shift away from buying things to experiences. And I think you can see that around a lot of different parts of our industry, and it's debatable whether that's a secular thing or a cyclical thing. We're focused on having something new for the customer that they didn't know they wanted to buy. And we think we can stick to our innovating and focus on being in that place of discovery, being in that place where you come to find something new, that that's the winning strategy over the long term."

There's -- I think the arc of a brand's viability and desirability by a customer maybe has been shortened. And so there's quick ascension for brands that are a really hot brand, but they can fall off rather quickly too. And I think it has a lot to do with the brand's decisions around distribution and how ubiquitous they are out there and in what channel. So this is something that we look at all the time. We look at the level of promotional business being done at each brand, and we use that to kind of get to the average. It's a big, big lever for us to not have to be taking unnecessary promotional markdowns, so we are definitely interested in doing less promotional business, and in some cases, that means we're going to not to be doing business with some vendors. So that's an ongoing thing. It's a big one for us. And I think the encouraging part of that is for as many brands as there may be that become over-promotional in our minds, they're still new ones that come along that are super viable and a big interest to customers. And we've got a lot of positive examples to be applying energy towards, so that I guess I would say that our merchandising group is feeling pretty optimistic about knowing where to pour on the gas, so to speak.

The idea that they would buy something and then put it in her closet for a couple of months until the weather change is not -- I mean, that's changed a lot over the years. That's just not a great scenario for us. So we talk a lot about making sure we got the product in the store at the right time for customers. I would also say that there is more movement around seasonless kinds of product, things that can be worn all year long. We find -- and particularly, since we do a lot of business in Southern states with warmer climates, that that's where you see that happen to a greater degree. I mean, you still have weather that drives a lot of business in colder weather markets around coats and what-have-you, and that's fairly predictable. In terms of the shopping happening at specific times of the year, that is true. Events, holidays would have you drive a lot of business. And I would say, in the most recent example, holiday, and we've seen this for the last several years, it continues to get more and more contracted, where we still do a lot of business in over a 6-week time frame, and it gets concentrated increasingly into that last week. And so we might feel -- we feel like, well, the holiday season isn't going very well, then that last few days is amazing, kind of how we make up for it. So the net of all that is we're still doing the business. It's just happening in a more concentrated time frame. So I think along the lines of what Jamie was talking about and how to service customers is it's important that we become increasingly efficient and super purposeful about how we allocate inventory, when and where. And so the supply chain logistics, all that becomes a very important part of what we're doing, and we've gotten better at that over the years too."

One was that in 2016, there were some noncash amortization due to the sale of those credit receivables.

The second piece is that now that we're less capital-constrained and we have a great partner in TD Bank, we're able to do more things to grow that portfolio.

And so we would expect, not only in 2017 but going forward, to see continued growth there. In terms of the loyalty program, you may recall, we launched that nontender program back in May. It's been really successful. It definitely taught us that there's a lot of folks out there that would like to have a relationship with us but don't want another credit card in their wallet. And I think that was really important to extend our relationship with our customers. Generally speaking, loyalty customers spend 3 to 4x more than non-loyalty customers. That is definitely true on the tender side. I think in the nontender, we still need to learn more about that. But I think as we go forward, some of the more significant things that we're going to be able to do is we need to integrate those 2 models on one platform. That will allow us to continue to offer more seamless experience and also continue to see some of those customers who are on the nontender gain greater benefit moving to tender. So we're excited about that. We're less than a year into it, and I think our plan is to continue to try new things, to test to see how customers respond and to certainly further improve the experience of those customers."

With customer expectations changing faster than ever, it's important that we remain focused on the customer. Our strong financial position has enabled us to make significant investments over the past 5 years. Through these investments, we've been able to strengthen our foundation and grow our business. And as we move forward, this gives us a platform for enhanced capabilities to better serve customers and increase market share. While we're mindful of the ever-changing and challenging retail environment, it also presents us with many opportunities. 
Our focus in 2016 was to improve both the customer experience and our productivity. We've been pleased with our team's efforts to adjust our operating model to meet the changing needs of customers. These efforts, particularly around inventory management and operating efficiencies, have contributed positively to our results. Our fourth quarter comp sales decreased 0.9%. While this was consistent with recent trends, it was below our plan, particularly for our full-line store business.
Early in the year, our team took aggressive steps to realign inventory in response to changes in customer demand. As a result of these efforts, fourth quarter sales growth outpaced inventory growth by nearly 500 basis points. This enabled the flow of newness and resulted in fewer markdowns, which contributed to our gross profit increase of more than 100 basis points.
For our Nordstrom brand, inclusive of our full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, comp sales decreased 2.7%. While we are not satisfied with these results, it's worth noting that we continue to see a greater share of our business shifting to regular price. Promotional sales in response to the competitive environment lessened relative to last year, demonstrating our momentum with growing relative brands, including limited distribution product.
For our Nordstrom Rack business, inclusive of online, comp sales increased 4.3% in the fourth quarter. For the year, our increase of 4.5% exceeded our plan. 
As we look ahead, we are focused on speed, convenience and personalization, culminating to our most important goal of improving service. We currently offer a number of ways to serve customers on their terms, wherever and however they shop. As an example, we began offering buy online, pick up in store back in 2008.
To make this a more convenient experience, we added curbside delivery in all of our U.S. full-line stores and enhanced the overall experience. In 2016, we had an encouraging increase in buy online, pick up in store sales volume of 45%.
In 2017, we are implementing several initiatives that are focused on our strategic pillars of product as well as service and experience.
From a merchandising perspective, we strive to offer a curated selection of the best brands. This includes limited distribution names such as IVY PARK, J.Crew, Good American as well as our Nordstrom exclusive brands. As we look for new opportunities through our vendor partnerships, we will continue to be purposeful in editing our assortment to facilitate newness and discovery.
In our full-price business, we completed a successful pilot of a mobile feature that gives customers the ability to reserve merchandise online and try out in our stores. Since the launch last fall in 6 Seattle area stores, we had over 10,000 customer reservations. Based on this strong response, we are planning to expand to 50 full-line stores this year. We will also continue to enhance our digital selling tools to support new ways of serving customers seamlessly across all channels.
In our off-price business, we are further integrating the digital and store experience. For example, we recently added a feature in the mobile app that allows customers to scan an item and buy it online if the color or size is not available in the store. In addition, last October, we tested a new store design at the Rack, with improvements to the store layout and fitting room experience. This format will be incorporated in most of our 17 new stores planned this year.
Looking over the longer term, we know that changes in retail and customer expectations will continue at an accelerated pace. We have a high-quality store portfolio, which gives us an opportunity to fully leverage our local assets, our people, product and place, to solve customers' unmet needs. In that regard, last month, we asked one of our top leaders, Geevy Thomas, to head up our efforts to reimagine the customer experience. He brings over 30 years of experience in many areas of Nordstrom, including full-line stores, merchandising and most recently, at the Rack. He and his team will have the ability to move quickly and boldly to find and test new solutions for serving customers into the future.
In closing, we have good momentum in place, and we will continue to make changes to ensure we are best serving customers and improving our business now and into the future.
I'd like to now turn it over to Mike to give additional color on our current performance and outlook for 2017."
32215,419586359,1142564,"Nordstrom, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2017",2017-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Nordstrom, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Blake. Our 2016 results demonstrated our team's speed and agility in responding to changes in business conditions and in making fundamental improvements to our operating model.

Our 2016 results demonstrated our team's speed and agility in responding to changes in business conditions and in making fundamental improvements to our operating model. Throughout the year, we took aggressive actions to prioritize our resources and optimize inventory turns. These efforts have translated into stabilized retail operating margins over the past 3 quarters combined. We also generated operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the year, well surpassing our 5-year historical average of $1.2 billion when excluding the sale of our credit card portfolio. This reflected working capital improvements, largely driven by a 2.5% reduction in inventory.
We also delivered free cash flow of $550 million for the year, which also benefited from a 20% reduction in CapEx from last year.
Our fourth quarter earnings exceeded our expectations, reflecting continued momentum in our inventory and expense execution. As Blake mentioned, our gross profit expansion of over 100 basis points had a meaningful positive impact on earnings. This reflects our strategies around product differentiation, which includes our ongoing efforts to grow limited distribution brands and private label. We believe that over the long run, these strategies support a sustainable regular-price selling business, which mitigates the impact of promotional activity in the marketplace.
We are encouraged that even through this current environment, we achieved record sales of $14.5 billion for the year. As we evolve with customers' changing expectations, we've made investments to fuel multiple growth areas.
Starting with our expansion into Canada. Our 5 full-line stores, including 2 which opened last fall, contributed total sales of $300 million in 2016. As we've previously shared, we believe this market represents a $1 billion opportunity, consisting of 6 full-line stores and 15 to 20 Rack stores.
Second, our total online business reached over $3 billion, growing roughly 30% on an annualized basis since 2010.
Third, our off-price business reached $4.5 billion and continues to be our largest source of new customers, gaining around 6 million in 2016.
And finally, we had a strong customer response to our expanded loyalty program, with 3.7 million customers joining through our nontender offer. We ended the year with a total of 7.8 million active Nordstrom Rewards customers, an increase of over 55% from last year.
Looking forward, I'd like to spend some time discussing the evolution of our business model. As we evolve with changing customer expectations, our business has shifted from a four-wall model to one that supports multiple channels. This reflected significant investments to fuel growth over the past 5 years in both e-commerce and new markets. E-commerce now represents nearly 1 quarter of our business compared to 8% in 2010.
While we improve profitability in our core business during this time, this accelerated shift to e-commerce has impacted our overall profitability. This dynamic requires us to make fundamental changes in the way we operate. In 2016, we made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around technology, supply chain and marketing capabilities. Over the past 5 years, spending in these areas grew by 20% on average. 
In 2016, we were able to bend that trajectory, cutting the growth in half. This is just the beginning of our progress. As we head into 2017 and beyond, we will continue our efforts to reshape our business model to support long-term profitable growth.
The other element impacting our near-term profitability is our investments in new market opportunities such as Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook Canada and Trunk Club. We are beginning to realize benefits from these investments. In 2016, they collectively contributed $1.2 billion to our top line. Going forward, we expect improved operating performance as they begin to scale. 
In addition, 2017 includes preopening costs of roughly $30 million related to our Manhattan flagship store.
Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. Starting with the capital plan, we expect to invest roughly $3.4 billion over the next 5 years. This is approximately 4% of sales, lower than the 5-year historical average of 5% due to moderating store investments. With technology and supply chain as a key enabler of delivering customer experiences, roughly 40% of our plan is allocated towards modernizing our tech platform that will bring digital and mobile enhancements and expanding our fulfillment network. 
Also, as we shift to a cloud-based platform, the nature of our tech spending is transitioning from a build to a rent model. To get a holistic perspective on technology, we plan to incur in total a cash spend of roughly $540 million in 2017 or 3.5% of sales. While this is generally consistent with our run rate over the past couple of years, our goal is to continually increase our productivity to support accelerated delivery of customer-facing features.
In 2016, we were able to roll out features 3 to 4x faster versus a couple years ago, with further opportunity for improvement.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our 2017 financial outlook. We expect earnings per diluted share of $2.75 to $3, which incorporates total sales growth of 3% to 4% and flat comp sales. This assumes a continuation of negative trends in our full-line stores, offset by outsized online growth.
Our outlook incorporates relatively stable gross margins while taking into account the negative mix impact from Rack's growth. As we head into 2017, we are in a clean inventory position, with plans to maintain inventory growth in line with sales trends. Additionally, our focus on product differentiation, which includes limited distribution brands and our private label, supports our ongoing efforts to strengthen our regular-price selling business.
From an SG&A rate perspective, our outlook includes continued technology and fulfillment investments, supporting multichannel growth in addition to incremental costs related to Manhattan. Please also refer to our slides for further assumptions regarding our outlook.
We're pleased with our progress in prioritizing resources, improving our productivity and increasing our speed of execution. As we position our organization for future success, we still have work to do as we realign our resources and capabilities to better serve new and existing customers, consistent with the evolving expectation of the Nordstrom brand.
One more thing. As this is my last quarterly earnings call with Nordstrom, I'd like to thank both the research and investment community for their support and curiosity for our business. We have always strived to provide a differentiated experience for our customers, which also means evolving our business. The underlying value to both customers and shareholders is the brand that has been built by our customers and supported by company leadership.
As customers' expectations continue to evolve, I'm very confident that the leadership and strategy will continue to elevate the Nordstrom brand. Thank you.
Now I'll turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

While we don't give quarterly guidance, clearly last year, in the first quarter, it was pretty disappointing. And that was a period of time when a lot of us changed expectations for the year. So I would expect going up against softer numbers at the beginning of the year might be a little bit helpful. But generally speaking, there's no other material change other than that the Anniversary Sale will go back to its normal cadence between Q2 and Q3. As far as the retail EBIT being down, I think that's a reflection of the soft business we continue to see in our full-line stores that's causing contraction there. Interestingly enough, in 2017, we're starting to see the profitability of the online business crossover to a higher margin than the store-based business. And as that continues to scale, we expect to see improvement. In addition to that, there's the investments that continue to keep a little pressure on that. In terms of the impact of any other reduced sales, most of that comp sales reduction has been coming from the full-line stores. And clearly, with a commission-based model, we tend to see some positive leverage that comes from that. And I think, in addition, as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to look for ways to readjust our operating model to make it more efficient."

What is changing, and it's being driven by customers, is how they want to shop and the kinds of experiences that they want to have. And so we've got opportunities to adjust our service model in our stores that both are more tailored to how customers want to shop, both the speed at which they want to have an experience or the type of experience they want to have as well as be more efficient with our staffing model. And so we see opportunities. We've been testing that this year. In fact, in 2016, we implemented our very first labor scheduling tool, and we'll be getting mature on that this year. But also things that Blake and Mike mentioned around buy online pick up in store growing at around 50%, rolling out store reserve. These are low-tech experiences where a customer can come in and have a great experience, buy a whole bunch of stuff in literally a few minutes without as much labor being needed. So we see opportunity in both the near and longer terms around being more efficient with our labor dollars in the stores as a percent of sales and continuing to drive productivity out of them."

This is Mike. Back -- the first part of your question on where we are with the margins, I mentioned a few minutes ago that we're definitely seeing those 2 lines crossing the margins and the e-commerce business are starting to surpass the margins in the store business. And that to your point has been about scale. And the challenge with the whole model has been having an accelerating business that has a high variable growth component and a decelerating business that has a high fixed cost component, which both work against you. I think we've made great progress in figuring out how to be more efficient on the e-commerce side, and we're starting to see that. And as Jamie mentioned, we're making some good progress on the store side, which leads us to the second part of your question, and that is when do you see stabilization? And it's tough to answer that until you reach equilibrium. And I don't think we've reached equilibrium in terms of where store sales and e-commerce sales start to level out. And so until we reach that, I think you're going to be experiencing some of this. Now fortunately, that's just a portion of our model. We have a lot of things going on in the off-price side that's driving some really good growth, and we have some new markets that we've been expanding that's driving some really good growth. So as we continue to make those adjustments going forward and the investments we've made, we continue to believe that all those collectively will put us in a position that we can grow earnings."

This is Jamie. I'll take that one. Yes, clearly, we've got some headwinds that we've been experiencing for the last couple of years, and it's been well documented and reported on around other people that do what we do in mall traffic and I think our overall category. What we're encouraged by, particularly in our most recent results, is a move away from a promotional stance. Our industry has been really promotional for the last couple of years. It's been driven by higher inventories, and that's not our business. And of course, we had to compete with that. But as that's cleaned up, that's impacted our results pretty positively. Our inventories are in good shape. The inventories got -- the industry's gotten less promotional. And as a result, we're selling a larger percentage of our sales at a regular price, and that's when we're the healthiest. When we can be bringing in a consistent flow of new merchandise for people to see, keep that merchandise turning and selling things at full price, good things happen. And we definitely felt we've turned the corner on that over the last quarter or so. Next step is to get transactions going. Transactions is a proxy for traffic, and it's been declining for the last couple of years. We see opportunities to drive traffic through new experiences. I've mentioned some of the digital experiences that we've already rolled out. We've got a number of initiatives we'd be rolling out in the next year or 2. Store reserve is a good example where we can use our stores to, really, to connect our online experiences and our store businesses in a pretty profound way. So this blending of the digital experience across the customer's entire shopping journey is a place we've been investing in for some time, and we think we're in early innings on being able to maximize the foundation and the capabilities that we have there. So we don't want to get into a lot of specifics on the things we'll be rolling out this year, but we look forward to, over the next few quarters, to be able to share with you some results."

We have roughly 120 full-line stores today. All of them make money. They're all cash flow positive. And we have, overall, a very healthy fleet of stores. We have, over the last couple of years, closed a few. We have announced one closure this year. I wouldn't -- that's probably a pretty good pace as we look out over the next 5 to 10 years, that there are some stores in older centers that we think we can close that store and then consolidate that business into stores nearby that we're investing in. And so the way that we're looking at our fleets, it has evolved for sure. For one thing, we look at stores that are the only store in a market, and they have a huge impact on our overall ability to gain market share of that market because it's not just the business we do in the 4 walls of that store, it's also the online component. And so if we look at a city and we've got one store, that may only be 50%, 60%, 70% of the business we do in that city, once you had in the online components. So we think that we'll be looking at those stores differently in terms of how we invest in those stores. On the flipside, the fourth or fifth or sixth store in a market we might look at differently today than we did in the past in terms of the role that it plays in driving business. And so you've got kind of 2 sides of the coin there. We think we have an opportunity to invest in those best stores in those malls that the developers are investing in and are creating better experiences. They're doing great. In the malls that are not being invested in -- are not, and those are some of the stores that you might see close. But overall, so the first part of your question, yes, and you've heard -- people said there's a shift away from buying things to experiences. And I think you can see that around a lot of different parts of our industry, and it's debatable whether that's a secular thing or a cyclical thing. We're focused on having something new for the customer that they didn't know they wanted to buy. And we think we can stick to our innovating and focus on being in that place of discovery, being in that place where you come to find something new, that that's the winning strategy over the long term."

There's -- I think the arc of a brand's viability and desirability by a customer maybe has been shortened. And so there's quick ascension for brands that are a really hot brand, but they can fall off rather quickly too. And I think it has a lot to do with the brand's decisions around distribution and how ubiquitous they are out there and in what channel. So this is something that we look at all the time. We look at the level of promotional business being done at each brand, and we use that to kind of get to the average. It's a big, big lever for us to not have to be taking unnecessary promotional markdowns, so we are definitely interested in doing less promotional business, and in some cases, that means we're going to not to be doing business with some vendors. So that's an ongoing thing. It's a big one for us. And I think the encouraging part of that is for as many brands as there may be that become over-promotional in our minds, they're still new ones that come along that are super viable and a big interest to customers. And we've got a lot of positive examples to be applying energy towards, so that I guess I would say that our merchandising group is feeling pretty optimistic about knowing where to pour on the gas, so to speak.

The idea that they would buy something and then put it in her closet for a couple of months until the weather change is not -- I mean, that's changed a lot over the years. That's just not a great scenario for us. So we talk a lot about making sure we got the product in the store at the right time for customers. I would also say that there is more movement around seasonless kinds of product, things that can be worn all year long. We find -- and particularly, since we do a lot of business in Southern states with warmer climates, that that's where you see that happen to a greater degree. I mean, you still have weather that drives a lot of business in colder weather markets around coats and what-have-you, and that's fairly predictable. In terms of the shopping happening at specific times of the year, that is true. Events, holidays would have you drive a lot of business. And I would say, in the most recent example, holiday, and we've seen this for the last several years, it continues to get more and more contracted, where we still do a lot of business in over a 6-week time frame, and it gets concentrated increasingly into that last week. And so we might feel -- we feel like, well, the holiday season isn't going very well, then that last few days is amazing, kind of how we make up for it. So the net of all that is we're still doing the business. It's just happening in a more concentrated time frame. So I think along the lines of what Jamie was talking about and how to service customers is it's important that we become increasingly efficient and super purposeful about how we allocate inventory, when and where. And so the supply chain logistics, all that becomes a very important part of what we're doing, and we've gotten better at that over the years too."

One was that in 2016, there were some noncash amortization due to the sale of those credit receivables. And without getting into the complexity of accounting, there are certain assets we needed to recognize when we sold and those got amortized over a relatively short period of time. We don't have that level of amortization in 2017. So that's one piece. The second piece is that now that we're less capital-constrained and we have a great partner in TD Bank, we're able to do more things to grow that portfolio. And so what you're starting to see is some benefit of us changing that operating model and having more capital available to grow that business. And so we would expect, not only in 2017 but going forward, to see continued growth there. In terms of the loyalty program, you may recall, we launched that nontender program back in May. It's been really successful. It definitely taught us that there's a lot of folks out there that would like to have a relationship with us but don't want another credit card in their wallet. And I think that was really important to extend our relationship with our customers. Generally speaking, loyalty customers spend 3 to 4x more than non-loyalty customers. That is definitely true on the tender side. I think in the nontender, we still need to learn more about that. But I think as we go forward, some of the more significant things that we're going to be able to do is we need to integrate those 2 models on one platform. That will allow us to continue to offer more seamless experience and also continue to see some of those customers who are on the nontender gain greater benefit moving to tender. So we're excited about that. We're less than a year into it, and I think our plan is to continue to try new things, to test to see how customers respond and to certainly further improve the experience of those customers."

Before we review our first quarter results, I'd like to provide some context about how our business has evolved and the direction we're heading.

Before we review our first quarter results, I'd like to provide some context about how our business has evolved and the direction we're heading. Over the past decade, we transitioned from being a predominantly mall-based store business to one that is more diversified, with multiple ways for customers to shop with us. During this time, we've invested in capabilities to better serve our customers and gain market share. This fueled our e-commerce growth, increased our customer base and enabled us to expand into new markets. Through these efforts, we've added nearly $6 billion to our top line. 
In keeping our customers at the forefront of everything we do, our business looks very different today. Nearly 1 quarter of our sales are from online purchases compared to roughly 5% from 10 years ago. We've added more ways to serve customers through our acquisitions of Trunk Club and HauteLook. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to be our fastest-growing business to reach $1 billion. We offer a variety of services that support our customers' needs around convenience such as buy online, pickup in store, curbside pickup and same-day delivery. We continued to invest in critical talent and capabilities around technology, mobile, data analytics and supply chain. Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, product and services represent the core of our brand. We're fortunate to have a high-quality portfolio of 122 full-line stores with all of our comp stores generating positive cash flow. Furthermore, our stores play an important role in attracting and retaining customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels began at our full-line or Rack stores.
We've strategically grown our off-price business, which represents roughly 30% of sales. It's positioned as our largest source of new customers with the average age skewing younger than our overall business. About 1/3 of customers who start shopping at the Rack will also cross shop in our full price business. We believe this is a unique competitive advantage in the market.
Because our customer shopping experience maybe influenced by multiple touch points, it's important that we view our business from the perspective of the markets in which we serve them. We're finding than measuring our outcomes through discrete channel metrics such as store comps are becoming less relevant.
As we continue to head in this direction, we're increasingly looking at our business as full-price and off-price, inclusive of stores and online, to better capture the synergies of having a physical and digital presence.
Now I'd like to discuss our first quarter results. Our earnings were in line with our expectations. We reported earnings per diluted share of $0.37, which included a onetime charge of $0.06 associated with the $650 million debt refinancing in the first quarter.
Last year, earnings per share of $0.26 included a $0.10 charge primarily related to higher credit chargebacks as we transitioned to a change in industry liability rules. When excluding these charges, our first quarter earnings increased 19% on a comparable basis.
While we're pleased with our inventory and expense execution, we're not satisfied with our top line results. Total sales increased 2.7% while comps decreased 0.8%. This was generally consistent with the trends we've experienced over the past year. 
In our full-price business, total sales decreased 1.7% and comps decreased 2.8%. From a merchandise perspective, we had strengthen our men's and women's apparel while accessories remained soft. Our expansion and full-price gross margin reflected the continued strength of our regular price sales. 
Our focus on expanding product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most sought-after brands while mitigating our business from the promotional environment. These efforts contributed to 100 basis point increase in the mix of regular price sales and our full-price business.
In our off-price business, total sales increased 8.7% and comps increased 2.3%. We took additional markdowns on slower-moving items, which impacted gross margins. Overall, our gross profit rate was slightly up from last year. We ended the quarter with inventory growth in line with sales growth.
Moving to our 2017 outlook. Our plan is grounded in the sales trends we've experienced over the past year. We are reiterating our earnings per share range of $2.75 to $3, total sales growth of 3% to 4% and approximately flat comps.
As we look ahead, we have a number of opportunities to drive growth. From a merchandising perspective, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness through a greater emphasis on limited distribution and relevant product. Our long-term ambition is for continued double-digit online growth. We've been able to increase the speed and agility with which we roll out enhancements to our product pages, navigation and content.
Mobile is integral to the customer's shopping experience and accounts for more than half of our online traffic. We're continuing testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital experiences. As an example, we're expanding reserve online and trying in stores from 60 to 50 stores this year. 
This fall, we have our 6 full-line store opening in Canada at [ Sureway ] Gardens in Toronto and 2 full-lines to a relocations in California at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Town Center in La Jolla. We have opened 6 Racks so far in 2017 and have 11 more opening in the fall. Additionally, we're excited about our Manhattan flagship, which is on track to be completed in 2019.
We recently announced a phased approach with the men's store opening first in spring 2018. 
Finally, I'd like to share that we're looking forward to having [ Anne Bremann ] join our team as CFO on June 2. She brings extensive retail experience with demonstrated success as a business partner and a steward of capital. Anne is succeeding Mike Koppel, who retired at the beginning of this month. Over the past 16 years, Mike has provided insight to the leadership team into how we can best utilize the company's resources to produce the outcomes we aspire to achieve. Our financial standing and overall reputation have been greatly enhanced by his leadership. And first, I'd like to thank Mike for his many contributions.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

Yes, I would say we transitioned our practice of investing in remodels from historically, it was a pretty democratic approach where after 10 or 12 years, we remodel a store kind of regardless of the volume level of performance. And over the last couple of years has transitioned to making more strategic investments in our highest volume stores. These are stores that we think play a bigger role in creating our brand. When it comes to our smaller volume stores, yes, they do generate cash. Like I said, all of our stores are cash flow positive, and we make money there. Obviously, if you do it -- put a bunch of capital into it, that can change that picture. We think we've got a lot of opportunities in the middle, frankly. It's not so much that the small [indiscernible] stores, we think those will be fine. It's a lot of the stores in the middle that we have an opportunity to upgrade them. So we're looking at a lot of different alternatives. We're working with our partners on the real estate side of big mall developers out there that we're partners with that are as motivated as we are to upgrade those stores. So we're starting to work on that, and we think we'll start to see some progress later this year."

Newness is always a theme that we talk about. And for us to have our inventories in line and be able to bring new goods in always helps stimulate the business. Also athletic and fitness type brands, and that's part of that cash realization lifestyle part that we talked about a bit over the years. That's a strong trend. If you look at our top brands, it's interesting. We have several that are super healthy and growing double digits, and we have some big legacy brands we've done this that are not that are shrinking quite [indiscernible]. So I guess, that's always been true to a degree but the good news for us is that with -- how some of the brands are falling off, it creates open to buy for us.

As our models become more diverse as off-price has become a bigger chunk of our business, as online becomes a bigger chunk of our business, we have more ways to serve the customer and gets us out of being a almost predominantly as our history has been, a mall-based physical store of model. And one of the great aspects of that is around customer acquisition and customer data. The Rack is a tremendous place for us to acquire customers. Now we're in very early innings of capturing the customer information and leveraging that to serve customers better.

So in total, our handbags, including everything, it's down more the average albeit everything else we're doing. Shoes, that's a big business for us. So we have to go speak to something pretty specific. Generally again, the designer part of our shoe business has been strong. The part that's been the weakest for us is our BP shoe department women's, which is generally represents more of an entry kind of price point, typically a bit younger and more casual in styling. We had to dig into that a little bit more and find out. I don't think that's necessarily reflective exactly what's going on in the industry because you already heard me say earlier of things like athletic and casualization has done well. So I think that really mostly on us and stuff that we can fix and sell for, so that doesn't seem to be a secular issue that we can't solve for.

So we think we have grounded plans and trend that enable us to be more agile and flexible and move forward as the business responds. What's happened in years past is that you tend to get optimistic that tomorrow's going to be better and we get over our SKUs in expense or inventory and it doesn't allow us to be fluid and react to the business.

Before we review our first quarter results, I'd like to provide some context about how our business has evolved and the direction we're heading. Over the past decade, we've transitioned from being a predominantly mall-based store",1032,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before we review our first quarter results, I'd like to provide some context about how our business has evolved and the direction we're heading. Over the past decade, we've transitioned from being a predominantly mall-based store business to one that is more diversified, with multiple ways for customers to shop with us. During this time, we've invested in capabilities to better serve our customers and gain market share. This fueled our e-commerce growth, increased our customer base and enabled us to expand into new markets. Through these efforts, we've added nearly $6 billion to our top line.
In keeping our customers at the forefront of everything we do, our business looks very different today. Nearly 1/4 of our sales are from online purchases compared to roughly 5% from 10 years ago. We've added more ways to serve customers through our acquisitions of Trunk Club and HauteLook. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to be our fastest-growing business to reach $1 billion. We offer a variety of services that support our customers' needs around convenience, such as buy online, pickup in store; curbside pickup; and same-day delivery. We continue to invest in critical talent and capabilities around technology, mobile, data analytics and supply chain. Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, product and services, represent the core of our brand. We're fortunate to have a high-quality portfolio of 122 full-line stores, with all of our comp stores generating positive cash flow. Furthermore, our stores play an important role in attracting and retaining customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels began at our full-line or Rack stores.
We have strategically grown our off-price business, which represents roughly 30% of sales. It's positioned as our largest source of new customers, with the average age skewing younger than our overall business. About 1/3 of customers who start shopping at the Rack will also cross-shop in our full-price business. We believe this is a unique competitive advantage in the market.
Because our customer's shopping experience may be influenced by multiple touch points, it's important that we view our business from the perspective of the markets in which we serve them. We're finding that measuring our outcomes through discrete channel metrics, such as store comps, are becoming less relevant.
As we continue to head in this direction, we're increasingly looking at our business as full-price and off-price, inclusive of stores and online, to better capture the synergies of having a physical and digital presence.
Now I'd like to discuss our first quarter results. Our earnings were in line with our expectations. We reported earnings per diluted share of $0.37, which included a onetime charge of $0.06 associated with the $650 million debt refinancing in the first quarter.
Last year, earnings per share of $0.26 included a $0.10 charge primarily related to higher credit charge-backs as we transition to a change in industry liability rules. When excluding these charges, our first quarter earnings increased 19% on a comparable basis.
While we're pleased with our inventory and expense execution, we're not satisfied with our top line results. Total sales increased 2.7% while comps decreased 0.8%. This was generally consistent with the trends we've experienced over the past year.
In our full-price business, total sales decreased 1.7% and comps decreased 2.8%. From a merchandise perspective, we had strengthened our men's and women's apparel while accessories remained soft. Our expansion in full-price gross margin reflected the continued strength of our regular-price sales.
Our focus on expanding product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most sought-after brands while mitigating our business from the promotional environment. These efforts contributed to 100 basis point increase in the mix of regular-price sales and our full-price business.
In our off-price business, total sales increased 8.7% and comps increased 2.3%. We took additional markdowns on slower-moving items, which impacted gross margins. Overall, our gross profit rate was slightly up from last year. We ended the quarter with inventory growth in line with sales growth.
Moving to our 2017 outlook. Our plan is grounded in the sales trends we've experienced over the past year. We are reiterating our earnings per share range of $2.75 to $3, total sales growth of 3% to 4% and approximately flat comps.
As we look ahead, we have a number of opportunities to drive growth. From a merchandising perspective, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness through a greater emphasis on limited distribution and relevant product. Our long-term ambition is for continued double-digit online growth. We've been able to increase the speed and agility with which we roll out enhancements to our product pages, navigation and content.
Mobile is integral to the customer's shopping experience and accounts for more than half of our online traffic. We're continually testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital experiences. As an example, we're expanding reserve online and trying in stores from [ 60 to 50 ] stores this year. 
This fall, we have our 6 full-line store opening in Canada at Sherway Gardens in Toronto and 2 full-line store relocations in California at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Center in La Jolla. We have opened 6 Racks so far in 2017 and have 11 more opening in the fall. Additionally, we're excited about our Manhattan flagship, which is on track to be completed in 2019.
We recently announced a phased approach with the men's store opening first in spring 2018.
Finally, I'd like to share that we're looking forward to having Anne Bramman join our team as CFO on June 2. She brings extensive retail experience with demonstrated success as a business partner and a steward of capital. Anne is succeeding Mike Koppel, who retired at the beginning of this month. Over the past 16 years, Mike has provided insight to the leadership team and to how we can best utilize the company's resources to produce the outcomes we aspire to achieve. Our financial standing and overall reputation have been greatly enhanced by his leadership. And first, I'd like to thank Mike for his many contributions.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

So we were really close to that. But to be clear, our plan is to beat that. Our goal is to be ahead of our plans. And so we recognized that we have some opportunities. There were a number of things that our team is working on, but there isn't any one thing that I would call out. It's not dissimilar to the performance we had in Q4. We were down 0.8%. So we have seen a little bit of a softening, but it is close to our plan. And we are encouraged by the opportunities and initiatives we have for the balance of this year. In terms of the online off-price portion of it, it also just missed our plans. We're anniversarying from a year ago the strongest numbers we had. We had a 42% increase a year ago in Q1 in online off-price. We had a 19% performance for Q1 of 2017, and that just missed our plan. And you'll see, as the balance of the year goes on, much stronger numbers with our plan because we have a plan for the year that is stronger weighted towards the balance end of the year. In terms of your specifics that we've seen anything from competition or other factors, we don't have anything material that we would point out, only that we recognize this fall short of our goals, and we've got work to do to improve upon that. You had, I think, a question on the margin, too. Regarding Q1 margins, I did call out in my remarks that we took higher markdowns in our Rack business, predominantly due to some seasonal underperforming merchandise. We had some more boots and coats and other things that we felt necessitated some more markdowns. That had an impact to the overall. The overall margin was relatively flat. Full-price had an improvement in margin, with off-price bringing it down slightly."

Obviously, if you do put a bunch of capital into it, that can change that picture. We think we've got a lot of opportunities in the middle, frankly. It's not so much that the small-sized stores. We think those will be fine. It's a lot of the stores in the middle that we have an opportunity to upgrade them. So we're looking on a lot of different alternatives.

I think that the themes that are generally true across all classifications is that you -- there's a continuing turn around casualization that we need to be mindful of, really, kind of across the board and that we've had good success, I think, where we focus on that appropriately. Newness is always a theme that we talk about. And for us to have our inventories in line and be able to bring new goods in always help stimulate the business. Also, athletic and fitness-type brands, that's kind of part of that casualization lifestyle part that we've talked about a bit over the years. That's a strong trend. As I look at our top brands, it's interesting. We have several that are super healthy and growing double digits, and we have some big legacy brands we've done business with that are not -- that are shrinking quite precipitously. So I guess, that's always been true to a degree. But the good news for us is that with how some of the brands are falling off, it creates open-to-buy for us. And so if you look at it from the buyer's point of view and our whole merchandising team, I think they feel pretty energized about the opportunity to go out and either apply more resources to some of these positive trends or find new brands. So it's -- I think, generally, our team feels -- that's the nature of our business, but feels kind of optimistic about the future and our ability to be able to find great product."

Stuff that someone had bought online, customers often choose -- actually, most often choose to want to return that in store. So we've got more inventory back into the store than we had originally planned. And that's again because of the large growth that we had there on the online part of the business in our off-price part of the segment.

As far as the second question was the Rack customers that migrate over to full-price, we have -- a lot of that is, for us, opportunity there is in data. As our models become more diverse, as off-price has become a bigger chunk of our business, as online becomes a bigger chunk of our business, we have more ways to serve the customer and gets us out of being a almost predominantly, as our history has been, a mall-based physical store model. And one of the great aspects of that is around customer acquisition and customer data. The Rack is a tremendous place for us to acquire customers. We're in very early innings of capturing the customer information and leveraging that to serve customers better. Our launch last year of our loyalty program to include noncardholders was a big step in the right direction, but we have a lot of opportunity going forward to continue to leverage customer information better.

So that -- we work pretty hard to try to find a way that the off-price part -- what we do in off-price complement each other. And you can see with the way that physically we're with stores. The most successful Racks are ones that are right next to a full-price store. So there is some synergy that goes with that. It doesn't necessarily cannibalize. There is share. There is acquisition that happens. But again, generally, there's some younger people that enter our brand through the Rack and that they end up migrating up to full-price over time.

That could be a marketing [ lend ] through our online business of, say, affiliates or banner ads or search words.

It will enable us to be more agile and flexible to move forward as the business responds. What's happened in years past is that we tend to get optimistic that tomorrow's going to be better and we get over our skis on expense or inventory and it doesn't allow us to be fluid and react to the business. So as Pete said, the whole subject about newness and the reason why the customer should buy something new really gets grounded in our merchants' ability to be able to keep everything very open and fluid. And so we have that with the Rack. Our inventories are in line. I think we have some good initiatives this year.

But we've always looked at you guys and your full-line stores as a proxy for the A malls more across the country. And some of the numbers that we see come by through external data sources through the quarter, yes, the traffic shouldn't be quite as bad in the A malls. And I wanted to just get your thoughts on how -- I know you guys don't speak about ASPs or AURs but -- in a month. But what do you think you need in the full-price stores, at this point, to say we can really get -- we can make a shot at getting these traffic numbers up in these stores, if maybe there's some AUR pressure that continues in the industry?"

And so we do think that there are less visits to the mall. But what we see, though, is that a lot of those visits are now going to our website. People shop for things lots of different ways, depending on what their needs happen to be that day. Some of those trips in the past have converted to trips to Nordstrom.com, and we're thrilled about that. And so it's our job to continue to focus on investing in our business and the experiences we can provide customers across all the channels to make for a great shopping experience.

Before we review our first quarter results, I'd like to provide some context about how our business has evolved and the direction we're heading. Over the past decade, we've transitioned from being a predominantly mall-based store",1029,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before we review our first quarter results, I'd like to provide some context about how our business has evolved and the direction we're heading. Over the past decade, we've transitioned from being a predominantly mall-based store business to one that is more diversified, with multiple ways for customers to shop with us. During this time, we've invested in capabilities to better serve our customers and gain market share. This fueled our e-commerce growth, increased our customer base and enabled us to expand into new markets. Through these efforts, we've added nearly $6 billion to our top line.
In keeping our customers at the forefront of everything we do, our business looks very different today. Nearly 1/4 of our sales are from online purchases compared to roughly 5% from 10 years ago. We've added more ways to serve customers through our acquisitions of Trunk Club and HauteLook. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to be our fastest-growing business to reach $1 billion. 
We offer a variety of services that support our customers' needs around convenience, such as buy online, pickup in store; curbside pickup; and same-day delivery. We continue to invest in critical talent and capabilities around technology, mobile, data analytics and supply chain. Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, product and services, represent the core of our brand. 
We're fortunate to have a high-quality portfolio of 122 full-line stores, with all of our comp stores generating positive cash flow. Furthermore, our stores play an important role in attracting and retaining customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels began at our full-line or Rack stores.
We have strategically grown our off-price business, which represents roughly 30% of sales. It's positioned as our largest source of new customers, with the average age skewing younger than our overall business. About 1/3 of customers who start shopping at the Rack will also cross-shop in our full-price business. We believe this is a unique competitive advantage in the market.
Because our customers' shopping experience may be influenced by multiple touch points, it's important that we view our business from the perspective of the markets in which we serve them. We're finding that measuring our outcomes through discrete channel metrics, such as store comps, are becoming less relevant.
As we continue to head in this direction, we're increasingly looking at our business as full-price and off-price, inclusive of stores and online, to better capture the synergies of having a physical and digital presence.
Now I'd like to discuss our first quarter results. Our earnings were in line with our expectations. We reported earnings per diluted share of $0.37, which included a onetime charge of $0.06 associated with the $650 million debt refinancing in the first quarter.
Last year, earnings per share of $0.26 included a $0.10 charge primarily related to higher credit charge-backs as we transition to a change in industry liability rules. When excluding these charges, our first quarter earnings increased 19% on a comparable basis.
While we're pleased with our inventory and expense execution, we're not satisfied with our top line results. Total sales increased 2.7% while comps decreased 0.8%. This was generally consistent with the trends we've experienced over the past year.
In our full-price business, total sales decreased 1.7% and comps decreased 2.8%. From a merchandise perspective, we had strength in our men's and women's apparel while accessories remained soft. Our expansion in full-price gross margin reflected the continued strength of our regular-price sales.
Our focus on expanding product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most sought-after brands while mitigating our business from the promotional environment. These efforts contributed to a 100 basis point increase in the mix of regular-price sales and our full-price business.
In our off-price business, total sales increased 8.7% and comps increased 2.3%. We took additional markdowns on slower-moving items, which impacted gross margins. Overall, our gross profit rate was slightly up from last year. We ended the quarter with inventory growth in line with sales growth.
Moving to our 2017 outlook. Our plan is grounded in the sales trends we've experienced over the past year. We are reiterating our earnings per share range of $2.75 to $3, total sales growth of 3% to 4% and approximately flat comps.
As we look ahead, we have a number of opportunities to drive growth. From a merchandising perspective, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness through a greater emphasis on limited distribution and relevant product. Our long-term ambition is for continued double-digit online growth. We've been able to increase the speed and agility with which we roll out enhancements to our product pages, navigation and content.
Mobile is integral to the customers' shopping experience and accounts for more than half of our online traffic. We're continually testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital experiences. As an example, we're expanding reserve online and trying in-stores from 60 to 50 stores this year. 
This fall, we have our 6 full-line store opening in Canada at Sherway Gardens in Toronto and 2 full-line store relocations in California at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Centre in La Jolla. We have opened 6 Racks so far in 2017 and have 11 more opening in the fall. Additionally, we're excited about our Manhattan flagship, which is on track to be completed in 2019. We recently announced a phased approach with the men's store opening first in spring 2018.
Finally, I'd like to share that we're looking forward to having Anne Bramman join our team as CFO on June 2. She brings extensive retail experience with demonstrated success as a business partner and a steward of capital. Anne is succeeding Mike Koppel, who retired at the beginning of this month. Over the past 16 years, Mike has provided insight to the leadership team into how we can best utilize the company's resources to produce the outcomes we aspire to achieve. Our financial standing and overall reputation have been greatly enhanced by his leadership. I'd personally like to thank Mike for his many contributions.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

So we were really close to that. But to be clear, our plan is to beat that. Our goal is to be ahead of our plans. And so we recognize that we had some opportunities. There were a number of things that our team is working on, but there isn't any one thing that I would call out. It's not dissimilar to the performance we had in Q4. We were down 0.8%. So we have seen a little bit of a softening, but it is close to our plan. And we are encouraged by the opportunities and initiatives we have for the balance of this year. In terms of the online off-price portion of it, it also just missed our plans. We're anniversary-ing from a year ago the strongest numbers we had. We had a 42% increase a year ago in Q1 in online off-price. We had a 19% performance for Q1 of 2017, and that just missed our plan. And you'll see, as the balance of the year goes on, much stronger numbers with our plan because we have a plan for the year that is stronger weighted towards the balance end of the year. In terms of your specifics have we've seen anything from competition or other factors, we don't have anything material that we would point out, only that we recognize this falls short of our goals, and we've got work to do to improve upon that. You had, I think, a question on the margin, too. Regarding Q1 margins, I did call out in my remarks that we took higher markdowns in our Rack business, predominantly due to some seasonal underperforming merchandise. We had some more boots and coats and other things that we felt necessitated some more markdowns. That had an impact to the overall. The overall margin was relatively flat. Full-price had an improvement in margin, with off-price bringing it down slightly."

When it comes to our smaller-volume stores, yes, they do generate cash. As Blake said, all of our -- all our stores are cash flow positive, and we make money there. Obviously, if you do put a bunch of capital into it, that can change that picture. We think we've got a lot of opportunities in the middle, frankly. It's not so much the small selling stores. We think those will be fine. It's a lot of the stores in the middle that we have an opportunity to upgrade them. So we're looking at a lot of different alternatives.

I think that the themes that are generally true across all classifications is that you -- there's a continuing turn around casualization that we need to be mindful of, really, kind of across the board and that we've had good success, I think, where we've focused on that appropriately. Newness is always a theme that we talk about. And for us to have our inventories in line and be able to bring new goods in always helps stimulate the business. Also, athletic and fitness-type brands, and that's kind of part of that casualization lifestyle part that we talked about a bit over the years. That's a strong trend. As I look at our top brands, it's interesting. We have several that are super healthy and growing double digits, and we have some big legacy brands we've done business with that are not; that are shrinking quite precipitously. So I guess, that's always been true to a degree. But the good news for us is that with how some of the brands are falling off, it creates open-to-buy for us. And so if you look at it from the buyer's point of view and our whole merchandising team, I think they feel pretty energized about the opportunity to go out and either apply more resources to some of these positive trends or find new brands. So it's -- I think, generally, our team feels -- maybe it's the nature of our business, but feels kind of optimistic about the future and our ability to be able to find great product."

So we've had such great growth in the online part of our off-price business. What the resulting action of that, kind of the unintended consequence, it creates more returns into a physical Rack store. Stuff that someone had bought online, customers often choose -- actually, most often choose to want to return that in store. So we've got more inventory back into the store than we had originally planned. And that's again because of the large growth that we've had there on the online part of the business in our off-price part of the segment. So we can adjust to that as it goes forward, but we're playing catch-up on that a little bit. And I think we understand, the further along that we get, how to anticipate those inventory conditions and so that we can do it more efficiently."

As far as the second question was the Rack customers that migrate over to full-price. We have -- a lot of that is first opportunity there is in data. As our models become more diverse, as off-price has become a bigger chunk of our business, as online becomes a bigger chunk of our business, we have more ways to serve the customer and gets us out of being a almost predominantly, as our history has been, a mall-based physical store model. And one of the great aspects of that is around customer acquisition and customer data. The Rack is a tremendous place for us to acquire customers. We're in very early innings of capturing the customer information and leveraging that to serve customers better. Our launch last year of our loyalty program to include noncardholders was a big step in the right direction, but we have a lot of opportunity going forward to continue to leverage customer information better.

The most successful Racks are ones that are right next to a full-price store. So there is some synergy that goes with that. It doesn't necessarily cannibalize. There is share. There is acquisition that happens. But again, generally, there's some younger people that enter our brand through the Rack and that they end up migrating up to full-price over time.

And the question I have is as customers expect so much, what do you think about the overall margin profile of the business and the need to materially step margins down just as you see the variable costs rise and also, as you look across the competitors who function in a very different margin structure? And it just feels like the speed to which customers expect product and the convenience factors will continue to pressure the need for you to address what consumers need. So I'm curious about the multiyear perspective on that since you are at the cutting edge with a lot of programs that you're implementing. And then I didn't know if I understood, so your lowest productivity is full-line stores, like should those be closed? Or how are you -- do you feel like they're brand appropriate even though they're 4-wall profitable?"

And one of the assets we obviously have is kind of 122 full-line stores to take care of our Nordstrom customers. And specifically, it's a place customers can go. It's also got people in there that can do things to serve customers better, and there's inventory. We've got a lot of inventory that's sitting out close to customers. So things like buy online and pick up in store is a great service. We have that in all our stores. It's growing about 50% year-over-year. And all our stores also have curbside pickup if customers want it. That's something that's a huge win for customers. It's also a win for us, for a customer to come in and pick up in the store. So we're focused on what are the assets we can have. Before we get into the -- kind of the race to the bottom of what are the things that just cost more, there is some of that but where we see an enormous amount of opportunity to do things that bolster the customer better and serve our business better."

In terms of our smaller stores, when we look at those stores, I think we have to ask ourselves, how do we feel about that store if we have to make a big investment in it. And given the amount of sales that those stores drive in a given market, the answers are different. If it's a store that's the only store in the market, we have very measurable online sales that those stores drive. And so we'd look at that. It might be the fifth or sixth store in a market, and that will give us a different answer. And if you look at what we've done over the last few years, where we have closed a number of stores that might have been the fifth or sixth store in that market and where we've invested in the better locations in that market, we'd rather the customer shop there. So I understand the spirit of the question, and we look at that a lot. We think there will be some opportunities over time but we really want to look at holistically with how we're serving customers in a given market, the role that those stores play, the role that online plays and how we can best serve them long term, and that will drive our decisions around our store fleet."

I would tell you that we planned the Rack business for the trend that's been the last, let's say, 18 months, and that's approximately flat in the comps in the stores. For Q1, we missed it by 0.9%. We're confident that we can get back on top of that, meet that plan and hopefully exceed it for the balance of the year. So we think we have grounded plans in trend. It will enable us to be more agile and flexible to move forward as the business responds. What's happened in years past is that we tend to get optimistic that tomorrow's going to be better and we get over our skis on expense or inventory and it doesn't allow us to be fluid and react to the business. So as Pete said, the whole subject about newness and the reason why the customer should buy something new really gets grounded in our merchants' ability to be able to keep everything very open and fluid. And so we have that with the Rack. Our inventories are in line. I think we have some good initiatives this year. But we look at the Rack not just -- and it's been said throughout this call, from the bricks-and-mortar point of view, we look at it as an off-price business with -- and our -- the Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook. And when you put that together, we think we're gaining market share, and we have facts that show that. But we're falling short of our plan. So we're trying to be clear with all of you on this call that we're not satisfied with these top line numbers, and we're working hard on that.

People shop for things lots of different ways, depending on what their needs happen to be that day. Some of those trips in the past have converted to trips to Nordstrom.com, and we're thrilled about that.

Before we review our first quarter results, I'd like to provide some context about how our business has evolved and the direction we're heading. Over the past decade, we've transitioned from being a predominantly mall-based store",1029,"Good afternoon, everyone. Before we review our first quarter results, I'd like to provide some context about how our business has evolved and the direction we're heading. Over the past decade, we've transitioned from being a predominantly mall-based store business to one that is more diversified, with multiple ways for customers to shop with us. During this time, we've invested in capabilities to better serve our customers and gain market share. This fueled our e-commerce growth, increased our customer base and enabled us to expand into new markets. Through these efforts, we've added nearly $6 billion to our top line.
In keeping our customers at the forefront of everything we do, our business looks very different today. Nearly 1/4 of our sales are from online purchases compared to roughly 5% from 10 years ago. We've added more ways to serve customers through our acquisitions of Trunk Club and HauteLook. Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook are on track to be our fastest-growing business to reach $1 billion. 
We offer a variety of services that support our customers' needs around convenience, such as buy online, pickup in store; curbside pickup; and same-day delivery. We continue to invest in critical talent and capabilities around technology, mobile, data analytics and supply chain. Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, product and services, represent the core of our brand. 
We're fortunate to have a high-quality portfolio of 122 full-line stores, with all of our comp stores generating positive cash flow. Furthermore, our stores play an important role in attracting and retaining customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels began at our full-line or Rack stores.
We have strategically grown our off-price business, which represents roughly 30% of sales. It's positioned as our largest source of new customers, with the average age skewing younger than our overall business. About 1/3 of customers who start shopping at the Rack will also cross-shop in our full-price business. We believe this is a unique competitive advantage in the market.
Because our customers' shopping experience may be influenced by multiple touch points, it's important that we view our business from the perspective of the markets in which we serve them. We're finding that measuring our outcomes through discrete channel metrics, such as store comps, are becoming less relevant.
As we continue to head in this direction, we're increasingly looking at our business as full-price and off-price, inclusive of stores and online, to better capture the synergies of having a physical and digital presence.
Now I'd like to discuss our first quarter results. Our earnings were in line with our expectations. We reported earnings per diluted share of $0.37, which included a onetime charge of $0.06 associated with the $650 million debt refinancing in the first quarter.
Last year, earnings per share of $0.26 included a $0.10 charge primarily related to higher credit charge-backs as we transition to a change in industry liability rules. When excluding these charges, our first quarter earnings increased 19% on a comparable basis.
While we're pleased with our inventory and expense execution, we're not satisfied with our top line results. Total sales increased 2.7% while comps decreased 0.8%. This was generally consistent with the trends we've experienced over the past year.
In our full-price business, total sales decreased 1.7% and comps decreased 2.8%. From a merchandise perspective, we had strength in our men's and women's apparel while accessories remained soft. Our expansion in full-price gross margin reflected the continued strength of our regular-price sales.
Our focus on expanding product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most sought-after brands while mitigating our business from the promotional environment. These efforts contributed to a 100 basis point increase in the mix of regular-price sales and our full-price business.
In our off-price business, total sales increased 8.7% and comps increased 2.3%. We took additional markdowns on slower-moving items, which impacted gross margins. Overall, our gross profit rate was slightly up from last year. We ended the quarter with inventory growth in line with sales growth.
Moving to our 2017 outlook. Our plan is grounded in the sales trends we've experienced over the past year. We are reiterating our earnings per share range of $2.75 to $3, total sales growth of 3% to 4% and approximately flat comps.
As we look ahead, we have a number of opportunities to drive growth. From a merchandising perspective, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness through a greater emphasis on limited distribution and relevant product. Our long-term ambition is for continued double-digit online growth. We've been able to increase the speed and agility with which we roll out enhancements to our product pages, navigation and content.
Mobile is integral to the customers' shopping experience and accounts for more than half of our online traffic. We're continually testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital experiences. As an example, we're expanding reserve online and trying in-stores from 60 to 50 stores this year. 
This fall, we have our 6 full-line store opening in Canada at Sherway Gardens in Toronto and 2 full-line store relocations in California at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Centre in La Jolla. We have opened 6 Racks so far in 2017 and have 11 more opening in the fall. Additionally, we're excited about our Manhattan flagship, which is on track to be completed in 2019. We recently announced a phased approach with the men's store opening first in spring 2018.
Finally, I'd like to share that we're looking forward to having Anne Bramman join our team as CFO on June 2. She brings extensive retail experience with demonstrated success as a business partner and a steward of capital. Anne is succeeding Mike Koppel, who retired at the beginning of this month. Over the past 16 years, Mike has provided insight to the leadership team into how we can best utilize the company's resources to produce the outcomes we aspire to achieve. Our financial standing and overall reputation have been greatly enhanced by his leadership. I'd personally like to thank Mike for his many contributions.
I'll now turn it over to Trina for Q&A."

So we have seen a little bit of a softening, but it is close to our plan. And we are encouraged by the opportunities and initiatives we have for the balance of this year. In terms of the online off-price portion of it, it also just missed our plans. We're anniversarying from a year ago the strongest numbers we had. We had a 42% increase a year ago in Q1 in online off-price. We had a 19% performance for Q1 of 2017, and that just missed our plan.

You had, I think, a question on the margin, too. Regarding Q1 margins, I did call out in my remarks that we took higher markdowns in our Rack business, predominantly due to some seasonal underperforming merchandise. We had some more boots and coats and other things that we felt necessitated some more markdowns. That had an impact to the overall. The overall margin was relatively flat. Full-price had an improvement in margin, with off-price bringing it down slightly."

Yes, I would say we've transitioned our practice of investing in remodels from historically, it was a pretty democratic approach, where after 10 or 12 years, we remodel the store kind of regardless of the volume level performance. And over the last couple of years, have transitioned to making more strategic investments in our highest-volume stores, those stores that we think play a bigger role in creating our brand. When it comes to our smaller-volume stores, yes, they do generate cash. As Blake said, all of our -- all our stores are cash flow positive, and we make money there. Obviously, if you do put a bunch of capital into it, that can change that picture. We think we've got a lot of opportunities in the middle, frankly. It's not so much the small selling stores. We think those will be fine. It's a lot of the stores in the middle that we have an opportunity to upgrade them. So we're looking at a lot of different alternatives. We're working with our partners on the real estate side. All the big mall developers out there that we're partners with are as motivated as we are to upgrade those stores. So we're starting to work on that, and we think we'll start to see some progress later this year."

We've talked about in the past that we could, over time, have approximately 300. I think the important thing there, too, is also the digital side of it. We ended last year with Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook with $700 million sales. I made reference in my comments that this is the fastest-growing part of our business in the history of this company moving towards $1 billion.

I think that the themes that are generally true across all classifications is that you -- there's a continuing turn around casualization that we need to be mindful of, really, kind of across the board and that we've had good success, I think, where we've focused on that appropriately. Newness is always a theme that we talk about. And for us to have our inventories in line and be able to bring new goods in always helps stimulate the business. Also, athletic and fitness-type brands, and that's kind of part of that casualization lifestyle part that we talked about a bit over the years. That's a strong trend. As I look at our top brands, it's interesting. We have several that are super healthy and growing double digits, and we have some big legacy brands we've done business with that are not; that are shrinking quite precipitously. So I guess, that's always been true to a degree. But the good news for us is that with how some of the brands are falling off, it creates open-to-buy for us. And so if you look at it from the buyer's point of view and our whole merchandising team, I think they feel pretty energized about the opportunity to go out and either apply more resources to some of these positive trends or find new brands. So it's -- I think, generally, our team feels -- maybe it's the nature of our business, but feels kind of optimistic about the future and our ability to be able to find great product."

Stuff that someone had bought online, customers often choose -- actually, most often choose to want to return that in store. So we've got more inventory back into the store than we had originally planned. And that's again because of the large growth that we've had there on the online part of the business in our off-price part of the segment.

As far as the second question was the Rack customers that migrate over to full-price. We have -- a lot of that is first opportunity there is in data. As our models become more diverse, as off-price has become a bigger chunk of our business, as online becomes a bigger chunk of our business, we have more ways to serve the customer and gets us out of being a almost predominantly, as our history has been, a mall-based physical store model. And one of the great aspects of that is around customer acquisition and customer data. The Rack is a tremendous place for us to acquire customers. We're in very early innings of capturing the customer information and leveraging that to serve customers better. Our launch last year of our loyalty program to include noncardholders was a big step in the right direction, but we have a lot of opportunity going forward to continue to leverage customer information better.

But we are making good progress with the bottom line results in the financial model, and there's more to do. And we're encouraged by that. We have a lot of initiatives that give us kind of cautious optimism for the balance of this year. And again, we try to be clear that there's no change in our annual guidance. Some of the reporting that you referred to is we're just trying to give some clarity about the nuances for the year and the quarter because we don't give quarterly guidance, and that was the thought behind that."

And so we're -- it's created some open-to-buy for us to try some new things. So we've got some catch-up to play there. So in total on handbags, including everything, it's down more than the average of everything else we're doing. Shoes, that's a big business for us. So we'd have to go speak to something pretty specific. Generally, again, the designer part of our shoe business has been strong. The part that's been the weakest for us is our BP. Shoe department in women's, which generally represents more of an entry kind of price point, typically a bit younger and more casual in styling. We've got to dig into that a little bit more and find out. I don't think that's necessarily reflective exactly of what's going on in the industry because you already heard me say earlier that things like athletic and casualization has done well. So I think that really mostly on us is stuff that we can fix and solve for, so that doesn't seem to be a secular issue that we can't solve for.

It's also got people in there that can do things to serve customers better, and there's inventory. We've got a lot of inventory that's sitting out close to customers. So things like buy online and pick up in store is a great service. We have that in all our stores. It's growing about 50% year-over-year.

We're confident that we can get back on top of that, meet that plan and hopefully exceed it for the balance of the year. So we think we have grounded plans in trend. It will enable us to be more agile and flexible to move forward as the business responds. What's happened in years past is that we tend to get optimistic that tomorrow's going to be better and we get over our skis on expense or inventory and it doesn't allow us to be fluid and react to the business. So as Pete said, the whole subject about newness and the reason why the customer should buy something new really gets grounded in our merchants' ability to be able to keep everything very open and fluid. And so we have that with the Rack. Our inventories are in line. I think we have some good initiatives this year. But we look at the Rack not just -- and it's been said throughout this call, from the bricks-and-mortar point of view, we look at it as an off-price business with -- and our -- the Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook.

As you know, we've just completed our Anniversary Sale. It's a unique event and one that distinguish itself in the industry as it includes brand-new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Our customers",1014,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As you know, we've just completed our Anniversary Sale. It's a unique event and one that distinguish itself in the industry as it includes brand-new arrivals at reduced prices for a limited time. Our customers look forward to our Anniversary Sale every year, and its one-of-a-kind element attracts new customers as well. This is our biggest event consistently generating significant volume that rivals the holiday period. 
Our anniversary results helped performed our recent sales trends as customers responded favorably to newness and the ability to shop the way they prefer in stores, with their mobile device and online. Our event continues to generate a strong call to action for our customers, and we increasingly see a higher penetration of digital sales. We delivered online growth of more than 20% compared to last year's sale. We also grew buy online, pickup in store sales by roughly 50%.
Our results demonstrated our progress in offering customers a differentiated selection of the best brands and products. 
In addition to a strong sellthrough rate of our anniversary product, we had increases in our regular price sales over last year. Beauty in women's apparel led our results, and 3 of our Nordstrom proprietary labels were among our top 5 selling brands. 
Our Nordstrom cardholders were among our most loyal customers, highly valued rewards benefit of shopping the sale early. Unfortunately, we had some website performance issues on the first day of [ early access ]. Our teams responded and resolved these issues within hours. Because our customers are our top priority, we subsequently offered Nordstrom cardholders 10 points per dollar spent on purchases made during the start of early access. Our customers appreciate this approach, and we saw substantial recovery in sales throughout the remainder of the day. In fact, we had the biggest day of online volume in our company's history.
Turning now to our overall sales results. We ended the second quarter with a total sales increase of 3.5% and comp increase of 1.7%. This growth was driven by our digital businesses, with NordstromRack.com and HauteLook, up 27%; and NordstromRack.com, up 20%.
In our full-price business, the Anniversary Sale contributed to positive gain with total sales increasing 2.4% and comp sales increasing 1.4% in the second quarter. While our full-line stores improved during the sale, the underlying trends outside of this event were consistent with our recent trend. Keep in mind that our anniversary results won't necessary inform our second half performance. Recall that last year, after a strong Anniversary Sale, our second half was more reflective of the trends prior to the event.
In our off-price business, total sales increased 9.8%, and comp sales increased 3.1%. This represented an improvement of roughly 100 basis points from last quarter but fell slightly below our expectation.
Looking to the rest of the year. We continue to focus on enhancing the customer experience and reaching new customers by leveraging our digital capability and investing in our top market. As part of our customer strategy, we're continually testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital shopping experiences. We're expanding our reserve online and try in-store service from 6 stores in the Seattle area to 4 more in the Chicago market. We plan to offer this feature in roughly 50 stores by the end of the year. We've been encouraged to find that around 80% of customers who try this service choose to shop this way again. 
We're executing on our digital strategy to meet our ambition for continued double-digit online growth. Through our ongoing efforts to elevate the digital experience, we expect our online penetration to exceed 25% by the end of the year. We've modernized our platform, enabling us to increase the speed and agility of enhancements to our product page, navigation and content. In our efforts to gain market share, we continue to prioritize our investments in the top North American market. 
In September, we will complete our planned full-line store expansion into Canada with the [ 6 ] store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. And in October, we will relocate 2 full-line stores in California, 1 from Westside Pavilion to Century City in Los Angeles and the other into a new space at University Towne Center in La Jolla. 
Our Rack business is an important way to attract the customers to Nordstrom. We opened 6 stores this spring, with 11 more opening this fall, which will bring our total Rack store count to 232 at year-end.
These stores incorporate our latest store designs with improvements to the layout and fitting room experience. Additionally, we're further integrating the digital and store functionalities to improve speed and convenience for the customer. 
For example, we enhanced our mobile app so the customers scan an item in store and buy it online if they want a different color or size. 
Through strategic partnerships with our vendors, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness and relevant product. Our efforts to expand product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most relevant brand while strengthening our regular-price business.
In closing, we view our business through our Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brand rather than through discrete store and online channel. The combination of our physical and digital asset represents a competitive advantage. Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, products and services are the core of our brand and play an important role in engaging with our customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels begin at our stores. With our customers at the center of everything we do, we're appreciative of the ongoing efforts by our team to better serve them in more ways, which has contributed positively to our second quarter result.
I'd now like to introduce Anne Bramman, who joined our team as Chief Financial Officer on June 2. She's a tremendous addition to our executive team and the company as a whole that hit the ground running in supporting our various initiatives. 
Anne, I'll now turn it over to you."

Since being in the role for the last couple",970,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. But before we get started on our results, I'd like to say how excited I am to be part of this company. I've long admired the Nordstrom brand and the management team. Since being in the role for the last couple of months, my appreciation of the company's unique culture and customer-centric philosophy has only grown. 
During the time of transformative change in the industry, I consider Nordstrom a leader in strategically investing for the future. In supporting the company's commitment to operating excellence, on focusing on evolving our business model to better serve customers and improve our performance.
Moving on to our second quarter results. Our earnings per share of $0.65 achieved our expectations. This reflected our positive anniversary results on going inventory and expense discipline and continued strength of our financial position.
Now some additional color on the drivers of our earnings. Beginning with merchandise margins. We had an improvement over last year, driven by the strength of our regular-priced selling. This exemplified our ongoing progress providing customers with newness and limited distribution product. 
We ended the quarter in a good inventory position, with sales growth of 3.5%, outpacing inventory growth of 2.2%. 
Our merchandise performance was more than offset by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores. In addition to the unplanned [ 10-point ] loyalty [ accommodation ] that Blake mentioned. We believe this offer contribute to our top line performance, but impact the growth profit by $7 million or 20 basis points.
From an EBIT perspective, we estimate the overall impact was roughly breakeven for the quarter with potential future upside of customers redeem their point. The net impact of all these factors was 25 basis point decline in gross profits from last year.
Moving to our expense performance. We've made meaningful improvement to our operating model. As we've accelerated our investment to fuel growth over the past several years, our technology, supply chain and marketing expenses grew 20% on an annualized basis from 2010 to 2015. Last year, we made a significant step change by making a number of adjustments to increase our efficiencies. As a result, the expense growth of our enterprise capabilities was cut in half to 10%. Throughout this year, we continued to maintain this moderated expense rate for these areas.
For the second quarter, SG&A expense increased 5% from last year or approximately 45 basis points, driven by a couple of items. As we've shared at the beginning of the year, we plan a total technology investment on a cash basis of $540 million or 3.5% of sales. This all in view captures the changing nature of our investment as we continue to shift to a cloud-based platform. This transition resulted in immediate expense impact rather than capitalization. 
In the first half of the year, we stayed on track with our plan as we continue to focus on improving our technology productivity. In addition, there is a mixed impact from higher supply chain costs associated with the growth of our online businesses, which accounted for 25% of our sales in the second quarter.
In terms of our underlying supply chain performance, on average cost per unit came in better than planned.
Our credit EBIT increased $23  -- [ $23 million ] over last year, driven by a 30% increase in credit card revenues. This was attributable to our successful partnership with TD Bank, which continues to exceed our expectation.
Turning to our financial position. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of approximately $900 million, essentially flat to a year ago. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $574 million and free cash flow of $115 million. Our debt leverage remain consistent with our expectation at 2.4x in adjusted debt-to-EBITDA basis. These metrics reflect our strong financial position, which is supported by our robust e-commerce platform and high-quality store portfolio. Even through the current retool environment, we have demonstrated industry-leading growth, increasing sales by 6% on an annualized basis over the past 3 years. Since 2009, we consistently generating annual operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion while maintaining a solid investment-grade rating.
We are well positioned in the market with our stores generating positive cash flows. As Blake mentioned, we're proportionally investing in the top market in which we serve customers. Our omni-channel business model provides favorable economics related to the cost of serving customers and strengthening our brand. As we continue to refine our approach, we'll keep you updated to how we're lining our metrics to better reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've narrowed EPS to the high end of our range, which represents $2.85 to $3. This incorporates our second quarter performance of while holding our assumptions for the second half of the year. Our top line expectations are consistent and reflects the trends we've seen over the past 1.5 years. Total sales are expected to increase approximately 4%, including $200 million for the [ 53rd week ] while we expect comp sales to be roughly flat to last year.
Retail gross profit is [indiscernible] higher new store expensive expenses and the mix impact of price good. Merchandise margins for the year should be relatively stable.
Our SG&A outlook remains consistent and incorporate side technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives, offset by our continued progress in productivity improvement. Our second quarter income tax rate of roughly 42% was impacted by timing. We expect to end the year with a tax rate of approximately 40%.
In closing, we remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience. This enable us to continue greater value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers and employees.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

We had in hindsight now maybe too aggressive a plan for the year. So for this year, we've been running about 200 basis points below our plan, and that's put a low pressure on our business and so that's why I made a comment that it was running a little bit below our expectation. But the main thing that I tried to convey in 3 or 4 of these calls now is both for the full-price business and the off-price business, we look at as a customer looks at it, both digitally and in the stores. And so merchants were aware of the nuances in each channel. The most important thing is how are we doing from a multichannel point of view in off-price, and we're really pleased with our results. And we think there's a lot of positives taking place, whether that's attracting new customers, whether it's a product to willing to return on that investment, it's low very strong part of our business and we're encouraged about the opportunities. We have some opportunities with a plan to manage the inventory a little bit tighter. So overall, the company had good inventory control, and off-price slightly over given those plans but a little margin pressure on it. But we think that's one of our strengths.

As you know, we've just completed our Anniversary Sale. It's a unique event and one that distinguishes us in the industry, as it includes brand-new arrivals that reduce prices for a limited time. Our customers",1014,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As you know, we've just completed our Anniversary Sale. It's a unique event and one that distinguishes us in the industry, as it includes brand-new arrivals that reduce prices for a limited time. Our customers look forward to our Anniversary Sale every year, and its one-of-a-kind element attracts new customers as well. This is our biggest event consistently generating significant volume that rivals the holiday period. 
Our Anniversary results outperformed our recent sales trends as customers responded favorably to newness and the ability to shop the way they prefer in stores, with a mobile device and online. Our event continues to generate a strong call to action for our customers, and we increasingly see a higher penetration of digital sales. We delivered online growth of more than 20% compared to last year's sale. We also grew buy-online, pick-up in-store sales by roughly 50%. Our results demonstrated our progress in offering customers a differentiated selection of the best brands and products. 
In addition to a strong sell-through rate of our Anniversary product, we had increases in our regular price sales over last year. Beauty and Women's apparel led our results, and 3 of our Nordstrom proprietary labels were among our top 5 selling brands. 
Our Nordstrom cardholders, who are among our most loyal customers, highly value the rewards benefit of shopping the sale early. Unfortunately, we had some website performance issues on the first day of Early Access. Our teams responded and resolved these issues within hours. Because our customers are our top priority, we subsequently offered Nordstrom cardholders 10 points per dollar spent on purchases made during the start of Early Access. Our customers appreciate this approach, and we saw a substantial recovery in sales throughout the remainder of the day. In fact, we had the biggest day of online volume in our company's history.
Turning now to our overall sales results. We ended the second quarter with a total sales increase of 3.5% and comp increase of 1.7%. This growth was driven by our digital businesses, with Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook up 27% and Nordstrom.com up 20%.
In our full-price business, the Anniversary Sale contributed to positive gain with total sales increasing 2.4% and comp sales increasing 1.4% in the second quarter. While our full-line stores improved during the sale, the underlying trends outside of this event were consistent with our recent trend. Keep in mind that our Anniversary results won't necessary inform our second half performance. Recall that last year, after a strong Anniversary Sale, our second half was more reflective of the trends prior to the event.
In our off-price business, total sales increased 9.8%, and comp sales increased 3.1%. This represented an improvement of roughly 100 basis points from last quarter but fell slightly below our expectation.
Looking to the rest of the year. We continue to focus on enhancing the customer experience and reaching new customers by leveraging our digital capabilities and investing in our top market. As part of our customer strategy, we're continually testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital shopping experiences. We're expanding our Reserve Online and Try In Store service from 6 stores in the Seattle area to 4 more in the Chicago market. We plan to offer this feature in roughly 50 stores by the end of the year. We've been encouraged to find that around 80% of customers who try this service choose to shop this way again. 
We're executing on our digital strategy to meet our ambition for continued double-digit online growth. Through our ongoing efforts to elevate the digital experience, we expect our online penetration to exceed 25% by the end of the year. We've modernized our platform, enabling us to increase the speed and agility of enhancements to our product pages, navigation and content. In our efforts to gain market share, we continue to prioritize our investments in the top North American market. 
In September, we will complete our planned full-line store expansion into Canada with a 6th store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. And in October, we will relocate 2 full-line stores in California, 1 from Westside Pavilion to Century City in Los Angeles, and the other into a new space at University Towne Center in La Jolla. 
Our Rack business is an important way to attract new customers to Nordstrom. We opened 6 stores this spring, with 11 more opening this fall, which will bring our total Rack store count to 232 at year-end.
These stores incorporate our latest store designs with improvements to the layout and fitting room experience. Additionally, we're further integrating the digital and store functionalities to improve speed and convenience for the customer. For example, we enhanced our mobile app so that customers can scan an item in store and buy it online if they want a different color or size. 
Through strategic partnerships with our vendors, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness and relevant product. Our efforts to expand product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most relevant brand while strengthening our regular-price business.
In closing, we view our business through our Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brand rather than through discrete store and online channel. The combination of our physical and digital asset represents a competitive advantage. Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, products and services, are the core of our brand and play an important role in engaging with our customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels began at our stores. With our customers at the center of everything we do, we're appreciative of the ongoing efforts by our team to better serve them in more ways, which has contributed positively to our second quarter result.
I'd now like to introduce Anne Bramman, who joined our team as Chief Financial Officer on June 2. She is a tremendous addition to our executive team and the company as a whole and has hit the ground running in supporting our various initiatives. 
Anne, I'll now turn it over to you."

I've long admired the Nordstrom brand and the management team. Since being in the role for the last couple of months, my appreciation of the company's unique culture and customer-centric philosophy has only grown. 
During a time of transformative change in the industry, I consider Nordstrom a leader in strategically investing for the future. In supporting the company's commitment to operating excellence, I'm focusing on evolving our business model to better serve customers and improve our performance.
Moving on to our second quarter results. Our earnings per share of $0.65 achieved our expectations. This reflected our positive Anniversary results, on-going inventory and expense discipline, and continued strength of our financial position.
Now some additional color on the drivers of our earnings. Beginning with merchandise margins. We had an improvement over last year, driven by the strength of our regular-priced selling. This exemplified our ongoing progress of providing customers with newness and limited distribution product. We ended the quarter in a good inventory position, with sales growth of 3.5%, outpacing inventory growth of 2.2%. 
Our merchandise performance was more than offset by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores, in addition to the unplanned 10-point loyalty accommodation that Blake mentioned. We believe this offer contributed to our top line performance, but impacted gross profit by $7 million or 20 basis points.
From an EBIT perspective, we estimate the overall impact was roughly breakeven for the quarter with potential future upside of customers redeem their points. The net impact of all these factors was 25 basis point decline in gross profits from last year.
Moving to our expense performance, we've made meaningful improvement to our operating model. As we've accelerated our investment to fuel growth over the past several years, our technology, supply chain and marketing expenses grew 20% on an annualized basis from 2010 to 2015. Last year, we made a significant step change by making a number of adjustments to increase our efficiencies. As a result, the expense growth of our enterprise capabilities was cut in half to 10%. Throughout this year, we continued to maintain this moderated expense rate for these areas.
For the second quarter, SG&A expense increased 5% from last year or approximately 45 basis points, driven by a couple of items. As we've shared at the beginning of the year, we planned a total technology investment on a cash basis of $540 million or 3.5% of sales. This all-in view captures the changing nature of our investment as we continue to shift to a cloud-based platform. This transition results in an immediate expense impact rather than capitalization. 
In the first half of the year, we stayed on track with our plan as we continue to focus on improving our technology productivity. In addition, there is a mixed impact from higher supply chain costs associated with the growth of our online businesses, which accounted for 25% of our sales in the second quarter. In terms of our underlying supply chain performance, on average, cost per unit came in better than planned.
Our credit EBIT increased $23 million over last year, driven by a 30% increase in credit card revenues. This was attributable to our successful partnership with TD Bank, which continues to exceed our expectations.
Turning to our financial position. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of approximately $900 million, essentially flat to a year ago. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $574 million and free cash flow of $115 million. Our debt leverage remain consistent with our expectation at 2.4x on adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR basis. These metrics reflect our strong financial position, which is supported by a robust e-commerce platform and high-quality store portfolio. Even through this current retail environment, we've demonstrated industry-leading growth, increasing sales by 6% on an annualized basis over the past 3 years. Since 2009, we consistently generated annual operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion while maintaining a solid investment-grade rating.
We are well positioned in the market with our stores generating positive cash flows. As Blake mentioned, we're disproportionately investing in the top market in which we serve customers. Our omnichannel business model provides favorable economics related to the cost of serving customers and strengthening our brand. As we continue to refine our approach, we'll keep you updated on how we're lining our metrics to better reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've narrowed EPS to the high end of our range, which represents $2.85 to $3. This incorporates our second quarter performance while holding our assumptions for the second half of the year. Our top line expectations are consistent and reflects the trends we've seen over the past 1.5 years. Total sales are expected to increase approximately 4%, including $200 million for the 53rd week, while we expect comp sales to be roughly flat to last year.
Retail gross profit assumes higher new store occupancy expenses and the mix impact from off-price growth. Merchandise margins for the year should be relatively stable.
Our SG&A outlook remains consistent and incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives, offset by our continued progress in productivity improvement. Our second quarter income tax rate of roughly 42% was impacted by timing. We expect to end the year with a tax rate of approximately 40%.
In closing, we remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience. This enables us to continue creating value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers and employees.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

We had, in hindsight now, maybe too aggressive a plan for the year. So for this year, we've been running about 200 basis points below our plan, and that's put a little pressure on our business, and so that's why I made a comment that it was running a little bit below our expectation. But the main thing that I tried to convey in 3 or 4 of these calls now is both for the full-price business and the off-price business, we look at as the customer looks at it, both digitally and in the stores. And so as merchants were aware of the nuances in each channel, the most important thing is how are we doing from a multichannel point of view in off-price, and we're really pleased with our results. And we think there's a lot of positives taking place, whether that's attracting new customers, whether it's a productivity that we're trending on that investment, it's still a very strong part of our business, and we're encouraged about the opportunities. We have some opportunities with that plan to manage the inventory a little bit tighter. So overall, the company had good inventory control, and off-price was slightly over, given those plans. So put a little margin pressure on it. But we think that's one of our strengths. We're making those changes, and we hope to demonstrate that for you the balance of this year."

It's an example we use a lot internally, especially in full price, because it is free for customers to mail back the returns, yet over 60% of our customers choose to do the returns in the store and because that's what they want to do. It's good for the customer and by the way, it's good for us. It's more economical for us, I think, to return that way. And also as you can imagine, having a store -- customer in the store is beneficial, and we really don't focus on trying to turn around that return and make a sale immediately with it. What we've learned is customer comes with a return, that's they're end they have to do.

As Pete talked about, long been a driver of our business has been newness, and we think we should have the fashion authority, the curated assortment with the customers to be a place where they come for something new and alter the wardrobe. We've been investing, as you know, for quite some time, and some of those investments are starting to mature and some are in early stages. But I'd point out around technology data where we're investing, in particular around supply chain, marketing and personalization. And we're starting to see progress in all those areas and Anniversary was part of that. And supply chain, there's a reference that our cost per unit delivery was reduced year-over-year. Just from a customer experience, we deliver package faster at a lower cost this Anniversary and while also reducing the number of orders should canceled due to inventory latency in the system.

As you know, we've just completed our Anniversary Sale. It's a unique event and one that distinguishes us in the industry, as it includes brand-new arrivals that reduce prices for a limited time. Our customers",1014,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As you know, we've just completed our Anniversary Sale. It's a unique event and one that distinguishes us in the industry, as it includes brand-new arrivals that reduce prices for a limited time. Our customers look forward to our Anniversary Sale every year, and its one-of-a-kind element attracts new customers as well. This is our biggest event consistently generating significant volume that rivals the holiday period. 
Our Anniversary results outperformed our recent sales trends as customers responded favorably to newness and the ability to shop the way they prefer in stores, with a mobile device and online. Our event continues to generate a strong call to action for our customers, and we increasingly see a higher penetration of digital sales. We delivered online growth of more than 20% compared to last year's sale. We also grew buy-online, pick-up in-store sales by roughly 50%. Our results demonstrated our progress in offering customers a differentiated selection of the best brands and products. 
In addition to a strong sell-through rate of our Anniversary product, we had increases in our regular price sales over last year. Beauty and Women's apparel led our results, and 3 of our Nordstrom proprietary labels were among our top 5 selling brands. 
Our Nordstrom cardholders, who are among our most loyal customers, highly value the rewards benefit of shopping the sale early. Unfortunately, we had some website performance issues on the first day of Early Access. Our teams responded and resolved these issues within hours. Because our customers are our top priority, we subsequently offered Nordstrom cardholders 10 points per dollar spent on purchases made during the start of Early Access. Our customers appreciate this approach, and we saw a substantial recovery in sales throughout the remainder of the day. In fact, we had the biggest day of online volume in our company's history.
Turning now to our overall sales results. We ended the second quarter with a total sales increase of 3.5% and comp increase of 1.7%. This growth was driven by our digital businesses, with Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook up 27% and Nordstrom.com up 20%.
In our full-price business, the Anniversary Sale contributed to positive gain with total sales increasing 2.4% and comp sales increasing 1.4% in the second quarter. While our full-line stores improved during the sale, the underlying trends outside of this event were consistent with our recent trend. Keep in mind that our Anniversary results won't necessary inform our second half performance. Recall that last year, after a strong Anniversary Sale, our second half was more reflective of the trends prior to the event.
In our off-price business, total sales increased 9.8%, and comp sales increased 3.1%. This represented an improvement of roughly 100 basis points from last quarter but fell slightly below our expectation.
Looking to the rest of the year. We continue to focus on enhancing the customer experience and reaching new customers by leveraging our digital capabilities and investing in our top market. As part of our customer strategy, we're continually testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital shopping experiences. We're expanding our Reserve Online and Try In Store service from 6 stores in the Seattle area to 4 more in the Chicago market. We plan to offer this feature in roughly 50 stores by the end of the year. We've been encouraged to find that around 80% of customers who try this service choose to shop this way again. 
We're executing on our digital strategy to meet our ambition for continued double-digit online growth. Through our ongoing efforts to elevate the digital experience, we expect our online penetration to exceed 25% by the end of the year. We've modernized our platform, enabling us to increase the speed and agility of enhancements to our product pages, navigation and content. In our efforts to gain market share, we continue to prioritize our investments in the top North American market. 
In September, we will complete our planned full-line store expansion into Canada with a 6th store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. And in October, we will relocate 2 full-line stores in California, 1 from Westside Pavilion to Century City in Los Angeles, and the other into a new space at University Towne Center in La Jolla. 
Our Rack business is an important way to attract new customers to Nordstrom. We opened 6 stores this spring, with 11 more opening this fall, which will bring our total Rack store count to 232 at year-end.
These stores incorporate our latest store designs with improvements to the layout and fitting room experience. Additionally, we're further integrating the digital and store functionalities to improve speed and convenience for the customer. For example, we enhanced our mobile app so that customers can scan an item in store and buy it online if they want a different color or size. 
Through strategic partnerships with our vendors, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness and relevant product. Our efforts to expand product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most relevant brand while strengthening our regular-price business.
In closing, we view our business through our Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brand rather than through discrete store and online channel. The combination of our physical and digital asset represents a competitive advantage. Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, products and services, are the core of our brand and play an important role in engaging with our customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels began at our stores. With our customers at the center of everything we do, we're appreciative of the ongoing efforts by our team to better serve them in more ways, which has contributed positively to our second quarter result.
I'd now like to introduce Anne Bramman, who joined our team as Chief Financial Officer on June 2. She is a tremendous addition to our executive team and the company as a whole and has hit the ground running in supporting our various initiatives. 
Anne, I'll now turn it over to you."

But before we get started on our results, I'd like to say how excited I am to be part of this company. I've long admired the Nordstrom brand and the management team. Since being in the role for the last couple",956,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. But before we get started on our results, I'd like to say how excited I am to be part of this company. I've long admired the Nordstrom brand and the management team. Since being in the role for the last couple of months, my appreciation of the company's unique culture and customer-centric philosophy has only grown. 
During a time of transformative change in the industry, I consider Nordstrom a leader in strategically investing for the future. In supporting the company's commitment to operating excellence, I'm focusing on evolving our business model to better serve customers and improve our performance.
Moving on to our second quarter results. Our earnings per share of $0.65 achieved our expectations. This reflected our positive Anniversary results, on-going inventory and expense discipline, and continued strength of our financial position.
Now some additional color on the drivers of our earnings. Beginning with merchandise margins. We had an improvement over last year, driven by the strength of our regular-priced selling. This exemplified our ongoing progress of providing customers with newness and limited distribution product. We ended the quarter in a good inventory position, with sales growth of 3.5%, outpacing inventory growth of 2.2%. 
Our merchandise performance was more than offset by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores, in addition to the unplanned 10-point loyalty accommodation that Blake mentioned. We believe this offer contributed to our top line performance, but impacted gross profit by $7 million or 20 basis points.
From an EBIT perspective, we estimate the overall impact was roughly breakeven for the quarter with potential future upside of customers redeem their points. The net impact of all these factors was 25 basis point decline in gross profits from last year.
Moving to our expense performance, we've made meaningful improvement to our operating model. As we've accelerated our investment to fuel growth over the past several years, our technology, supply chain and marketing expenses grew 20% on an annualized basis from 2010 to 2015. Last year, we made a significant step change by making a number of adjustments to increase our efficiencies. As a result, the expense growth of our enterprise capabilities was cut in half to 10%. Throughout this year, we continued to maintain this moderated expense rate for these areas.
For the second quarter, SG&A expense increased 5% from last year or approximately 45 basis points, driven by a couple of items. As we've shared at the beginning of the year, we planned a total technology investment on a cash basis of $540 million or 3.5% of sales. This all-in view captures the changing nature of our investment as we continue to shift to a cloud-based platform. This transition results in an immediate expense impact rather than capitalization. 
In the first half of the year, we stayed on track with our plan as we continue to focus on improving our technology productivity. In addition, there is a mixed impact from higher supply chain costs associated with the growth of our online businesses, which accounted for 25% of our sales in the second quarter. In terms of our underlying supply chain performance, on average, cost per unit came in better than planned.
Our credit EBIT increased $23 million over last year, driven by a 30% increase in credit card revenues. This was attributable to our successful partnership with TD Bank, which continues to exceed our expectations.
Turning to our financial position. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of approximately $900 million, essentially flat to a year ago. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $574 million and free cash flow of $115 million. Our debt leverage remain consistent with our expectation at 2.4x on adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR basis. These metrics reflect our strong financial position, which is supported by a robust e-commerce platform and high-quality store portfolio. Even through this current retail environment, we've demonstrated industry-leading growth, increasing sales by 6% on an annualized basis over the past 3 years. Since 2009, we consistently generated annual operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion while maintaining a solid investment-grade rating.
We are well positioned in the market with our stores generating positive cash flows. As Blake mentioned, we're disproportionately investing in the top market in which we serve customers. Our omnichannel business model provides favorable economics related to the cost of serving customers and strengthening our brand. As we continue to refine our approach, we'll keep you updated on how we're lining our metrics to better reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've narrowed EPS to the high end of our range, which represents $2.85 to $3. This incorporates our second quarter performance while holding our assumptions for the second half of the year. Our top line expectations are consistent and reflects the trends we've seen over the past 1.5 years. Total sales are expected to increase approximately 4%, including $200 million for the 53rd week, while we expect comp sales to be roughly flat to last year.
Retail gross profit assumes higher new store occupancy expenses and the mix impact from off-price growth. Merchandise margins for the year should be relatively stable.
Our SG&A outlook remains consistent and incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives, offset by our continued progress in productivity improvement. Our second quarter income tax rate of roughly 42% was impacted by timing. We expect to end the year with a tax rate of approximately 40%.
In closing, we remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience. This enables us to continue creating value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers and employees.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

And if you look for the last 6 quarters, it's been fairly consistent ranging from on the high 8% to about 11.8% to 12% from a total business, and the comps are pretty similar. We had, in hindsight now, maybe too aggressive a plan for the year. So for this year, we've been running about 200 basis points below our plan, and that's put a little pressure on our business, and so that's why I made a comment that it was running a little bit below our expectation. But the main thing that I tried to convey in 3 or 4 of these calls now is both for the full-price business and the off-price business, we look at as the customer looks at it, both digitally and in the stores. And so though as merchants we're aware of the nuances in each channel, the most important thing is how are we doing from a multichannel point of view in off-price, and we're really pleased with our results. And we think there's a lot of positives taking place, whether that's attracting new customers, whether it's the productivity, that return on that investment, it's still a very strong part of our business, and we're encouraged about the opportunities. We have some opportunities with that plan to manage the inventory a little bit tighter. So overall, the company had good inventory control, and off-price was slightly over, given those plans. So put a little margin pressure on it. But we think that's one of our strengths. We're making those changes, and we hope to demonstrate that for you the balance of this year."

It's an example we use a lot internally, especially in full price, because it is free for customers to mail back the returns, yet over 60% of our customers choose to do the returns in a store and because that's what they want to do. It's good for the customer and by the way, it's good for us. It's more economical for us to return that way. And also as you can imagine, having a store -- customer in the store is beneficial, and we really don't focus on trying to turn around that return and make a sale immediately with it. What we've learned is, a customer comes in with a return, that's their errand they have to do.

But I'd point out around technology data where we're investing, in particular around supply chain, marketing and personalization. And we're starting to see progress in all those areas and Anniversary was part of that. And supply chain, there's a reference that our cost per unit delivering was reduced year-over-year. Just from a customer experience, we delivered package faster at a lower cost this Anniversary and while also reducing the number of orders that canceled due to inventory latency in the system. So there's been good progress there that we think is really important to customers."

And obviously, it's been really well received by the customer. That is the nature of that business, is being able to be opportunistic to work with our key vendors and to be able to take advantage of things like that. And obviously, we want to keep doing more of things along those line. It's why we're very sensitive to the inventory management because it's really important in that business even maybe more so than the full-price business that we're opportunistic in our buys and that we have open to buy and can be aggressive in that. To date, I can't think of something materially that have passed on, but we just want to stay in that mode. In terms of foot traffic in the stores, Jamie talked earlier, we don't have traffic counters, we look at transaction. We are seeing a very -- continues to be a very healthy movement of customers between the channels, and in many cases, their first experiences in the Rack and then off-price and online and they migrate into a full-price offering. And it's a great way for us to attract an aspirational customer that we're anxious to have part of our portfolio. So I don't know, Jamie, is there anything for you to add on full price?"

As you know, we've just completed our Anniversary Sale. It's a unique event and one that distinguishes us in the industry, as it includes brand-new arrivals that reduce prices for a limited time. Our customers",1014,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As you know, we've just completed our Anniversary Sale. It's a unique event and one that distinguishes us in the industry, as it includes brand-new arrivals that reduce prices for a limited time. Our customers look forward to our Anniversary Sale every year, and its one-of-a-kind element attracts new customers as well. This is our biggest event consistently generating significant volume that rivals the holiday period. 
Our Anniversary results outperformed our recent sales trends as customers responded favorably to newness and the ability to shop the way they prefer in stores, with a mobile device and online. Our event continues to generate a strong call to action for our customers, and we increasingly see a higher penetration of digital sales. We delivered online growth of more than 20% compared to last year's sale. We also grew buy-online, pick-up in-store sales by roughly 50%. Our results demonstrated our progress in offering customers a differentiated selection of the best brands and products. 
In addition to a strong sell-through rate of our Anniversary product, we had increases in our regular price sales over last year. Beauty and Women's apparel led our results, and 3 of our Nordstrom proprietary labels were among our top 5 selling brands. 
Our Nordstrom cardholders, who are among our most loyal customers, highly value the rewards benefit of shopping the sale early. Unfortunately, we had some website performance issues on the first day of Early Access. Our teams responded and resolved these issues within hours. Because our customers are our top priority, we subsequently offered Nordstrom cardholders 10 points per dollar spent on purchases made during the start of Early Access. Our customers appreciate this approach, and we saw a substantial recovery in sales throughout the remainder of the day. In fact, we had the biggest day of online volume in our company's history.
Turning now to our overall sales results. We ended the second quarter with a total sales increase of 3.5% and comp increase of 1.7%. This growth was driven by our digital businesses, with Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook up 27% and Nordstrom.com up 20%.
In our full-price business, the Anniversary Sale contributed to positive gain with total sales increasing 2.4% and comp sales increasing 1.4% in the second quarter. While our full-line stores improved during the sale, the underlying trends outside of this event were consistent with our recent trend. Keep in mind that our Anniversary results won't necessary inform our second half performance. Recall that last year, after a strong Anniversary Sale, our second half was more reflective of the trends prior to the event.
In our off-price business, total sales increased 9.8%, and comp sales increased 3.1%. This represented an improvement of roughly 100 basis points from last quarter but fell slightly below our expectation.
Looking to the rest of the year. We continue to focus on enhancing the customer experience and reaching new customers by leveraging our digital capabilities and investing in our top market. As part of our customer strategy, we're continually testing and rolling out new ways to connect the physical and digital shopping experiences. We're expanding our Reserve Online and Try In Store service from 6 stores in the Seattle area to 4 more in the Chicago market. We plan to offer this feature in roughly 50 stores by the end of the year. We've been encouraged to find that around 80% of customers who try this service choose to shop this way again. 
We're executing on our digital strategy to meet our ambition for continued double-digit online growth. Through our ongoing efforts to elevate the digital experience, we expect our online penetration to exceed 25% by the end of the year. We've modernized our platform, enabling us to increase the speed and agility of enhancements to our product pages, navigation and content. In our efforts to gain market share, we continue to prioritize our investments in the top North American market. 
In September, we will complete our planned full-line store expansion into Canada with a 6th store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. And in October, we will relocate 2 full-line stores in California, 1 from Westside Pavilion to Century City in Los Angeles, and the other into a new space at University Towne Center in La Jolla. 
Our Rack business is an important way to attract new customers to Nordstrom. We opened 6 stores this spring, with 11 more opening this fall, which will bring our total Rack store count to 232 at year-end.
These stores incorporate our latest store designs with improvements to the layout and fitting room experience. Additionally, we're further integrating the digital and store functionalities to improve speed and convenience for the customer. For example, we enhanced our mobile app so that customers can scan an item in store and buy it online if they want a different color or size. 
Through strategic partnerships with our vendors, we continue to focus on providing customers with newness and relevant product. Our efforts to expand product with limited distribution helps us provide customers with the most relevant brand while strengthening our regular-price business.
In closing, we view our business through our Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brand rather than through discrete store and online channel. The combination of our physical and digital asset represents a competitive advantage. Our local market assets, our stores, salespeople, products and services, are the core of our brand and play an important role in engaging with our customers. Nearly 80% of customers who shop with us across multiple channels began at our stores. With our customers at the center of everything we do, we're appreciative of the ongoing efforts by our team to better serve them in more ways, which has contributed positively to our second quarter result.
I'd now like to introduce Anne Bramman, who joined our team as Chief Financial Officer on June 2. She is a tremendous addition to our executive team and the company as a whole and has hit the ground running in supporting our various initiatives. 
Anne, I'll now turn it over to you."

I've long admired the Nordstrom brand and the management team. Since being in the role for the last couple of months, my appreciation of the company's unique culture and customer-centric philosophy has only grown. 
During a time of transformative change in the industry, I consider Nordstrom a leader in strategically investing for the future. In supporting the company's commitment to operating excellence, I'm focusing on evolving our business model to better serve customers and improve our performance.
Moving on to our second quarter results. Our earnings per share of $0.65 achieved our expectations. This reflected our positive Anniversary results, on-going inventory and expense discipline, and continued strength of our financial position.
Now some additional color on the drivers of our earnings. Beginning with merchandise margins. We had an improvement over last year, driven by the strength of our regular-priced selling. This exemplified our ongoing progress of providing customers with newness and limited distribution product. We ended the quarter in a good inventory position, with sales growth of 3.5%, outpacing inventory growth of 2.2%. 
Our merchandise performance was more than offset by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores, in addition to the unplanned 10-point loyalty accommodation that Blake mentioned. We believe this offer contributed to our top line performance, but impacted gross profit by $7 million or 20 basis points.
From an EBIT perspective, we estimate the overall impact was roughly breakeven for the quarter with potential future upside of customers redeem their points. The net impact of all these factors was 25 basis point decline in gross profits from last year.
Moving to our expense performance, we've made meaningful improvement to our operating model. As we've accelerated our investment to fuel growth over the past several years, our technology, supply chain and marketing expenses grew 20% on an annualized basis from 2010 to 2015. Last year, we made a significant step change by making a number of adjustments to increase our efficiencies. As a result, the expense growth of our enterprise capabilities was cut in half to 10%. Throughout this year, we continued to maintain this moderated expense rate for these areas.
For the second quarter, SG&A expense increased 5% from last year or approximately 45 basis points, driven by a couple of items. As we've shared at the beginning of the year, we planned a total technology investment on a cash basis of $540 million or 3.5% of sales. This all-in view captures the changing nature of our investment as we continue to shift to a cloud-based platform. This transition results in an immediate expense impact rather than capitalization. 
In the first half of the year, we stayed on track with our plan as we continue to focus on improving our technology productivity. In addition, there is a mixed impact from higher supply chain costs associated with the growth of our online businesses, which accounted for 25% of our sales in the second quarter. In terms of our underlying supply chain performance, on average, cost per unit came in better than planned.
Our credit EBIT increased $23 million over last year, driven by a 30% increase in credit card revenues. This was attributable to our successful partnership with TD Bank, which continues to exceed our expectations.
Turning to our financial position. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of approximately $900 million, essentially flat to a year ago. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $574 million and free cash flow of $115 million. Our debt leverage remain consistent with our expectation at 2.4x on adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR basis. These metrics reflect our strong financial position, which is supported by a robust e-commerce platform and high-quality store portfolio. Even through this current retail environment, we've demonstrated industry-leading growth, increasing sales by 6% on an annualized basis over the past 3 years. Since 2009, we consistently generated annual operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion while maintaining a solid investment-grade rating.
We are well positioned in the market with our stores generating positive cash flows. As Blake mentioned, we're disproportionately investing in the top market in which we serve customers. Our omnichannel business model provides favorable economics related to the cost of serving customers and strengthening our brand. As we continue to refine our approach, we'll keep you updated on how we're lining our metrics to better reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Turning now to our full year outlook. We've narrowed EPS to the high end of our range, which represents $2.85 to $3. This incorporates our second quarter performance while holding our assumptions for the second half of the year. Our top line expectations are consistent and reflects the trends we've seen over the past 1.5 years. Total sales are expected to increase approximately 4%, including $200 million for the 53rd week, while we expect comp sales to be roughly flat to last year.
Retail gross profit assumes higher new store occupancy expenses and the mix impact from off-price growth. Merchandise margins for the year should be relatively stable.
Our SG&A outlook remains consistent and incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives, offset by our continued progress in productivity improvement. Our second quarter income tax rate of roughly 42% was impacted by timing. We expect to end the year with a tax rate of approximately 40%.
In closing, we remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience. This enables us to continue creating value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders, customers and employees.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

We had, in hindsight now, maybe too aggressive a plan for the year. So for this year, we've been running about 200 basis points below our plan, and that's put a little pressure on our business, and so that's why I made a comment that it was running a little bit below our expectation. But the main thing that I tried to convey in 3 or 4 of these calls now is both for the full-price business and the off-price business, we look at as the customer looks at it, both digitally and in the stores. And so though as merchants we're aware of the nuances in each channel, the most important thing is how are we doing from a multichannel point of view in off-price, and we're really pleased with our results. And we think there's a lot of positives taking place, whether that's attracting new customers, whether it's the productivity, that return  on that investment, it's still a very strong part of our business, and we're encouraged about the opportunities. We have some opportunities with that plan to manage the inventory a little bit tighter. So overall, the company had good inventory control, and off-price was slightly over, given those plans. So put a little margin pressure on it. But we think that's one of our strengths. We're making those changes, and we hope to demonstrate that for you the balance of this year."

It's good for the customer and by the way, it's good for us. It's more economical for us  to return that way. And also as you can imagine, having a store -- customer in the store is beneficial, and we really don't focus on trying to turn around that return and make a sale immediately with it. What we've learned is, a customer comes in with a return, that's their errand they have to do.

And we think we're in good locations. All of our stores contribute and are profitable. And so when we think about that investment, it's gone from a very democratic approach to all stores kind of being the same to being more strategic and targeted. And so as we think about from a DMA point of view, the top markets are getting more of those funds. And we think that's appropriate and we think balanced with the digital offering.

The other part of that enables, which is the other path we have to go down, is differentiating our online experience, which for us I think the right place is in addition to being a convenient, friction-free transaction is that were to be a richer experience, a place for discovery. As Pete talked about, long been the driver of our business has been newness, and we think we should have the fashion authority, the curated assortment with the customers to be a place where they come for something new and update their wardrobes. We've been investing, as you know, for quite some time, and some of those investments are starting to mature and some are in early stages. But I'd point out around technology data where we're investing, in particular around supply chain, marketing and personalization. And we're starting to see progress in all those areas and Anniversary was part of that. And supply chain, there's a reference that our cost per unit delivering was reduced year-over-year. Just from a customer experience, we delivered package faster at a lower cost this Anniversary and while also reducing the number of orders that canceled due to inventory latency in the system. So there's been good progress there that we think is really important to customers."

To date, I can't think of something materially that have passed on, but we just want to stay in that mode. In terms of foot traffic in the stores, Jamie talked earlier, we don't have traffic counters, we look at transaction. We are seeing a very -- continues to be a very healthy movement of customers between the channels, and in many cases, their first experiences in the Rack and then off-price and online and they migrate into a full-price offering.

In addition to reviewing the third quarter results, I'll share some key initiatives that we're focusing on for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.67. We estimate these earnings will reduce by roughly $0.04 from hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey, which affected our stores in Puerto Rico, Southeast Florida and Houston. The damage in Puerto Rico was particularly extensive, requiring us to close the store as we continue our repair efforts. We're grateful to our teams in each of these communities who have extended ourselves to help our employees and customers.
Reported total sales growth of 2% [ and ] a comp decrease of 0.9%. Lost sales from the hurricane accounted for approximately $20 million or 60 basis points. When adjusting for this impact, our overall sales performance was generally in line with our expectations. This reflected consistent trends at our full-price business while on off-price, we experienced of deterioration relative to recent trends.
In our Nordstrom brand, total sales decreased 1.2% and comps decreased 1.9%. Sales in our full-line stores remain consistent with current trends. As we expected, Nordstrom.com sales reflected a higher volume of returns associated with Anniversary Sales last quarter. When we combine July and August to adjust for this timing impact, Nordstrom.com grew at a mid-teens rate.
In our Nordstrom Rack brand, total sales increased 5.5% and comps increased 0.8%, which reflected a step down from recent trends. In hindsight, our sales plan at the beginning of the year was too aggressive. As a result, we found ourselves over inventoried with the fluidity necessary to chase the business. This impacted our ability to provide newness, which led to softer results in the third quarter. We have made significant adjustments to our receipt plans to bring our inventories in line and believe we're well positioned for the fourth quarter in this regard. We recognize the opportunity to improve our top line results and are committed to providing good inventory flow, fashion-right merchandise and the best value possible.
Our Nordstrom Rack business remains a highly productive model and is approaching $5 billion in sales for the year. Finding new ways to engage with customers on their terms is as important as ever. We're continually testing and learning from new concepts to deliver experiences that improve and speed, convenience and personalization for Nordstrom customers. This is core to our strategy of providing a differentiated selection of the best products coupled with a high level of service and experience.
Our most recent example is Nordstrom Local, a test retail concept that's focused on services. Centrally located in West Hollywood, Nordstrom Local gives customers convenient access to personal stylists, alterations, online orders and more. In the first 4 weeks since opening, we got thousands of customer interactions and are applying the learnings to innovate further. Ultimately, our goal is to drive increased customer engagement and market share.
Another way we're engaging with customers on their terms is our Reserve Online and Try In Store service, which we recently expanded to more than 50 stores across the country. Our customers appreciate its speed and convenience. It frees up their time. And if they choose to do additional shopping in our store, this results in a material lift in their spend. We're also connecting the digital and in-store strands with our style boards. This digital selling tool leverages the expertise of our salespeople and enables customers to receive personalized product recommendations on their mobile phones.
Providing newness is an important aspect of our approach with the customer, and we're encouraged by our recent collaborations with the working brands. Our pop and shops give customers access to highly sought-after brands like Corey Parker and Goop. Our recent partnership with Everlane has been our most successful pop and concept to date. Our partnerships with fashion influencers are another way we're creating inspiration and discovery for customers. We collaborated with the popular fashion blog, Something Navy, to launch an exclusive capsule collection with our in-house treasure and bond brand. It was our largest brand launch ever generating $2 million in demand for the first day. 
We made additional progress in growing limited distribution products, and our private label brands continue to outperform the company average.
We view our stores as a competitive asset and has invested in the markets in which we serve customers. We strengthen our presence in Southern California with the relocation of 2 full-line stores, the Century City and University Towne Center. Both openings well exceeded our plans. 
Also this fall, we had 11 new Rack store openings and 1 relocation in markets that include Los Angeles, Manhattan and Seattle. 
In Canada, we opened the sixth and final of our announced full-line stores with our new store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. We look forward to introducing Nordstrom Rack to our Canadian customers starting next spring in Calgary and Toronto.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we're focused on making Nordstrom a convenient place for customers to do their holiday shopping. We have a number of initiatives in place. We've invested in key categories and brands that resonate most with our customers. This includes expanding our online selection and fulfillment capacity to support the peak volumes that we expect during the holidays. To make shopping faster and easier, we offer in our full-line stores, buy online, pickup in-store with an option for curbside services. 
Also in several markets, we have available Reserve Online and Try In Store and same-day delivery services. Next month, we'll offer 24-hour curbside pickup in major markets including Seattle, Chicago, Dallas and San Diego.
During this holiday period, we believe the strength of our digital capabilities, along with our local market assets, our people, product and place, represent a significant competitive advantage in serving our customers.
I'll now turn it over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our third quarter performance and outlook for the year."

Our third quarter earnings when excluding the hurricane impact were generally in line with our expectations. 
Looking at the drivers of our results. Our retail gross profit rate was down 12 basis points due to planned occupancy costs associated with new Rack stores in the U.S. and upcoming stores in Canada. Merchandise margins continue to be relatively stable, reflecting our ongoing progress in supporting a healthy regular price selling business. For 5 straight quarters, sales growth outpaced inventory growth, and we exited the third quarter in a relatively clean inventory position. For the balance of the year, our inventory plans are aligned with current sales trends.
Moving to SG&A. Our rate was up approximately [ 150 ] basis points, primarily due to technology and supply chain expenses. As we've commented over the past year, we've made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around our technology, supply chain and marketing capabilities. This required fundamental change from the way we operate to improve the customer experience and support long-term profitable growth.
Last year, we made a significant step change to the expense growth in these areas by cutting the recent historical run rate of 20% by half. This year, we are on track to hold this expense rate constant to last year's growth rate.
In supply chain, we continue to see the mixed impact associated with the accelerated growth of online, which is approaching 25% of our sales. We've made operational improvements to reduce split shipments and [ canceled ] orders. This has resulted in a better customer experience while reducing our average cost per unit. Going forward, we see further opportunities to gain efficiencies.
Technology is another critical enabler in delivering customer experiences. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to modernize our platforms and investments are shifting to call-based solutions. This is creating more than immediate expense impact rather than capitalization. To get a more holistic perspective on our technology investments, we continue to be on track with our plan for total cash spend of roughly $540 million or 3.5% of sales.
Turning to credit. EBIT increased $16 million over last year, driven by credit card revenue growth of 25%. We also recently sold our bank charter, eliminating associated regulatory requirements and minimal costs.
We've been encouraged by the continued momentum in our Nordstrom Rewards program. With nearly 10 million active loyalty customers, our loyalty program represents more than half of our sales year-to-date. This growth has been fueled by the expansion of our program in spring 2016, which enabled all of our customers to earn rewards regardless how they choose to pay.
Turning to our financial position. We continue to have a healthy balance sheet and have generated around $600 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Our debt leverage remain consistent with our expectations at 2.5x on adjusted debt-to-EBITDA basis. We reported double-digit return on invested capital of 10.7%. These metrics reflect our overall favorable positioning in the market.
As Blake mentioned, our combined physical and digital presence is a key differentiator in serving customers and gaining market share. Our omni-channel business model also provides for favorable economics related to driving customer spend, reducing the cost of serving customers and elevating the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. We believe we have meaningful opportunities ahead to further leverage our investments and improve our long-term profitability.
Now I'd like to provide some additional color on our updated 2017 outlook. We narrowed our EPS range of $2.85 to $2.95 compared with our prior outlook of $2.85 to [ $3 ]. This incorporates our third quarter results [ and ] the estimated full year hurricane impact of roughly $0.06. In addition, we adjusted our full year tax rate to be in line with the year-to-date rate. 
From a top line perspective, we held our full year outlook for total sales growth of approximately 4% with roughly flat comps. This incorporates our underlying trends while taking into consideration expectations for continued uncertainty in retail. It also includes the 53rd week impact, which is estimated to add $200 million in sales or $0.02 to $0.03 in EPS. Retail gross profit assumes higher occupancy expenses and the mixed impact from off-price growth. Merchandise margins reflect the solid inventory position heading into the fourth quarter.
Our SG&A assumptions remain consistent, reflecting higher technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives. As a result, the deleverage in our SG&A rate for the full year is expected to be relatively similar to what was experienced year-to-date. This is normalized for onetime items such as the [ $20 million ] legal settlement gain in the fourth quarter of last year.
Based on better-than-expected performance, credit EBIT is estimated at $165 million compared with our prior outlook of $145 million.
In closing, we're well positioned to execute on a healthy plans and remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

In addition to reviewing the third quarter results, I'll share some key initiatives that we're focusing on for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.67. We",991,"Good afternoon, and welcome to our call. In addition to reviewing the third quarter results, I'll share some key initiatives that we're focusing on for the remainder of the year. 
For the third quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.67. We estimate these earnings will reduce by roughly $0.04 from hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey, which affected our stores in Puerto Rico, Southeast Florida and Houston. The damage in Puerto Rico was particularly extensive, requiring us to close the store as we continue our repair efforts. We're grateful to our teams in each of these communities who have extended ourselves to help our employees and customers.
We reported total sales growth of 2% and a comp decrease of 0.9%. Lost sales from the hurricanes accounted for approximately $20 million or 60 basis points. When adjusting for this impact, our overall sales performance was generally in line with our expectations. This reflected consistent trends at our full-price business, while on off-price, we experienced some deterioration relative to recent trends.
In our Nordstrom brand, total sales decreased 1.2% and comps decreased 1.9%. Sales in our full-line stores remained consistent with current trends. As we expected, Nordstrom.com sales reflected a higher volume of returns associated with Anniversary Sales last quarter. When we combine July and August to adjust for this timing impact, Nordstrom.com grew at a mid-teens rate.
In our Nordstrom Rack brand, total sales increased 5.5% and comps increased 0.8%, which reflected a step down from recent trends. In hindsight, our sales plan at the beginning of the year was too aggressive. As a result, we found ourselves over-inventoried with the fluidity necessary to chase the business. This impacted our ability to provide newness, which led to softer results in the third quarter. We have made significant adjustments to our receipt plans to bring our inventories in line and believe we're well positioned for the fourth quarter in this regard. We recognize the opportunity to improve our top line results and are committed to providing good inventory flow, fashion-right merchandise and the best value possible.
Our Nordstrom Rack business remains a highly productive model and is approaching $5 billion in sales for the year. Finding new ways to engage with customers on their terms is as important as ever. We're continually testing and learning from new concepts to deliver experiences that improve speed, convenience and personalization for Nordstrom customers. This is core to our strategy of providing a differentiated selection of the best products, coupled with a high level of service and experience.
Our most recent example is Nordstrom Local, a test retail concept that's focused on services. Centrally located in West Hollywood, Nordstrom Local gives customers convenient access to personal stylists, alterations, online orders and more. In the first 4 weeks since opening, we got thousands of customer interactions and are applying the learnings to innovate further. Ultimately, our goal is to drive increased customer engagement and market share.
Another way we're engaging with customers on their terms is our Reserve Online and Try In Store service, which we recently expanded to more than 50 stores across the country. Our customers appreciate its speed and convenience. It frees up their time. And if they choose to do additional shopping in our store, this results in a material lift in their spend. 
We're also connecting the digital and in-store experience with our style boards. This digital-selling tool leverages the expertise of our salespeople and enables customers to receive personalized product recommendations on their mobile phones.
Providing newness is an important aspect of our approach with the customer, and we're encouraged by our recent collaborations with the merging brands. Our Pop-In shops give customers access to highly sought-after brands like Warby Parker and Goop. Our recent partnership with Everlane has been our most successful Pop-In concept to date. Our partnerships with fashion influencers are another way we're creating inspiration and discovery for customers. We collaborated with the popular fashion blog, Something Navy, to launch an exclusive capsule collection with our in-house Treasure & Bond brand. It was our largest brand launch ever, generating $2 million in demand for the first day. 
We made additional progress in growing limited distribution products, and our private label brand continue to outperform the company average.
We view our stores as a competitive asset and has invested in the markets in which we serve customers. We strengthened our presence in Southern California with the relocation of 2 full-line stores, the Century City and University Towne Center. Both openings well exceeded our plans. 
Also this fall, we had 11 new Rack store openings and 1 relocation in markets that include Los Angeles, Manhattan and Seattle. 
In Canada, we opened the sixth and final of our announced full-line stores with our new store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. We look forward to introducing Nordstrom Rack to our Canadian customers starting next spring in Calgary and Toronto.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we're focused on making Nordstrom a convenient place for customers to do their holiday shopping. We have a number of initiatives in place. We've invested in key categories and brands that resonate most with our customers. This includes expanding our online selection and fulfillment capacity to support the peak volumes that we expect during the holidays. To make shopping faster and easier, we offer in our full-line stores, buy online, pickup in-store with an option for curbside services. 
Also, in several markets, we have available Reserve Online and Try In Store and same-day delivery services. Next month, we'll offer 24-hour curbside pickup in major markets, including Seattle, Chicago, Dallas and San Diego.
During this holiday period, we believe the strength of our digital capabilities, along with our local market assets, our people, product and place, represent a significant competitive advantage in serving our customers.
I'll now turn it over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our third quarter performance and outlook for the year."

Our third quarter earnings, when excluding the hurricane impact, were generally in line with our expectations. Looking at the drivers of our results. Our retail gross profit rate was down 12 basis points, due",820,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter earnings, when excluding the hurricane impact, were generally in line with our expectations. 
Looking at the drivers of our results. Our retail gross profit rate was down 12 basis points, due to planned occupancy costs associated with new Rack stores in the U.S. and upcoming stores in Canada. Merchandise margins continue to be relatively stable, reflecting our ongoing progress in supporting a healthy, regular-price selling business. For 5 straight quarters, sales growth outpaced inventory growth, and we exited the third quarter in a relatively clean inventory position. For the balance of the year, our inventory plans are aligned with current sales trends.
Moving to SG&A. Our rate was up approximately 160 basis points, primarily due to technology and supply chain expenses. As we've commented over the past year, we've made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around our technology, supply chain and marketing capabilities. This required fundamental changes in the way we operate to improve the customer experience and support long-term profitable growth.
Last year, we made a significant step change to the expense growth in these areas by cutting the recent historical run rate of 20% by half. This year, we are on track to hold this expense rate constant to last year's growth rate.
In supply chain, we continue to see the mixed impact associated with the accelerated growth of online, which is approaching 25% of our sales. We've made operational improvements to reduce split shipments and cancelled orders. This has resulted in a better customer experience while reducing our average cost per unit. Going forward, we see further opportunities to gain efficiencies.
Technology is another critical enabler in delivering customer experiences. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to modernize our platforms, and investments are shifting to cloud-based solutions. This is creating more of an immediate expense impact rather than capitalization. To get a more holistic perspective on our technology investments, we continue to be on track with our plan for total cash spend of roughly $540 million or 3.5% of sales.
Turning to credit. EBIT increased $16 million over last year, driven by credit card revenue growth of 25%. We also recently sold our bank charter, eliminating associated regulatory requirements and minimal costs.
We've been encouraged by the continued momentum in our Nordstrom Rewards program. With nearly 10 million active loyalty customers, our loyalty program represents more than half of our sales year-to-date. This growth has been fueled by the expansion of our program in spring 2016, which enables all of our customers to earn rewards regardless how they choose to pay.
Turning to our financial position. We continue to have a healthy balance sheet and have generated around $600 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Our debt leverage remain consistent with our expectations at 2.5x on adjusted debt-to-EBITDA basis. We reported double-digit return on invested capital of 10.7%. These metrics reflect our overall favorable positioning in the market.
As Blake mentioned, our combined physical and digital presence is a key differentiator in serving customers and gaining market share. Our omnichannel business model also provides for favorable economics related to driving customer spend, reducing the cost of serving customers and elevating the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. We believe we have meaningful opportunities ahead to further leverage our investments and improve our long-term profitability.
Now I'd like to provide some additional color on our updated 2017 outlook. We narrowed our EPS range of $2.85 to $2.95 compared with our prior outlook of $2.85 to $3. This incorporates our third quarter results and the estimated full year hurricane impact of roughly $0.06. In addition, we adjusted our full year tax rate to be in line with the year-to-date rate. 
From a top line perspective, we've held our full year outlook for total sales growth of approximately 4% with roughly flat comps. This incorporates our underlying trends while taking into consideration expectations for continued uncertainty in retail. It also includes the 53rd-week impact, which is estimated to add $200 million in sales or $0.02 to $0.03 in EPS. Retail gross profit assumes higher occupancy expenses and the mixed impact from off-price growth. Merchandise margins reflect the solid inventory position heading into the fourth quarter.
Our SG&A assumptions remain consistent, reflecting higher technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives. As a result, the deleverage in our SG&A rate for the full year is expected to be relatively similar to what was experienced year-to-date. This is normalized for onetime items such as the $22 million legal settlement gain in the fourth quarter of last year.
Based on better-than-expected performance, credit EBIT is estimated at $165 million compared with our prior outlook of $145 million.
And In closing, we're well positioned to execute on our healthy plans and remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

And so we weren't the market as aggressively as we would like to have been to ensure that we have the right freshness and flow and, again, corresponding values.

And to your question, I think you would expect that traffic is better in the better malls, the more productive malls. And so nothing really is [indiscernible] point to there.

We have a lot of different ways for the customer to engage with us and a lot of different ways of connecting the merchandise the customer wants with how they want to receive it. So be it in a store, be at their home, be at the discovery portion being digital or in a physical environment. So you'll continue to see us offer more options for the customers because we think a part of it is not just getting merchandise to the customer faster, it's giving the customer control of how they want it while also offering as much selection as possible for the time frame that they want to get their merchandise. And then about metrics. Do you want to take that, Anne?"

And so I think that was probably the biggest driver of opportunity, but there's lots of things that we think there are opportunities in our execution. From afar, it's relatively simple business. To execute though at this level of $5 billion and as productive as it is, there's a lot of nuances to it. And so our team is working hard just last year. None of us are satisfied with these results, but there is a sense of optimism and encouragement about the things they've been working on and how that positions us better to be able to respond going forward to the customer. And so we believe we can get back on the fourth quarter hopefully to the first half trend.

So we talked about migrating more to the cloud as we've been progressing, so it's really swapping the same cash dollars, it's just whether it's expense or capital. And what the cloud-based solutions allow us to do is it's easier to scale and it drives better performance overall, both internally and as well for the customer experience. Nordstrom is investing quite heavily in reducing customer friction so we're simplifying our checkout, looking at ways to improve our payment options. So all those things take investments. On the supply chain side, we've really been focusing on reducing the amount of cancellations, which allows for more top line growth and better customer experience and then improving our split shipments, which also improves our cost centers for better customer experience. So those are the types of things that we're looking at. So there's an investment, but there's also a flow through that you will see post implementation. So as we continue to go through -- we've talked about the fact that we've got some general operational investments coming along with Manhattan, so you would expect us to start seeing some leverage on that because we are investing ahead of the curve, and we are continuing to make investments to drive a better customer experience, but also drive productivity and scale in the business."

In addition to reviewing the third quarter results, I'll share some key initiatives that we're focusing on for the remainder of the year.

In addition to reviewing the third quarter results, I'll share some key initiatives that we're focusing on for the remainder of the year. 
For the third quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.67. We estimate these earnings were reduced by roughly $0.04 from hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey, which affected our stores in Puerto Rico, Southeast Florida and Houston. The damage in Puerto Rico was particularly extensive, requiring us to close the store as we continue our repair efforts. We're grateful to our teams in each of these communities who have extended themselves to help our employees and customers.
We reported total sales growth of 2% and a comp decrease of 0.9%. Lost sales from the hurricanes accounted for approximately $20 million or 60 basis points. When adjusting for this impact, our overall sales performance was generally in line with our expectations. This reflected consistent trends at our full-price business, while on off-price, we experienced some deterioration relative to recent trends.
In our Nordstrom brand, total sales decreased 1.2% and comps decreased 1.9%. Sales in our full-line stores remained consistent with current trends. As we expected, Nordstrom.com sales reflected a higher volume of returns associated with Anniversary Sales last quarter. When we combine July and August to adjust for this timing impact, Nordstrom.com grew at a mid-teens rate.
In our Nordstrom Rack brand, total sales increased 5.5% and comps increased 0.8%, which reflected a step down from recent trends. In hindsight, our sales plan at the beginning of the year was too aggressive. As a result, we found ourselves over-inventoried with the fluidity necessary to chase the business. This impacted our ability to provide newness, which led to softer results in the third quarter. We have made significant adjustments to our receipt plans to bring our inventories in line and believe we're well positioned for the fourth quarter in this regard. We recognize the opportunity to improve our top line results and are committed to providing good inventory flow, fashion-right merchandise and the best value possible.
Our Nordstrom Rack business remains a highly productive model and is approaching $5 billion in sales for the year. Finding new ways to engage with customers on their terms is as important as ever. We're continually testing and learning from new concepts to deliver experiences that improve speed, convenience and personalization for Nordstrom customers. This is core to our strategy of providing a differentiated selection of the best products, coupled with a high level of service and experience.
Our most recent example is Nordstrom Local, a test retail concept that's focused on services. Centrally located in West Hollywood, Nordstrom Local gives customers convenient access to personal stylists, alterations, online orders and more. In the first 4 weeks since opening, we got thousands of customer interactions and are applying the learnings to innovate further. Ultimately, our goal is to drive increased customer engagement and market share.
Another way we're engaging with customers on their terms is our Reserve Online and Try In Store service, which we recently expanded to more than 50 stores across the country. Our customers appreciate its speed and convenience. It frees up their time. And if they choose to do additional shopping in our store, this results in a material lift in their spend. 
We're also connecting the digital and in-store experience with our style boards. This digital-selling tool leverages the expertise of our salespeople and enables customers to receive personalized product recommendations on their mobile phones.
Providing newness is an important aspect of our approach with the customer, and we're encouraged by our recent collaborations with emerging brands. Our Pop-In shops give customers access to highly sought-after brands like Warby Parker and Goop. Our recent partnership with Everlane has been our most successful Pop-In concept to date. Our partnerships with fashion influencers are another way we're creating inspiration and discovery for customers. We collaborated with the popular fashion blog, Something Navy, to launch an exclusive capsule collection with our in-house Treasure & Bond brand. It was our largest brand launch ever, generating $2 million in demand for the first day. 
We made additional progress in growing limited distribution products, and our private label brand continue to outperform the company average.
We view our stores as a competitive asset and has invested in the markets in which we serve customers. We strengthened our presence in Southern California with the relocation of 2 full-line stores, the Century City and University Towne Center. Both openings well exceeded our plans. 
Also this fall, we had 11 new Rack store openings and 1 relocation in markets that include Los Angeles, Manhattan and Seattle. 
In Canada, we opened the sixth and final of our announced full-line stores with our new store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. We look forward to introducing Nordstrom Rack to our Canadian customers starting next spring in Calgary and Toronto.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we're focused on making Nordstrom a convenient place for customers to do their holiday shopping. We have a number of initiatives in place. We've invested in key categories and brands that resonate most with our customers. This includes expanding our online selection and fulfillment capacity to support the peak volumes that we expect during the holidays. To make shopping faster and easier, we offer in our full-line stores, buy online, pickup in-store with an option for curbside services. 
Also, in several markets, we have available Reserve Online and Try In Store and same-day delivery services. Next month, we'll offer 24-hour curbside pickup in major markets, including Seattle, Chicago, Dallas and San Diego.
During this holiday period, we believe the strength of our digital capabilities, along with our local market assets, our people, product and place, represent a significant competitive advantage in serving our customers.
I'll now turn it over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our third quarter performance and outlook for the year."

Our third quarter earnings, when excluding the hurricane impact, were generally in line with our expectations. Looking at the drivers of our results. Our retail gross profit rate was down 12 basis points, due",818,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter earnings, when excluding the hurricane impact, were generally in line with our expectations. 
Looking at the drivers of our results. Our retail gross profit rate was down 12 basis points, due to planned occupancy costs associated with new Rack stores in the U.S. and upcoming stores in Canada. Merchandise margins continue to be relatively stable, reflecting our ongoing progress in supporting a healthy, regular-price selling business. For 5 straight quarters, sales growth outpaced inventory growth, and we exited the third quarter in a relatively clean inventory position. For the balance of the year, our inventory plans are aligned with current sales trends.
Moving to SG&A. Our rate was up approximately 160 basis points, primarily due to technology and supply chain expenses. As we've commented over the past year, we've made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around our technology, supply chain and marketing capabilities. This required fundamental changes in the way we operate to improve the customer experience and support long-term profitable growth.
Last year, we made a significant step-change to the expense growth in these areas by cutting the recent historical run-rate of 20% by half. This year, we are on track to hold this expense rate constant to last year's growth rate.
In supply chain, we continue to see the mix impact associated with the accelerated growth of online, which is approaching 25% of our sales. We've made operational improvements to reduce split shipments and cancelled orders. This has resulted in a better customer experience while reducing our average cost per unit. Going forward, we see further opportunities to gain efficiencies.
Technology is another critical enabler in delivering customer experiences. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to modernize our platforms, and investments are shifting to cloud-based solutions. This is creating more of immediate expense impact rather than capitalization. To get a more holistic perspective on our technology investments, we continue to be on track with our plan for total cash spend of roughly $540 million or 3.5% of sales.
Turning to credit. EBIT increased $16 million over last year, driven by credit card revenue growth of 25%. We also recently sold our bank charter, eliminating associated regulatory requirements and minimal costs.
We've been encouraged by the continued momentum in our Nordstrom Rewards program. With nearly 10 million active loyalty customers, our loyalty program represents more than half of our sales year-to-date. This growth has been fueled by the expansion of our program in spring 2016, which enables all of our customers to earn rewards regardless of how they choose to pay.
Turning to our financial position. We continue to have a healthy balance sheet and have generated around $600 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Our debt leverage remain consistent with our expectations at 2.5x on adjusted debt-to-EBITDA basis. We reported double-digit return on invested capital of 10.7%. These metrics reflect our overall favorable positioning in the market.
As Blake mentioned, our combined physical and digital presence is a key differentiator in serving customers and gaining market share. Our omnichannel business model also provides for favorable economics related to driving customer spend, reducing the cost of serving customers and elevating the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. We believe we have meaningful opportunities ahead to further leverage our investments and improve our long-term profitability.
Now I'd like to provide some additional color on our updated 2017 outlook. We narrowed our EPS range of $2.85 to $2.95 compared with our prior outlook of $2.85 to $3. This incorporates our third quarter results and the estimated full year hurricane impact of roughly $0.06. In addition, we adjusted our full year tax rate to be in line with the year-to-date rate. 
From a top line perspective, we've held our full year outlook for total sales growth of approximately 4% with roughly flat comps. This incorporates our underlying trends while taking into consideration expectations for continued uncertainty in retail. It also includes the 53rd-week impact, which is estimated to add $200 million in sales or $0.02 to $0.03 in EPS. Retail gross profit assumes higher occupancy expenses and the mixed impact from off-price growth. Merchandise margins reflect the solid inventory position heading into the fourth quarter.
Our SG&A assumptions remain consistent, reflecting higher technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives. As a result, the deleverage in our SG&A rate for the full year is expected to be relatively similar to what was experienced year-to-date. This is normalized for onetime items such as the $22 million legal settlement gain in the fourth quarter of last year.
Based on better-than-expected performance, credit EBIT is estimated at $165 million compared with our prior outlook of $145 million.
And In closing, we're well positioned to execute on our healthy plans and remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

It's -- it may sound subtle but it's a significant change in doing our business as opposed to looking at our stores as four-wall P&Ls or e-commerce business across the whole country. I was really looking at customers in a given market, what assets do we have that we can leverage to serve them better? And if it goes to things like something that we have placed for a while, like buy online, pick up in store and store reserve, which you heard Jamie say is ramping up, style boards, curbside service. But in particular, if you think about our market, our assets in addition to the digital assets we have which are in all markets, our physical assets of having the stores, the people in the stores and the inventory. We have a lot of inventory that's deployed very close to where the majority of our business is done. And there's supply chain initiatives that are part of that. There's marketing initiatives that are part of that, that we're very excited about that will allow us to do things for customers that really, we don't see anyone else who can do some of these things. And Nordstrom Local's part of that bigger effort. So I would put that at the top of the list for us."

Our trends are actually pretty darn consistent and have been in the mid-double digits all year, and we're very encouraged with our trends there.

So removing those timing issues, our trends at Nordstrom.com are very consistent, and we're encouraged about that. In terms of shipping options, that is a place that we think we can absolutely win with the customer. Again, it's leveraging our assets.

To execute though at this level of $5 billion and as productive as it is, there's a lot of nuances to it. And so our team is working hard just last year. None of us are satisfied with these results, but there is a sense of optimism and encouragement about the things they've been working on and how that positions us better to be able to respond going forward to the customer.

And what the cloud-based solutions allow us to do is it's easier to scale and it drives better performance overall, both internally and as well for the customer experience.We've also been investing quite heavily in reducing customer friction so we're simplifying our checkout, looking at ways to improve our payment options. So all those things take investments. On the supply chain side, we've really been focusing on reducing the amount of cancellations, which allows for more top line growth and better customer experience and then improving our split shipments, which also improves our cost centers for better customer experience. So those are the types of things that we're looking at. So there's an investment, but there's also a flow-through that you will see post implementation.

In addition to reviewing the third quarter results, I'll share some key initiatives that we're focusing on for the remainder of the year. 
For the third quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.67. We estimate these earnings were reduced by roughly $0.04 from hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey, which affected our stores in Puerto Rico, Southeast Florida and Houston. The damage in Puerto Rico was particularly extensive, requiring us to close the store as we continue our repair efforts. We're grateful to our teams in each of these communities who have extended themselves to help our employees and customers.
We reported total sales growth of 2% and a comp decrease of 0.9%. Lost sales from the hurricanes accounted for approximately $20 million or 60 basis points. When adjusting for this impact, our overall sales performance was generally in line with our expectations. This reflected consistent trends at our full-price business, while on off-price, we experienced some deterioration relative to recent trends.
In our Nordstrom brand, total sales decreased 1.2% and comps decreased 1.9%. Sales in our full-line stores remained consistent with current trends. As we expected, Nordstrom.com sales reflected a higher volume of returns associated with Anniversary Sales last quarter. When we combine July and August to adjust for this timing impact, Nordstrom.com grew at a mid-teens rate.
In our Nordstrom Rack brand, total sales increased 5.5% and comps increased 0.8%, which reflected a step down from recent trends. In hindsight, our sales plan at the beginning of the year was too aggressive. As a result, we found ourselves over-inventoried with the fluidity necessary to chase the business. This impacted our ability to provide newness, which led to softer results in the third quarter. We have made significant adjustments to our receipt plans to bring our inventories in line and believe we're well positioned for the fourth quarter in this regard. We recognize the opportunity to improve our top line results and are committed to providing good inventory flow, fashion-right merchandise and the best value possible.
Our Nordstrom Rack business remains a highly productive model and is approaching $5 billion in sales for the year. Finding new ways to engage with customers on their terms is as important as ever. We're continually testing and learning from new concepts to deliver experiences that improve speed, convenience and personalization for Nordstrom customers. This is core to our strategy of providing a differentiated selection of the best products, coupled with a high level of service and experience.
Our most recent example is Nordstrom Local, a test retail concept that's focused on services. Centrally located in West Hollywood, Nordstrom Local gives customers convenient access to personal stylists, alterations, online orders and more. In the first 4 weeks since opening, we got thousands of customer interactions and are applying the learnings to innovate further. Ultimately, our goal is to drive increased customer engagement and market share.
Another way we're engaging with customers on their terms is our Reserve Online and Try In Store service, which we recently expanded to more than 50 stores across the country. Our customers appreciate its speed and convenience. It frees up their time. And if they choose to do additional shopping in our store, this results in a material lift in their spend. 
We're also connecting the digital and in-store experience with our style boards. This digital-selling tool leverages the expertise of our salespeople and enables customers to receive personalized product recommendations on their mobile phones.
Providing newness is an important aspect of our approach with the customer, and we're encouraged by our recent collaborations with emerging brands. Our Pop-In shops give customers access to highly sought-after brands like Warby Parker and Goop. Our recent partnership with Everlane has been our most successful Pop-In concept to date. Our partnerships with fashion influencers are another way we're creating inspiration and discovery for customers. We collaborated with the popular fashion blog, Something Navy, to launch an exclusive capsule collection with our in-house Treasure & Bond brand. It was our largest brand launch ever, generating $2 million in demand for the first day. 
We made additional progress in growing limited distribution products, and our private label brand continue to outperform the company average.
We view our stores as a competitive asset and has invested in the markets in which we serve customers. We strengthened our presence in Southern California with the relocation of 2 full-line stores, the Century City and University Towne Center. Both openings well exceeded our plans. 
Also this fall, we had 11 new Rack store openings and 1 relocation in markets that include Los Angeles, Manhattan and Seattle. 
In Canada, we opened the sixth and final of our announced full-line stores with our new store at Sherway Gardens in Toronto. We look forward to introducing Nordstrom Rack to our Canadian customers starting next spring in Calgary and Toronto.
As we head into the fourth quarter, we're focused on making Nordstrom a convenient place for customers to do their holiday shopping. We have a number of initiatives in place. We've invested in key categories and brands that resonate most with our customers. This includes expanding our online selection and fulfillment capacity to support the peak volumes that we expect during the holidays. To make shopping faster and easier, we offer in our full-line stores, buy online, pickup in-store with an option for curbside services. 
Also, in several markets, we have available Reserve Online and Try In Store and same-day delivery services. Next month, we'll offer 24-hour curbside pickup in major markets, including Seattle, Chicago, Dallas and San Diego.
During this holiday period, we believe the strength of our digital capabilities, along with our local market assets, our people, product and place, represent a significant competitive advantage in serving our customers.
I'll now turn it over to Anne, who will provide additional insights into our third quarter performance and outlook for the year."

Our third quarter earnings, when excluding the hurricane impact, were generally in line with our expectations. Looking at the drivers of our results. Our retail gross profit rate was down 12 basis points, due",819,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter earnings, when excluding the hurricane impact, were generally in line with our expectations. 
Looking at the drivers of our results. Our retail gross profit rate was down 12 basis points, due to planned occupancy costs associated with new Rack stores in the U.S. and upcoming stores in Canada. Merchandise margins continue to be relatively stable, reflecting our ongoing progress in supporting a healthy, regular-price selling business. For 5 straight quarters, sales growth outpaced inventory growth, and we exited the third quarter in a relatively clean inventory position. For the balance of the year, our inventory plans are aligned with current sales trends.
Moving to SG&A. Our rate was up approximately 160 basis points, primarily due to technology and supply chain expenses. As we've commented over the past year, we've made significant progress in improving our productivity, particularly around our technology, supply chain and marketing capabilities. This required fundamental changes in the way we operate to improve the customer experience and support long-term profitable growth.
Last year, we made a significant step-change to the expense growth in these areas by cutting the recent historical run rate of 20% by half. This year, we are on track to hold this expense rate constant to last year's growth rate.
In supply chain, we continue to see the mix impact associated with the accelerated growth of online, which is approaching 25% of our sales. We've made operational improvements to reduce split shipments and cancelled orders. This has resulted in a better customer experience while reducing our average cost per unit. Going forward, we see further opportunities to gain efficiencies.
Technology is another critical enabler in delivering customer experiences. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to modernize our platforms, and investments are shifting to cloud-based solutions. This is creating more of immediate expense impact rather than capitalization. To get a more holistic perspective on our technology investments, we continue to be on track with our plan for total cash spend of roughly $540 million or 3.5% of sales.
Turning to credit. EBIT increased $16 million over last year, driven by credit card revenue growth of 25%. We also recently sold our bank charter, eliminating associated regulatory requirements and minimal costs.
We've been encouraged by the continued momentum in our Nordstrom Rewards program. With nearly 10 million active loyalty customers, our loyalty program represents more than half of our sales year-to-date. This growth has been fueled by the expansion of our program in spring 2016, which enables all of our customers to earn rewards regardless of how they choose to pay.
Turning to our financial position. We continue to have a healthy balance sheet and have generated around $600 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Our debt leverage remain consistent with our expectations at 2.5x on adjusted debt-to-EBITDA basis. We reported double-digit return on invested capital of 10.7%. These metrics reflect our overall favorable positioning in the market.
As Blake mentioned, our combined physical and digital presence is a key differentiator in serving customers and gaining market share. Our omnichannel business model also provides for favorable economics related to driving customer spend, reducing the cost of serving customers and elevating the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. We believe we have meaningful opportunities ahead to further leverage our investments and improve our long-term profitability.
Now I'd like to provide some additional color on our updated 2017 outlook. We narrowed our EPS range of $2.85 to $2.95 compared with our prior outlook of $2.85 to $3. This incorporates our third quarter results and the estimated full year hurricane impact of roughly $0.06. In addition, we adjusted our full year tax rate to be in line with the year-to-date rate. 
From a top line perspective, we've held our full year outlook for total sales growth of approximately 4% with roughly flat comps. This incorporates our underlying trends while taking into consideration expectations for continued uncertainty in retail. It also includes the 53rd-week impact, which is estimated to add $200 million in sales or $0.02 to $0.03 in EPS. Retail gross profit assumes higher occupancy expenses and the mixed impact from off-price growth. Merchandise margins reflect the solid inventory position heading into the fourth quarter.
Our SG&A assumptions remain consistent, reflecting higher technology and supply chain expenses associated with our growth initiatives. As a result, the deleverage in our SG&A rate for the full year is expected to be relatively similar to what was experienced year-to-date. This is normalized for onetime items such as the $22 million legal settlement gain in the fourth quarter of last year.
Based on better-than-expected performance, credit EBIT is estimated at $165 million compared with our prior outlook of $145 million.
And In closing, we're well positioned to execute on our healthy plans and remain focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Trina for Q&A."

Blake mentioned that they do perform a little better in terms of their gross margin. And I think increasingly, we've got to figure out a way to be really good at developing and sourcing our own products as well as partnering with brands that are willing to have a bit of a limited approach to distribution. I think that, that's worked really well for us. But when you look at our brands that falls in that bucket, whether it's our own little brands or the ones that are relatively limited, they are outperforming the other brands. So we definitely think we're on a good path there. I will tell you that we have a lot of common issues with our major suppliers and when you can put 2 heads together to work on that as a partner, it definitely creates good outcomes."

And so I think that was probably the biggest driver of opportunity, but there's lots of things that we think there are opportunities in our execution. From afar, it's relatively simple business. To execute though at this level of $5 billion and as productive as it is, there's a lot of nuances to it. And so our team is working hard just last year. None of us are satisfied with these results, but there is a sense of optimism and encouragement about the things they've been working on and how that positions us better to be able to respond going forward to the customer. And so we believe we can get back on the fourth quarter hopefully to the first half trend. That's what we're focused on, but we need to show improvement, and the last quarter certainly was a reflection of the customers indicating that we have some opportunities."

Could you talk a little bit about what type of IT and supply chain spending is driving at what I think was about 8% growth in SG&A? And is there -- are there any strategies in place to perhaps bring the SG&A dollar growth rate down in future years? Any thoughts would be helpful."

But having said that, let me just give you a couple of examples of what we've been focusing on from an investment perspective. So we talked about migrating more to the cloud as we've been progressing, so it's really swapping the same cash dollars, it's just whether it's expense or capital. And what the cloud-based solutions allow us to do is it's easier to scale and it drives better performance overall, both internally and as well for the customer experience. We've also been investing quite heavily in reducing customer friction so we're simplifying our checkout, looking at ways to improve our payment options. So all those things take investments. On the supply chain side, we've really been focusing on reducing the amount of cancellations, which allows for more top line growth and better customer experience and then improving our split shipments, which also improves our cost centers for better customer experience. So those are the types of things that we're looking at. So there's an investment, but there's also a flow-through that you will see post implementation. So as we continue to go through -- we've talked about the fact that we've got some general operational investments coming along with Manhattan, so you would expect us to start seeing some leverage on that because we are investing ahead of the curve, and we are continuing to make investments to drive a better customer experience, but also drive productivity and scale in the business."
