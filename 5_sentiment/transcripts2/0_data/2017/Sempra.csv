On today's call, I will discuss several topics: our 2016 achievements, an update on the key items our management team is focused on in 2017 and our 2017 earnings guidance and dividend. This morning, we reported full year 2016 earnings of $",1083,"Thanks, Rick. On today's call, I will discuss several topics: our 2016 achievements, an update on the key items our management team is focused on in 2017 and our 2017 earnings guidance and dividend. 
This morning, we reported full year 2016 earnings of $5.46 per share or $5.05 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2016 adjusted earnings include a net $0.11 per share benefit related to several additional items, the adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation and a change in our planned repatriation both partially offset by a revaluation of deferred income taxes related to Peruvian tax reform and the impairment of the North-South Pipeline. This net benefit largely offsets the loss of earnings resulting from the sale of our interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline.
In 2016, we delivered on our financial targets and positioned ourselves for future success by resolving some key issues that I will discuss in a few minutes. We are pleased to announce we are raising our 2017 earnings guidance to a range of $4.85 to $5.25 per share, up from our previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 per share. Jeff will review the key drivers of our increased guidance.
At Sempra, we have a long-standing commitment of growing our dividend. Consistent with this, our board approved a 9% increase in the 2017 dividend to $3.29 per share last week. As you'll recall, we're targeting 8% to 9% annual dividend increases over the next several years. The strength of our projected future cash flows gives us confidence we can grow our dividend at a higher rate than our utility peers. It also reinforces our commitment to maximizing total shareholder value through a combination of dividends and earnings growth.
The next few slides will highlight our key areas of focus in 2017, beginning with our California Utilities on Slide 5. Earlier this month, we reached an important proposed agreement on the cost of capital extension. The agreement sets SDG&E's and SoCalGas's authorized return on equity to 10.2% and 10.05%, respectively, through 2019. In 2018, we will true up long-term debt cost to actual debt cost at both our California Utilities. The debt true-up impacts earnings at the utilities by about $36 million per year, which we had already assumed in our financial plans. 
This proposed agreement is an important step in gaining greater certainty to our planned utility earnings. Since we had already forecasted a debt true-up in 2018, the settlement has no material impact to the assumptions discussed at last year's analyst conference regarding utility capital structure and returns. DPUC approval is required, which is expected in the first half of this year.
Moving to Aliso Canyon. SoCalGas has resolved a number of key issues. We sealed the lake over a year ago. The Department of Public Health conducted indoor and outdoor testing, which facilitated residents returning to their homes last summer. We've entered into 2 settlement agreements with governmental agencies, including the recent settlements with South Coast AQMD. And at the facility, we strengthened the infrastructure and filed for approval to begin injections. Our focus going forward is to resolve the remaining issues as expeditiously and safely as possible, including: resuming injections at the continuing to collect insurance proceeds and resolving remaining legal claims.
Turning to SONGS. The final decision and the arbitration hearing against MHI is expected in the near future. The existing SONGS settlement agreement calls for an even split of the award between ratepayers and shareholders after reimbursement of attorney's fees. 
As a reminder, at the end of last year, the CPUC directed the parties to revisit the 2014 SONGS settlement agreement. By April 28, all parties must come to an agreement where the CPUC will begin further proceedings. 2 all-party meetings have been held. We maintained that the existing settlement agreement is consistent with regulatory precedent and takes into consideration the best interest of the parties.
Please turn to Slide 6 for an update on Cameron. I want to assure you that completing Cameron JV Trains 1 through 3 and putting them into service is a top priority for Sempra and the other owners. The JV continues to monitor the construction activities as well as the quality of the work and provides a weekly progress report to Sempra and our owners. Since owners received the updated working schedule in early November, executive management from Cameron JV has had multiple meetings with Cameron's contractor to discuss and review the schedule and path forward. 
Sempra management has also had discussions with the contractors. Cameron JV continues to engage additional independent resources to provide further insight into the construction process and progress. And the contractor has implemented a number of additional measures, which we think are important. 
The measures include improvement of drainage at the site to help mitigate effects of adverse weather conditions and resequencing the work to minimize risk and improve efficiency, among other things. Cameron's contractor believes the current schedule is achievable and calls for in-service time frames of mid-2018 for Train 1, end of 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. When we provide our 2018 earnings projections at the analyst conference, our results will reflect these estimated dates.
It is important to note the Cameron JV's exposure is safeguarded in 2 important ways: first, the lump sum turnkey contract is generally designed to transfer certain cost overrun and scheduled risk to Cameron's contractor; second, Cameron JV's tariff adjustment mechanism is designed to materially preserve its IRR in connection with cost overruns and schedule changes. Sempra's focus continues to be delivering the overall long-term value of our interest in the Cameron JV to our shareholders while reducing risks.
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address the current political and business environment. I will take a minute to address potential policy implications to Mexico, and later, Jeff will discuss potential tax reform. 
The current administration is focused on addressing the U.S. trade imbalance. The value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico in 2016 was more than twice the value of U.S. energy imports from Mexico, improving the U.S. trade imbalance. IEnova's business supports this by helping build the backbone of Mexico's energy infrastructure. We continue to see great growth potential in Mexico and will highlight some of the opportunities we see at the upcoming analyst conference.
With that, I will hand the call over to Jeff for his first earnings call as CFO. Please turn to Slide 7."

I have a good fortune of starting my new role on a positive note. We've updated our plan and are increasing our 2017 EPS guidance range. Our new 2017 guidance is $4.85 to $5.25 per share.

We've updated our plan and are increasing our 2017 EPS guidance range. Our new 2017 guidance is $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Our new range is up from the previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 provided at last year's analyst conference. 
Next, I'll briefly discuss the key drivers of our updated guidance. First, both SDG&E and IEnova had strong performance in 2016, and we expect the improved performance to continue. Given the strong international growth opportunities, we're no longer planning to repatriate cash from current earnings from Mexico or Peru. Our plan is to indefinitely reinvest the cash locally in capital projects.
Compared to previous guidance, our tax expense is lower because of this change. These benefits were partially offset by higher insurance costs to SDG&E and SoCalGas that are not fully offset by cost savings included in our prior plan.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $379 million or $1.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $383 million or $1.52 per share. Full year 2016 earnings were $1,370,000,000 or $5.46 per share. This compares favorably to 2015 earnings of $1,349,000,000 or $5.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2016 earnings were $5.05 per share.
This year, you'll also see the organizational changes we announced last fall. Our operations are now combined into 2 groups, Sempra Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the appendix.
Next, I'll go through a comparison of 2016 to 2015. This slide highlights our recent results and that they were impacted by several items. Debbie addressed the first 5 items earlier in her remarks. Please note that the change in our plan repatriation resulted in a reversal in 2016 of a $20 million tax charge taken in 2015. 
The other main drivers of the year-over-year comparison are as follows: $9 million of net higher earnings at the California Utilities, offset by $14 million [ph] lower favorable impact from the resolution of prior year's taxes at parent and $25 million lower favorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects at Sempra Mexico and the South American Utilities. 
Next, let's please turn to Slide 10. I'd like to end with a discussion on tax reform. There are a few proposals being circulated, and we've evaluated several scenarios. At a high level, we believe that most likely outcomes would not materially impact our projected earnings. At our California Utilities, which represent almost 80% of our 2016 adjusted earnings, we don't expect any significant impact. It's important to remember there's been a history of flow-through treatment for major tax reform dating back to 1986, and we expect any differences to be recorded in the memo accounts established by our final 2016 GRC. 
Under that decision, you'll recall we're required to track the impact of tax changes with amounts reviewed in the next rate case. There are also opportunities to offset any potential reduced rate base from 100% expensing with additional capital spending. 
When you consider the potential impact to our EPS 5 years from now, we expect there's a potential range of a negative 5% to 6% to a positive 5% to 6%. The low end assumes 20% corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital, immediate nondeductibility of interest and a potential to use some foreign cash to reduce U.S. debt. In contrast, the high end scenario has the same assumptions, except Cameron qualifies for the board of tax exemption and the nondeductibility of interest is confined to new debt only.
We've also looked at additional scenarios, which we believe are more likely and involve some form of mitigation resulting in the range of negative 1% to 3%. To be clear, we find this to be the most likely outcome. It's uncertain if there will be any material change to our current tax laws, but if there are, the impacts to our earnings profile could be materially different than what is shown here. In the interim, we'll be working with key trade associations and independently to ensure that the unique aspects of our industry and our company are fully understood and fairly represented.
Next, please turn to Slide 11 for a few closing remarks from Debbie."

In summary, we were able to meet our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance while positioning ourselves for long-term success. We executed our operational plan and continue to resolve key challenges, including: finalizing the GRC at our California Utilities and most recently, reaching a proposed settlement on the cost of capital extension; closing the PEMEX JV acquisition, winning the Marine Pipeline bid jointly with TransCanada and executing the successful IEnova equity follow-on offerings in Mexico; selling REX and our Southeast utilities to more closely align our assets with our long-term growth strategy; and making significant progress related to Aliso Canyon. 
These are just some of the accomplishments that have established our foundation for future success and give us confidence in our 2017 dividend growth and earnings guidance discussed today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming analyst conference here in San Diego on April 4 and 5 and talking more then about our future.
Finally, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Mark Snell for his extraordinary contributions to the success of Sempra. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the last 15 years, and we wish him well as he moves into the next chapter of his life. 
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you have."

And then we're really interested in some opportunities we see with liquid pipelines and receiving terminals. And so we see that business continuing to move forward. And in discussions that we've had with the officials in Mexico and then with some of the administration that when we look at energy imports, exports, the U.S. exports twice as much in the energy space to Mexico as we receive from Mexico, so it really meets what the focus is, is to correct any trade imbalances. And so we see that opportunity for us to continue to grow in the energy space in Mexico remaining under the administration. And so we're -- going forward, we'll be talking about a lot of opportunities that and his team have on the drawing board right now when we get to our analyst meeting and we're very excited about it."

As Jeff mentioned, when we looked at provisions of tax reform going forward and the impact of bonus depreciation beyond the time that we had envisioned in our plan, because when we gave you our plans, we always looked at the bonus depreciation effect and the plans as far as that have been continued. Now if that continues beyond the time frame, Jeff indicated to you that we thought it would be -- it's about -- 10% more capital or about $100 million at each utility that would need to be spent to offset that. And we feel that, that is very achievable with the kinds of long-term projects that we have like under way. So -- but I'll have Jeff specifically talk on the cash tax impact."

I would just start by saying that when you get back to what the policymakers' priorities are in California, you think about safety and reliability and grid modernization. I mean, these are kind of right in the wheelhouse so we think is important to our customers. So if you go back to the original conversation on bonus depreciation several years ago, I think what you've really seen is the company's spending more capital to meet the policymakers' requirements and no real change in terms of the impact to our rate base. I think to Debbie's point, the bonus depreciation rules which are in place today, where we really reflected in the guidance we laid out last summer. And then on a going-forward basis, if you did move under tax reform to 100% expensing, I think what we've laid out is, to Debbie's point again, it would require us about another $100 million of incremental capital each of our utility to not have any erosion to our rate base. So I think one of the things that we're kind of emboldened by is we spend about -- invest about $2.7 billion [ph] in 2016, which is one of our highest years ever in terms of capital deployment at SoCalGas and SDG&E, and we have lots of opportunity going forward. So I think there's a fair amount of enthusiasm of getting to the Analyst Day and kind of laying out that larger capital plan. And then with respect to cash taxes, currently, we had effective tax rate last year of 21%. We think that probably goes up slightly going into 2017. But currently, we're not in a cash taxpaying situation."

It wasn't Sempra alone overseeing the construction. So we fashioned this in a way that we protected our shareholder interest and keeping the economics of the projects solid regardless of what happened with the timing or the cost of construction. We laid those risks off intentionally. That's not to say that we're not looking at expansion. And when we did that contract, we also looked at the expandability of the facility. And we had terms in the agreement that went through how we would expand to a 5-train facility. We've commented before that one of our partners has not been willing to provide the equity for the expansion, and that we are working to resolve those issues with that partner so that we can expand to a Train 4. That we've had meetings with that partner and the principals of that partner and are in discussions with them to see if we can reach a resolution on that. And then once we get that resolved, we are very interested in continuing forward with Cameron Train 4 because we think it's going to be one of the lowest-cost options in the marketplace and it's a really good option. And so nothing has changed in that. But as we told you before, we've got to resolve this partner issue in order for us to move forward with expansion and we're diligently working on that now."

I think just as you think about it, under a border adjustment, the taxes will apply to when the goods are consumed rather than produced. And the thing that hits us most directly, as you recall, we have 2 facilities that actually we import power in the United States from. The first one is our Mexicali power plant referred to as TdM. That one is held for sale so we expect that will resolve itself by middle of the summer. And then secondly, IEnova has the ESJ windfarm that dispatches into the California grid. We've done some assessment around that in the applicable taxes adjustment did go forward, and we think that's a nonmaterial issue to our company. But what's a little bit interesting is if you think about the Cameron facility, it's probably unlikely, Paul, that it would apply to us. But there have been scenarios, different countries where the export exemption has applied upstream. So thinking about that as a towing facility no different than the power plant, right? Our customers bring gas to the facility and they're ultimately the ultimate exporter from the facility. So just we want to track closely because if you did see a decline in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, if the border adjustment did apply, it would be reduced the tax on Cameron an incremental 20% to 0. So again, to Debbie's point, it's probably speculative at this point. It will really depend on how legislation is written but something that we'll be actively following.."

On today's call, I will discuss several topics: our 2016 achievements, an update on the key items our management team is focused on in 2017 and our 2017 earnings guidance and dividend. 
This morning, we reported full year 2016 earnings of $5.46 per share or $5.05 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2016 adjusted earnings include a net $0.11 per share benefit related to several additional items, the adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation and a change in our planned repatriation both partially offset by a revaluation of deferred income taxes related to Peruvian tax reform and the impairment of the North-South Pipeline. This net benefit largely offsets the loss of earnings resulting from the sale of our interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline.
In 2016, we delivered on our financial targets and positioned ourselves for future success by resolving some key issues that I will discuss in a few minutes. We are pleased to announce we are raising our 2017 earnings guidance to a range of $4.85 to $5.25 per share, up from our previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 per share. Jeff will review the key drivers of our increased guidance.
At Sempra, we have a long-standing commitment of growing our dividend. Consistent with this, our board approved a 9% increase in the 2017 dividend to $3.29 per share last week. As you'll recall, we're targeting 8% to 9% annual dividend increases over the next several years. The strength of our projected future cash flows gives us confidence we can grow our dividend at a higher rate than our utility peers. It also reinforces our commitment to maximizing total shareholder value through a combination of dividend and earnings growth.
The next few slides will highlight our key areas of focus in 2017, beginning with our California Utilities on Slide 5. Earlier this month, we reached an important proposed agreement on the cost of capital extension. The agreement sets SDG&E's and SoCalGas's authorized return on equity to 10.2% and 10.05%, respectively, through 2019. In 2018, we will true up long-term debt cost to actual debt cost at both our California Utilities. The debt true-up impacts earnings at the utilities by about $36 million per year, which we had already assumed in our financial plans. 
This proposed agreement is an important step in gaining greater certainty to our planned utility earnings. Since we had already forecasted a debt true-up in 2018, the settlement has no material impact to the assumptions discussed at last year's analyst conference regarding utility capital structure and returns. DPUC approval is required, which is expected in the first half of this year.
Moving to Aliso Canyon. SoCalGas has resolved a number of key issues. We sealed the leak over a year ago. The Department of Public Health conducted indoor and outdoor testing, which facilitated residents returning to their homes last summer. We've entered into 2 settlement agreements with governmental agencies, including the recent settlement with South Coast AQMD. And at the facility, we strengthened the infrastructure and filed for approval to begin injections. Our focus going forward is to resolve the remaining issues as expeditiously and safely as possible, including: resuming injections at the field, continuing to collect insurance proceeds and resolving remaining legal claims.
Turning to SONGS. The final decision and the arbitration hearing against MHI is expected in the near future. The existing SONGS settlement agreement calls for an even split of the award between ratepayers and shareholders after reimbursement of attorney's fees. 
As a reminder, at the end of last year, the CPUC directed the parties to revisit the 2014 SONGS settlement agreement. By April 28, all parties must come to an agreement where the CPUC will begin further proceedings. 2 all-party meetings have been held. We maintained that the existing settlement agreement is consistent with regulatory precedent and takes into consideration the best interest of the parties.
Please turn to Slide 6 for an update on Cameron. I want to assure you that completing Cameron JV Trains 1 through 3 and putting them into service is a top priority for Sempra and the other owners. The JV continues to monitor the construction activities as well as the quality of the work and provides a weekly progress report to Sempra and other owners. Since owners received the updated working schedule in early November, executive management from Cameron JV has had multiple meetings with Cameron's contractor to discuss and review the schedule and path forward. 
Sempra management has also had discussions with the contractors. Cameron JV continues to engage additional independent resources to provide further insight into the construction process and progress. And the contractor has implemented a number of additional measures, which we think are important. 
The measures include improvement of drainage at the site to help mitigate effects of adverse weather conditions and resequencing the work to minimize risk and improve efficiency, among other things. Cameron's contractor believes the current schedule is achievable and calls for in-service time frames of mid-2018 for Train 1, end of 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. When we provide our 2018 earnings projections at the analyst conference, our results will reflect these estimated dates.
It is important to note the Cameron JV's exposure is safeguarded in 2 important ways: first, the lump sum turnkey contract is generally designed to transfer certain cost overrun and schedule risk to Cameron's contractor; second, Cameron JV's tariff adjustment mechanism is designed to materially preserve its IRR in connection with cost overruns and schedule changes. Sempra's focus continues to be delivering the overall long-term value of our interest in the Cameron JV to our shareholders while reducing risks.
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address the current political and business environment. I will take a minute to address potential policy implications to Mexico, and later, Jeff will discuss potential tax reform. 
The current administration is focused on addressing the U.S. trade imbalance. The value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico in 2016 was more than twice the value of U.S. energy imports from Mexico, improving the U.S. trade imbalance. IEnova's business supports this by helping build the backbone of Mexico's energy infrastructure. We continue to see great growth potential in Mexico and will highlight some of the opportunities we see at the upcoming analyst conference.
With that, I will hand the call over to Jeff for his first earnings call as CFO. Please turn to Slide 7."

I have a good fortune of starting my new role on a positive note. We've updated our plan and are increasing our 2017 EPS guidance range. Our new 2017 guidance is $4.85 to $5.25 per share.

We've updated our plan and are increasing our 2017 EPS guidance range. Our new 2017 guidance is $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Our new range is up from the previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 provided at last year's analyst conference. 
Next, I'll briefly discuss the key drivers of our updated guidance. First, both SDG&E and IEnova had strong performance in 2016, and we expect the improved performance to continue. Given the strong international growth opportunities, we're no longer planning to repatriate cash from current earnings from Mexico or Peru. Our plan is to indefinitely reinvest the cash locally in capital projects.
Compared to previous guidance, our tax expense is lower because of this change. These benefits were partially offset by higher insurance costs to SDG&E and SoCalGas that are not fully offset by cost savings included in our prior plan.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $379 million or $1.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $383 million or $1.52 per share. Full year 2016 earnings were $1,370,000,000 or $5.46 per share. This compares favorably to 2015 earnings of $1,349,000,000 or $5.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2016 earnings were $5.05 per share.
This year, you'll also see the organizational changes we announced last fall. Our operations are now combined into 2 groups, Sempra Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the appendix.
Next, I'll go through a comparison of 2016 to 2015. This slide highlights our recent results and that they were impacted by several items. Debbie addressed the first 5 items earlier in her remarks. Please note that the change in our plan repatriation resulted in a reversal in 2016 of a $20 million tax charge taken in 2015. 
The other main drivers of the year-over-year comparison are as follows: $9 million of net higher earnings at the California Utilities, offset by $14 million lower favorable impact from the resolution of prior year's taxes at parent and $25 million lower favorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects at Sempra Mexico and the South American Utilities. 
Next, let's please turn to Slide 10. I'd like to end with a discussion on tax reform. There are a few proposals being circulated, and we've evaluated several scenarios. At a high level, we believe that most likely outcomes would not materially impact our projected earnings. At our California Utilities, which represent almost 80% of our 2016 adjusted earnings, we don't expect any significant impact. It's important to remember there's been a history of flow-through treatment for major tax reform dating back to 1986, and we expect any differences to be recorded in the memo accounts established by our final 2016 GRC. 
Under that decision, you'll recall we're required to track the impacts of tax changes with amounts reviewed in the next rate case. There are also opportunities to offset any potential reduced rate base from 100% expensing with additional capital spending. 
When you consider the potential impact to our EPS 5 years from now, we expect there's a potential range of a negative 5% to 6% to a positive 5% to 6%. The low end assumes 20% corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital, immediate nondeductibility of interest and a potential to use some foreign cash to reduce U.S. debt. In contrast, the high-end scenario has the same assumptions, except Cameron qualifies for the board of tax exemption and the nondeductibility of interest is confined to new debt only.
We've also looked at additional scenarios, which we believe are more likely and involve some form of mitigation resulting in the range of negative 1% to 3%. To be clear, we find this to be the most likely outcome. It's uncertain if there will be any material change to our current tax laws, but if there are, the impacts to our earnings profile could be materially different than what is shown here. In the interim, we'll be working with key trade associations and independently to ensure that the unique aspects of our industry and our company are fully understood and fairly represented.
Next, please turn to Slide 11 for a few closing remarks from Debbie."

In summary, we were able to meet our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance while positioning ourselves for long-term success. We executed our operational plan and continue to resolve key challenges, including: finalizing the GRC at our California Utilities and most recently, reaching a proposed settlement on the cost of capital extension; closing the PEMEX JV acquisition, winning the Marine Pipeline bid jointly with TransCanada and executing the successful IEnova equity follow-on offerings in Mexico; selling REX and our Southeast utilities to more closely align our assets with our long-term growth strategy; and making significant progress related to Aliso Canyon. 
These are just some of the accomplishments that have established our foundation for future success and give us confidence in our 2017 dividend growth and earnings guidance discussed today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming analyst conference here in San Diego on April 4 and 5 and talking more then about our future.
Finally, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Mark Snell for his extraordinary contributions to the success of Sempra. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the last 15 years, and we wish him well as he moves into the next chapter of his life.

I mean, these are kind of right in the wheelhouse so we think is important to our customers. So if you go back to the original conversation on bonus depreciation several years ago, I think what you've really seen is the company's spending more capital to meet the policymakers' requirements and no real change in terms of the impact to our rate base. And I think to Debbie's point, the bonus depreciation rules which are in place today, where we really reflected in the guidance we laid out last summer. And then on a going-forward basis, if you did move under tax reform to 100% expensing, I think what we've laid out is, to Debbie's point again, it would require us about another $100 million of incremental capital each of our utility to not have any erosion to our rate base. So I think one of the things that we're kind of emboldened by is we spend about -- invest about $2.7 billion [ph] in 2016, which is one of our highest years ever in terms of capital deployment at SoCalGas and SDG&E, and we have lots of opportunity going forward. So I think there's a fair amount of enthusiasm of getting to the Analyst Day and kind of laying out that larger capital plan. And then with respect to cash taxes, currently, we had effective tax rate last year of 21%. We think that probably goes up slightly going into 2017. But currently, we're not in a cash taxpaying situation."

It wasn't Sempra alone overseeing the construction. So we fashioned this in a way that we protected our shareholder interest and keeping the economics of the projects solid regardless of what happened with the timing or the cost of construction. We laid those risks off intentionally. That's not to say that we're not looking at expansion. And when we did that contract, we also looked at the expandability of the facility. And we had terms in the agreement that went through how we would expand to a 5-train facility. We've commented before that one of our partners has not been willing to provide the equity for the expansion, and that we are working to resolve those issues with that partner so that we can expand to a Train 4. That we've had meetings with that partner and the principals of that partner and are in discussions with them to see if we can reach a resolution on that. And then once we get that resolved, we are very interested in continuing forward with Cameron Train 4 because we think it's going to be one of the lowest-cost options in the marketplace and it's a really good option. And so nothing has changed in that. But as we told you before, we've got to resolve this partner issue in order for us to move forward with expansion, and we're diligently working on that now."

I think just as you think about it, under a border adjustment, the taxes will apply to where the goods are consumed rather than produced. And the thing that hits us most directly, as you recall, we have 2 facilities that actually we import power in the United States from. The first one is our Mexicali power plant referred to as TdM. That one is held for sale so we expect that will resolve itself by middle of the summer. And then secondly, IEnova has the ESJ wind farm that dispatches into the California grid. We've done some assessment around that and the applicable taxes if were adjustment did go forward, and we think that's a nonmaterial issue to our company. But what's a little bit interesting is if you think about the Cameron facility, it's probably unlikely, Paul, that it would apply to us. But there have been scenarios, in different VAT countries where the export exemption has applied upstream. So thinking about that as a tolling facility no different than a power plant, right? Our customers bring gas to the facility and they're ultimately the ultimate exporter from the facility. It's just something we want to track closely because if you did see a decline in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, if the border adjustment did apply, it would be reducing the tax on Cameron an incremental 20% to 0. So again, to Debbie's point, it's probably speculative at this point. It will really depend on how legislation is written but it's something that we'll be actively following."

On today's call, I will discuss several topics: our 2016 achievements, an update on the key items our management team is focused on in 2017 and our 2017 earnings guidance and dividend. 
This morning, we reported full year 2016 earnings of $5.46 per share or $5.05 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2016 adjusted earnings include a net $0.11 per share benefit related to several additional items, the adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation and a change in our planned repatriation both partially offset by a revaluation of deferred income taxes related to Peruvian tax reform and the impairment of the North-South Pipeline. This net benefit largely offsets the loss of earnings resulting from the sale of our interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline.
In 2016, we delivered on our financial targets and positioned ourselves for future success by resolving some key issues that I will discuss in a few minutes. We are pleased to announce we are raising our 2017 earnings guidance to a range of $4.85 to $5.25 per share, up from our previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 per share. Jeff will review the key drivers of our increased guidance.
At Sempra, we have a long-standing commitment of growing our dividend. Consistent with this, our board approved a 9% increase in the 2017 dividend to $3.29 per share last week. As you'll recall, we're targeting 8% to 9% annual dividend increases over the next several years. The strength of our projected future cash flows gives us confidence we can grow our dividend at a higher rate than our utility peers. It also reinforces our commitment to maximizing total shareholder value through a combination of dividend and earnings growth.
The next few slides will highlight our key areas of focus in 2017, beginning with our California Utilities on Slide 5. Earlier this month, we reached an important proposed agreement on the cost of capital extension. The agreement sets SDG&E's and SoCalGas's authorized return on equity to 10.2% and 10.05%, respectively, through 2019. In 2018, we will true up long-term debt cost to actual debt cost at both our California Utilities. The debt true-up impacts earnings at the utilities by about $36 million per year, which we had already assumed in our financial plans. 
This proposed agreement is an important step in gaining greater certainty to our planned utility earnings. Since we had already forecasted a debt true-up in 2018, the settlement has no material impact to the assumptions discussed at last year's analyst conference regarding utility capital structure and returns. DPUC approval is required, which is expected in the first half of this year.
Moving to Aliso Canyon. SoCalGas has resolved a number of key issues. We sealed the leak over a year ago. The Department of Public Health conducted indoor and outdoor testing, which facilitated residents returning to their homes last summer. We've entered into 2 settlement agreements with governmental agencies, including the recent settlement with South Coast AQMD. And at the facility, we strengthened the infrastructure and filed for approval to begin injections. Our focus going forward is to resolve the remaining issues as expeditiously and safely as possible, including: resuming injections at the field, continuing to collect insurance proceeds and resolving remaining legal claims.
Turning to SONGS. The final decision and the arbitration hearing against MHI is expected in the near future. The existing SONGS settlement agreement calls for an even split of the award between ratepayers and shareholders after reimbursement of attorney's fees. 
As a reminder, at the end of last year, the CPUC directed the parties to revisit the 2014 SONGS settlement agreement. By April 28, all parties must come to an agreement where the CPUC will begin further proceedings. 2 all-party meetings have been held. We maintained that the existing settlement agreement is consistent with regulatory precedent and takes into consideration the best interest of the parties.
Please turn to Slide 6 for an update on Cameron. I want to assure you that completing Cameron JV Trains 1 through 3 and putting them into service is a top priority for Sempra and the other owners. The JV continues to monitor the construction activities as well as the quality of the work and provides a weekly progress report to Sempra and other owners. Since owners received the updated working schedule in early November, executive management from Cameron JV has had multiple meetings with Cameron's contractor to discuss and review the schedule and path forward. 
Sempra management has also had discussions with the contractors. Cameron JV continues to engage additional independent resources to provide further insight into the construction process and progress. And the contractor has implemented a number of additional measures, which we think are important. 
The measures include improvement of drainage at the site to help mitigate effects of adverse weather conditions and resequencing the work to minimize risk and improve efficiency, among other things. Cameron's contractor believes the current schedule is achievable and calls for in-service time frames of mid-2018 for Train 1, end of 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. When we provide our 2018 earnings projections at the analyst conference, our results will reflect these estimated dates.
It is important to note the Cameron JV's exposure is safeguarded in 2 important ways: first, the lump sum turnkey contract is generally designed to transfer certain cost overrun and schedule risk to Cameron's contractor; second, Cameron JV's tariff adjustment mechanism is designed to materially preserve its IRR in connection with cost overruns and schedule changes. Sempra's focus continues to be delivering the overall long-term value of our interest in the Cameron JV to our shareholders while reducing risk.
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address the current political and business environment. I will take a minute to address potential policy implications to Mexico, and later, Jeff will discuss potential tax reform. 
The current administration is focused on addressing the U.S. trade imbalance. The value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico in 2016 was more than twice the value of U.S. energy imports from Mexico, improving the U.S. trade imbalance. IEnova's business supports this by helping build the backbone of Mexico's energy infrastructure. We continue to see great growth potential in Mexico and will highlight some of the opportunities we see at the upcoming analyst conference.
With that, I will hand the call over to Jeff for his first earnings call as CFO. Please turn to Slide 7."

Given the strong international growth opportunities, we're no longer planning to repatriate cash from current earnings from Mexico or Peru. Our plan is to indefinitely reinvest the cash locally in capital projects.
Compared to previous guidance, our tax expense is lower because of this change. These benefits were partially offset by higher insurance costs to SDG&E and SoCalGas that are not fully offset by cost savings included in our prior plan.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $379 million or $1.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $383 million or $1.52 per share. Full year 2016 earnings were $1,370,000,000 or $5.46 per share. This compares favorably to 2015 earnings of $1,349,000,000 or $5.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2016 earnings were $5.05 per share.
This year, you'll also see the organizational changes we announced last fall. Our operations are now combined into 2 groups, Sempra Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the appendix.
Next, I'll go through a comparison of 2016 to 2015. This slide highlights our recent results and that they were impacted by several items. Debbie addressed the first 5 items earlier in her remarks. Please note that the change in our plan repatriation resulted in a reversal in 2016 of a $20 million tax charge taken in 2015. 
The other main drivers of the year-over-year comparison are as follows: $9 million of net higher earnings at the California Utilities, offset by $14 million lower favorable impact from the resolution of prior year's taxes at parent and $25 million lower favorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects at Sempra Mexico and the South American Utilities. 
Next, let's please turn to Slide 10. I'd like to end with a discussion on tax reform. There are a few proposals being circulated, and we've evaluated several scenarios. At a high level, we believe that most likely outcomes would not materially impact our projected earnings. At our California Utilities, which represent almost 80% of our 2016 adjusted earnings, we don't expect any significant impact. It's important to remember there's been a history of flow-through treatment for major tax reform dating back to 1986, and we expect any differences to be recorded in the memo accounts established by our final 2016 GRC. 
Under that decision, you'll recall we're required to track the impacts of tax changes with amounts reviewed in the next rate case. There are also opportunities to offset any potential reduced rate base from 100% expensing with additional capital spending. 
When you consider the potential impact to our EPS 5 years from now, we expect there's a potential range of a negative 5% to 6% to a positive 5% to 6%. The low end assumes 20% corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital, immediate nondeductibility of interest and a potential to use some foreign cash to reduce U.S. debt. In contrast, the high-end scenario has the same assumptions, except Cameron qualifies for the board of tax exemption and the nondeductibility of interest is confined to new debt only.
We've also looked at additional scenarios, which we believe are more likely and involve some form of mitigation resulting in the range of negative 1% to 3%. To be clear, we find this to be the most likely outcome. It's uncertain if there will be any material change to our current tax laws, but if there are, the impacts to our earnings profile could be materially different than what is shown here. In the interim, we'll be working with key trade associations and independently to ensure that the unique aspects of our industry and our company are fully understood and fairly represented.
Next, please turn to Slide 11 for a few closing remarks from Debbie."

In summary, we were able to meet our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance while positioning ourselves for long-term success. We executed our operational plan and continue to resolve key challenges, including: finalizing the GRC at our California Utilities and most recently, reaching a proposed settlement on the cost of capital extension; closing the PEMEX JV acquisition, winning the Marine Pipeline bid jointly with TransCanada and executing the successful IEnova equity follow-on offerings in Mexico; selling REX and our Southeast utilities to more closely align our assets with our long-term growth strategy; and making significant progress related to Aliso Canyon. 
These are just some of the accomplishments that have established our foundation for future success and give us confidence in our 2017 dividend growth and earnings guidance discussed today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming analyst conference here in San Diego on April 4 and 5 and talking more then about our future.
Finally, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Mark Snell for his extraordinary contributions to the success of Sempra. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the last 15 years, and we wish him well as he moves into the next chapter of his life. 
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you have."

I would just start by saying that when you go back to what the policymakers' priorities are in California, you think about safety and reliability and grid modernization. I mean, these are kind of right in the wheelhouse of what we think is important to our customers. So if you go back to the original conversation on bonus depreciation several years ago, I think what you've really seen is the company's spending more capital to meet the policymakers' requirements and no real change in terms of the impact to our rate base. And I think to Debbie's point, the bonus depreciation rules which are in place today were we really reflected in the guidance we laid out last summer. And then on a going-forward basis, if you did move under tax reform to 100% expensing, I think what we've laid out is, to Debbie's point again, it would require us about another $100 million of incremental capital each of our utility to not have any erosion to our rate base. So I think one of the things that we're kind of emboldened by is we spend about -- invest about $2.7 billion in 2016, which is one of our highest years ever in terms of capital deployment at SoCalGas and SDG&E, and we have lots of opportunity going forward. So I think there's a fair amount of enthusiasm of getting to the Analyst Day and kind of laying out that larger capital plan. And then with respect to cash taxes, currently we had effective tax rate last year of 21%. We think that probably goes up slightly going into 2017.

It wasn't Sempra alone overseeing the construction. So we fashioned this in a way that we protected our shareholder interest and keeping the economics of the projects solid regardless of what happened with the timing or the cost of construction. We laid those risks off intentionally. That's not to say that we're not looking at expansion. And when we did that contract, we also looked at the expandability of the facility. And we had terms in the agreement that went through how we would expand to a 5-train facility. We've commented before that one of our partners has not been willing to provide the equity for the expansion, and that we are working to resolve those issues with that partner so that we can expand to a Train 4. That we've had meetings with that partner and the principals of that partner and are in discussions with them to see if we can reach a resolution on that. And then once we get that resolved, we are very interested in continuing forward with Cameron Train 4 because we think it's going to be one of the lowest-cost options in the marketplace and it's a really good option. And so nothing has changed in that. But as we told you before, we've got to resolve this partner issue in order for us to move forward with expansion, and we're diligently working on that now."

I think just as you think about it, under a border adjustment, the taxes will apply to where the goods are consumed rather than produced. And the thing that hits us most directly, as you recall, we have 2 facilities that actually we import power in the United States from. The first one is our Mexicali power plant referred to as TdM. That one is held for sale so we expect that will resolve itself by middle of the summer. And then secondly, IEnova has the ESJ wind farm that dispatches into the California grid. We've done some assessment around that and the applicable taxes if were adjustment did go forward, and we think that's a nonmaterial issue to our company. But what's a little bit interesting is if you think about the Cameron facility, it's probably unlikely, Paul, that it would apply to us. But there have been scenarios in different VAT countries where the export exemption has applied upstream. So thinking about that as a tolling facility no different than a power plant, right? Our customers bring gas to the facility and they're ultimately the ultimate exporter from the facility. It's just something we want to track closely because if you did see a decline in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, if the border adjustment did apply, it would be reducing the tax on Cameron an incremental 20% to 0. So again, to Debbie's point, it's probably speculative at this point. It will really depend on how legislation is written, but it's something that we'll be actively following."

On today's call, I will discuss several topics: our 2016 achievements, an update on the key items our management team is focused on in 2017 and our 2017 earnings guidance and dividend. 
This morning, we reported full year 2016 earnings of $5.46 per share or $5.05 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2016 adjusted earnings include a net $0.11 per share benefit related to several additional items, the adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation and a change in our planned repatriation both partially offset by a revaluation of deferred income taxes related to Peruvian tax reform and the impairment of the North-South Pipeline. This net benefit largely offsets the loss of earnings resulting from the sale of our interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline.
In 2016, we delivered on our financial targets and positioned ourselves for future success by resolving some key issues that I will discuss in a few minutes. We are pleased to announce we are raising our 2017 earnings guidance to a range of $4.85 to $5.25 per share, up from our previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 per share. Jeff will review the key drivers of our increased guidance.
At Sempra, we have a long-standing commitment of growing our dividend. Consistent with this, our board approved a 9% increase in the 2017 dividend to $3.29 per share last week. As you'll recall, we're targeting 8% to 9% annual dividend increases over the next several years. The strength of our projected future cash flows gives us confidence we can grow our dividend at a higher rate than our utility peers. It also reinforces our commitment to maximizing total shareholder value through a combination of dividend and earnings growth.
The next few slides will highlight our key areas of focus in 2017, beginning with our California Utilities on Slide 5. Earlier this month, we reached an important proposed agreement on the cost of capital extension. The agreement sets SDG&E's and SoCalGas's authorized return on equity to 10.2% and 10.05%, respectively, through 2019. In 2018, we will true up long-term debt cost to actual debt cost at both our California Utilities. The debt true-up impacts earnings at the utilities by about $36 million per year, which we had already assumed in our financial plans. 
This proposed agreement is an important step in gaining greater certainty to our planned utility earnings. Since we had already forecasted a debt true-up in 2018, the settlement has no material impact to the assumptions discussed at last year's analyst conference regarding utility capital structure and returns. DPUC approval is required, which is expected in the first half of this year.
Moving to Aliso Canyon. SoCalGas has resolved a number of key issues. We sealed the leak over a year ago. The Department of Public Health conducted indoor and outdoor testing, which facilitated residents returning to their homes last summer. We've entered into 2 settlement agreements with governmental agencies, including the recent settlement with South Coast AQMD. And at the facility, we strengthened the infrastructure and filed for approval to begin injections. Our focus going forward is to resolve the remaining issues as expeditiously and safely as possible, including: resuming injections at the field, continuing to collect insurance proceeds and resolving remaining legal claims.
Turning to SONGS. The final decision and the arbitration hearing against MHI is expected in the near future. The existing SONGS settlement agreement calls for an even split of the award between ratepayers and shareholders after reimbursement of attorney's fees. 
As a reminder, at the end of last year, the CPUC directed the parties to revisit the 2014 SONGS settlement agreement. By April 28, all parties must come to an agreement where the CPUC will begin further proceedings. 2 all-party meetings have been held. We maintained that the existing settlement agreement is consistent with regulatory precedent and takes into consideration the best interest of the parties.
Please turn to Slide 6 for an update on Cameron. I want to assure you that completing Cameron JV Trains 1 through 3 and putting them into service is a top priority for Sempra and the other owners. The JV continues to monitor the construction activities as well as the quality of the work and provides a weekly progress report to Sempra and other owners. Since owners received the updated working schedule in early November, executive management from Cameron JV has had multiple meetings with Cameron's contractor to discuss and review the schedule and path forward. 
Sempra management has also had discussions with the contractors. Cameron JV continues to engage additional independent resources to provide further insight into the construction process and progress. And the contractor has implemented a number of additional measures, which we think are important. 
The measures include improvement of drainage at the site to help mitigate effects of adverse weather conditions and resequencing the work to minimize risk and improve efficiency, among other things. Cameron's contractor believes the current schedule is achievable and calls for in-service time frames of mid-2018 for Train 1, end of 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. When we provide our 2018 earnings projections at the analyst conference, our results will reflect these estimated dates.
It is important to note the Cameron JV's exposure is safeguarded in 2 important ways: first, the lump sum turnkey contract is generally designed to transfer certain cost overrun and schedule risk to Cameron's contractor; second, Cameron JV's tariff adjustment mechanism is designed to materially preserve its IRR in connection with cost overruns and schedule changes. Sempra's focus continues to be delivering the overall long-term value of our interest in the Cameron JV to our shareholders while reducing risk.
Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address the current political and business environment. I will take a minute to address potential policy implications to Mexico, and later, Jeff will discuss potential tax reform. 
The current administration is focused on addressing the U.S. trade imbalance. The value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico in 2016 was more than twice the value of U.S. energy imports from Mexico, improving the U.S. trade imbalance. IEnova's business supports this by helping build the backbone of Mexico's energy infrastructure. We continue to see great growth potential in Mexico and will highlight some of the opportunities we see at the upcoming analyst conference.
With that, I will hand the call over to Jeff for his first earnings call as CFO. Please turn to Slide 7."

I have a good fortune of starting my new role on a positive note. We've updated our plan and are increasing our 2017 EPS guidance range. Our new 2017 guidance is $4.85 to $5.25 per share.

We've updated our plan and are increasing our 2017 EPS guidance range. Our new 2017 guidance is $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Our new range is up from the previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 provided at last year's analyst conference. 
Next, I'll briefly discuss the key drivers of our updated guidance. First, both SDG&E and IEnova had strong performance in 2016, and we expect the improved performance to continue. Given the strong international growth opportunities, we're no longer planning to repatriate cash from current earnings from Mexico or Peru. Our plan is to indefinitely reinvest the cash locally in capital projects.
Compared to previous guidance, our tax expense is lower because of this change. These benefits were partially offset by higher insurance costs to SDG&E and SoCalGas that are not fully offset by cost savings included in our prior plan.
Let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $379 million or $1.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $383 million or $1.52 per share. Full year 2016 earnings were $1,370,000,000 or $5.46 per share. This compares favorably to 2015 earnings of $1,349,000,000 or $5.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2016 earnings were $5.05 per share.
This year, you'll also see the organizational changes we announced last fall. Our operations are now combined into 2 groups, Sempra Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the appendix.
Next, I'll go through a comparison of 2016 to 2015. This slide highlights our recent results and that they were impacted by several items. Debbie addressed the first 5 items earlier in her remarks. Please note that the change in our plan repatriation resulted in a reversal in 2016 of a $20 million tax charge taken in 2015. 
The other main drivers of the year-over-year comparison are as follows: $9 million of net higher earnings at the California Utilities, offset by $14 million lower favorable impact from the resolution of prior year's taxes at parent and $25 million lower favorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects at Sempra Mexico and the South American Utilities. 
Next, let's please turn to Slide 10. I'd like to end with a discussion on tax reform. There are a few proposals being circulated, and we've evaluated several scenarios. At a high level, we believe that most likely outcomes would not materially impact our projected earnings. At our California Utilities, which represent almost 80% of our 2016 adjusted earnings, we don't expect any significant impact. It's important to remember there's been a history of flow-through treatment for major tax reform dating back to 1986, and we expect any differences to be recorded in the memo accounts established by our final 2016 GRC. 
Under that decision, you'll recall we're required to track the impacts of tax changes with amounts reviewed in the next rate case. There are also opportunities to offset any potential reduced rate base from 100% expensing with additional capital spending. 
When you consider the potential impact to our EPS 5 years from now, we expect there's a potential range of a negative 5% to 6% to a positive 5% to 6%. The low end assumes 20% corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital, immediate nondeductibility of interest and a potential to use some foreign cash to reduce U.S. debt. In contrast, the high-end scenario has the same assumptions, except Cameron qualifies for the board of tax exemption and the nondeductibility of interest is confined to new debt only.
We've also looked at additional scenarios, which we believe are more likely and involve some form of mitigation resulting in the range of negative 1% to 3%. To be clear, we find this to be the most likely outcome. It's uncertain if there will be any material change to our current tax laws, but if there are, the impacts to our earnings profile could be materially different than what is shown here. In the interim, we'll be working with key trade associations and independently to ensure that the unique aspects of our industry and our company are fully understood and fairly represented.
Next, please turn to Slide 11 for a few closing remarks from Debbie."

In summary, we were able to meet our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance while positioning ourselves for long-term success. We executed our operational plan and continue to resolve key challenges, including: finalizing the GRC at our California Utilities and most recently, reaching a proposed settlement on the cost of capital extension; closing the PEMEX JV acquisition, winning the Marine Pipeline bid jointly with TransCanada and executing the successful IEnova equity follow-on offerings in Mexico; selling REX and our Southeast utilities to more closely align our assets with our long-term growth strategy; and making significant progress related to Aliso Canyon. 
These are just some of the accomplishments that have established our foundation for future success and give us confidence in our 2017 dividend growth and earnings guidance discussed today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming analyst conference here in San Diego on April 4 and 5 and talking more then about our future.
Finally, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Mark Snell for his extraordinary contributions to the success of Sempra. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the last 15 years, and we wish him well as he moves into the next chapter of his life. 
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you have."

It's hard to characterize and pin anything on one particular item because there are so many. But we had a good meeting with them yesterday and spoke about a number of issues.

And in discussions that we've had with the officials in Mexico and then with some of the administration -- that when we look at energy imports, exports, the U.S. exports twice as much in the energy space to Mexico as we receive from Mexico, so it really meets what the focus is, is to correct any trade imbalances.

As Jeff mentioned, when we looked at the provisions of tax reform going forward and the impact of bonus depreciation beyond the time that we had envisioned in our plan, because when we gave you our plans, we always looked at the bonus depreciation effect and the plans as far as that have been continued. Now if that continues beyond the time frame, Jeff indicated to you that we thought it would be -- it's about -- 10% more capital or about $100 million at each utility that would need to be spent to offset that. And we feel that, that is very achievable with the kinds of long-term projects that we have like PSEP under way. So -- but I'll have Jeff specifically talk on the cash tax impact."

I would just start by saying that when you go back to what the policymakers' priorities are in California, you think about safety and reliability and grid modernization. I mean, these are kind of right in the wheelhouse of what we think is important to our customers. So if you go back to the original conversation on bonus depreciation several years ago, I think what you've really seen is the company's spending more capital to meet the policymakers' requirements and no real change in terms of the impact to our rate base. And I think to Debbie's point, the bonus depreciation rules which are in place today were we really reflected in the guidance we laid out last summer. And then on a going-forward basis, if you did move under tax reform to 100% expensing, I think what we've laid out is, to Debbie's point again, it would require us about another $100 million of incremental capital each of our utility to not have any erosion to our rate base. So I think one of the things that we're kind of emboldened by is we spend about -- invest about $2.7 billion in 2016, which is one of our highest years ever in terms of capital deployment at SoCalGas and SDG&E, and we have lots of opportunity going forward. So I think there's a fair amount of enthusiasm of getting to the Analyst Day and kind of laying out that larger capital plan. And then with respect to cash taxes, currently we had effective tax rate last year of 21%. We think that probably goes up slightly going into 2017. But currently we're not in a cash taxpaying situation."

It wasn't Sempra alone overseeing the construction. So we fashioned this in a way that we protected our shareholder interest and keeping the economics of the projects solid regardless of what happened with the timing or the cost of construction. We laid those risks off intentionally. That's not to say that we're not looking at expansion. And when we did that contract, we also looked at the expandability of the facility. And we had terms in the agreement that went through how we would expand to a 5-train facility. We've commented before that one of our partners has not been willing to provide the equity for the expansion, and that we are working to resolve those issues with that partner so that we can expand to a Train 4. That we've had meetings with that partner and the principals of that partner and are in discussions with them to see if we can reach a resolution on that. And then once we get that resolved, we are very interested in continuing forward with Cameron Train 4 because we think it's going to be one of the lowest-cost options in the marketplace and it's a really good option. And so nothing has changed in that. But as we told you before, we've got to resolve this partner issue in order for us to move forward with expansion, and we're diligently working on that now."

I think just as you think about it, under a border adjustment, the taxes will apply to where the goods are consumed rather than produced. And the thing that hits us most directly, as you recall, we have 2 facilities that actually we import power in the United States from. The first one is our Mexicali power plant referred to as TdM. That one is held for sale so we expect that will resolve itself by middle of the summer. And then secondly, IEnova has the ESJ wind farm that dispatches into the California grid. We've done some assessment around that and the applicable taxes if were adjustment did go forward, and we think that's a nonmaterial issue to our company. But what's a little bit interesting is if you think about the Cameron facility, it's probably unlikely, Paul, that it would apply to us. But there have been scenarios in different VAT countries where the export exemption has applied upstream. So thinking about that as a tolling facility no different than a power plant, right? Our customers bring gas to the facility and they're ultimately the ultimate exporter from the facility. It's just something we want to track closely because if you did see a decline in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, if the border adjustment did apply, it would be reducing the tax on Cameron an incremental 20% to 0. So again, to Debbie's point, it's probably speculative at this point. It will really depend on how legislation is written, but it's something that we'll be actively following."

I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, not whoever that other company was that the operator put on. Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the web",263,"Thanks for joining us this morning. I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, not whoever that other company was that the operator put on. 
Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the webcast for our analyst conference a few weeks ago. I appreciate the useful feedback we received. For those of you who are unable to attend, you can find all of the conference materials on our website. 
I'd like to start off by reiterating Sempra's long-term value drivers. First, we expect to grow our EPS 10% to 11% from 2017 through 2021 by successfully executing on projects already under contract and our infrastructure businesses and our expected utility performance. 
Second, we plan to grow our dividend from 2017 by 8% to 9% annually, then reassess it for additional increases after Cameron's 3 trains come online. And third, our increased cash flow should provide $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in additional debt capacity in 2021. This offers us the flexibility to further enhance long-term shareholder value. And fourth, we expect to capture opportunities over the next 5 years to add to or extend our earnings growth. 
Before I turn it over to Jeff, please turn to Slide 5. One of the ways we measure our success is delivering on our EPS guidance. Jeff will review a few of our recent operational successes and our first quarter results, which keep us on track to meet our 2017 earnings guidance of $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Jeff?"

First, regarding the cost of capital, we remain constructive on this settlement and believe it's in the best interest of all parties.

First, regarding the cost of capital, we remain constructive on this settlement and believe it's in the best interest of all parties. We continue to expect that the settlement or something is substantially similar will be approved. 
Second, we're focused on executing the capital plan that we laid out at our conference by advancing major projects, in particular Cameron Trains 1 through 3 and the Marine Pipeline. We've also made near-term progress on several other projects. At SDG&E, we signed 5 new contracts for battery storage facilities totaling 83.5 megawatts, [ 70 ] of which will be directly owned by SDG&E. 
SDG&E also placed one of the largest lithium ion battery systems in the world into service in the first quarter. Many of you had the opportunity to visit SDG&E during the conference to hear about this and how it supports California's electrification efforts as well as furthering the state's policy goal by reducing carbon emissions.
IEnova expects to complete 3 natural gas pipelines by the end of the second quarter. This also represents the combined investment of close to $900 million. Each project, you'll recall, is backed by 25-year U.S. dollar-denominated contract with CSC. 
Third, we're also looking at new investment opportunities. Let me list a few examples. IEnova recently agreed to construct a solar facility with a 20-year PPA for 110 megawatts with an industrial scale company. This is the first bilateral agreement in Mexico under the new market for renewables where the offtaker is a private company. We anticipate there'll be more opportunities like this. 
The Pima solar facility is expected to cost roughly [ $115 million  ] and be operational by the end of 2018. This project is also a great example of how we at Sempra leverage our experience across different growth platforms. The success we've demonstrated in U.S. renewable business allows us to compete more effectively for projects just like this in Mexico.
We also made CPUC filings for additional projects, representing the potential for almost $500 million of new capital. To be clear, these projects were not included in the capital plan we outlined at the analyst conference. These projects include: an expansion of SoCalGas's Master Meter program for mobile home parks and SDG&E's proposal to replace its customer information system.
Now please turn to the next slide. Our first quarter financial results was the strongest first quarter performance Sempra has experienced since it was formed. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. This compares favorably to first quarter 2016 earnings of $353 million or $1.40 per share. 
On an adjusted basis, we recorded earnings of $438 million or $1.74 per share. Again, this compares to fourth quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $404 million or $1.60 per share. You'll also recall that we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation in the third quarter of last year. This was applied retroactively to the first quarter of 2016 and accordingly increased earnings by $34 million in that period.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss the key factors impacting our results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by strong operating results, including $18 million of higher operating earnings from SDG&E and South America, $21 million of higher earnings at our California Utilities. This is largely as a result of the delay of the 2016 GRC file decision. These earnings were recorded in the second quarter of 2016, plus $29 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico related to the GdC and Ventika acquisitions and higher AFUDC earnings. 
[indiscernible] improvement in earnings this year were $14 million of higher tax benefit and lower interest cost at parent. These items were partially offset by $34 million of tax benefit from 2016 compared to $3 million of tax expense in 2017 associated with share-based compensation, and at Sempra Mexico, $25 million of lower earnings from foreign currency and inflation effects primarily from current quarter losses.
If you will, I'd like to spend a moment on foreign currency. You'll recall that our current hedging strategy limits our FX-related exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico. While we expect some intra-quarter volatility from time to time, our hedging strategy over the full year is designed to reduce or eliminate expenses related to this exposure. 
You'll also recall that there are other FX exposures that impact earnings but not cash flow. These occur in Mexico and South America and we do not hedge these additional costs. These exposures have historically largely offset over a full year when the currencies move in a similar way. You'll find additional details on the FX in the appendix. 
And with that, we'll conclude with our prepared comments and stop to take any additional questions you might have."

And we think to answer the Mexico question first, there's some wonderful opportunities in terms of renewables there. A lot of bids will be going out for additional renewable resources to meet the standards that have been set by Mexico. And then what's significant about the Pima project is this is one of the very first projects to be assigned with an industrial customer. And we think that, that's a really interesting market to have some opportunities to directly sign up with some of the commercial industrial customers to provide them renewable resources. Also in Mexico, we're still expecting bids coming out on the electric transmission side. And as we told you at the conference, we think there's some great opportunities to continue our efforts in the liquids side of the business and don't have anything specific to announce in that area, but we see a lot of interest in finding a partner like IEnova to build the infrastructure on the liquids side of the business. And as you know, we already have an ethane pipeline and a terminal. And so we've been in that business and we think it has some great opportunities for us. On the Peruvian pipeline, I will ask Steve Davis to add any color to that. But what I will tell you is that it looks like that, that project will go out for bid, and that it's likely to go out for bid later this year or the beginning of next year. And our focus has been on ensuring that the bid terms will allow for a truly competitive bid process with participants that are concerned about not taking on any Foreign Corrupt Practice Act responsibilities. And as you know, we backed away from that when we felt that we could not get the kind of a clean deal that we felt that we could execute on. And so we have had some meetings with government officials, encouraging them to create a bit that ensures that the project is going to be financeable and that there will be adequate opportunities to bid in the way that the bid is structured.

I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, not whoever that other company was that the operator put on. Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the web",263,"Thanks for joining us this morning. I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, not whoever that other company was that the operator put on. 
Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the webcast for our analyst conference a few weeks ago. I appreciate the useful feedback we received. For those of you who are unable to attend, you can find all of the conference materials on our website. 
I'd like to start off by reiterating Sempra's long-term value drivers. First, we expect to grow our EPS 10% to 11% from 2017 through 2021 by successfully executing on projects already under contract and our infrastructure businesses and our expected utility performance. 
Second, we plan to grow our dividend from 2017 by 8% to 9% annually, then reassess it for additional increases after Cameron's 3 trains come online. And third, our increased cash flow should provide $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in additional debt capacity in 2021. This offers us the flexibility to further enhance long-term shareholder value. And fourth, we expect to capture opportunities over the next 5 years to add to or extend our earnings growth. 
Before I turn it over to Jeff, please turn to Slide 5. One of the ways we measure our success is delivering on our EPS guidance. Jeff will review a few of our recent operational successes and our first quarter results, which keep us on track to meet our 2017 earnings guidance of $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Jeff?"

First, regarding the cost of capital, we remain constructive on this settlement and believe it's in the best interest of all parties, and we continue to expect that the settlement or something is substantially similar to what will be approved. 
Second, we're focused on executing the capital plan that we laid out at our conference by advancing major projects, in particular, Cameron Trains 1 through 3 and the Marine Pipeline. We've also made near-term progress on several other projects. At SDG&E, we signed 5 new contracts for battery storage facilities totaling 83.5 megawatts, 70 of which will be directly owned by SDG&E. 
SDG&E also placed one of the largest lithium ion battery systems in the world into service in the first quarter. Many of you had the opportunity to visit SDG&E during the conference to hear about this and how it supports California's electrification efforts as well as furthering the state's policy goal by reducing carbon emissions.
IEnova expects to complete 3 natural gas pipelines by the end of the second quarter. This also represents the combined investment of close to $900 million. Each project, you'll recall, is backed by 25-year U.S. dollar-denominated contract with CSC. 
Third, we're also looking at new investment opportunities. Let me list a few examples: IEnova recently agreed to construct a solar facility with a 20-year PPA for 110 megawatts with an industrial steel company. This is the first bilateral agreement in Mexico under the new market for renewables where the off-taker is a private company. We anticipate there'll be more opportunities like this. 
The Pima solar facility is expected to cost roughly $115 million and be operational by the end of 2018. This project is also a great example of how we, at Sempra, leverage our experience across different growth platforms. The success we've demonstrated in U.S. renewable business allows us to compete more effectively for projects just like this in Mexico.
We also made CPUC filings for additional projects, representing the potential for almost $500 million of new capital. To be clear, these projects were not included in the capital plan we outlined at the analyst conference. These projects include: an expansion of SoCalGas's Master Meter program for mobile home parks and SDG&E's proposal to replace its customer information system.
Now please turn to the next slide. Our first quarter financial results was the strongest first quarter performance Sempra has experienced since it was formed. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. This compares favorably to first quarter 2016 earnings of $353 million or $1.40 per share. 
On an adjusted basis, we recorded earnings of $438 million or $1.74 per share. Again, this compares to fourth quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $404 million or $1.60 per share. You'll also recall that we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation in the third quarter of last year. This was applied retroactively to the first quarter of 2016 and accordingly increased earnings by $34 million in that period.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss the key factors impacting our results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by strong operating results, including $18 million of higher operating earnings from SDG&E and South America, $21 million of higher earnings at our California Utilities. This is largely as a result of the delay of the 2016 GRC file decision. These earnings were recorded in the second quarter of 2016, plus $29 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico related to the GdC and Ventika acquisitions and higher AFUDC earnings. 
Also an improvement in earnings this year were $14 million of higher tax benefit and lower interest cost at parent. These items were partially offset by $34 million of tax benefit from 2016 compared to $3 million of tax expense in 2017 associated with share-based compensation, and at Sempra Mexico, $25 million of lower earnings from foreign currency and inflation effects primarily from current quarter losses.
If you will, I'd like to spend a moment on foreign currency. You'll recall that our current hedging strategy limits our FX-related exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico. While we expect some intra-quarter volatility from time to time, our hedging strategy over the full year is designed to reduce or eliminate expenses related to this exposure. 
You'll also recall that there are other FX exposures that impact earnings but not cash flow. These occur in Mexico and South America, and we do not hedge these additional costs. These exposures have historically largely offset over a full year when the currencies move in a similar way. You'll find additional details on the FX in the appendix. 
And with that, we'll conclude with our prepared comments and stop to take any additional questions that you might have."

And we think the answer to the Mexico question first, there's some wonderful opportunities in terms of renewables there. A lot of bids will be going out for additional renewable resources to meet the standards that have been set by Mexico. And then what's significant about the Pima project is this is one of the very first projects to be assigned with an industrial customer. And we think that, that's a really interesting market to have some opportunities to directly sign up with some of the commercial industrial customers to provide them renewable resources. Also in Mexico, we're still expecting bids coming out on the electric transmission side. And as we told you at the conference, we think there's some great opportunities to continue our efforts in the liquids side of the business. And don't have anything specific to announce in that area, but we see a lot of interest in finding a partner like IEnova to build the infrastructure on the liquids side of the business. And as you know, we already have an ethane pipeline and a terminal. And so we've been in that business and we think it has some great opportunities for us. On the Peruvian pipeline, I will ask Steve Davis to add any color to that. But what I will tell you is that it looks like that, that project will go out for bid, and that it's likely to go out for bid later this year or the beginning of next year. And our focus has been on ensuring that the bid terms will allow for a truly competitive bid process with participants that are concerned about not taking on any Foreign Corrupt Practice Act responsibilities. And as you know, we backed away from that when we felt that we could not get the kind of a clean deal that we felt that we could execute on. And so we have had some meetings with the government officials, encouraging them to create a bit that ensures that the project is going to be financeable and that there will be adequate opportunities to bid in the way that the bid is structured.

And I think that what's going on in Australia, it just shows that not necessarily getting these things done means that always that, that's going to be available or available for a longer period of time. So I'm not sure it's going to have an immediate effect but it starts to show that the end users are seriously starting to contemplate the need to go FID pretty soon, if not this year, next year or in the next year, so that they can make sure that they meet the needs that they have and don't get in trouble if something like that were to become more serious.

I actually think that what's happening in Australia and in some of these other locations, where the supply store starts to get more constrained, makes it way better for the U.S. in terms of marketing our projects.

I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, not whoever that other company was that the operator put on. 
Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the webcast for our analyst conference a few weeks ago. I appreciate the useful feedback we received. For those of you who are unable to attend, you can find all of the conference materials on our website. 
I'd like to start off by reiterating Sempra's long-term value drivers. First, we expect to grow our EPS 10% to 11% from 2017 through 2021 by successfully executing on projects already under contract and our infrastructure businesses and our expected utility performance. 
Second, we plan to grow our dividend from 2017 by 8% to 9% annually, then reassess it for additional increases after Cameron's 3 trains come online. And third, our increased cash flow should provide $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in additional debt capacity in 2021. This offers us the flexibility to further enhance long-term shareholder value. And fourth, we expect to capture opportunities over the next 5 years to add to or extend our earnings growth. 
Before I turn it over to Jeff, please turn to Slide 5. One of the ways we measure our success is delivering on our EPS guidance. Jeff will review a few of our recent operational successes and our first quarter results, which keep us on track to meet our 2017 earnings guidance of $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Jeff?"
120622,428684485,1196869,"Sempra Energy, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 09, 2017",2017-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks a lot, Debbie.

First, regarding the cost of capital, we remain constructive on this settlement and believe it's in the best interest of all parties, and we continue to expect that the settlement or something is substantially similar to what will be approved. 
Second, we're focused on executing the capital plan that we laid out at our conference by advancing major projects, in particular, Cameron Trains 1 through 3 and the Marine Pipeline. We've also made near-term progress on several other projects. At SDG&E, we signed 5 new contracts for battery storage facilities totaling 83.5 megawatts, 70 of which will be directly owned by SDG&E. 
SDG&E also placed one of the largest lithium ion battery systems in the world into service in the first quarter. Many of you had the opportunity to visit SDG&E during the conference to hear about this and how it supports California's electrification efforts as well as furthering the state's policy goal by reducing carbon emissions.
IEnova expects to complete 3 natural gas pipelines by the end of the second quarter. This also represents the combined investment of close to $900 million. Each project, you'll recall, is backed by 25-year U.S. dollar-denominated contract with [ CSC ]. 
Third, we're also looking at new investment opportunities. Let me list a few examples: IEnova recently agreed to construct a solar facility with a 20-year PPA for 110 megawatts with an industrial steel company. This is the first bilateral agreement in Mexico under the new market for renewables where the off-taker is a private company. We anticipate there'll be more opportunities like this. 
The Pima solar facility is expected to cost roughly $115 million and be operational by the end of 2018. This project is also a great example of how we, at Sempra, leverage our experience across different growth platforms. The success we've demonstrated in U.S. renewable business allows us to compete more effectively for projects just like this in Mexico.
We also made CPUC filings for additional projects, representing the potential for almost $500 million of new capital. To be clear, these projects were not included in the capital plan we outlined at the analyst conference. These projects include: an expansion of SoCalGas's Master Meter program for mobile home parks and SDG&E's proposal to replace its customer information system.
Now please turn to the next slide. Our first quarter financial results was the strongest first quarter performance Sempra has experienced since it was formed. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. This compares favorably to first quarter 2016 earnings of $353 million or $1.40 per share. 
On an adjusted basis, we recorded earnings of $438 million or $1.74 per share. Again, this compares to fourth quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $404 million or $1.60 per share. You'll also recall that we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation in the third quarter of last year. This was applied retroactively to the first quarter of 2016 and accordingly increased earnings by $34 million in that period.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss the key factors impacting our results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by strong operating results, including $18 million of higher operating earnings from SDG&E and South America, $21 million of higher earnings at our California Utilities. This is largely as a result of the delay of the 2016 GRC [ file ] decision. These earnings were recorded in the second quarter of 2016, plus $29 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico related to the GdC and Ventika acquisitions and higher AFUDC earnings. 
Also an improvement in earnings this year were $14 million of higher tax benefit and lower interest cost at parent. These items were partially offset by $34 million of tax benefit from 2016 compared to $3 million of tax expense in 2017 associated with share-based compensation, and at Sempra Mexico, $25 million of lower earnings from foreign currency and inflation effects primarily from current quarter losses.
If you will, I'd like to spend a moment on foreign currency. You'll recall that our current hedging strategy limits our FX-related exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico. While we expect some intra-quarter volatility from time to time, our hedging strategy over the full year is designed to reduce or eliminate expenses related to this exposure. 
You'll also recall that there are other FX exposures that impact earnings but not cash flow. These occur in Mexico and South America, and we do not hedge these additional costs. These exposures have historically largely offset over a full year when the currencies move in a similar way. You'll find additional details on the FX in the appendix. 
And with that, we'll conclude with our prepared comments and stop to take any additional questions that you might have."

And we think the answer to the Mexico question first, there's some wonderful opportunities in terms of renewables there. A lot of bids will be going out for additional renewable resources to meet the standards that have been set by Mexico. And then what's significant about the Pima project is this is one of the very first projects to be assigned with an industrial customer. And we think that, that's a really interesting market to have some opportunities to directly sign up with some of the commercial industrial customers to provide them renewable resources. Also in Mexico, we're still expecting bids coming out on the electric transmission side. And as we told you at the conference, we think there's some great opportunities to continue our efforts in the liquids side of the business. And don't have anything specific to announce in that area, but we see a lot of interest in finding a partner like IEnova to build the infrastructure on the liquids side of the business. And as you know, we already have an ethane pipeline and a terminal. And so we've been in that business and we think it has some great opportunities for us. On the Peruvian pipeline, I will ask Steve Davis to add any color to that. But what I will tell you is that it looks like that, that project will go out for bid, and that it's likely to go out for bid later this year or the beginning of next year. And our focus has been on ensuring that the bid terms will allow for a truly competitive bid process with participants that are concerned about not taking on any Foreign Corrupt Practice Act responsibilities. And as you know, we backed away from that when we felt that we could not get the kind of a clean deal that we felt that we could execute on. And so we have had some meetings with the government officials, encouraging them to create a bit that ensures that the project is going to be financeable and that there will be adequate opportunities to bid in the way that the bid is structured.

And I know you talked with Phil from CBI, but also note that in the earnings call yesterday, one of Phil's colleagues, Patrick Mullen, used the comment when asked about Cameron LNG and the startup. And I'll quote, ""We expect the phase startup of these 3 trains starting in the latter half of next year."" That may have just been kind of bundling of Train 1 and Train 2 with one supposed to be midyear and one supposed to be at the end of the year. Or you could interpret that as, ""Hey, everything's moving a little bit more again."" Would love your thoughts, if any."

And I think that what's going on in Australia, it just shows that not necessarily getting these things done means that always that, that's going to be available or available for a longer period of time. So I'm not sure it's going to have an immediate effect but it starts to show that the end users are seriously starting to contemplate the need to go FID pretty soon, if not this year, next year or in the next year, so that they can make sure that they meet the needs that they have and don't get in trouble if something like that were to become more serious. And so I think that having Woodside along with us has been very good for the project and for us. And so we look forward to trying to get these things signed up."

And in the U.S. market, you don't have one dedicated supply source for the gas. And you also have the ability to sell off the gas at liquid points in the U.S. if you don't want to take the gas. I actually think that what's happening in Australia and in some of these other locations, where the supply store starts to get more constrained, makes it way better for the U.S. in terms of marketing our projects. And so that's the opportunity that we see right now. And I think Woodside sees a similar view. They've been very excited about our Port Arthur project from the beginning.

I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, not whoever that other company was that the operator put on. Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the web",263,"Thanks for joining us this morning. I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, not whoever that other company was that the operator put on. 
Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the webcast for our analyst conference a few weeks ago. I appreciate the useful feedback we received. For those of you who are unable to attend, you can find all of the conference materials on our website. 
I'd like to start off by reiterating Sempra's long-term value drivers. First, we expect to grow our EPS 10% to 11% from 2017 through 2021 by successfully executing on projects already under contract and our infrastructure businesses and our expected utility performance. 
Second, we plan to grow our dividend from 2017 by 8% to 9% annually, then reassess it for additional increases after Cameron's 3 trains come online. And third, our increased cash flow should provide $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in additional debt capacity in 2021. This offers us the flexibility to further enhance long-term shareholder value. And fourth, we expect to capture opportunities over the next 5 years to add to or extend our earnings growth. 
Before I turn it over to Jeff, please turn to Slide 5. One of the ways we measure our success is delivering on our EPS guidance. Jeff will review a few of our recent operational successes and our first quarter results, which keep us on track to meet our 2017 earnings guidance of $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Jeff?"

First, regarding the cost of capital, we remain constructive on this settlement and believe it's in the best interest of all parties, and we continue to expect that the settlement or something is substantially similar to what will be approved. 
Second, we're focused on executing the capital plan that we laid out at our conference by advancing major projects, in particular, Cameron Trains 1 through 3 and the Marine Pipeline. We've also made near-term progress on several other projects. At SDG&E, we signed 5 new contracts for battery storage facilities totaling 83.5 megawatts, 70 of which will be directly owned by SDG&E. 
SDG&E also placed one of the largest lithium ion battery systems in the world into service in the first quarter. Many of you had the opportunity to visit SDG&E during the conference to hear about this and how it supports California's electrification efforts as well as furthering the state's policy goal by reducing carbon emissions.
IEnova expects to complete 3 natural gas pipelines by the end of the second quarter. This also represents the combined investment of close to $900 million. Each project, you'll recall, is backed by 25-year U.S. dollar-denominated contract with [ CSC ]. 
Third, we're also looking at new investment opportunities. Let me list a few examples: IEnova recently agreed to construct a solar facility with a 20-year PPA for 110 megawatts with an industrial steel company. This is the first bilateral agreement in Mexico under the new market for renewables where the off-taker is a private company. We anticipate there'll be more opportunities like this. 
The Pima solar facility is expected to cost roughly $115 million and be operational by the end of 2018. This project is also a great example of how we, at Sempra, leverage our experience across different growth platforms. The success we've demonstrated in U.S. renewable business allows us to compete more effectively for projects just like this in Mexico.
We also made CPUC filings for additional projects, representing the potential for almost $500 million of new capital. To be clear, these projects were not included in the capital plan we outlined at the analyst conference. These projects include: an expansion of SoCalGas's Master Meter program for mobile home parks and SDG&E's proposal to replace its customer information system.
Now please turn to the next slide. Our first quarter financial results was the strongest first quarter performance Sempra has experienced since it was formed. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. This compares favorably to first quarter 2016 earnings of $353 million or $1.40 per share. 
On an adjusted basis, we recorded earnings of $438 million or $1.74 per share. Again, this compares to fourth quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $404 million or $1.60 per share. You'll also recall that we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation in the third quarter of last year. This was applied retroactively to the first quarter of 2016 and accordingly increased earnings by $34 million in that period.
Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss the key factors impacting our results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by strong operating results, including $18 million of higher operating earnings from SDG&E and South America, $21 million of higher earnings at our California Utilities. This is largely as a result of the delay of the 2016 GRC [ file ] decision. These earnings were recorded in the second quarter of 2016, plus $29 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico related to the GdC and Ventika acquisitions and higher AFUDC earnings. 
Also an improvement in earnings this year were $14 million of higher tax benefit and lower interest cost at parent. These items were partially offset by $34 million of tax benefit from 2016 compared to $3 million of tax expense in 2017 associated with share-based compensation, and at Sempra Mexico, $25 million of lower earnings from foreign currency and inflation effects primarily from current quarter losses.
If you will, I'd like to spend a moment on foreign currency. You'll recall that our current hedging strategy limits our FX-related exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico. While we expect some intra-quarter volatility from time to time, our hedging strategy over the full year is designed to reduce or eliminate expenses related to this exposure. 
You'll also recall that there are other FX exposures that impact earnings but not cash flow. These occur in Mexico and South America, and we do not hedge these additional costs. These exposures have historically largely offset over a full year when the currencies move in a similar way. You'll find additional details on the FX in the appendix. 
And with that, we'll conclude with our prepared comments and stop to take any additional questions that you might have."

And we think the answer to the Mexico question first, there's some wonderful opportunities in terms of renewables there.

And then what's significant about the Pima project is this is one of the very first projects to be assigned with an industrial customer. And we think that, that's a really interesting market to have some opportunities to directly sign up with some of the commercial industrial customers to provide them renewable resources. Also in Mexico, we're still expecting bids coming out on the electric transmission side. And as we told you at the conference, we think there's some great opportunities to continue our efforts in the liquids side of the business. And don't have anything specific to announce in that area, but we see a lot of interest in finding a partner like IEnova to build the infrastructure on the liquids side of the business. And as you know, we already have an ethane pipeline and a terminal. And so we've been in that business and we think it has some great opportunities for us. On the Peruvian pipeline, I will ask Steve Davis to add any color to that. But what I will tell you is that it looks like that, that project will go out for bid, and that it's likely to go out for bid later this year or the beginning of next year. And our focus has been on ensuring that the bid terms will allow for a truly competitive bid process with participants that are concerned about not taking on any Foreign Corrupt Practice Act responsibilities. And as you know, we backed away from that when we felt that we could not get the kind of a clean deal that we felt that we could execute on. And so we have had some meetings with the government officials, encouraging them to create a bit that ensures that the project is going to be financeable and that there will be adequate opportunities to bid in the way that the bid is structured.

What does it mean in terms of tightening up the market perhaps in Asia? And then secondly, does it make, and it sounds like you were saying that it does, does it make people more interested in something like Port Arthur or other opportunities that you guys are exploring in terms of getting supply that may not be as -- I'm sorry, that may not have as much risk perhaps associated with it like something we're seeing in Australia."

And in the U.S. market, you don't have one dedicated supply source for the gas. And you also have the ability to sell off the gas at liquid points in the U.S. if you don't want to take the gas. I actually think that what's happening in Australia and in some of these other locations, where the supply store starts to get more constrained, makes it way better for the U.S. in terms of marketing our projects. And so that's the opportunity that we see right now. And I think Woodside sees a similar view. They've been very excited about our Port Arthur project from the beginning. And I think being an Australian company, they see the benefit of that as well."

With these great year-to-date results, we are increasing our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. The increase in our guidance is a direct result of our strong year-to-date earnings, which Jeff will review with you later, combined with our expectations for continued strong financial performance for the remainder of the year. 
Our businesses are performing well, and we've had some great success in securing growth projects for our future. Some highlights that I will detail later are: since our analyst conference, we've made significant progress on our strategic investments, adding over $1 billion in new projects, with approximately $500 million coming from projects we filed for at our California utilities. 
In addition, we received 2 positive regulatory outcomes that improved the clarity of our expected financial returns and allow us to increase the amount of gas stored at Aliso Canyon by reinstating injections. We expect positive developments across our businesses to completely offset the 2018 impact of a further Cameron delay, which I will discuss in a moment. Based on these developments, we are affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. We expect to give updated 2018 segment guidance and 2019 guidance early next year.
Now please turn to the next slide where I will discuss the update to the Cameron schedule. Cameron and the joint venture partners continue to monitor Cameron's construction progress. Our observations are that certain aspects of the work may be ahead of schedule but many others are behind the schedule we received last October. As a result, Cameron has continued to question the contractor, and recently, the contractor notified us that its Cameron schedule has changed. 
Based on several factors, we think it is reasonable to expect that Train 1 could be delayed into 2019 with Trains 2 and 3 following throughout 2019. These factors include: an updated schedule from the contractor; Cameron's own review of the schedule; and the inherent risk in constructing and testing these types of facilities. The contractor and JV partners are assessing reasons for the schedule change and working through the issue. All parties are focused on bringing the 3 trains into service as soon as practical.
Let me be clear, we are disappointed in the most recent change and the impact on our near-term earnings and cash flow. We have revised our 2018 financial plan to assume no earnings from Cameron in 2018. But as I mentioned, the expected strength of our other businesses allows us to affirm our 2018 guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. We also continue to expect our earnings from Cameron in 2020 to be in the $300 million to $350 million range.
In the long term, we don't foresee any material impact to Cameron's economics. When we developed the project, we built in risk mitigation provisions at our contracts such as the lump sum turnkey EPC contract with schedule and cost overrun protection. 
I will end this slide on an additional point many of you have asked us about. During large construction projects like Cameron, contractors often assert that they are owed additional compensation, schedule extensions or both. While Cameron has received information from the contractor claiming they are owed amounts beyond the contract value, sufficient details have not been provided to enable an evaluation of the validity or the amounts. 
The contractors informed us that they will supplement the information at a future date. I will reiterate, we expect the protections we put in place to get Cameron's long-term economics materially the same. We think it is important to share with you the progress that has been made on this project site. Please go to the next slide.
This slide shows a photo of the Cameron site as of mid-July. As you can see, a lot of work is getting done. That said, we will continue to monitor the progress that gives a schedule to help ensure that safety and long-term reliability of the project is not being compromised.
Now turn to the next slide. We have listed some of the most important and relevant accomplishments today, which give a sense of how far construction has progressed. I'll mention a few. 100% of the engineering work has been completed. Nearly 100% of the procurement is completed, and all 3 heat exchangers have been laid on their foundations. Finally, this project has our full attention, and I want to emphasize how important it is to us. I also know that it's important to all of you.
With that, I'll hand it off to Jeff, who will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff?"

Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $60 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276",271,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $60 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276 million or $1.10 per share. This also compares favorably to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2016 of $200 million or $0.79 per share.
Next, let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the key factors impacting these results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by healthy operating results that include: $23 million due to higher earnings from LNG marketing activities in 2017 and losses in the second quarter of 2016 that were related to gas price movement on inventory sold forward; $21 million of higher operational earnings primarily from acquisitions and pipelines placed into service in Mexico; $16 million from higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses, at SDG&E; and finally, $11 million from higher earnings due to U.S. renewable assets that were placed into service in 2016 as well as increased production across the portfolio this year. 
The strong operational results that I discussed for Mexico were more than offset by $12 million of losses in the current quarter related to foreign currency and inflation effects. This compares to a $16 million benefit last year. I'd also like to emphasize that assuming current rates, $30 million of additional hedge income is expected to be booked in the second half of the year and largely offset the year-to-date FX losses at Mexico.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Debbie who will go over our business updates."

I'll describe several that we've added since our last quarterly call.
Let me start with Mexico. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to IEnova's Analyst Day in June where the team identified $45 billion of potential market opportunities through 2025. Of this $45 billion, approximately $10 billion are in the newly opened Liquids Infrastructure business. 
I discussed at our Analyst Day that I thought this was an excellent growth area for us. IEnova has started to expand its strategic footprint into this area and had some positive recent developments. Specifically, IEnova will develop 3 liquids terminals, 2 of which will be in the high consumption areas of Mexico City and Puebla and the third in the port of Veracruz. 
The facilities all have long-term firm U.S. dollar-denominated capacity agreements with Valero. In addition, the expected total CapEx for the projects is $275 million and all are planned to go into service through 2019.
Valero has the option to purchase 50% equity ownership in all of the facilities when they go into service. We hope to continue to build our strategic partnership with Valero as projects like these fit IEnova and Sempra's core competency. Most importantly, these projects will lay a solid foundation for us to expand this new business line into additional inland and marine terminal opportunities as well as liquids transportation investments. Just as we did with our natural gas pipeline, we see the opportunities for solid returns and great growth by being an early mover in this market.
Moving to Chile. We were awarded a transmission project through our joint venture for approximately $50 million. The project is expected to go into service in 2021 and continues to build on our growing transmission business in Chile. 
Finally, we are constructing a new 200-megawatt solar project in California. This facility is fully contracted for an average of 18 years and is expected to go into service in phases through the first half of 2018.
Please turn to the next slide. Starting with the cost of capital, we were pleased that the all-party settlement was upheld, extending the certainty of our ROEs through 2019. This decision provides greater clarity of our planned earnings at our California utilities. 
Also at SoCalGas, we received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field to a target level of approximately 24 Bcf and have started to do so. While the recent approval to resume gas injections is positive news, we remain concerned about system reliability this summer and in the coming winter, given the length of time it took to receive this decision as well as the limitations on targeted gas storage levels. We are working cooperatively with the agencies to help ensure we safely operate the Aliso Canyon storage field within the authority we have been granted.
Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we have filed applications at the CPUC for 2 projects representing an incremental $500 million of rate base investments, comprised of the Master Meter mobile home park and a new customer information system at SDG&E.
Before I turn to our guidance, I'll highlight that adding and filing for over $1 billion of new development projects across our utility and infrastructure businesses is a testament to our strong growth platforms and our ability to capture opportunities. We continue to make significant progress on the projects and our plans while also evaluating and advancing projects like those we've added since the analyst conference.
Please turn to the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, for the second time this year, we are raising our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. On a GAAP basis, our increased 2017 EPS guidance range is $4.95 to $5.25. The key contributors driving this increase are: strong year-to-date earnings, accelerated capital deployment and disciplined cost management across our businesses. We expect these key operational drivers to continue into 2018 and to completely offset the delay in Cameron. This has enabled us to affirm our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80.
Please turn to the last slide. To recap, we have accomplished a great deal over the last several months. First, we are making significant progress on our strategic investments with over $1 billion added since our analyst conference. Second, we received positive regulatory outcomes at the California utilities on 2 important matters: the cost of capital extension and reinstating injection at Aliso Canyon. And third, we raised 2017 adjusted EPS guidance and affirm 2018 EPS guidance on a strong expected operational performance.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you might have."

Let me kind of walk you through because I think it is important for you to understand that because the key thing is that these are improvements that we believe are sustainable going forward. And we've really been working throughout 2017 to put these kinds of things in place and then to build upon them in 2018 and 2019. So let me hit the highlights of the key areas. First, last year, we got about $1.4 billion of incremental capital approved and our utilities that was outside of our rate case capital. And so these are incremental projects. And we've been really focused on how we can expedite getting those projects in service, beginning the collection of and then putting them to service in the rate base. And then we filed for another $500 million worth of projects that I mentioned in my talking points. So the utility performance has been very strong, and it's really based upon the deployment of additional capital largely. And then we are building another 200-megawatt solar project in California and that will go into service throughout 2018. And so we will have that, on an ongoing basis, producing earnings. In Mexico, we've had a lot of new projects that we've announced. We have a solar project with Solar. Now we have these liquids terminals that we'll be constructing throughout 2018 into '19. And then we've just had really strong performance from all of our businesses in terms of being very efficient in the operations, which is something we believe can continue. So everything we're looking at in 2018 is, in my mind, totally focused on better performance and performance that we can continue beyond 2018."

The thing that we look at when we entered into this project was a very risk-mitigated approach. And so we did with our partners Cameron JV sign a lump sum turnkey agreement. And we expect to hold the contractor joint venture to that agreement. And like most construction projects, people come along with claims and ask for different things, and that's a normal course. I'm not going to go into the specifics of the dollars because we do not have enough information to even review it, audit it or anything else. And so I don't want to talk about dollars. One of the reasons is very important for you all to remember. This is really not a Sempra issue. We are protected throughout the agreements that we've signed on this issue, primarily through the EPC lump sum turnkey agreement and we expect them to perform under that contract. But also through our other contracts, we're protected. Our economics are going to be protected. Of course, as Debbie said, we're disappointed in the earnings movement. But we're confident about getting the value out of this project. And I think that's what we should focus on when you're talking to us about Sempra's impact from these kind of cost issues. Does that help?"

So to the extent that when there is departing load and they take their cost, that's fine. And we just need to make sure that going forward, the commission complies with that law and we have a solution to do that. I would like to just say though, keep in mind that in California, our rates are decoupled and our generation rate base investment is less than 10% so we're not long on generation obviously. In San Diego, we don't have any CCA providers. We do have some cities that are looking at it. And one of the key issues and variables as they look at this issue is what the commission will -- is doing in compliance with state law on the departing load charges. So that's a key issue and variable, which is causing the cities to take a second look at things."

So we know what's going on in the site. We also have multiple external consultants there reviewing the work and the process and reviewing the forecast forward. What do we see going forward? And as the work continues to progress, as you see in the photograph, there's less work to finish so that would naturally cause you to be a little bit more confident in it. Yet we do have to take into account things like weather. So as our consultants and we look at it, we take into account the normal course of events in the Gulf Coast. What I would say is not in there is unexpected event. If there was a major disruption from a major hurricane in 2017 or 2018, that would probably cause some change. But it's hard to say because it depends where the hurricane hits, how much time is away, that recent storm Cindy that they had, they were away from the site for like 1.5 days. So it kind of depends on the severity of it. But we do, in our own analysis, built in the normal kind of weather issues that confront contractors in the Gulf of Mexico."

And what we wanted to understand is really kind of what the critical path was on the project and what does that mean to the end day on the project? Because when you have a combination of things getting done faster and things getting done later, it's really hard to determine what the overall impact is. So we brought in outside consultants. We spent time with the contractor that they gave us some dates that they felt that they could meet. We had our consultants and I'll review all of that type of information. And we came to some of our own conclusions. And that our conclusions are that from our standpoint, we feel that we don't want to have any earnings at our financial plan for 2018 for Cameron. We don't want to assume that risk, and we want to give you guidance without any earnings from Cameron. If something wonderful happens and it comes in early, that's great.

With these great year-to-date results, we are increasing our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. The increase in our guidance is a direct result of our strong year-to-date earnings, which Jeff will review with you later, combined with our expectations for continued strong financial performance for the remainder of the year. 
Our businesses are performing well, and we've had some great success in securing growth projects for our future. Some highlights that I will detail later are: since our analyst conference, we've made significant progress on our strategic investments, adding over $1 billion of new projects, with approximately $500 million coming from projects we filed for at our California Utilities. 
In addition, we received 2 positive regulatory outcomes that improve the clarity of our expected financial returns and allow us to increase the amount of gas stored at Aliso Canyon by reinstating injections. We expect positive developments across our businesses to completely offset the 2018 impact of a further Cameron delay, which I will discuss in a moment. Based on these developments, we are affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. We expect to give updated 2018 segment guidance and 2019 guidance early next year.
Now please turn to the next slide where I will discuss the update to the Cameron schedule. Cameron and the joint venture partners continue to monitor Cameron's construction progress. Our observations are that certain aspects of the work may be ahead of schedule but many others are behind the schedule we received last October. As a result, Cameron has continued to question the contractor, and recently, the contractor notified us that its Cameron schedule has changed. 
Based on several factors, we think it is reasonable to expect that Train 1 could be delayed into 2019 with Trains 2 and 3 following throughout 2019. These factors include: an updated schedule from the contractor; Cameron's own review of the schedule; and the inherent risk in constructing and testing these types of facilities. The contractor and JV partners are assessing reasons for the schedule change and working through the issue. All parties are focused on bringing the 3 trains into service as soon as practical.
Let me be clear, we are disappointed in the most recent change and the impact on our near-term earnings and cash flow. We have revised our 2018 financial plan to assume no earnings from Cameron in 2018. But as I mentioned, the expected strength of our other businesses allows us to affirm our 2018 guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. We also continue to expect our earnings from Cameron in 2020 to be in the $300 million to $350 million range.
In the long term, we don't foresee any material impact to Cameron's economics. When we developed the project, we built in risk mitigation provisions at our contracts such as the lump sum turnkey EPC contract with schedule and cost overrun protection. 
I will end this slide on an additional point many of you have asked us about. During large construction projects like Cameron, contractors often assert that they are owed additional compensation, schedule extensions or both. While Cameron has received information from the contractor claiming they are owed amounts beyond the contract value, sufficient details have not been provided to enable an evaluation of the validity or the amount. 
The contractors informed us that they will supplement the information at a future date. I will reiterate, we expect the protections we put in place to keep Cameron's long-term economics materially the same. We think it is important to share with you the progress that has been made on this project site. Please go to the next slide.
This slide shows a photo of the Cameron site as of mid-July. As you can see, a lot of work is getting done. That said, we will continue to monitor the progress that gives the schedule to help ensure that safety and long-term reliability of the project is not being compromised.
Now turn to the next slide. We have listed some of the most important and relevant accomplishments today, which give a sense of how far construction has progressed. I'll mention a few. 100% of the engineering work has been completed. Nearly 100% of the procurement is completed, and all 3 heat exchangers have been laid on their foundations. Finally, this project has our full attention, and I want to emphasize how important it is to us. I also know that it's important to all of you.
With that, I'll hand it off to Jeff, who will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff?"

Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $60 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276",271,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $60 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276 million or $1.10 per share. This also compares favorably to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2016 of $200 million or $0.79 per share.
Next, let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the key factors impacting these results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by healthy operating results that include: $23 million due to higher earnings from LNG marketing activities in 2017 and losses in the second quarter of 2016 that were related to gas price movement on inventory sold forward; $21 million of higher operational earnings primarily from acquisitions and pipelines placed into service in Mexico; $16 million from higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses, at SDG&E; and finally, $11 million from higher earnings due to U.S. renewable assets that were placed into service in 2016 as well as increased production across the portfolio this year. 
The strong operational results that I discussed for Mexico were more than offset by $12 million of losses in the current quarter related to foreign currency and inflation effects. This compares to a $16 million benefit last year. I'd also like to emphasize that assuming current rates, $30 million of additional hedge income is expected to be booked in the second half of the year and largely offset the year-to-date FX losses at Mexico.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Debbie who will go over our business updates."
120622,531859260,1268244,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2017",2017-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Jeff.

I'll describe several that we've added since our last quarterly call.
Let me start with Mexico. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to IEnova's Analyst Day in June where the team identified $45 billion of potential market opportunities through 2025. Of this $45 billion, approximately $10 billion are in the newly opened liquids infrastructure business. 
I discussed at our Analyst Day that I thought this was an excellent growth area for us. IEnova has started to expand its strategic footprint into this area and had some positive recent developments. Specifically, IEnova will develop 3 liquids terminals, 2 of which will be in the high consumption areas of Mexico City and Puebla and the third in the port of Veracruz. 
The facilities all have long-term firm U.S. dollar-denominated capacity agreements with Valero. In addition, the expected total CapEx for the projects is $275 million and all are planned to go into service through 2019.
Valero has the option to purchase 50% equity ownership in all of the facilities when they go into service. We hope to continue to build our strategic partnership with Valero as projects like these fit IEnova and Sempra's core competency. Most importantly, these projects will lay a solid foundation for us to expand this new business line into additional inland and marine terminal opportunities as well as liquids transportation investments. Just as we did with our natural gas pipeline, we see the opportunities for solid returns and great growth by being an early mover in this market.
Moving to Chile. We were awarded a transmission project through our joint venture for approximately $50 million. The project is expected to go into service in 2021 and continues to build on our growing transmission business in Chile. 
Finally, we are constructing a new 200-megawatt solar project in California. This facility is fully contracted for an average of 18 years and is expected to go into service in phases through the first half of 2018.
Please turn to the next slide. Starting with the cost of capital, we were pleased that the all-party settlement was upheld, extending the certainty of our ROEs through 2019. This decision provides greater clarity of our planned earnings at our California Utilities. 
Also at SoCalGas, we received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field to a target level of approximately 24 Bcf and have started to do so. While the recent approval to resume gas injections is positive news, we remain concerned about system reliability this summer and in the coming winter, given the length of time it took to receive this decision as well as the limitations on targeted gas storage levels. We are working cooperatively with the agencies to help ensure we safely operate the Aliso Canyon storage field within the authority we have been granted.
Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we have filed applications at the CPUC for 2 projects representing an incremental $500 million of rate base investments, comprised of the Master Meter mobile home park and a new customer information system at SDG&E.
Before I turn to our guidance, I'll highlight that adding and filing for over $1 billion of new development projects across our utility and infrastructure businesses is a testament to our strong growth platforms and our ability to capture opportunities. We continue to make significant progress on the projects and our plan while also evaluating and advancing projects like those we've added since the analyst conference.
Please turn to the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, for the second time this year, we are raising our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. On a GAAP basis, our increased 2017 EPS guidance range is $4.95 to $5.25. The key contributors driving this increase are: strong year-to-date earnings, accelerated capital deployment and disciplined cost management across our businesses. We expect these key operational drivers to continue into 2018 and to completely offset the delay in Cameron. This has enabled us to affirm our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80.
Please turn to the last slide. To recap, we have accomplished a great deal over the last several months. First, we are making significant progress on our strategic investments with over $1 billion added since our analyst conference. Second, we received positive regulatory outcomes at the California Utilities on 2 important matters: the cost of capital extension and reinstating injection at Aliso Canyon. And third, we raised 2017 adjusted EPS guidance and affirm 2018 EPS guidance on a strong expected operational performance.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you might have."

Let me kind of walk you through because I think it is important for you to understand that because the key thing is that these are improvements that we believe are sustainable going forward. And we've really been working throughout 2017 to put these kinds of things in place and then to build upon them in 2018 and 2019. So let me hit the highlights of the key areas. First, last year, we got about $1.4 billion of incremental capital approved and our utilities that was outside of our rate case capital. And so these are incremental projects. And we've been really focused on how we can expedite getting those projects in service, beginning the collection of the AFUDC and then putting them to service in the rate base. And then we filed for another $500 million worth of projects that I mentioned in my talking points. So the utility performance has been very strong, and it's really based upon the deployment of additional capital largely. And then we are building another 200-megawatt solar project in California and that will go into service throughout 2018. And so we will have that, on an ongoing basis, producing earnings. In Mexico, we've had a lot of new projects that we've announced. We have a solar project with Pima Solar. Now we have these liquids terminals that we'll be constructing throughout 2018 into '19. And then we've just had really strong performance from all of our businesses in terms of being very efficient in the operations, which is something we believe can continue. So everything we're looking at in 2018 is, in my mind, totally focused on better performance and performance that we can continue beyond 2018."

The thing that we looked at when we entered into this project was a very risk-mitigated approach. And so we did with our partners, Cameron JV, sign a lump sum turnkey agreement. And we expect to hold the contractor joint venture to that agreement. And like most construction projects, people come along with claims and ask for different things, and that's the normal course. I'm not going to go into the specifics of the dollars because we do not have enough information to even review it, audit it or anything else. And so I don't want to talk about dollars. And one of the reasons is very important for you all to remember. This is really not a Sempra issue. We are protected throughout the agreements that we've signed on this issue, primarily through the EPC lump sum turnkey agreement and we expect them to perform under that contract. But also through our other contracts, we're protected. Our economics are going to be protected. Of course, as Debbie said, we're disappointed in the earnings movement. But we're confident about getting the value out of this project. And I think that's what we should focus on when you're talking to us about Sempra's impact from these kind of cost issues.

And we just need to make sure that going forward, the commission complies with that law and we have a solution to do that. I would like to just say though, keep in mind that in California, our rates are decoupled and our generation rate base investment is less than 10% so we're not long on generation obviously. In San Diego, we don't have any CCA providers. We do have some cities that are looking at it. And one of the key issues and variables as they look at this issue is what the commission will -- is doing in compliance with state law on the departing load charges.

So we know what's going on in the site. We also have multiple external consultants there reviewing the work and the process and reviewing the forecast forward. What do we see going forward? And as the work continues to progress, as you see in the photograph, there's less work to finish so that would naturally cause you to be a little bit more confident in it. Yet we do have to take into account things like weather. So as our consultants and we look at it, we take into account the normal course of events in the Gulf Coast. What I would say is not in there is unexpected events. If there was a major disruption from a major hurricane in 2017 or 2018, that would probably cause some change. But it's hard to say because it depends where the hurricane hits, how much time is away, that recent storm, Cindy, that they had, they were away from the site for like 1.5 days. So it kind of depends on the severity of it. But we do, in our own analysis, build in the normal kind of weather issues that confront contractors in the Gulf of Mexico."

Because when you have a combination of things getting done faster and things getting done later, it's really hard to determine what the overall impact is. So we brought in outside consultants.

But it's one of our growth areas and -- but I wouldn't say that we have changed significantly our capital plans in that area from what we showed you at the analyst conference."

With these great year-to-date results, we are increasing our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. The increase in our guidance is a direct result of our strong year-to-date earnings, which Jeff will review with you later, combined with our expectations for continued strong financial performance for the remainder of the year. 
Our businesses are performing well, and we've had some great success in securing growth projects for our future. Some highlights that I will detail later are: since our analyst conference, we've made significant progress on our strategic investments, adding over $1 billion of new projects, with approximately $500 million coming from projects we filed for at our California Utilities. 
In addition, we received 2 positive regulatory outcomes that improve the clarity of our expected financial returns and allow us to increase the amount of gas stored at Aliso Canyon by reinstating injections. We expect positive developments across our businesses to completely offset the 2018 impact of a further Cameron delay, which I will discuss in a moment. Based on these developments, we are affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. We expect to give updated 2018 segment guidance and 2019 guidance early next year.
Now please turn to the next slide where I will discuss the update to the Cameron schedule. Cameron and the joint venture partners continue to monitor Cameron's construction progress. Our observations are that certain aspects of the work may be ahead of schedule but many others are behind the schedule we received last October. As a result, Cameron has continued to question the contractor, and recently, the contractor notified us that its Cameron schedule has changed. 
Based on several factors, we think it is reasonable to expect that Train 1 could be delayed into 2019 with Trains 2 and 3 following throughout 2019. These factors include: an updated schedule from the contractor; Cameron's own review of the schedule; and the inherent risk in constructing and testing these types of facilities. The contractor and JV partners are assessing reasons for the schedule change and working through the issue. All parties are focused on bringing the 3 trains into service as soon as practical.
Let me be clear, we are disappointed in the most recent change and the impact on our near-term earnings and cash flow. We have revised our 2018 financial plan to assume no earnings from Cameron in 2018. But as I mentioned, the expected strength of our other businesses allows us to affirm our 2018 guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. We also continue to expect our earnings from Cameron in 2020 to be in the $300 million to $350 million range.
In the long term, we don't foresee any material impact to Cameron's economics. When we developed the project, we built in risk mitigation provisions at our contracts such as the lump sum turnkey EPC contract with schedule and cost overrun protection. 
I will end this slide on an additional point many of you have asked us about. During large construction projects like Cameron, contractors often assert that they are owed additional compensation, schedule extensions or both. While Cameron has received information from the contractor claiming they are owed amounts beyond the contract value, sufficient details have not been provided to enable an evaluation of the validity or the amount. 
The contractors informed us that they will supplement the information at a future date. I will reiterate, we expect the protections we put in place to keep Cameron's long-term economics materially the same. We think it is important to share with you the progress that has been made on this project site. Please go to the next slide.
This slide shows a photo of the Cameron site as of mid-July. As you can see, a lot of work is getting done. That said, we will continue to monitor the progress that gives the schedule to help ensure that safety and long-term reliability of the project is not being compromised.
Now turn to the next slide. We have listed some of the most important and relevant accomplishments today, which give a sense of how far construction has progressed. I'll mention a few. 100% of the engineering work has been completed. Nearly 100% of the procurement is completed, and all 3 heat exchangers have been laid on their foundations. Finally, this project has our full attention, and I want to emphasize how important it is to us. I also know that it's important to all of you.
With that, I'll hand it off to Jeff, who will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff?"

Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $60 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276",271,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $60 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276 million or $1.10 per share. This also compares favorably to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2016 of $200 million or $0.79 per share.
Next, let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the key factors impacting these results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by healthy operating results that include: $23 million due to higher earnings from LNG marketing activities in 2017 and losses in the second quarter of 2016 that were related to gas price movement on inventory sold forward; $21 million of higher operational earnings primarily from acquisitions and pipelines placed into service in Mexico; $16 million from higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses, at SDG&E; and finally, $11 million from higher earnings due to U.S. renewable assets that were placed into service in 2016 as well as increased production across the portfolio this year. 
The strong operational results that I discussed for Mexico were more than offset by $12 million of losses in the current quarter related to foreign currency and inflation effects. This compares to a $16 million benefit last year. I'd also like to emphasize that assuming current rates, $30 million of additional hedge income is expected to be booked in the second half of the year and largely offset the year-to-date FX losses at Mexico.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Debbie who will go over our business updates."
120622,531859260,1268528,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2017",2017-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. As I mentioned earlier, we've added over $1 billion of new investments. I'll describe several that we've added since our last quarterly call.Let me start with Mexico. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to IEnova's Analyst Day in June wh",788,"Thanks, Jeff. As I mentioned earlier, we've added over $1 billion of new investments. I'll describe several that we've added since our last quarterly call.
Let me start with Mexico. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to IEnova's Analyst Day in June where the team identified $45 billion of potential market opportunities through 2025. Of this $45 billion, approximately $10 billion are in the newly opened liquids infrastructure business. 
I discussed at our Analyst Day that I thought this was an excellent growth area for us. IEnova has started to expand its strategic footprint into this area and had some positive recent developments. Specifically, IEnova will develop 3 liquids terminals, 2 of which will be in the high consumption areas of Mexico City and Puebla and the third in the port of Veracruz. 
The facilities all have long-term firm U.S. dollar-denominated capacity agreements with Valero. In addition, the expected total CapEx for the projects is $275 million and all are planned to go into service through 2019.
Valero has the option to purchase 50% equity ownership in all of the facilities when they go into service. We hope to continue to build our strategic partnership with Valero as projects like these fit IEnova and Sempra's core competency. Most importantly, these projects will lay a solid foundation for us to expand this new business line into additional inland and marine terminal opportunities as well as liquids transportation investments. Just as we did with our natural gas pipelines, we see the opportunities for solid returns and great growth by being an early mover in this market.
Moving to Chile. We were awarded a transmission project through our joint venture for approximately $50 million. The project is expected to go into service in 2021 and continues to build on our growing transmission business in Chile. 
Finally, we are constructing a new 200-megawatt solar project in California. This facility is fully contracted for an average of 18 years and is expected to go into service in phases through the first half of 2018.
Please turn to the next slide. Starting with the cost of capital, we were pleased that the all-party settlement was upheld, extending the certainty of our ROEs through 2019. This decision provides greater clarity of our planned earnings at our California Utilities. 
Also at SoCalGas, we received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field to a target level of approximately 24 Bcf and have started to do so. While the recent approval to resume gas injections is positive news, we remain concerned about system reliability this summer and in the coming winter, given the length of time it took to receive this decision as well as the limitations on targeted gas storage levels. We are working cooperatively with the agencies to help ensure we safely operate the Aliso Canyon storage field within the authority we have been granted.
Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we have filed applications at the CPUC for 2 projects representing an incremental $500 million of rate base investments, comprised of the Master Meter mobile home park and a new customer information system at SDG&E.
Before I turn to our guidance, I'll highlight that adding and filing for over $1 billion of new development projects across our utility and infrastructure businesses is a testament to our strong growth platforms and our ability to capture opportunities. We continue to make significant progress on the projects and our plan while also evaluating and advancing projects like those we've added since the analyst conference.
Please turn to the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, for the second time this year, we are raising our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. On a GAAP basis, our increased 2017 EPS guidance range is $4.95 to $5.25. The key contributors driving this increase are: strong year-to-date earnings, accelerated capital deployment and disciplined cost management across our businesses. We expect these key operational drivers to continue into 2018 and to completely offset the delay in Cameron  [indiscernible] . This has enabled us to affirm our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80.
Please turn to the last slide. To recap, we have accomplished a great deal over the last several months. First, we are making significant progress on our strategic investments with over $1 billion added since our analyst conference. Second, we received positive regulatory outcomes at the California Utilities on 2 important matters: the cost of capital extension and reinstating injection at Aliso Canyon. And third, we raised 2017 adjusted EPS guidance and affirm 2018 EPS guidance on a strong expected operational performance.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you might have."

Let me kind of walk you through because I think it is important for you to understand this, because the key thing is that these are improvements that we believe are sustainable going forward. And we've really been working throughout 2017 to put these kinds of things in place and then to build upon them in 2018 and 2019. So let me hit the highlights of the key areas. First, last year, we got about $1.4 billion of incremental capital approved and our utilities that was outside of our rate case capital. And so these are incremental projects. And we've been really focused on how we can expedite getting those projects in service, beginning the collection of the AFUDC and then putting them to service in the rate base. And then we filed for another $500 million worth of projects that I mentioned in my talking points. So the utility performance has been very strong, and it's really based upon the deployment of additional capital largely. And then we are building another 200-megawatt solar project in California and that will go into service throughout 2018. And so we will have that, on an ongoing basis, producing earnings. In Mexico, we've had a lot of new projects that we've announced. We have a solar project with Pima Solar. Now we have these liquids terminals that we'll be constructing throughout 2018 into '19. And then we've just had really strong performance from all of our businesses in terms of being very efficient in the operations, which is something we believe can continue. So everything we're looking at in 2018 is, in my mind, totally focused on better performance and performance that we can continue beyond 2018."

The thing that we looked at when we entered into this project was a very risk-mitigated approach. And so we did with our partners, Cameron JV, sign a lump sum turnkey agreement. And we expect to hold the contractor joint venture to that agreement. And like most construction projects, people come along with claims and ask for different things, and that's the normal course. I'm not going to go into the specifics of the dollars because we do not have enough information to even review it, audit it or anything else. And so I don't want to talk about dollars. And one of the reasons is very important for you all to remember. This is really not a Sempra issue. We are protected throughout the agreements that we've signed on this issue, primarily through the EPC lump sum turnkey agreement and we expect them to perform under that contract. But also through our other contracts, we're protected. Our economics are going to be protected. Of course, as Debbie said, we're disappointed in the earnings movement. But we're confident about getting the value out of this project. And I think that's what we should focus on when you're talking to us about Sempra's impact from these kind of cost issues.

And we just need to make sure that going forward, the commission complies with that law and we have a solution to do that. I would like to just say though, keep in mind that in California, our rates are decoupled and our generation rate base investment is less than 10% so we're not long on generation obviously. In San Diego, we don't have any CCA providers. We do have some cities that are looking at it. And one of the key issues and variables as they look at this issue is what the commission will -- is doing in compliance with state law on the departing load charges.

So we know what's going on in the site. We also have multiple external consultants there reviewing the work and the process and reviewing the forecast forward. What do we see going forward? And as the work continues to progress, as you see in the photograph, there's less work to finish so that would naturally cause you to be a little bit more confident in it. Yet we do have to take into account things like weather. So as our consultants and we look at it, we take into account the normal course of events in the Gulf Coast. What I would say is not in there is unexpected events. If there was a major disruption from a major hurricane in 2017 or 2018, that would probably cause some change. But it's hard to say because it depends where the hurricane hits, how much time is away, that recent storm, Cindy, that they had, they were away from the site for like 1.5 days. So it kind of depends on the severity of it. But we do, in our own analysis, build in the normal kind of weather issues that confront contractors in the Gulf of Mexico."

And what we wanted to understand is really kind of what the critical path was on the project and what does that mean to the end date on the project? Because when you have a combination of things getting done faster and things getting done later, it's really hard to determine what the overall impact is. So we brought in outside consultants.

But it's one of our growth areas and -- but I wouldn't say that we have changed significantly our capital plans in that area from what we showed you at the analyst conference."

With these great year-to-date results, we are increasing our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. The increase in our guidance is a direct result of our strong year-to-date earnings, which Jeff will review with you later, combined with our expectations for continued strong financial performance for the remainder of the year. 
Our businesses are performing well, and we've had some great success in securing growth projects for our future. Some highlights that I will detail later are: since our analyst conference, we've made significant progress on our strategic investments, adding over $1 billion of new projects, with approximately $500 million coming from projects we filed for at our California Utilities. 
In addition, we received 2 positive regulatory outcomes that improve the clarity of our expected financial returns and allow us to increase the amount of gas stored at Aliso Canyon by reinstating injections. We expect positive developments across our businesses to completely offset the 2018 impact of a further Cameron delay, which I will discuss in a moment. Based on these developments, we are affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. We expect to give updated 2018 segment guidance and 2019 guidance early next year.
Now please turn to the next slide where I will discuss the update to the Cameron schedule. Cameron and the joint venture partners continue to monitor Cameron's construction progress. Our observations are that certain aspects of the work may be ahead of schedule but many others are behind the schedule we received last October. As a result, Cameron has continued to question the contractor, and recently, the contractor notified us that its Cameron schedule has changed. 
Based on several factors, we think it is reasonable to expect that Train 1 could be delayed into 2019 with Trains 2 and 3 following throughout 2019. These factors include: an updated schedule from the contractor; Cameron's own review of the schedule; and the inherent risk in constructing and testing these types of facilities. The contractor and JV partners are assessing reasons for the schedule change and working through the issue. All parties are focused on bringing the 3 trains into service as soon as practical.
Let me be clear, we are disappointed in the most recent change and the impact on our near-term earnings and cash flow. We have revised our 2018 financial plan to assume no earnings from Cameron in 2018. But as I mentioned, the expected strength of our other businesses allows us to affirm our 2018 guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. We also continue to expect our earnings from Cameron in 2020 to be in the $300 million to $350 million range.
In the long term, we don't foresee any material impact to Cameron's economics. When we developed the project, we built in risk mitigation provisions at our contracts such as the lump sum turnkey EPC contract with schedule and cost overrun protection. 
I will end this slide on an additional point many of you have asked us about. During large construction projects like Cameron, contractors often assert that they are owed additional compensation, schedule extensions or both. While Cameron has received information from the contractor claiming they are owed amounts beyond the contract value, sufficient details have not been provided to enable an evaluation of the validity or the amount. 
The contractors informed us that they will supplement the information at a future date. I will reiterate, we expect the protections we put in place to keep Cameron's long-term economics materially the same. We think it is important to share with you the progress that has been made on this project site. Please go to the next slide.
This slide shows a photo of the Cameron site as of mid-July. As you can see, a lot of work is getting done. That said, we will continue to monitor the progress that gives the schedule to help ensure that safety and long-term reliability of the project is not being compromised.
Now turn to the next slide. We have listed some of the most important and relevant accomplishments today, which give a sense of how far construction has progressed. I'll mention a few. 100% of the engineering work has been completed. Nearly 100% of the procurement is completed, and all 3 heat exchangers have been laid on their foundations. Finally, this project has our full attention, and I want to emphasize how important it is to us. I also know that it's important to all of you.
With that, I'll hand it off to Jeff, who will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff?"

Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $60 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276",271,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $60 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276 million or $1.10 per share. This also compares favorably to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2016 of $200 million or $0.79 per share.
Next, let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the key factors impacting these results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by healthy operating results that include: $23 million due to higher earnings from LNG marketing activities in 2017 and losses in the second quarter of 2016 that were related to gas price movement on inventory sold forward; $21 million of higher operational earnings primarily from acquisitions and pipelines placed into service in Mexico; $16 million from higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses, at SDG&E; and finally, $11 million from higher earnings due to U.S. renewable assets that were placed into service in 2016 as well as increased production across the portfolio this year. 
The strong operational results that I discussed for Mexico were more than offset by $12 million of losses in the current quarter related to foreign currency and inflation effects. This compares to a $16 million benefit last year. I'd also like to emphasize that assuming current rates, $30 million of additional hedge income is expected to be booked in the second half of the year and largely offset the year-to-date FX losses at Mexico.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Debbie who will go over our business updates."
120622,531859260,1273890,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2017",2017-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. As I mentioned earlier, we've added over $1 billion of new investments. I'll describe several that we've added since our last quarterly call.Let me start with Mexico. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to IEnova's Analyst Day in June wh",788,"Thanks, Jeff. As I mentioned earlier, we've added over $1 billion of new investments. I'll describe several that we've added since our last quarterly call.
Let me start with Mexico. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to IEnova's Analyst Day in June where the team identified $45 billion of potential market opportunities through 2025. Of this $45 billion, approximately $10 billion are in the newly opened liquids infrastructure business. 
I discussed at our Analyst Day that I thought this was an excellent growth area for us. IEnova has started to expand its strategic footprint into this area and had some positive recent developments. Specifically, IEnova will develop 3 liquids terminals, 2 of which will be in the high consumption areas of Mexico City and Puebla and the third in the port of Veracruz. 
The facilities all have long-term firm U.S. dollar-denominated capacity agreements with Valero. In addition, the expected total CapEx for the projects is $275 million and all are planned to go into service through 2019.
Valero has the option to purchase 50% equity ownership in all of the facilities when they go into service. We hope to continue to build our strategic partnership with Valero as projects like these fit IEnova and Sempra's core competency. Most importantly, these projects will lay a solid foundation for us to expand this new business line into additional inland and marine terminal opportunities as well as liquids transportation investments. Just as we did with our natural gas pipelines, we see the opportunities for solid returns and great growth by being an early mover in this market.
Moving to Chile. We were awarded a transmission project through our joint venture for approximately $50 million. The project is expected to go into service in 2021 and continues to build on our growing transmission business in Chile. 
Finally, we are constructing a new 200-megawatt solar project in California. This facility is fully contracted for an average of 18 years and is expected to go into service in phases through the first half of 2018.
Please turn to the next slide. Starting with the cost of capital, we were pleased that the all-party settlement was upheld, extending the certainty of our ROEs through 2019. This decision provides greater clarity of our planned earnings at our California Utilities. 
Also at SoCalGas, we received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field to a target level of approximately 24 Bcf and have started to do so. While the recent approval to resume gas injections is positive news, we remain concerned about system reliability this summer and in the coming winter, given the length of time it took to receive this decision as well as the limitations on targeted gas storage levels. We are working cooperatively with the agencies to help ensure we safely operate the Aliso Canyon storage field within the authority we have been granted.
Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we have filed applications at the CPUC for 2 projects representing an incremental $500 million of rate base investments, comprised of the Master Meter mobile home park and a new customer information system at SDG&E.
Before I turn to our guidance, I'll highlight that adding and filing for over $1 billion of new development projects across our utility and infrastructure businesses is a testament to our strong growth platforms and our ability to capture opportunities. We continue to make significant progress on the projects and our plan while also evaluating and advancing projects like those we've added since the analyst conference.
Please turn to the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, for the second time this year, we are raising our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. On a GAAP basis, our increased 2017 EPS guidance range is $4.95 to $5.25. The key contributors driving this increase are: strong year-to-date earnings, accelerated capital deployment and disciplined cost management across our businesses. We expect these key operational drivers to continue into 2018 and to completely offset the delay in Cameron  [indiscernible] . This has enabled us to affirm our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80.
Please turn to the last slide. To recap, we have accomplished a great deal over the last several months. First, we are making significant progress on our strategic investments with over $1 billion added since our analyst conference. Second, we received positive regulatory outcomes at the California Utilities on 2 important matters: the cost of capital extension and reinstating injection at Aliso Canyon. And third, we raised 2017 adjusted EPS guidance and affirm 2018 EPS guidance on a strong expected operational performance.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you might have."

Let me kind of walk you through because I think it is important for you to understand this, because the key thing is that these are improvements that we believe are sustainable going forward. And we've really been working throughout 2017 to put these kinds of things in place and then to build upon them in 2018 and 2019. So let me hit the highlights of the key areas. First, last year, we got about $1.4 billion of incremental capital approved and our utilities that was outside of our rate case capital. And so these are incremental projects. And we've been really focused on how we can expedite getting those projects in service, beginning the collection of the AFUDC and then putting them to service in the rate base. And then we filed for another $500 million worth of projects that I mentioned in my talking points. So the utility performance has been very strong, and it's really based upon the deployment of additional capital largely. And then we are building another 200-megawatt solar project in California and that will go into service throughout 2018. And so we will have that, on an ongoing basis, producing earnings. In Mexico, we've had a lot of new projects that we've announced. We have a solar project with Pima Solar. Now we have these liquids terminals that we'll be constructing throughout 2018 into '19. And then we've just had really strong performance from all of our businesses in terms of being very efficient in the operations, which is something we believe can continue. So everything we're looking at in 2018 is, in my mind, totally focused on better performance and performance that we can continue beyond 2018."

The thing that we looked at when we entered into this project was a very risk-mitigated approach. And so we did with our partners, Cameron JV, sign a lump sum turnkey agreement. And we expect to hold the contractor joint venture to that agreement. And like most construction projects, people come along with claims and ask for different things, and that's the normal course. I'm not going to go into the specifics of the dollars because we do not have enough information to even review it, audit it or anything else. And so I don't want to talk about dollars. And one of the reasons is very important for you all to remember. This is really not a Sempra issue. We are protected throughout the agreements that we've signed on this issue, primarily through the EPC lump sum turnkey agreement and we expect them to perform under that contract. But also through our other contracts, we're protected. Our economics are going to be protected. Of course, as Debbie said, we're disappointed in the earnings movement. But we're confident about getting the value out of this project. And I think that's what we should focus on when you're talking to us about Sempra's impact from these kind of cost issues.

And we just need to make sure that going forward, the commission complies with that law and we have a solution to do that. I would like to just say though, keep in mind that in California, our rates are decoupled and our generation rate base investment is less than 10% so we're not long on generation obviously. In San Diego, we don't have any CCA providers. We do have some cities that are looking at it. And one of the key issues and variables as they look at this issue is what the commission will -- is doing in compliance with state law on the departing load charges.

So we know what's going on in the site. We also have multiple external consultants there reviewing the work and the process and reviewing the forecast forward. What do we see going forward? And as the work continues to progress, as you see in the photograph, there's less work to finish so that would naturally cause you to be a little bit more confident in it. Yet we do have to take into account things like weather. So as our consultants and we look at it, we take into account the normal course of events in the Gulf Coast. What I would say is not in there is unexpected events. If there was a major disruption from a major hurricane in 2017 or 2018, that would probably cause some change. But it's hard to say because it depends where the hurricane hits, how much time is away, that recent storm, Cindy, that they had, they were away from the site for like 1.5 days. So it kind of depends on the severity of it. But we do, in our own analysis, build in the normal kind of weather issues that confront contractors in the Gulf of Mexico."

And what we wanted to understand is really kind of what the critical path was on the project and what does that mean to the end date on the project? Because when you have a combination of things getting done faster and things getting done later, it's really hard to determine what the overall impact is. So we brought in outside consultants.

But it's one of our growth areas and -- but I wouldn't say that we have changed significantly our capital plans in that area from what we showed you at the analyst conference."

At our analyst conference, we discussed 2 important strategic goals for Sempra through 2021: first, we exp",1902,"Thanks, Jeff. From time to time, it's important for us to take a step back and talk about how our projects and acquisitions fit within our strategy. At our analyst conference, we discussed 2 important strategic goals for Sempra through 2021: first, we expect to deliver roughly double the long-term earnings growth rate of our utility peers; and second, we plan superior dividend growth of 8% to 9%. These were set before consideration of the significant opportunities we've been executing on this year. 
I'd like to highlight our success in growing our business in the 6 months since our analyst conference. We have captured or filed for approximately $1.9 billion in incremental opportunities that were not part of our plan. We also announced the Oncor transaction, which we expect to be accretive to EPS during our plan period. It also adds a new strategic growth platform in the U.S. while helping us maintain the approximately 75-25 U.S. international earnings mix in our portfolio. And our California Utilities submitted their General Rate Case filings, which seeks significant increases in revenue requirements for 2019 needed to continue providing safe and reliable service to customers.
Please turn to the next slide. Collectively, the new projects add approximately $1.9 billion of additional investment. I would like to highlight our most recent project addition. We announced the pending acquisition of Pemex's 25% equity interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline for approximately $520 million, bringing IEnova's total ownership to 50%. We expect the transaction to close by the end of this year. Most of these projects come online later in 2018 and beyond, and we expect that they will improve our growth in the latter years of our plan. 
We have also seen improved operating performance in cash flows from our core businesses. This improved performance, coupled with the additional projects, should allow us to offset some of the 2019 impact of the previously announced Cameron delay. And just to confirm, there's no change at Cameron as we continue to expect Trains 1 through 3 to be producing LNG in 2019.
As you can see, since the analyst conference, we have developed growth projects across our businesses, and we believe our portfolio mix will allow us to continue to grow earnings at rates roughly double that of traditional utilities while maintaining a utility-like risk profile.
Please turn to the next slide. When you look at our existing platform, it's easy to see how Oncor is a great strategic fit. This business has a strong management team and is focused on achieving above-average growth through transmission and distribution investments that create value for customers and shareholders. Oncor manages a large rate base, similar to our California Utilities, and adding it to our portfolio increases Sempra's U.S.-based utility earnings mix. 
Further, Texas is a constructive business environment with above-average customer and energy use growth. This acquisition provides meaningful expected accretion and also strengthens our expected credit profile in future years, giving us further balance sheet flexibility to continue to invest in growth.
I would like to highlight the last point. From the strengthening credit profile provided by Oncor and the ongoing earnings accretion from the transaction, we expect to have $1 billion to $1.5 billion of credit capacity in the outer years of our plan, which should provide us with approximately the same credit profile as we communicated at our April analyst conference. The credit capacity could be used to return value to our shareholders through funding of additional growth opportunities, increases in planned annual dividend growth, share repurchases or a combination.
Before moving on, I'd like to give an update on where we're at in the regulatory process. We filed our change in control request with the PUC of Texas on October 5, and on October 12, the ALJ and the staff deemed the application sufficient. On October 16, the commission approved a schedule of 180 days to resolve the case by early April.
Now we are responding to data request and we're optimistic that once we address questions and issues identified in the data request, we could work towards constructive settlements with the key intervening parties.
Many of you have asked about our financing and while we can't answer specific questions, I will say that as we execute our financing plan, we will consider our progress on the regulatory front. We will also consider a wide range of financing alternatives, so we could make the best decisions based on market conditions at the time of our capital raises.
Please turn to the next slide. Sempra has a strong presence in the Gulf Coast with our LNG projects, natural gas storage and IEnova. The addition of Oncor will further strengthen our footprint and serves as a new growth platform to expand our opportunity set. We have a great history of leveraging our platforms and understanding of energy markets to find new opportunities. Examples include development of our current renewables business to meet state RPS standards and planting the roots for IEnova, which started out with a cross-border pipeline in northern Baja and 3 small LDCs. 
Our strategic vision for the Texas Gulf Coast region is to be a major player in these growing energy markets. We expect the addition of Oncor, coupled with our existing presence in the natural gas market, to position us well to be a leading player in the Gulf Coast and cross-border energy markets.
Please turn to the next slide where I'll review Oncor's opportunities in more detail. Oncor recently had its rate case approved, which authorized a new ROE and capital structure, and Oncor made the commitment to spend a minimum of $7.5 billion over 5 years. Their current capital plan forecast is for $8.4 billion and is designed to improve service and reduce cost to customers. 
Some of the things we like about this business are: Oncor is investing in only transmission and distribution projects, so there's no exposure to generation assets, which we believe is the right profile for electric utilities going forward; they are making large investments while maintaining the lowest rates in Texas; and they are authorized to recover costs associated with additional projects that are in the customers' best interest through a tracker mechanism without additional approval between rate cases. We believe this is a prudent regulatory mechanism, which allows for timely investments to enhance customer safety, operational efficiency and grid integrity.
Not many companies have visibility to both a minimum 5-year capital plan and an approved authorized return on that capital. Therefore, the addition of Oncor will provide Sempra even greater visibility to utility earnings growth over the next 5 years.
In addition to the existing 5-year capital plan, Oncor management has identified additional areas of potential investment which would benefit customers, including expansion of a transmission grid and increasing the capacity of existing transmission facilities to accommodate load growth and reduce congestion; expansion into new growth regions in the Dallas-Fort Worth area; expedited deployment of smart grid and other technologies; and hardening of critical infrastructure to mitigate storm and other damage and the cost of restoration.
Please turn to the next slide. As we were contemplating this transaction, the market opportunities we saw led us to believe we could make both companies better in the future. As you can see on the slide, Texas is a leader in energy and holds the #1 spot in many areas. By expanding our business portfolio in the region with the Oncor transaction, we believe we are well positioned to source additional opportunities in the Gulf Coast and Mexican energy market through the strong relationships, market intelligence and experience we have in one of the fastest-growing markets in North America.
Please turn to the next slide where I will discuss our California Utilities recent rate case filing. I briefly mentioned some developments at our California Utilities earlier and would like to take a moment to provide some additional detail. With regard to the 2019 General Rate Case filings, we requested a 19% and 11% revenue requirement increase over estimated authorized 2018 levels for SoCalGas and SDG&E, respectively; 6% to 7% average annual attrition mechanism through 2022, which would result in a 4-year rate case cycle; and projected investments related to our risk assessment mitigation filings, which should help ensure continued safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems and increase our rate base over time. We will work constructively to achieve a fair and timely decision to be implemented in 2019.
Please turn to the next slide. I would like to discuss the impairment that we recorded this quarter related to the cost from the 2007 wildfires. In August, 2 ALJs issued a proposed decision denying SDG&E's request to recover costs previously incurred related to these wildfires. We vehemently disagree with the PD. While this is not a final decision, under applicable accounting guidance, we concluded that the wildfire regulatory asset should be impaired. 
However, based upon the evidence and laws, we believe the commission should rule in our favor. Since this proposed decision, we have had properly noticed ex parte and all party meetings with the CPUC to reiterate our position that the wildfires fall under the construct of inverse condemnation and that as such, these costs should be fully recovered through insurance and rate. California courts have allowed plaintiffs to claim inverse condemnation against SDG&E for the 2007 wildfires. Today, courts have applied inverse condemnation to utilities, in part on the notion that utilities can pass through the cost to ratepayers.
To further support our position, FERC previously approved in full SDG&E's wildfire recovery, considering the inverse condemnation precedent. We will vigorously pursue available avenues to favorably resolve the issue with the CPUC, and if needed, will exhaust all available administrative and court appeals.
Also in light of the recent wildfires in northern California, I want to highlight the proactive steps we've taken over the years to implement a comprehensive fire risk mitigation program to help protect our customers and stakeholders. I'll go through of the few of many examples.
We installed 13,000 new steel distribution and transmission poles with higher strength conductors and increased line spacing beyond the CPUC's requirement. We developed the largest utility weather network in the nation with 170 weather stations, each of which provides real-time weather data, delivering enhanced situational awareness to our utility operation and field personnel. We also provide this data to firefighting agencies. 
We contracted for supplemental firefighting resources, including one of the largest heli-tankers in the world. And like our weather data, we make this resource available to our region. And we developed and implemented an aggressive vegetation management program where we have a database of 460,000 trees that are in close proximity of our lines. We systematically assess, remove and trim vegetation away from our lines and facilities to reduce fire risk.
Now please turn to the last slide. To recap, we've been working diligently to deliver on our value proposition. First, we expect to be at the upper end of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range. Second, we're leveraging our growth drivers to execute additional projects at both our utility and infrastructure businesses to add to future earnings growth. And third, we're advancing Oncor transaction by making substantial regulatory progress, and we're looking forward to adding this strategic growth platform to our business.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions."

Greg, you might recall that when we -- IEnova actually acquired our 50-50 interest -- Pemex's interest in our joint venture, we excluded this particular pipeline because this pipeline was the one that was actually in construction at the time. And as the parties negotiated for the acquisition of Pemex's interest in the joint venture, they were hopeful of getting a price that recognized that the pipe was fully operational and all the construction risk and everything was behind them but that wasn't the case. So we actually pulled this piece of the operation out of that and continued the joint venture while the pipeline was being built. And now that it's fully operational, it's already in service and has much lower risk, we went back to them and they were still interested in selling that interest. And so we struck a deal with them, which is a really good value but probably closer to the lower end of our normal expectations of high single-digit, low double-digit unlevered returns. And that's simply because it has lower risk. It's complete, it's in service and operating and it's a great pipeline and is one of the biggest pipelines taking gas to Mexico from the U.S."

Greg, you pointed it out and we're not completely through the labeled hurricane season. But I think we've made it through and unfortunately for all of you in the northeast, it seems like the weather is moving that way. But the good news is and although we recognize that certainly, a lot of people in the Gulf Coast and across Texas suffered as a result of the storm and we contributed money to the efforts there, the storm had relatively little impact on the actual Cameron LNG site. And as far as the schedule goes Debbie just mentioned that we have no change in the schedule. We did get a claim from the contractor around Hurricane Harvey. It was a name storm so they're allowed to make a claim. But it was rather immaterial, less than a couple of weeks delay so that didn't really change the schedule and an immaterial amount of money related to it. They have told us they might have some additional claims but we don't have information on that. But I think it's pretty well recognize that there wasn't much damage. But we're still on track. Things are going well. They were back on the site working hard within a couple of weeks of the storm. And so that's where we stand."

Obviously, with the situation in northern California and the Napa fires, that this has to be a focus area of the commission. And the laws in California have been pretty clearly determined by the courts to apply to the investor-owned utilities. And these laws rely on the fact that these utilities that provide services for the public interest and have facilities in the public domain would have the ability to recover costs and that therefore, they have strict liability. And that it is something that we will put through the court system if the commission does not rule in our favor. In terms of the cost of capital, I think that's speculative at this time as to how all of this comes out. We look at the risk that we can mitigate. And as I said earlier in my remarks, we have really focused a lot of mitigation efforts to reduce our fire risk in southern California and our service territory. Our insurance -- insurers have told us that we have the absolute best fire mitigation plan that they've seen in the industry. So our focus is on doing what we can control. And that we're hopeful that the commission decides like they did earlier when they granted us the funds for FEMA recovery, which was our cost of restoration from the fire and the FERC granted us full recovery in this. And that it would seem a little odd not to have the same type of recovery with the law in California. But at this point, we'll wait and see what happens when the commission decides."

That negligence is not the standard for inverse condemnation and the laws -- I mean, the courts, in looking at the fire claims, never considered whether there was negligence or gross negligence. They only considered whether our facilities were involved in the fires. And so -- and if that is shown to be the case, that your facilities are involved in the fires, the standard in California's strict liability. And that standard strict liability comes from the view that you can spread those costs across the ratepayers. And it was a law that was really started from municipalities largely, so they have facilities in the public good and that if something flooded or there was an issue, that they could recover those costs across all of the customers in the municipality. The courts in California then interpreted it to apply to the investor-owned utilities as well. So you don't ever get into a negligence standard through the court system on this. And that's the concern that we have with what the proposed decision. It doesn't rely on how the courts determine how inverse condemnation is applied. It's just a different standard that is not the standard that's used by the court to assess whether you have a liability. So that's where we will be fighting that. And we do not believe that -- clearly, FERC saw that and FERC looked at the same set of facts and believed that we were a reasonable utility operator. The very same set of facts in that we were a regional utility operator and that -- so these ALJ-proposed decisions, and I will stress, these are not commission decisions at this point, they are ALJ-proposed decisions, we just see as inconsistent with the law and inconsistent with how the other regulatory agencies looked at the same set of facts."

At our analyst conference, we discussed 2 important strategic goals for Sempra through 2021: first, we exp",1902,"Thanks, Jeff. From time to time, it's important for us to take a step back and talk about how our projects and acquisitions fit within our strategy. At our analyst conference, we discussed 2 important strategic goals for Sempra through 2021: first, we expect to deliver roughly double the long-term earnings growth rate of our utility peers; and second, we plan superior dividend growth of 8% to 9%. These were set before consideration of the significant opportunities we've been executing on this year. 
I'd like to highlight our success in growing our business in the 6 months since our analyst conference. We have captured or filed for approximately $1.9 billion in incremental opportunities that were not part of our plan. We also announced the Oncor transaction, which we expect to be accretive to EPS during our plan period. It also adds a new strategic growth platform in the U.S. while helping us maintain the approximately 75-25 U.S. international earnings mix in our portfolio. And our California Utilities submitted their General Rate Case filings, which seeks significant increases in revenue requirements for 2019 needed to continue providing safe and reliable service to customers.
Please turn to the next slide. Collectively, the new projects add approximately $1.9 billion of additional investment. I would like to highlight our most recent project addition. We announced the pending acquisition of Pemex's 25% equity interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline for approximately $520 million, bringing IEnova's total ownership to 50%. We expect the transaction to close by the end of this year. Most of these projects come online later in 2018 and beyond, and we expect that they will improve our growth in the latter years of our plan. 
We have also seen improved operating performance in cash flows from our core businesses. This improved performance, coupled with the additional projects, should allow us to offset some of the 2019 impact of the previously announced Cameron delay. And just to confirm, there's no change at Cameron as we continue to expect Trains 1 through 3 to be producing LNG in 2019.
As you can see, since the analyst conference, we have developed growth projects across our businesses, and we believe our portfolio mix will allow us to continue to grow earnings at rates roughly double that of traditional utilities while maintaining a utility-light risk profile.
Please turn to the next slide. When you look at our existing platform, it's easy to see how Oncor is a great strategic fit. This business has a strong management team and is focused on achieving above-average growth through transmission and distribution investments that create value for customers and shareholders. Oncor manages a large rate base, similar to our California Utilities, and adding it to our portfolio increases Sempra's U.S.-based utility earnings mix. 
Further, Texas is a constructive business environment with above-average customer and energy use growth. This acquisition provides meaningful expected accretion and also strengthens our expected credit profile in future years, giving us further balance sheet flexibility to continue to invest in growth.
I would like to highlight the last point. From the strengthening credit profile provided by Oncor and the ongoing earnings accretion from the transaction, we expect to have $1 billion to $1.5 billion of credit capacity in the outer years of our plan, which should provide us with approximately the same credit profile as we communicated at our April analyst conference. The credit capacity could be used to return value to our shareholders through funding of additional growth opportunities, increases in planned annual dividend growth, share repurchases or a combination.
Before moving on, I'd like to give an update on where we're at in the regulatory process. We filed our change in control request with the PUC of Texas on October 5, and on October 12, the ALJ and the staff deemed the application sufficient. On October 16, the commission approved a schedule of 180 days to resolve the case by early April.
Now we are responding to data request and we're optimistic that once we address questions and issues identified in the data request, we could work towards constructive settlements with the key intervening parties.
Many of you have asked about our financing and while we can't answer specific questions, I will say that as we execute our financing plan, we will consider our progress on the regulatory front. We will also consider a wide range of financing alternatives, so we can make the best decisions based on market conditions at the time of our capital raises.
Please turn to the next slide. Sempra has a strong presence in the Gulf Coast, with our LNG projects, natural gas storage and IEnova. The addition of Oncor would further strengthen our footprint and serves as a new growth platform to expand our opportunity set. We have a great history of leveraging our platforms and understanding of energy markets to find new opportunities. Examples include development of our current renewables business to meet state RPS standards and planting the roots for IEnova, which started out with a cross-border pipeline in northern Baja and 3 small LDCs. 
Our strategic vision for the Texas Gulf Coast region is to be a major player in these growing energy markets. We expect the addition of Oncor, coupled with our existing presence in the natural gas market, to position us well to be a leading player in the Gulf Coast and cross-border energy markets.
Please turn to the next slide where I'll review Oncor's opportunities in more detail. Oncor recently had its rate case approved, which authorized a new ROE and capital structure, and Oncor made the commitment to spend a minimum of $7.5 billion over 5 years. Their current capital plan forecast is for $8.4 billion and is designed to improve service and reduce cost to customers. 
Some of the things we like about this business are: Oncor is investing in only transmission and distribution projects, so there's no exposure to generation assets, which we believe is the right profile for electric utilities going forward; they are making large investments while maintaining the lowest rates in Texas; and they are authorized to recover costs associated with additional projects that are in the customers' best interest through a tracker mechanism, without additional approval between rate cases. We believe this is a prudent regulatory mechanism, which allows for timely investments to enhance customer safety, operational efficiency and grid integrity.
Not many companies have visibility to both a minimum 5-year capital plan and an approved authorized return on that capital. Therefore, the addition of Oncor will provide Sempra even greater visibility to utility earnings growth over the next 5 years.
In addition to the existing 5-year capital plan, Oncor management has identified additional areas of potential investment which would benefit customers, including expansion of a transmission grid and increasing the capacity of existing transmission facilities to accommodate load growth and reduce congestion; expansion into new growth regions in the Dallas-Fort Worth area; expedited deployment of Smart Grid and other technologies; and hardening of critical infrastructure to mitigate storm and other damage and the costs of restoration.
Please turn to the next slide. As we were contemplating this transaction, the market opportunities we saw led us to believe we could make both companies better in the future. As you can see on the slide, Texas is a leader in energy and holds the #1 spot in many areas. By expanding our business portfolio in the region with the Oncor transaction, we believe we are well positioned to source additional opportunities in the Gulf Coast and Mexican energy market through the strong relationships, market intelligence and experience we have in one of the fastest-growing markets in North America.
Please turn to the next slide where I will discuss our California Utilities recent rate case filing. I briefly mentioned some developments at our California Utilities earlier and would like to take a minute to provide some additional details. With regard to the 2019 General Rate Case filing, we requested a 19% and 11% revenue requirement increase over estimated authorized 2018 levels for SoCalGas and SDG&E, respectively; 6% to 7% average annual attrition mechanism through 2022, which would result in a 4-year rate case cycle; and projected investments related to our risk assessment mitigation filings, which should help ensure continued safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems and increase our rate base over time. We will work constructively to achieve a fair and timely decision to be implemented in 2019.
Please turn to the next slide. I would like to discuss the impairment that we recorded this quarter related to the cost from the 2007 wildfires. In August, 2 ALJs issued a proposed decision denying SDG&E's request to recover cost previously incurred related to these wildfires. We vehemently disagree with the PD. While this is not a final decision, under applicable accounting guidance, we concluded that the wildfire regulatory asset should be impaired. 
However, based upon the evidence and laws, we believe the commission should rule in our favor. Since this proposed decision, we have had properly noticed ex parte and all party meetings with the CPUC to reiterate our position that the wildfires fall under the construct of inverse condemnation and that as such, these costs should be fully recovered through insurance and rate. California courts have allowed plaintiffs to claim inverse condemnation against SDG&E for the 2007 wildfires. Today, courts have applied inverse condemnation to utilities, in part on the notion that utilities can pass through the cost to ratepayers.
To further support our position, FERC previously approved in full SDG&E's wildfire recovery, considering the inverse condemnation precedent. We will vigorously pursue available avenues to favorably resolve the issue with the CPUC, and if needed, will exhaust all available administrative and court appeals.
Also in light of the recent wildfires in northern California, I want to highlight the proactive steps we've taken over the years to implement a comprehensive fire risk mitigation program to help protect our customers and stakeholders. I'll go through of the few of many examples.
We installed 13,000 new steel distribution and transmission poles with higher strength conductors and increased line spacing beyond the CPUC's requirement. We developed the largest utility weather network in the nation with 170 weather stations, each of which provides real-time weather data, delivering enhanced situational awareness to our utility operations and field personnel. We also provide this data to firefighting agencies. 
We contracted for supplemental firefighting resources, including one of the largest heli-tankers in the world. And like our weather data, we make this resource available to our region. And we developed and implemented an aggressive vegetation management program, where we have a database of 460,000 trees that are in close proximity of our lines. We systematically assess, remove and trim vegetation away from our lines and facilities to reduce fire risk.
Now please turn to the last slide. To recap, we've been working diligently to deliver on our value proposition. First, we expect to be at the upper end of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range. Second, we're leveraging our growth drivers to execute additional projects at both our utility and infrastructure businesses to add to future earnings growth. And third, we're advancing Oncor transaction by making substantial regulatory progress, and we're looking forward to adding this strategic growth platform to our business.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions."

Hi, Greg. Hey, you might recall that when we -- IEnova actually acquired our 50-50 interest -- Pemex's interest in our joint venture, we excluded this particular pipeline because this pipeline was the one that was actually in construction at the time. And as the parties negotiated for the acquisition of Pemex's interest in the joint venture, they were hopeful of getting a price that recognized that the pipe was fully operational and all the construction risk and everything was behind them, but that wasn't the case. So we actually pulled this piece of the operation out of that, and continued the joint venture while the pipeline was being built. And now that it's fully operational, it's already in service and has much lower risk, we went back to them and they were still interested in selling that interest. And so we struck a deal with them, which is a really good value, but probably closer to the lower end of our normal expectations of high single-digit, low double-digit unlevered returns. And that's simply because it has a lower risk. It's complete, it's in service and operating and it's a great pipeline and is one of the biggest pipelines taking gas to Mexico from the U.S."

And as far as the schedule goes, Debbie just mentioned that we have no change in the schedule. We did get a claim from the contractor around Hurricane Harvey. It was a named storm, so they're allowed to make a claim. But it was rather immaterial, less than a couple of weeks delay, so that didn't really change the schedule and an immaterial amount of money related to it. They have told us they might have some additional claims but we don't have information on that. But I think it's pretty well recognized that there wasn't much damage. But we're still on track.

Obviously, with this situation in northern California and the Napa fires, that this has to be a focus area of the commission. And the laws in California have been pretty clearly determined by the courts to apply to the investor-owned utilities. And these laws rely on the fact that these utilities that provide services for the public interest and have facilities in the public domain would have the ability to recover cost and that therefore, they have strict liability. And that, it is something that we will put through the court system if the commission does not rule in our favor. In terms of the cost of capital, I think that's speculative at this time as to how all of this comes out. We look at the risk that we can mitigate. And as I said earlier in my remarks, we have really focused on a lot of mitigation efforts to reduce our fire risk in southern California and our service territory. Our insurance -- insurers have told us that we have the absolute best fire mitigation plan that they've seen in the industry. So our focus is on doing what we can control. And that we're hopeful that the commission decides like they did earlier, when they granted us the funds for SEMA recovery, which was our cost of restoration from the fire, and that FERC granted us full recovery in this. And that it would seem a little odd not to have the same type of recovery with the law in California. But at this point, we'll wait and see what happens when the commission decides."

That negligence is not the standard for inverse condemnation and the laws -- I mean, the courts, in looking at the fire claims, never considered whether there was negligence or gross negligence. They only considered whether our facilities were involved in the fires. And so -- and if that is shown to be the case, that your facilities are involved in the fires, the standard in California's strict liability. And so -- and that standard of strict liability comes from the view that you can spread those costs across the ratepayers. And it was a law that was really started from municipalities largely, so they have facilities in the public good and that if they had something flooded or there was an issue, that they could recover those costs across all of the customers in the municipality. The courts in California then interpreted it to apply to the investor-owned utilities as well. So you don't ever get into a negligence standard through the court system on this. And that's the concern that we have with what the proposed decision. It doesn't rely on how the courts determine how inverse condemnation is applied. It sets a different standard that is not the standard that's used by the courts to assess whether you have a liability. So that's where we will be fighting that. And we do not believe that -- clearly, FERC saw that, and FERC looked at the same set of facts and believed that we were a reasonable utility operator. The very same set of facts, in that we were a regional utility operator and that -- so these ALJ-proposed decisions, and I will stress, these are not commission decisions at this point, they are ALJ-proposed decisions, we just see as inconsistent with the law and inconsistent with how the other regulatory agencies looked at the same set of facts."

And what we told you at that time when we looked at the out years of the plan in 2021 is the one that you're providing. All we did is we took the approved rate base that we had, and then we applied the attrition factor that had been approved for the utilities over the life of the plant. So that, that's all we did. And that it did not reflect our regulatory filings. It did not reflect this new process, this risk adjustment mechanism, the ramp that we had to look at risk and then, how do we mitigate those over time with the systematic replacement of key components of the system. And so that -- what you're seeing now is what we had filed for in the rate case that would be our 2022, with the amount of rate base we requested and the attrition mechanisms we requested in the rate case. That is not to say --
[Audio Gap]
All of that, but that is what we've requested. And in that rate case now, we have specific projects and specific activities to consume that capital. When we did it before, all we used is what had been approved with an attrition factor on it. So this gives you greater visibility to what we're looking at in terms of CapEx requirements for the utility. Again, it's our filing. We may not recover all of that, but we think we have great justification for it because it all came out of the process that the commission has asked us to use, which is this risk adjustment process."

And I hope we are able to earn that confidence from the regulators over time. When we looked at the ring-fence and those provisions, we felt it was not significantly different than what we had or how we've operated with our California Utilities under a first priority condition where we have to put capital into those utilities to meet their needs. And so, is it livable? Yes.

We reported year-to-date earnings per share of $2.99 or $3.87 on an adjusted basis. Based on these strong year-to-date results, we expect to be at the upper end of our 2017 adjusted earnings guidance range of $5 to $5.30 per share. On a GAAP basis, our updated 2017 earnings guidance range is $4.13 to $4.43 per share. Excluded from adjusted earnings this quarter was the impairment of SDG&E's wildfire regulatory asset which I will discuss later.
On this call, I want to update you on actions we have taken to implement our growth strategy, including plans to create value from the Oncor transaction. I will also review our General Rate Case filings at our California Utilities and the requested rate base to continue to run safe and reliable systems. 
Before I review each of these, please turn to the next slide, where Jeff will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff?"

As Debbie mentioned, our year-to-date adjusted earnings have been strong and are 11% higher than last year, and the quarterly variances are explained in the business unit summary section. The key takeaway from our results is that we're on track to deliver strong full year earnings. 
And with that, let's move to Slide 7 and I'll turn it back over to Debbie."
120622,540701974,1325623,"Sempra Energy, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 30, 2017",2017-10-30,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Jeff.

At our analyst conference, we discussed 2 important strategic goals for Sempra through 2021: first, we exp",1902,"Thanks, Jeff. From time to time, it's important for us to take a step back and talk about how our projects and acquisitions fit within our strategy. At our analyst conference, we discussed 2 important strategic goals for Sempra through 2021: first, we expect to deliver roughly double the long-term earnings growth rate of our utility peers; and second, we plan superior dividend growth of 8% to 9%. These were set before consideration of the significant opportunities we've been executing on this year. 
I'd like to highlight our success in growing our business in the 6 months since our analyst conference. We have captured or filed for approximately $1.9 billion in incremental opportunities that were not part of our plan. We also announced the Oncor transaction, which we expect to be accretive to EPS during our plan period. It also adds a new strategic growth platform in the U.S. while helping us maintain the approximately 75-25 U.S. international earnings mix in our portfolio. And our California Utilities submitted their General Rate Case filings, which seeks significant increases in revenue requirements for 2019 needed to continue providing safe and reliable service to customers.
Please turn to the next slide. Collectively, the new projects add approximately $1.9 billion of additional investment. I would like to highlight our most recent project addition. We announced the pending acquisition of Pemex's 25% equity interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline for approximately $520 million, bringing IEnova's total ownership to 50%. We expect the transaction to close by the end of this year. Most of these projects come online later in 2018 and beyond, and we expect that they will improve our growth in the latter years of our plan. 
We have also seen improved operating performance in cash flows from our core businesses. This improved performance, coupled with the additional projects, should allow us to offset some of the 2019 impact of the previously announced Cameron delay. And just to confirm, there's no change at Cameron as we continue to expect Trains 1 through 3 to be producing LNG in 2019.
As you can see, since the analyst conference, we have developed growth projects across our businesses, and we believe our portfolio mix will allow us to continue to grow earnings at rates roughly double that of traditional utilities while maintaining a utility-light risk profile.
Please turn to the next slide. When you look at our existing platform, it's easy to see how Oncor is a great strategic fit. This business has a strong management team and is focused on achieving above-average growth through transmission and distribution investments that create value for customers and shareholders. Oncor manages a large rate base, similar to our California Utilities, and adding it to our portfolio increases Sempra's U.S.-based utility earnings mix. 
Further, Texas is a constructive business environment with above-average customer and energy use growth. This acquisition provides meaningful expected accretion and also strengthens our expected credit profile in future years, giving us further balance sheet flexibility to continue to invest in growth.
I would like to highlight the last point. From the strengthening credit profile provided by Oncor and the ongoing earnings accretion from the transaction, we expect to have $1 billion to $1.5 billion of credit capacity in the outer years of our plan, which should provide us with approximately the same credit profile as we communicated at our April analyst conference. The credit capacity could be used to return value to our shareholders through funding of additional growth opportunities, increases in planned annual dividend growth, share repurchases or a combination.
Before moving on, I'd like to give an update on where we're at in the regulatory process. We filed our change in control request with the PUC of Texas on October 5, and on October 12, the ALJ and the staff deemed the application sufficient. On October 16, the commission approved a schedule of 180 days to resolve the case by early April.
Now we are responding to data request and we're optimistic that once we address questions and issues identified in the data request, we could work towards constructive settlements with the key intervening parties.
Many of you have asked about our financing and while we can't answer specific questions, I will say that as we execute our financing plan, we will consider our progress on the regulatory front. We will also consider a wide range of financing alternatives, so we can make the best decisions based on market conditions at the time of our capital raises.
Please turn to the next slide. Sempra has a strong presence in the Gulf Coast, with our LNG projects, natural gas storage and IEnova. The addition of Oncor would further strengthen our footprint and serves as a new growth platform to expand our opportunity set. We have a great history of leveraging our platforms and understanding of energy markets to find new opportunities. Examples include development of our current renewables business to meet state RPS standards and planting the roots for IEnova, which started out with a cross-border pipeline in northern Baja and 3 small LDCs. 
Our strategic vision for the Texas Gulf Coast region is to be a major player in these growing energy markets. We expect the addition of Oncor, coupled with our existing presence in the natural gas market, to position us well to be a leading player in the Gulf Coast and cross-border energy markets.
Please turn to the next slide where I'll review Oncor's opportunities in more detail. Oncor recently had its rate case approved, which authorized a new ROE and capital structure, and Oncor made the commitment to spend a minimum of $7.5 billion over 5 years. Their current capital plan forecast is for $8.4 billion and is designed to improve service and reduce cost to customers. 
Some of the things we like about this business are: Oncor is investing in only transmission and distribution projects, so there's no exposure to generation assets, which we believe is the right profile for electric utilities going forward; they are making large investments while maintaining the lowest rates in Texas; and they are authorized to recover costs associated with additional projects that are in the customers' best interest through a tracker mechanism, without additional approval between rate cases. We believe this is a prudent regulatory mechanism, which allows for timely investments to enhance customer safety, operational efficiency and grid integrity.
Not many companies have visibility to both a minimum 5-year capital plan and an approved authorized return on that capital. Therefore, the addition of Oncor will provide Sempra even greater visibility to utility earnings growth over the next 5 years.
In addition to the existing 5-year capital plan, Oncor management has identified additional areas of potential investment which would benefit customers, including expansion of the transmission grid and increasing the capacity of existing transmission facilities to accommodate load growth and reduce congestion; expansion into new growth regions in the Dallas-Fort Worth area; expedited deployment of Smart Grid and other technologies; and hardening of critical infrastructure to mitigate storm and other damage and the costs of restoration.
Please turn to the next slide. As we were contemplating this transaction, the market opportunities we saw led us to believe we could make both companies better in the future. As you can see on the slide, Texas is a leader in energy and holds the #1 spot in many areas. By expanding our business portfolio in the region with the Oncor transaction, we believe we are well positioned to source additional opportunities in the Gulf Coast and Mexican energy markets through the strong relationships, market intelligence and experience we have in one of the fastest-growing markets in North America.
Please turn to the next slide where I will discuss our California Utilities recent rate case filing. I briefly mentioned some developments at our California Utilities earlier and would like to take a minute to provide some additional details. With regard to the 2019 General Rate Case filing, we requested a 19% and 11% revenue requirement increase over estimated authorized 2018 levels for SoCalGas and SDG&E, respectively; 6% to 7% average annual attrition mechanisms through 2022, which would result in a 4-year rate case cycle; and projected investments related to our risk assessment mitigation filings, which should help ensure continued safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems and increase our rate base over time. We will work constructively to achieve a fair and timely decision to be implemented in 2019.
Please turn to the next slide. I would like to discuss the impairment that we recorded this quarter related to the cost from the 2007 wildfires. In August, 2 ALJs issued a proposed decision denying SDG&E's request to recover costs previously incurred related to these wildfires. We vehemently disagree with the PD. While this is not a final decision, under applicable accounting guidance, we concluded that the wildfire regulatory asset should be impaired. 
However, based upon the evidence and laws, we believe the commission should rule in our favor. Since this proposed decision, we have had properly noticed ex parte and all party meetings with the CPUC to reiterate our position that the wildfires fall under the construct of inverse condemnation and that as such, these costs should be fully recovered through insurance and rates. California courts have allowed plaintiffs to claim inverse condemnation against SDG&E for the 2007 wildfires. Today, courts have applied inverse condemnation to utilities, in part on the notion that utilities can pass through the cost to ratepayers.
To further support our position, FERC previously approved in full SDG&E's wildfire recovery, considering the inverse condemnation precedent. We will vigorously pursue available avenues to favorably resolve the issue with the CPUC, and if needed, will exhaust all available administrative and court appeals.
Also in light of the recent wildfires in northern California, I want to highlight the proactive steps we've taken over the years to implement a comprehensive fire risk mitigation program to help protect our customers and stakeholders. I'll go through of the few of many examples.
We installed 13,000 new steel distribution and transmission poles with higher strength conductors and increased line spacing beyond the CPUC's requirement. We developed the largest utility weather network in the nation with 170 weather stations, each of which provides real-time weather data, delivering enhanced situational awareness to our utility operations and field personnel. We also provide this data to firefighting agencies. 
We contracted for supplemental firefighting resources, including one of the largest heli-tankers in the world. And like our weather data, we make this resource available to our region. And we developed and implemented an aggressive vegetation management program, where we have a database of 460,000 trees that are in close proximity of our lines. We systematically assess, remove and trim vegetation away from our lines and facilities to reduce fire risk.
Now please turn to the last slide. To recap, we've been working diligently to deliver on our value proposition. First, we expect to be at the upper end of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range. Second, we're leveraging our growth drivers to execute additional projects at both our utility and infrastructure businesses to add to future earnings growth. And third, we're advancing Oncor transaction by making substantial regulatory progress, and we're looking forward to adding this strategic growth platform to our business.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions."

Hi, Greg. Hey, you might recall that when we -- IEnova actually acquired our 50-50 interest -- Pemex's interest in our joint venture, we excluded this particular pipeline because this pipeline was the one that was actually in construction at the time. And as the parties negotiated for the acquisition of Pemex's interest in the joint venture, they were hopeful of getting a price that recognized that the pipe was fully operational and all the construction risk and everything was behind them, but that wasn't the case. So we actually pulled this piece of the operation out of that, and continued the joint venture while the pipeline was being built. And now that it's fully operational, it's already in service and has much lower risk, we went back to them and they were still interested in selling that interest. And so we struck a deal with them, which is a really good value, but probably closer to the lower end of our normal expectations of high single-digit, low double-digit unlevered returns. And that's simply because it has a lower risk. It's complete, it's in service and operating and it's a great pipeline and is one of the biggest pipelines taking gas to Mexico from the U.S."

But the good news is, and although we recognize that certainly a lot of people in the Gulf Coast and across Texas suffered as a result of this storm and we contributed money to the efforts there, the storm had relatively little impact on the actual Cameron LNG site. And as far as the schedule goes, Debbie just mentioned that we have no change in the schedule. We did get a claim from the contractor around Hurricane Harvey. It was a named storm, so they're allowed to make a claim. But it was rather immaterial, less than a couple of weeks delay, so that didn't really change the schedule and an immaterial amount of money related to it. They have told us they might have some additional claims but we don't have information on that. But I think it's pretty well recognized that there wasn't much damage. But we're still on track.

Obviously, with this situation in northern California and the Napa fires, that this has to be a focus area of the commission. And the laws in California have been pretty clearly determined by the courts to apply to the investor-owned utilities. And these laws rely on the fact that these utilities that provide services for the public interest and have facilities in the public domain would have the ability to recover cost and that therefore, they have strict liability. And that, it is something that we will put through the court system if the commission does not rule in our favor. In terms of the cost of capital, I think that's speculative at this time as to how all of this comes out. We look at the risk that we can mitigate. And as I said earlier in my remarks, we have really focused on a lot of mitigation efforts to reduce our fire risk in southern California and our service territory. Our insurance -- insurers have told us that we have the absolute best fire mitigation plan that they've seen in the industry. So our focus is on doing what we can control. And that we're hopeful that the commission decides like they did earlier, when they granted us the funds for SEMA recovery, which was our cost of restoration from the fire, and that FERC granted us full recovery in this. And that it would seem a little odd not to have the same type of recovery with the law in California. But at this point, we'll wait and see what happens when the commission decides."

But that we have a lot going on in the Gulf Coast region. People forget sometimes that we have the joint venture with TransCanada to build the Marine Pipeline across the Gulf region to Mexico. We already had -- that's under construction right now. We have some storage development opportunities tied to the LNG facility. We have the pipelines tied to the LNG facility. And then we have the 3 trains at Cameron under construction in Louisiana and then are looking at moving forward with Port Arthur. So this, we feel a lot of opportunity, most of which has been on the gas side. And we think that Oncor also has been talking to their leadership, opportunities -- they've been a little capital constrained, as you might imagine, and have opportunities to invest for the benefit of their customers in areas like technology and in release of congestion that will actually reduce cost to customers, improve service. And we've asked them to start looking at, if they were not in such a capital constrained situation, what more would they be able to do in terms of investments over time? And I think that they're really excited about the opportunities to look at spending time focused on how they grow their business versus dealing with 5 years in a bankruptcy court. So I think there's some great opportunities, Julien."

That negligence is not the standard for inverse condemnation and the laws -- I mean, the courts, in looking at the fire claims, never considered whether there was negligence or gross negligence. They only considered whether our facilities were involved in the fires. And so -- and if that is shown to be the case, that your facilities are involved in the fires, the standard in California is strict liability. And so -- and that standard of strict liability comes from the view that you can spread those costs across the ratepayers. And it was a law that was really started from municipalities largely, so they have facilities in the public good and then if they had something flooded or there was an issue, that they could recover those costs across all of the customers in the municipality. The courts in California then interpreted it to apply to the investor-owned utilities as well. So you don't ever get into a negligence standard through the court system on this. And that's the concern that we have with what the proposed decision. It doesn't rely on how the courts determine how inverse condemnation is applied. It sets a different standard that is not the standard that's used by the courts to assess whether you have a liability. So that's where we will be fighting that. And we do not believe that -- clearly, FERC saw that, and FERC looked at the same set of facts and believed that we were a reasonable utility operator. The very same set of facts, in that we were a regional utility operator and that -- so these ALJ-proposed decisions, and I will stress, these are not commission decisions at this point, they are ALJ-proposed decisions, we just see as inconsistent with the law and inconsistent with how the other regulatory agencies looked at the same set of facts."

From time to time, it's important for us to take a step back and talk about how our projects and acquisitions fit within our strategy. At our analyst conference, we discussed 2 important strategic goals for Sempra through 2021: first, we expect to deliver roughly double the long-term earnings growth rate of our utility peers; and second, we plan superior dividend growth of 8% to 9%. These were set before consideration of the significant opportunities we've been executing on this year. 
I'd like to highlight our success in growing our business in the 6 months since our analyst conference. We have captured or filed for approximately $1.9 billion in incremental opportunities that were not part of our plan. We also announced the Oncor transaction, which we expect to be accretive to EPS during our plan period. It also adds a new strategic growth platform in the U.S. while helping us maintain the approximately 75-25 U.S. international earnings mix in our portfolio. And our California Utilities submitted their General Rate Case filings, which seeks significant increases in revenue requirements for 2019 needed to continue providing safe and reliable service to customers.
Please turn to the next slide. Collectively, the new projects add approximately $1.9 billion of additional investment. I would like to highlight our most recent project addition. We announced the pending acquisition of Pemex's 25% equity interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline for approximately $520 million, bringing IEnova's total ownership to 50%. We expect the transaction to close by the end of this year. Most of these projects come online later in 2018 and beyond, and we expect that they will improve our growth in the latter years of our plan. 
We have also seen improved operating performance in cash flows from our core businesses. This improved performance, coupled with the additional projects, should allow us to offset some of the 2019 impact of the previously announced Cameron delay. And just to confirm, there's no change at Cameron as we continue to expect Trains 1 through 3 to be producing LNG in 2019.
As you can see, since the analyst conference, we have developed growth projects across our businesses, and we believe our portfolio mix will allow us to continue to grow earnings at rates roughly double that of traditional utilities while maintaining a utility-light risk profile.
Please turn to the next slide. When you look at our existing platform, it's easy to see how Oncor is a great strategic fit. This business has a strong management team and is focused on achieving above-average growth through transmission and distribution investments that create value for customers and shareholders. Oncor manages a large rate base, similar to our California Utilities, and adding it to our portfolio increases Sempra's U.S.-based utility earnings mix. 
Further, Texas is a constructive business environment with above-average customer and energy use growth. This acquisition provides meaningful expected accretion and also strengthens our expected credit profile in future years, giving us further balance sheet flexibility to continue to invest in growth.
I would like to highlight the last point. From the strengthening credit profile provided by Oncor and the ongoing earnings accretion from the transaction, we expect to have $1 billion to $1.5 billion of credit capacity in the outer years of our plan, which should provide us with approximately the same credit profile as we communicated at our April analyst conference. The credit capacity could be used to return value to our shareholders through funding of additional growth opportunities, increases in planned annual dividend growth, share repurchases or a combination.
Before moving on, I'd like to give an update on where we're at in the regulatory process. We filed our change in control request with the PUC of Texas on October 5, and on October 12, the ALJ and the staff deemed the application sufficient. On October 16, the commission approved a schedule of 180 days to resolve the case by early April.
Now we are responding to data request and we're optimistic that once we address questions and issues identified in the data request, we could work towards constructive settlements with the key intervening parties.
Many of you have asked about our financing and while we can't answer specific questions, I will say that as we execute our financing plan, we will consider our progress on the regulatory front. We will also consider a wide range of financing alternatives, so we can make the best decisions based on market conditions at the time of our capital raises.
Please turn to the next slide. Sempra has a strong presence in the Gulf Coast, with our LNG projects, natural gas storage and IEnova. The addition of Oncor would further strengthen our footprint and serves as a new growth platform to expand our opportunity set. We have a great history of leveraging our platforms and understanding of energy markets to find new opportunities. Examples include development of our current renewables business to meet state RPS standards and planting the roots for IEnova, which started out with a cross-border pipeline in northern Baja and 3 small LDCs. 
Our strategic vision for the Texas Gulf Coast region is to be a major player in these growing energy markets. We expect the addition of Oncor, coupled with our existing presence in the natural gas market, to position us well to be a leading player in the Gulf Coast and cross-border energy markets.
Please turn to the next slide where I'll review Oncor's opportunities in more detail. Oncor recently had its rate case approved, which authorized a new ROE and capital structure, and Oncor made the commitment to spend a minimum of $7.5 billion over 5 years. Their current capital plan forecast is for $8.4 billion and is designed to improve service and reduce cost to customers. 
Some of the things we like about this business are: Oncor is investing in only transmission and distribution projects, so there's no exposure to generation assets, which we believe is the right profile for electric utilities going forward; they are making large investments while maintaining the lowest rates in Texas; and they are authorized to recover costs associated with additional projects that are in the customers' best interest through a tracker mechanism, without additional approval between rate cases. We believe this is a prudent regulatory mechanism, which allows for timely investments to enhance customer safety, operational efficiency and grid integrity.
Not many companies have visibility to both a minimum 5-year capital plan and an approved authorized return on that capital. Therefore, the addition of Oncor will provide Sempra even greater visibility to utility earnings growth over the next 5 years.
In addition to the existing 5-year capital plan, Oncor management has identified additional areas of potential investment which would benefit customers, including expansion of the transmission grid and increasing the capacity of existing transmission facilities to accommodate load growth and reduce congestion; expansion into new growth regions in the Dallas-Fort Worth area; expedited deployment of Smart Grid and other technologies; and hardening of critical infrastructure to mitigate storm and other damage and the costs of restoration.
Please turn to the next slide. As we were contemplating this transaction, the market opportunities we saw led us to believe we could make both companies better in the future. As you can see on the slide, Texas is a leader in energy and holds the #1 spot in many areas. By expanding our business portfolio in the region with the Oncor transaction, we believe we are well positioned to source additional opportunities in the Gulf Coast and Mexican energy markets through the strong relationships, market intelligence and experience we have in one of the fastest-growing markets in North America.
Please turn to the next slide where I will discuss our California Utilities recent rate case filing. I briefly mentioned some developments at our California Utilities earlier and would like to take a minute to provide some additional details. With regard to the 2019 General Rate Case filing, we requested a 19% and 11% revenue requirement increase over estimated authorized 2018 levels for SoCalGas and SDG&E, respectively; 6% to 7% average annual attrition mechanisms through 2022, which would result in a 4-year rate case cycle; and projected investments related to our risk assessment mitigation filings, which should help ensure continued safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems and increase our rate base over time. We will work constructively to achieve a fair and timely decision to be implemented in 2019.
Please turn to the next slide. I would like to discuss the impairment that we recorded this quarter related to the cost from the 2007 wildfires. In August, 2 ALJs issued a proposed decision denying SDG&E's request to recover costs previously incurred related to these wildfires. We vehemently disagree with the PD. While this is not a final decision, under applicable accounting guidance, we concluded that the wildfire regulatory asset should be impaired. 
However, based upon the evidence and laws, we believe the commission should rule in our favor. Since this proposed decision, we have had properly noticed ex parte and all party meetings with the CPUC to reiterate our position that the wildfires fall under the construct of inverse condemnation and that as such, these costs should be fully recovered through insurance and rates. California courts have allowed plaintiffs to claim inverse condemnation against SDG&E for the 2007 wildfires. Today, courts have applied inverse condemnation to utilities, in part on the notion that utilities can pass through the cost to ratepayers.
To further support our position, FERC previously approved in full SDG&E's wildfire recovery, considering the inverse condemnation precedent. We will vigorously pursue available avenues to favorably resolve the issue with the CPUC, and if needed, will exhaust all available administrative and court appeals.
Also in light of the recent wildfires in northern California, I want to highlight the proactive steps we've taken over the years to implement a comprehensive fire risk mitigation program to help protect our customers and stakeholders. I'll go through of the few of many examples.
We installed 13,000 new steel distribution and transmission poles with higher strength conductors and increased line spacing beyond the CPUC's requirement. We developed the largest utility weather network in the nation with 170 weather stations, each of which provides real-time weather data, delivering enhanced situational awareness to our utility operations and field personnel. We also provide this data to firefighting agencies. 
We contracted for supplemental firefighting resources, including one of the largest heli-tankers in the world. And like our weather data, we make this resource available to our region. And we developed and implemented an aggressive vegetation management program, where we have a database of 460,000 trees that are in close proximity of our lines. We systematically assess, remove and trim vegetation away from our lines and facilities to reduce fire risk.
Now please turn to the last slide. To recap, we've been working diligently to deliver on our value proposition. First, we expect to be at the upper end of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range. Second, we're leveraging our growth drivers to execute additional projects at both our utility and infrastructure businesses to add to future earnings growth. And third, we're advancing Oncor transaction by making substantial regulatory progress, and we're looking forward to adding this strategic growth platform to our business.
With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions."

Hi, Greg. Hey, you might recall that when we -- IEnova actually acquired our 50-50 interest -- Pemex's interest in our joint venture, we excluded this particular pipeline because this pipeline was the one that was actually in construction at the time. And as the parties negotiated for the acquisition of Pemex's interest in the joint venture, they were hopeful of getting a price that recognized that the pipe was fully operational and all the construction risk and everything was behind them, but that wasn't the case. So we actually pulled this piece of the operation out of that, and continued the joint venture while the pipeline was being built. And now that it's fully operational, it's already in service and has much lower risk, we went back to them and they were still interested in selling that interest. And so we struck a deal with them, which is a really good value, but probably closer to the lower end of our normal expectations of high single-digit, low double-digit unlevered returns. And that's simply because it has a lower risk. It's complete, it's in service and operating and it's a great pipeline and is one of the biggest pipelines taking gas to Mexico from the U.S."

But the good news is, and although we recognize that certainly a lot of people in the Gulf Coast and across Texas suffered as a result of this storm and we contributed money to the efforts there, the storm had relatively little impact on the actual Cameron LNG site. And as far as the schedule goes, Debbie just mentioned that we have no change in the schedule. We did get a claim from the contractor around Hurricane Harvey. It was a named storm, so they're allowed to make a claim. But it was rather immaterial, less than a couple of weeks delay, so that didn't really change the schedule and an immaterial amount of money related to it. They have told us they might have some additional claims but we don't have information on that. But I think it's pretty well recognized that there wasn't much damage. But we're still on track.

In terms of the cost of capital, I think that's speculative at this time as to how all of this comes out. We look at the risk that we can mitigate. And as I said earlier in my remarks, we have really focused on a lot of mitigation efforts to reduce our fire risk in southern California and our service territory. Our insurance -- insurers have told us that we have the absolute best fire mitigation plan that they've seen in the industry. So our focus is on doing what we can control. And that we're hopeful that the commission decides like they did earlier, when they granted us the funds for SEMA recovery, which was our cost of restoration from the fire, and that FERC granted us full recovery in this. And that it would seem a little odd not to have the same type of recovery with the law in California. But at this point, we'll wait and see what happens when the commission decides."

That negligence is not the standard for inverse condemnation and the laws -- I mean, the courts, in looking at the fire claims, never considered whether there was negligence or gross negligence. They only considered whether our facilities were involved in the fires. And so -- and if that is shown to be the case, that your facilities are involved in the fires, the standard in California is strict liability. And so -- and that standard of strict liability comes from the view that you can spread those costs across the ratepayers. And it was a law that was really started from municipalities largely, so they have facilities in the public good and then if they had something flooded or there was an issue, that they could recover those costs across all of the customers in the municipality. The courts in California then interpreted it to apply to the investor-owned utilities as well. So you don't ever get into a negligence standard through the court system on this. And that's the concern that we have with what the proposed decision. It doesn't rely on how the courts determine how inverse condemnation is applied. It sets a different standard that is not the standard that's used by the courts to assess whether you have a liability. So that's where we will be fighting that. And we do not believe that -- clearly, FERC saw that, and FERC looked at the same set of facts and believed that we were a reasonable utility operator. The very same set of facts, in that we were a regional utility operator and that -- so these ALJ-proposed decisions, and I will stress, these are not commission decisions at this point, they are ALJ-proposed decisions, we just see as inconsistent with the law and inconsistent with how the other regulatory agencies looked at the same set of facts."

That if you have a fire that your facilities were involved in, the law of the state of California, if it shows that your facilities were involved in that fire, you have strict liability. You don't go to court -- no one claims negligence in court. They claim inverse condemnation, and if it's shown that your facilities were involved, there's a strict liability standard. All the claims that we paid out on our fire had to do with strict liability and inverse condemnation. And that law is created because you were supposed to be able to collect from your customers or if you're a municipality, those in a municipality. So that negligence is not an issue. No one claims, in these cases, negligence. They come in and they claim it's inverse condemnation and that you have strict liability for it. So all of the claims... I'm sorry?"

But I guess what I'm wondering is, and I guess the reason why the question is being asked, I think to a certain degree, because of the recent wildfires is, if it was found that a utility had been negligent in terms of how it was -- I'm not suggesting you guys were involved in that, I'm just suggesting -- I'm just questioning, if that was the case, would that have any impact, in your opinion, on the ability to recover from ratepayers?"

And other utilities don't have that kind of structure. But I think it's something that we have to earn over time with the way that we capitalize that business and ensure that we honor the provisions and that they see that Oncor management really makes the decisions for the best interest of Texas and its customers. And I hope we are able to earn that confidence from the regulators over time. When we looked at the ring-fence and those provisions, we felt it was not significantly different than what we had or how we've operated with our California Utilities under a first priority condition where we have to put capital into those utilities to meet their needs. And so, is it livable? Yes. Would we want to change it over time, with us proving that we were strong owners and that the commission feeling that we should have the same kind of regulatory structure that the other Texas utilities do? When we get to that point, we would look at maybe a way to transition."
