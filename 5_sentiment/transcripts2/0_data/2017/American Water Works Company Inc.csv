And before I turn the call over to Susan, let me briefly talk about the American Water Investor Relations team. As you know, Melissa Schwarzell was promoted recently to a new position in our rates team. And almost at the same time, Cathy DeMots, our IR Executive Assistant, decided to retire after 30 years with American Water. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Melissa and Cathy for all their hard work, dedication and camaraderie during their time in the Investor Relations group.
Now as part of American Water's commitment to developing talent from within, we promoted Ralph Jedlicka, who has been part of the finance team since 2007, to be our new Director of Investor Relations. And then we were lucky to find Kelley Uyeda, a professional with 10 years of IR experience, to be our new Executive Assistant. I'm personally very excited about our new team. Most of you, folks, have already interacted with Kelley and Ralph, and we look forward to meeting you all when we go out on the road on investor visits.
And with that said, now I'd like to turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. We will highlight a number of 2016 company records and achievements throughout our presentation. Just to name a few, we accomplished record levels in safety, capital investment, O&M efficiency and regulated acquisitions. All of these achievements are possible because of our engaged employees, our safe and efficient operations and our smart investments. And this enables us to achieve top-quartile customer satisfaction, continued 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth and top dividend growth.
Our employees delivered another strong year of results by successfully executing our strategy. In 2016, we invested about $1.5 billion, the highest in our company's history. $1.3 billion of that was invested in our regulated systems to improve service reliability and water quality for our customers. We're able to increase our investment to this level because our hardworking employees continually improve both O&M and capital efficiency. We're proud of our ability to deliver on our growth goal while effectively managing every dollar so we can deliver excellent customer service while limiting the impact on our customer's bill. Most importantly, we know our customers need to trust that the water we provide them is clean and is safe. Once again, we met or surpassed EPA requirements in 2016. In fact, our systems were 21x better than the industry in drinking water quality and compliance as measured by the EPA drinking water database. This is absolutely foundational to our business.
Our customer base is growing by a record 82,000 customers through closed and pending regulated acquisitions. This is in addition to the 13,000 customers added from organic growth in our existing service areas in 2016. Our Military Services Group completed 2 price redeterminations in the fourth quarter for a total of $0.75 million in annual fee adjustment.
Keystone Clearwater ended 2016 as we projected. For 2017, natural gas prices have rebounded, and both drilling rig count and well completion activity have increased significantly. Keystone continues to increase market share by offering total water management solutions at competitive pricing to Appalachian Basin E&P. At the same time, they expanded their overall services outside the oil and gas industry to the municipal water services market.
As you can see on Slide 7, operating revenues were $802 million during our fourth quarter. We experienced continued growth in our regulated businesses from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. And while we faced headwinds throughout the year in our military-based -- in our Market-Based Military Services Group, we benefited from 2 price redeterminations in the fourth quarter and 4 in the full year. Linda will discuss the quarter's drivers in more detail in just a few minutes.
Operating revenues for the year increased 4.5% over 2015, and our 2016 annual earnings, without the effect of the Freedom Industries binding agreement in principle, were $2.84 per share, up 7.6% over 2015 EPS.
Turning now to Slide 8. Today, we affirmed our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share and continue our progress towards achieving 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2021. Additionally, we project we will grow our dividend in 2017 at the top of our long-term EPS growth range, following the double-digit growth we have had for dividends over the past 4 years.
In summary, it was another really good year, and we thank all of our employees who made it happen.
With that, Walter will now give his update."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong year all around, with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains [ph] benefit our customers.
Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the fourth quarter 2016. In December, we received an order adjusting rates for Illinois American Water. The case was driven by approximately $340 million in infrastructure investments across Illinois to ensure reliable service. The order will result in $35.2 million in additional annual base rate revenue. Additionally, it included a volume balancing account, which is a
type of revenue stabilization mechanism. I would also like to note that Illinois American Water was rated a Top Water Utility and Customer Satisfaction in the Midwest by J.D. Power.
In West Virginia, we received approval for a distribution system improvement charge, which will enable us to accelerate our infrastructure replacement reliability program. Through DSIC, West Virginia American Water will make approximately $29 million in systemwide upgrades in 2017, which will mean a 40% increase of pipeline replacement from 2016 and only impact our average customer by about $0.52 per month.
We're also awaiting the West Virginia Commission's decision of an agreement related to the PSC's review of the Freedom Industries chemical spill. The settlement recognized the important changes made over the past 3 years to improve customer confidence in the water system. And additional effort is planned in areas like source water monitoring, protection planning and public communication. We believe this resolution is in the best interest of our customers, our employees and our company. As always, we'll continue to bring our customers the best service possible, and we believe that we're positioned to be an industry leader in source water protection and planning.
In addition, California American Water is requesting an extension of its current cost of capital and is awaiting a response from the California Public Utility Commission. This would affect rates starting in January 2018, and of course, we'll keep you updated.
I also want to mention that last week, we announced multiple promotions and state leadership positions. From time to time, we talk about our commitment to developing talent within, leveraging our internal expertise and having robust and sustainable succession plan. Last week was a perfect example of that. Long-time leaders with proven records of accomplishment were promoted to take on new challenges at American Water. Having a strong bench is a critical part of any company's success. We believe that our efforts in this regard have positioned American Water very well for the future from a talent perspective. I congratulate all our newly promoted leaders.
On Slide 11. Our employees drive legislative and regulatory relations, and through their efforts, we made additional progress in 2016. Fair market legislation continues to expand, most recently in Indiana and Pennsylvania. And in the past 5 years, legislation has been enacted in 5 of the states we serve that directly help communities address the stressed water and wastewater system. Our employees will continue to work with state and federal officials to help the nation and our states tackle serious water infrastructure challenges beyond our own company.
Turning to Slide 12. 2016 was also a great year for growth. We added 13,000 customers through organic growth in our existing service areas. And through pending and closed acquisitions, we'll add approximately 82,000 customers in our Regulated Businesses. This includes our newest wastewater customers in Scranton and Dunmore.
We completed the acquisition of Scranton last December, and we were so pleased to welcome 31,000 new customers as well as the new employees who joined our Pennsylvania American Water team.
Moving on to Slide 13. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments, balanced by [ph] efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested more capital this year than in any other, with $1.3 billion going into our Regulated Operations. This is critical to reliable service, but it's also about affordable service. We spoke about this at our Investor Conference. You can see the progress we made on our O&M efficiency ratio, going from 44.2% in 2010 to 34.9% for the last 12 months ending December 2016. We established a new target of 32.5% by 2021. And our success here is 100% due to our employees and a culture of continuous improvement and a commitment to our customers.
For example, in our Pennsylvania operations, we found and repaired more than 5 million gallons per day of unknown non-surface leaks using cell loggers. This technology provides remote alarming and automatic data upload from any location where cell service is available. We estimate that we'll save $75,000 per month in just one operating area. We'll now look to expand this across our footprint, saving money and valuable water for our customers.
Finally, on Slide 14. I just want to highlight some of the examples of how our operations really demonstrate our vision: clean water for life every day. In both New Jersey and Tennessee, we help areas struggling with water source challenges. A local leader in the surrounding county of Bledsoe asked Tenessee American Water if we could help a small community in private wells during the exceptional drought of 2016. We were able to quickly mobilize a water tanker and deliver to the local volunteer fire department. As soon as we arrived, residents were lining up to fill containers for use in their homes.
In New Jersey, we transferred 4 million gallons a day to the northern part of the state under our drought watch. We're able to provide assistance here because of our expansive distribution network and interconnects throughout the state. We're also completing an internal project that will increase our capacity to transfer volumes greater than 10 million gallons a day, in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
In California, our project to remove the San Clemente Dam and reroute to Carmel River was named Green Project of the Year by the American Infrastructure Magazine. This project was a win for the local people and the environment. The removal of the dam and restoration of the river has many benefits, including the recovery of threatened wildlife, the preservation of more than 900 acres of coastal watershed lands and the permanent removal of the public safety were [ph] exposed by the San Clemente Dam.
And of course, we're proud of the excellent water quality results that Susan mentioned. This gives -- these results give our customers confidence in the water they drink and use every day. So it was a great year of growth, smart investments and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda now for more detail on our financial performance."

We reported earnings of $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, up $0.02 over the same quarter last year. As shown on Slide 16, our Regulated segment and Market-Based Businesses were each up $0.01, and",1152,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. We reported earnings of $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, up $0.02 over the same quarter last year. As shown on Slide 16, our Regulated segment and Market-Based Businesses were each up $0.01, and parent was flat to the prior year. For the full year, we reported earnings of $2.62 per share. Excluding the $0.22 charge from the binding agreement, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.84, up $0.20 or 7.6% compared to the prior year. These adjusted results were driven by our Regulated segment, which was up $0.23 or 8.7%. Our Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01, and parent was down $0.02, as expected.
Turning to Slide 17. Let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment compared to fourth quarter last year. Our Regulated Operations were up $0.01 overall. Revenue was up $0.12 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support investment growth, acquisitions and organic growth. O&M expense was higher by $0.05, $0.03 of which was due to timing. As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we expected about $10 million of certain maintenance, repairs and tank painting expenses to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.03 each, driven primarily by our investment growth.
For our Market-Based Businesses, we were up $0.01, mainly from the 2016 addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base in our Military Services Group and price redeterminations at several military bases. We record price redeterminations related to prior periods in the quarter they are completed.
Turning to Slide 18. Let me walk through our 2016 adjusted earnings per share compared to the prior year. The Regulated Businesses adjusted earnings were up $0.23 or 8.7% with 4 major drivers. First, revenue was higher by $0.43 per share. Of this $0.43, $0.32 was from infrastructure surcharges and authorized rate increases to support investment growth. $0.08 was from acquisitions and organic growth, and $0.03 was from balancing account and other.
Second, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.06 from several factors. We had higher production- and employee-related costs to support growth in our business. We also had a $0.05 negative impact from several nonrecurring items, including a judgment on a contract dispute, a technology write-off and the 2015 benefit from finalization of the California general rate case. These increases were partially offset by lower casualty insurance claims and lower uncollectible expense.
Third, depreciation expense increased $0.09 from investment growth. And finally, general taxes, interest and other increased $0.05, again, attributable to our investment in infrastructure to provide reliable service to our customers.
I would also like to point out that although there was no year-over-year weather impact in our Regulated Business, we did have a favorable weather impact of $0.05 in 2016, mainly from the dry weather conditions in New Jersey that Walter discussed.
Next, the Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01 year-over-year. We previously shared with you some headwinds we were facing from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group and Keystone's efforts to manage their business to be earnings-neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market. With that said, the Military Services Group ended the year flat compared to last year. Although revenue was down $21 million due to lower capital upgrades compared to 2015, the impact was offset by the addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base and price redeterminations in the fourth quarter.
In our Homeowner Services Group, revenue was up $11 million compared to last year, but it was more than offset by higher claims, increased marketing expenses and costs associated with investment in a new Homeowner Services Group customer information system. And lastly, Keystone's results for the year were essentially earnings-neutral as we anticipated.
Parent and other costs were higher by $0.02, primarily from higher interest expense on long-term debt, higher short-term debt balances and increased interest rates on short-term debt compared to the prior year. Also in 2016, we contributed $2.3 million to the American Water Foundation, a 501C3 organization which exists to help the communities we serve offer a better quality of life to their citizens.
Turning to Slide 19. We have a total of $125.4 million in annualized new revenue effective since January 1, 2016. This includes $92.2 million of new authorized revenue in 2016, of which about 2/3 was from infrastructure mechanisms with the remaining 1/3 from rate cases. And we have another $33.2 million in new annualized revenues that have been authorized since the beginning of 2017.  We have also filed and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases, a California step increase, and 2 infrastructure surcharge requests, for a total outstanding revenue request of $71.7 million.
Slide 20 highlights our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. You heard Susan and Walter talk about our record level of capital investment this year of $1.5 billion. This includes $1.3 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers. These investments increased our estimated rate base at year end 2016 to $10.7 million, a 7% increase from the prior year. The remaining $200 million was for acquisition, which Scranton, being the largest acquisition, with an adjusted net purchase price of $151 million.
Our cash flow from operations grew 8.2% to $1.3 billion in 2016. This was driven by our strong adjusted net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services business, continuous improvement in collection efforts in our Regulated Businesses, and the timing of expenses. 
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.6%. With the conclusion of our Illinois rate case, including the 45-basis point improvement in the authorized ROE in that state, our weighted average authorized return on equity across our Regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9%. And we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized, and achieved return through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcome.
Turning to Slide 21, and looking forward to 2017. We are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've shown you before, with plus or minus $0.07 of weather, or what we consider normal whether viability being the most significant. Events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ. 
We also continue to be a leader in dividend growth. Compared to the Dow Jones utility average, the UTY and our water utility peers. In fact, over the last 4 years, we have had dividend increases at the top end of our long-term 7% or 10% EPS compound annual growth rate. Subject to Board of Directors approval, we project our 2017 dividend growth to be at the top of that 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth range. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to highlight very beefy our company value of environment the leadership, and what it means to our customers. As a company that relies on environmental protection for the services we provide, American Water is naturally focused on sustainability, not just because it's the right thing to do, which it certainly is, but also because it's our business imperative. It is more than just compliance with laws and regulation, although we are proud that our systems are 21x better than the industry. It extends the partnership's with environmental groups in our local watershed to foster protection and education on water issues. It also means that we are front and center on national policy issues around sustainable water supply, water quality and replacing aging infrastructure. There are approximately 53,000 water treatment plants in the United States, with about 400 of those participating in the EPA and AWWA partnership for safe water program. In 2016, only 33 plants received the President's Award, the program's highest honor. Pennsylvania American Water was awarded 9 of these 33, out of a total of 53,000 water treatment plants. Also in 2016, American Water was recognized by the Environmental Business Journal for our water quality and sustainability, and named by Newsweek as one of America's Top Green Companies. Our efforts has also translated into 8 patents, most dealing with water treatment technology as well as $43 million of research grants awarded over the years. And of course, that is because of the people we haven't American Water. Our R&D group, a 15 employees includes 8 Ph.Ds and 4 people with other advanced degrees. They work hard every day with researchers across the globe to find better ways to sustain, treat, deliver and recycle our precious water resources. And our 6,800 employees, including operation, engineering, water quality and environmental professionals are always finding better way to serve our customers and protect our environment. While awards are good, the best recognition is highly satisfied customers and their peace of mind.

So our Keystone operations are in the Appalachian Basin, and we're only water services provider that does the cycle of water management, except of course, we do not, at the end of the cycle take the ways at the site, and then put them into the deep wells that have been controversial. So because of that, we're finding that more and more of the ENTs want to deploy their capital for their own -- for example, to development of pipeline and for their own services, so we can step in and basically handle, providing the water and recycling the water on the site and they don't have to worry about it. So we've gone from 20% when we purchased them in July 2015 to 35% now. We still believe that we are opportunities for growth in the area and in fact, what we're finding now is that there's so much work in the area that we're seeing some of the pre-kind of 2016 downturn, we're seeing some of the pricing come back for the services, and the need for the large ENT to especially to feel comfortable, that they have a partner who has a very strong commitment to environmental sustainability.

I will start and then Walter can talk about the New Jersey situation. So interestingly at been involved with the part of the Policy Center, working on, looking at the pool infrastructure issue around the administration and their efforts. And it's interesting, there are a lot of parties that are interested. We have a coalition with the U.S. Chamber and NAM and several groups that are looking at this. I think the question is, remains where's the money coming from? So for us in the infrastructure, we are very excited that there is a focus on infrastructure. We like that there is a lot of interest from both sides of the aisle on private-public partnership, so we'll just have to see how that plays out. But the good news for us is regardless of what plays out nationally, we have such a strong capital investment program, and being an investor-owned water utility, we could see above but for us, we're just continuing to do our business, which is robust and as we said, we continue to invest more and more capital. So there could be something down there. We're monitoring it closely and hopefully, we will see something come from that. The last question you asked, and then Walter, can you talk about what's going on in New Jersey with the issue around municipalities -- we are constantly, as we said in Investor Day, we survey the landscape of all municipalities and companies that are out there that meet our guidelines and our discipline in terms of acquisition, but we are very disciplined. So when we look, we don't see the need to grow for the sake of growing, unless it is a good investment for us for the long-term. Our financial models, we're always looking at what all this mean in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and ensuring we have a disciplined around those acquisition, but that doesn't mean we're not looking or that we don't have substantial data and information on these opportunities. It just means that we will not get out there and do something for the sake of just saying we have an acquisition. And I do think, it's interesting, we've been waiting, as you know, following the water industry as long as you have, everybody keeps talking about there will be, no pun intended, floodgates opened, on municipalities to be privatized. But it's a one by one battle. As municipalities have to look at their own particular circumstances, and they did all the options they have available to them. So our entire strategy is we're in these communities, we're on the ground, we're there to be a solutions provider. We think, in many cases, we can provide services at a lower cost, and we believe that we can improve water quality, improve service, and give predictability of cost in many locations better than what is, exists there. And it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we tell our story. And the New Jersey situation is very interesting. Walter, if you want to talk about that."

It's got to work its way to the assembly, obviously, and then get signed by the governor. But what it does is really, requires the same thing for municipalities and investor-owned utilities. Adn let me give you a couple of examples of what they're looking at. The testing fo valves and hydrants for New Jersey, New Jersey Board of Public Utilities requirements, would be not just required of investor-owned but were required of all municipalities within New Jersey. Cyber-security program requirements, action plans for any notice of violation, developing a comprehensive capital, long-term capital plans, and a replacement rate for pipe targeted for about 150 years. These are all the things that we are required to do in the investor-owned side, and it's really going to have the same requirements for municipalities around New Jersey. And the whole purpose is to make sure that the water quality is protected in New Jersey, and that's really the focus of Senator Sweeney [indiscernible]"

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. We will highlight a number of 2016 company records and achievements throughout our presentation. Just to name a few, we accomplished record levels in safety, capital investment, O&M efficiency and regulated acquisitions. All of these achievements are possible because of our engaged employees, our safe and efficient operations and our smart investments. And this enables us to achieve top-quartile customer satisfaction, continued 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth and top dividend growth.
Our employees delivered another strong year of results by successfully executing our strategy. In 2016, we invested about $1.5 billion, the highest in our company's history. $1.3 billion of that was invested in our regulated systems to improve service reliability and water quality for our customers. We're able to increase our investment to this level because our hardworking employees continually improve both O&M and capital efficiency. We're proud of our ability to deliver on our growth goal while effectively managing every dollar so we can deliver excellent customer service while limiting the impact on our customer's bill. Most importantly, we know our customers need to trust that the water we provide them is clean and is safe. Once again, we met or surpassed EPA requirements in 2016. In fact, our systems were 21x better than the industry in drinking water quality and compliance as measured by the EPA drinking water database. This is absolutely foundational to our business.
Our customer base is growing by a record 82,000 customers through closed and pending regulated acquisitions. This is in addition to the 13,000 customers added from organic growth in our existing service areas in 2016. Our Military Services Group completed 2 price redeterminations in the fourth quarter for a total of $0.75 million in annual fee adjustment.
Keystone Clearwater ended 2016 as we projected. For 2017, natural gas prices have rebounded, and both drilling rig count and well completion activity have increased significantly. Keystone continues to increase market share by offering total water management solutions at competitive pricing to Appalachian Basin E&P. At the same time, they expanded their overall services outside the oil and gas industry to the municipal water services market.
As you can see on Slide 7, operating revenues were $802 million during our fourth quarter. We experienced continued growth in our regulated businesses from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. And while we faced headwinds throughout the year in our military-based -- in our Market-Based Military Services Group, we benefited from 2 price redeterminations in the fourth quarter and 4 in the full year. Linda will discuss the quarter's drivers in more detail in just a few minutes.
Operating revenues for the year increased 4.5% over 2015, and our 2016 annual earnings, without the effect of the Freedom Industries binding agreement in principle, were $2.84 per share, up 7.6% over 2015 EPS.
Turning now to Slide 8. Today, we affirmed our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share and continue our progress towards achieving 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2021. Additionally, we project we will grow our dividend in 2017 at the top of our long-term EPS growth range, following the double-digit growth we have had for dividends over the past 4 years.
In summary, it was another really good year, and we thank all of our employees who made it happen.
With that, Walter will now give his update."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong year all around, with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains to benefit our customers.Let's walk through som",1132,"Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong year all around, with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains to benefit our customers.
Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the fourth quarter 2016. In December, we received an order adjusting rates for Illinois American Water. The case was driven by approximately $340 million in infrastructure investments across Illinois to ensure reliable service. The order will result in $35.2 million in additional annual base rate revenue. Additionally, it included a volume balancing account, which is a
type of revenue stabilization mechanism. I would also like to note that Illinois American Water was rated a Top Water Utility and Customer Satisfaction in the Midwest by J.D. Power.
In West Virginia, we received approval for a distribution system improvement charge, which will enable us to accelerate our infrastructure replacement reliability program. Through DSIC, West Virginia American Water will make approximately $29 million in systemwide upgrades in 2017, which will mean a 40% increase of pipeline replacement from 2016 and only impact our average customer by about $0.52 per month.
We're also awaiting the West Virginia Commission's decision of an agreement related to the PSC's review of the Freedom Industries chemical spill. The settlement recognized the important changes made over the past 3 years to improve customer confidence in the water system. And additional effort is planned in areas like source water monitoring, protection planning and public communication. We believe this resolution is in the best interest of our customers, our employees and our company. As always, we'll continue to bring our customers the best service possible, and we believe that we're positioned to be an industry leader in source water protection and planning.
In addition, California American Water is requesting an extension of its current cost of capital and is awaiting a response from the California Public Utility Commission. This would affect rates starting in January 2018, and of course, we'll keep you updated.
I also want to mention that last week, we announced multiple promotions and state leadership positions. From time to time, we talk about our commitment to developing talent within, leveraging our internal expertise and having robust and sustainable succession plan. Last week was a perfect example of that. Long-time leaders with proven records of accomplishment were promoted to take on new challenges at American Water. Having a strong bench is a critical part of any company's success. We believe that our efforts in this regard have positioned American Water very well for the future from a talent perspective. I congratulate all our newly promoted leaders.
On Slide 11. Our employees drive legislative and regulatory relations, and through their efforts, we made additional progress in 2016. Fair market legislation continues to expand, most recently in Indiana and Pennsylvania. And in the past 5 years, legislation has been enacted in 5 of the states we serve that directly help communities address the stressed water and wastewater system. Our employees will continue to work with state and federal officials to help the nation and our states tackle serious water infrastructure challenges beyond our own company.
Turning to Slide 12. 2016 was also a great year for growth. We added 13,000 customers through organic growth in our existing service areas. And through pending and closed acquisitions, we'll add approximately 82,000 customers in our Regulated Businesses. This includes our newest wastewater customers in Scranton and Dunmore.
We completed the acquisition of Scranton last December, and we were so pleased to welcome 31,000 new customers as well as the new employees who joined our Pennsylvania American Water team.
Moving on to Slide 13. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested more capital this year than in any other, with $1.3 billion going into our Regulated Operations. This is critical to reliable service, but it's also about affordable service. We spoke about this at our Investor Conference. You can see the progress we made on our O&M efficiency ratio, going from 44.2% in 2010 to 34.9% for the last 12 months ending December 2016. We established a new target of 32.5% by 2021. And our success here is 100% due to our employees and a culture of continuous improvement and a commitment to our customers.
For example, in our Pennsylvania operations, we found and repaired more than 5 million gallons per day of unknown non-surface leaks using cell loggers. This technology provides remote alarming and automatic data upload from any location where cell service is available. We estimate that we'll save $75,000 per month in just one operating area. We'll now look to expand this across our footprint, saving money and valuable water for our customers.
Finally, on Slide 14. I just want to highlight some of the examples of how our operations really demonstrate our vision: clean water for life every day. In both New Jersey and Tennessee, we help areas struggling with water source challenges. A local leader in the surrounding county of Bledsoe asked Tennessee American Water if we could help a small community in private wells during the exceptional drought of 2016. We were able to quickly mobilize a water tanker and deliver to the local volunteer fire department. As soon as we arrived, residents were lining up to fill containers for use in their homes.
In New Jersey, we transferred 4 million gallons a day to the northern part of the state under our drought watch. We're able to provide assistance here because of our expansive distribution network and interconnects throughout the state. We're also completing an internal project that will increase our capacity to transfer volumes greater than 10 million gallons a day, in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
In California, our project to remove the San Clemente Dam and reroute to Carmel River was named Green Project of the Year by the American Infrastructure Magazine. This project was a win for the local people and the environment. The removal of the dam and restoration of the river has many benefits, including the recovery of threatened wildlife, the preservation of more than 900 acres of coastal watershed lands and the permanent removal of the public safety risk posed by the San Clemente Dam.
And of course, we're proud of the excellent water quality results that Susan mentioned. This gives -- these results give our customers confidence in the water they drink and use every day. So it was a great year of growth, smart investments and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda now for more detail on our financial performance."

As shown on Slide 16, our Regulated segment and Market-Based Businesses were each up $0.01, and",1153,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. We reported earnings of $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, up $0.02 over the same quarter last year. As shown on Slide 16, our Regulated segment and Market-Based Businesses were each up $0.01, and parent was flat to the prior year. For the full year, we reported earnings of $2.62 per share. Excluding the $0.22 charge from the binding agreement, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.84, up $0.20 or 7.6% compared to the prior year. These adjusted results were driven by our Regulated segment, which was up $0.23 or 8.7%. Our Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01, and parent was down $0.02, as expected.
Turning to Slide 17. Let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment compared to fourth quarter last year. Our Regulated Operations were up $0.01 overall. Revenue was up $0.12 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support investment growth, acquisitions and organic growth. O&M expense was higher by $0.05, $0.03 of which was due to timing. As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we expected about $10 million of certain maintenance, repairs and tank painting expenses to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.03 each, driven primarily by our investment growth.
For our Market-Based Businesses, we were up $0.01, mainly from the 2016 addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base in our Military Services Group and price redeterminations at several military bases. We record price redeterminations related to prior periods in the quarter they are completed.
Turning to Slide 18. Let me walk through our 2016 adjusted earnings per share compared to the prior year. The Regulated Businesses adjusted earnings were up $0.23 or 8.7% with 4 major drivers. First, revenue was higher by $0.43 per share. Of this $0.43, $0.32 was from infrastructure surcharges and authorized rate increases to support investment growth. $0.08 was from acquisitions and organic growth, and $0.03 was from balancing account and other.
Second, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.06 from several factors. We had higher production- and employee-related costs to support growth in our business. We also had a $0.05 negative impact from several nonrecurring items, including a judgment on a contract dispute, a technology write-off and the 2015 benefit from finalization of the California general rate case. These increases were partially offset by lower casualty insurance claims and lower uncollectible expense.
Third, depreciation expense increased $0.09 from investment growth. And finally, general taxes, interest and other increased $0.05, again, attributable to our investment in infrastructure to provide reliable service to our customers.
I would also like to point out that although there was no year-over-year weather impact in our Regulated Business, we did have a favorable weather impact of $0.05 in 2016, mainly from the dry weather conditions in New Jersey that Walter discussed.
Next, the Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01 year-over-year. We previously shared with you some headwinds we were facing from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group and Keystone's efforts to manage their business to be earnings-neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market. With that said, the Military Services Group ended the year flat compared to last year. Although revenue was down $21 million due to lower capital upgrades compared to 2015, the impact was offset by the addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base and price redeterminations in the fourth quarter.
In our Homeowner Services Group, revenue was up $11 million compared to last year, but it was more than offset by higher claims, increased marketing expenses and costs associated with investment in a new Homeowner Services Group customer information system. And lastly, Keystone's results for the year were essentially earnings-neutral as we anticipated.
Parent and other costs were higher by $0.02, primarily from higher interest expense on long-term debt, higher short-term debt balances and increased interest rates on short-term debt compared to the prior year. Also in 2016, we contributed $2.3 million to the American Water Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization which exists to help the communities we serve offer a better quality of life to their citizens.
Turning to Slide 19. We have a total of $125.4 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of 2016. This includes $92.2 million of new authorized revenue in 2016, of which about 2/3 was from infrastructure mechanisms, with the remaining 1/3 from rate cases. And we have another $33.2 million in new annualized revenues that have been authorized since the beginning of 2017. We have also filed and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases, a California step increase and 2 infrastructure surcharge requests, for a total outstanding revenue request of $71.7 million.
Slide 20 highlights our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. You heard Susan and Walter talk about our record level of capital investment this year of $1.5 billion. This includes $1.3 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers. These investments increased our estimated rate base at year-end 2016 to $10.7 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year. The remaining $200 million was for acquisition, with Scranton being the largest acquisition with an adjusted net purchase price of $151 million.
Our cash flow from operations grew 8.2% to $1.3 billion in 2016. This was driven by our strong adjusted net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services business, continuous improvements in collection efforts in our Regulated Businesses and the timing of expenses.
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.6%. With the conclusion of our Illinois rate case, including the 45 basis point improvement in the authorized ROE in that state, our weighted average authorized return on equity across our Regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9%. And we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized and achieved return through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcome.
Turning to Slide 21 and looking forward to 2017. We are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've shown you before, with plus or minus $0.07 of weather, or what we consider normal weather variability, being the most significant. Events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ.
We also continue to be a leader in dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility Average, the UTY and our water utility peers. In fact, over the last 4 years, we have had dividend increases at the top end of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate. Subject to Board of Directors' approval, we project our 2017 dividend growth to be at the top of that 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth range.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, I want to highlight very briefly our company value of environmental leadership and what it means to our customers. As a company that relies on environmental protection for the services we provide, American Water is naturally focused on sustainability, not just because it's the right thing to do, which it certainly is, but also because it's our business imperative. It is more than just compliance with laws and regulations, although we are proud that our systems are 21x better than the industry. It extends to partnerships with environmental groups in our local watershed to foster protection and education on water issues. It also means that we are front and center on national policy issues around sustainable water supply, water quality and replacing aging infrastructure. There are approximately 53,000 water treatment plants in the United States, with about 400 of those participating in the EPA and AWWA partnership for safe water program. In 2016, only 33 plants received the Presidents Award, the program's highest honor. Pennsylvania American Water was awarded 9 of these 33, out of a total of 53,000 water treatment plants. Also in 2016, American Water was recognized by the Environmental Business Journal for our water quality and sustainability and named by Newsweek as one of America's Top Green Companies.
Our efforts have also translated into 8 patents, most dealing with water treatment technology, as well as $43 million of research grants awarded over the years. And of course, that is because of the people we have at American Water. Our R&D group of 15 employees includes 8 Ph.Ds and 4 people with other advanced degrees. They work hard every day with researchers across the globe to find better ways to sustain, treat, deliver and recycle our precious water resources. And our 6,800 employees, including operations, engineering, water quality and environmental lab professionals, are always finding better ways to serve our customers and protect our environment. While awards are good, the best recognition is highly satisfied customers and their peace of mind.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

And we're the only water services provider that does the cycle of water management, except, of course, we do not, at the end of the cycle, take the waste at the site and put them into the deep wells that have been controversial. So because of that, we're finding that more and more of the E&Ps want to deploy their capital for their own, for example, development of pipeline and for their own services. So we can step in and basically handle providing the water and recycling the water on the site, and they don't have to worry about it. So we've gone from 20% when we purchased them in July 2015 to 35% now. We still believe that there are opportunities for growth in the area. And in fact, what we're finding now is that there's so much work in the area that we're seeing some of the -- pre-kind of 2016 downturn, we're seeing some of the pricing come back for the services and the need for the large E&Ps especially to feel comfortable that they have a partner who has a very strong commitment to environmental sustainability.

I will start, and then Walter can talk specifically about the New Jersey situation. So interestingly, I've been involved with the Bipartisan Policy Center working on -- looking at the whole infrastructure issue around the administration and their efforts. And it's interesting, there are a lot of parties that are interested. We have a coalition with the U.S. Chamber and NAM and several groups that are looking at this. I think the question is -- remains as where's the money coming from. So for us in the infrastructure, we are very excited that there is a focus on infrastructure. We like that there is a lot of interest from both sides of the aisle on public-private partnerships. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. But the good news for us is regardless of what plays out nationally, we have such a strong capital investment program. And being an investor-owned water utility, we could see above, but for us, we're just continuing to do our business, which is robust, and as we said, we continue to invest more and more capital. So there could be something down there. We're monitoring it closely, and hopefully, we will see something come from that. The last question you asked, and then Walter can talk about what's going on in New Jersey with the issue around municipalities, we are constantly -- as we said in Investor Day, we survey the landscape of all municipalities and companies that are out there that meet our guidelines and our discipline in terms of acquisition. But we are very disciplined. So when we look, we don't see the need to grow for the sake of growing, unless it is a good investment for us for the long term. Our financial models, we're always looking at so what would this mean in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and ensuring that we have a discipline around those acquisitions. But that doesn't mean we're not looking or that we don't have substantial data and information on these opportunities. It just means that we will not get out there and do something for the sake of just saying that we have an acquisition. And I do think, it's interesting, we've been waiting, as you know, following the water industry as long as you have, everybody keeps talking about there will be, no pun intended, floodgates opened on municipalities to be privatized. But it's a one-by-one battle. Municipalities have to look at their own particular circumstances and they -- and all the options that they have available to them. So our entire strategy is we're in these communities, we're on the ground, we're there to be a solutions provider. We think, in many cases, we can provide services at a lower cost, and we believe that we can improve water quality, improve service and give predictability of cost in many locations better than what exists there. And it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we tell our story. And the New Jersey situation is very interesting. Walter, if you want to talk about that."

And let me give you a couple of examples of what they're looking at. The testing of valves and hydrants per New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' requirements would be not just required of investor-owned but required of all municipalities within New Jersey. Cyber-security program requirements, action plans for any notice of violation, developing a comprehensive capital, long-term capital plan and a replacement rate for pipe targeted about 150 years. These are all the things that we're required to do in the investor-owned side, and it's really going to have the same requirements for municipalities around New Jersey. And the whole purpose is to make sure that the water quality is protected in New Jersey, and that's really the focus of Senator Sweeney's bill that he introduced."

And I think one of the things we learned from Flint, Michigan, is safe water is for everybody, and regardless of who provides that water, whether it's private or public, there should be the same standards for safe, clean water, and that we have great wastewater services and sanitation services. So I think that as some of these things have happened, people have realized it doesn't matter who the purveyor is, there needs to be standards that everybody follows, and for us, it's the ability to have a level playing field."

That means that we take on the customers. We begin to integrate them into our system. And generally, from a financial standpoint, during the time frame between when we close and when we get through a final rate case decision, we finance those acquisitions with shorter-term debt, and we would expect these acquisitions to meet certain financial metrics, including being accretive to earnings. And so that is kind of the process that we go through until we file our next rate case decision -- or rate case in the rate case process, then we will, coming out of that process, have our authorized amount that is included in rate base upon which we would earn -- have the opportunity to earn a full return."

At this point, we're just kind of guessing. And I think everybody is pretty much in that situation. We continue, though, to look at investment opportunities regardless NARUC does with the President of NARIC, Rob Powelson, of course.

Now we're starting to see as gas prices are so affordable that, that will probably continue, and we will probably see gas increase. And those of you all who cover electric also know that regardless of what happens with the clean power plant, a lot of plants are already underway and people are already building significant new combined cycle facilities. So we believe that we've turned the corner. We see activity tremendously growing. As I said in my comments, we're seeing rig counts up. We're seeing well completion activities up, along with the natural gas prices. We believe that we're getting back to a more normal -- what that normal is, I think we're going to have to see over the next few months.

And before I turn the call over to Susan, let me briefly talk about the American Water Investor Relations team. As you know, Melissa Schwarzell was promoted recently to a new position in our rates team. And almost at the same time, Cathy DeMots, our IR Executive Assistant, decided to retire after 30 years with American Water. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Melissa and Cathy for all their hard work, dedication and camaraderie during their time in the Investor Relations group.
Now as part of American Water's commitment to developing talent from within, we promoted Ralph Jedlicka, who has been part of the finance team since 2007, to be our new Director of Investor Relations. And then we were lucky to find Kelley Uyeda, a professional with 10 years of IR experience, to be our new Executive Assistant. I'm personally very excited about our new team.

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. We will highlight a number of 2016 company records and achievements throughout our presentation. Just to name a few, we accomplished record levels in safety, capital investment, O&M efficiency and regulated acquisitions. All of these achievements are possible because of our engaged employees, our safe and efficient operations and our smart investments. And this enables us to achieve top-quartile customer satisfaction, continued 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth and top dividend growth.
Our employees delivered another strong year of results by successfully executing our strategy. In 2016, we invested about $1.5 billion, the highest in our company's history. $1.3 billion of that was invested in our regulated systems to improve service reliability and water quality for our customers. We're able to increase our investment to this level because our hardworking employees continually improve both O&M and capital efficiency. We're proud of our ability to deliver on our growth goal while effectively managing every dollar so we can deliver excellent customer service while limiting the impact on our customer's bill. Most importantly, we know our customers need to trust that the water we provide them is clean and is safe. Once again, we met or surpassed EPA requirements in 2016. In fact, our systems were 21x better than the industry in drinking water quality and compliance as measured by the EPA drinking water database. This is absolutely foundational to our business.
Our customer base is growing by a record 82,000 customers through closed and pending regulated acquisitions. This is in addition to the 13,000 customers added from organic growth in our existing service areas in 2016. Our Military Services Group completed 2 price redeterminations in the fourth quarter for a total of $0.75 million in annual fee adjustment.
Keystone Clearwater ended 2016 as we projected. For 2017, natural gas prices have rebounded, and both drilling rig count and well completion activity have increased significantly. Keystone continues to increase market share by offering total water management solutions at competitive pricing to Appalachian Basin E&P. At the same time, they expanded their overall services outside the oil and gas industry to the municipal water services market.
As you can see on Slide 7, operating revenues were $802 million during our fourth quarter. We experienced continued growth in our regulated businesses from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. And while we faced headwinds throughout the year in our military-based -- in our Market-Based Military Services Group, we benefited from 2 price redeterminations in the fourth quarter and 4 in the full year. Linda will discuss the quarter's drivers in more detail in just a few minutes.
Operating revenues for the year increased 4.5% over 2015, and our 2016 annual earnings, without the effect of the Freedom Industries binding agreement in principle, were $2.84 per share, up 7.6% over 2015 EPS.
Turning now to Slide 8. Today, we affirmed our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share and continue our progress towards achieving 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2021. Additionally, we project we will grow our dividend in 2017 at the top of our long-term EPS growth range, following the double-digit growth we have had for dividends over the past 4 years.
In summary, it was another really good year, and we thank all of our employees who made it happen.
With that, Walter will now give his update."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong year all around, with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains to benefit our customers.
Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the fourth quarter 2016. In December, we received an order adjusting rates for Illinois American Water. The case was driven by approximately $340 million in infrastructure investments across Illinois to ensure reliable service. The order will result in $35.2 million in additional annual base rate revenue. Additionally, it included a volume balancing account, which is a
type of revenue stabilization mechanism. I would also like to note that Illinois American Water was rated a Top Water Utility in Customer Satisfaction in the Midwest by J.D. Power.
In West Virginia, we received approval for a distribution system improvement charge, which will enable us to accelerate our infrastructure replacement reliability program. Through DSIC, West Virginia American Water will make approximately $29 million in systemwide upgrades in 2017, which will mean a 40% increase of pipeline replacement from 2016 and only impact our average customer by about $0.52 per month.
We're also awaiting the West Virginia Commission's decision of an agreement related to the PSC's review of the Freedom Industries chemical spill. The settlement recognized the important changes made over the past 3 years to improve customer confidence in the water system. And additional effort is planned in areas like source water monitoring, protection planning and public communication. We believe this resolution is in the best interest of our customers, our employees and our company. As always, we'll continue to bring our customers the best service possible, and we believe that we're positioned to be an industry leader in source water protection and planning.
In addition, California American Water is requesting an extension of its current cost of capital and is awaiting a response from the California Public Utility Commission. This would affect rates starting in January 2018, and of course, we'll keep you updated.
I also want to mention that last week, we announced multiple promotions and state leadership positions. From time to time, we talk about our commitment to developing talent within, leveraging our internal expertise and having robust and sustainable succession plan. Last week was a perfect example of that. Long-time leaders with proven records of accomplishment were promoted to take on new challenges at American Water. Having a strong bench is a critical part of any company's success. We believe that our efforts in this regard have positioned American Water very well for the future from a talent perspective. I congratulate all our newly promoted leaders.
On Slide 11. Our employees drive legislative and regulatory relations, and through their efforts, we made additional progress in 2016. Fair market legislation continues to expand, most recently in Indiana and Pennsylvania. And in the past 5 years, legislation has been enacted in 5 of the states we serve that directly help communities address the stressed water and wastewater system. Our employees will continue to work with state and federal officials to help the nation and our states tackle serious water infrastructure challenges beyond our own company.
Turning to Slide 12. 2016 was also a great year for growth. We added 13,000 customers through organic growth in our existing service areas. And through pending and closed acquisitions, we'll add approximately 82,000 customers in our Regulated Businesses. This includes our newest wastewater customers in Scranton and Dunmore.
We completed the acquisition of Scranton last December, and we were so pleased to welcome 31,000 new customers as well as the new employees who joined our Pennsylvania American Water team.
Moving on to Slide 13. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested more capital this year than in any other, with $1.3 billion going into our Regulated Operations. This is critical to reliable service, but it's also about affordable service. We spoke about this at our Investor Conference. You can see the progress we made on our O&M efficiency ratio, going from 44.2% in 2010 to 34.9% for the last 12 months ending December 2016. We established a new target of 32.5% by 2021. And our success here is 100% due to our employees and a culture of continuous improvement and a commitment to our customers.
For example, in our Pennsylvania operations, we found and repaired more than 5 million gallons per day of unknown non-surface leaks using cell loggers. This technology provides remote alarming and automatic data upload from any location where cell service is available. We estimate that we'll save $75,000 per month in just one operating area. We'll now look to expand this across our footprint, saving money and valuable water for our customers.
Finally, on Slide 14. I just want to highlight some of the examples of how our operations really demonstrate our vision: clean water for life every day. In both New Jersey and Tennessee, we help areas struggling with water source challenges. A local leader in the surrounding county of Bledsoe asked Tennessee American Water if we could help a small community in private wells during the exceptional drought of 2016. We were able to quickly mobilize a water tanker and deliver to the local volunteer fire department. As soon as we arrived, residents were lining up to fill containers for use in their homes.
In New Jersey, we transferred 4 million gallons a day to the northern part of the state under a drought watch. We're able to provide assistance here because of our expansive distribution network and interconnects throughout the state. We're also completing an internal project that will increase our capacity to transfer volumes greater than 10 million gallons a day, in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
In California, our project to remove the San Clemente Dam and reroute to Carmel River was named Green Project of the Year by the American Infrastructure Magazine. This project was a win for the local people and the environment. The removal of the dam and restoration of the river has many benefits, including the recovery of threatened wildlife, the preservation of more than 900 acres of coastal watershed lands and the permanent removal of the public safety risk posed by the San Clemente Dam.
And of course, we're proud of the excellent water quality results that Susan mentioned. This gives -- these results give our customers confidence in the water they drink and use every day. So it was a great year of growth, smart investments and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda now for more detail on our financial performance."

As shown on Slide 16, our Regulated segment and Market-Based Businesses were each up $0.01, and parent was flat to the prior year. For the full year, we reported earnings of $2.62 per share. Excluding the $0.22 charge from the binding agreement, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.84, up $0.20 or 7.6% compared to the prior year. These adjusted results were driven by our Regulated segment, which was up $0.23 or 8.7%. Our Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01, and parent was down $0.02, as expected.
Turning to Slide 17. Let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment compared to fourth quarter last year. Our Regulated Operations were up $0.01 overall. Revenue was up $0.12 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support investment growth, acquisitions and organic growth. O&M expense was higher by $0.05, $0.03 of which was due to timing. As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we expected about $10 million of certain maintenance, repairs and tank painting expenses to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.03 each, driven primarily by our investment growth.
For our Market-Based Businesses, we were up $0.01, mainly from the 2016 addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base in our Military Services Group and price redeterminations at several military bases. We record price redeterminations related to prior periods in the quarter they are completed.
Turning to Slide 18. Let me walk through our 2016 adjusted earnings per share compared to the prior year. The Regulated Businesses adjusted earnings were up $0.23 or 8.7% with 4 major drivers. First, revenue was higher by $0.43 per share. Of this $0.43, $0.32 was from infrastructure surcharges and authorized rate increases to support investment growth. $0.08 was from acquisitions and organic growth, and $0.03 was from balancing account and other.
Second, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.06 from several factors. We had higher production- and employee-related costs to support growth in our business. We also had a $0.05 negative impact from several nonrecurring items, including a judgment on a contract dispute, a technology write-off and the 2015 benefit from finalization of the California general rate case. These increases were partially offset by lower casualty insurance claims and lower uncollectible expense.
Third, depreciation expense increased $0.09 from investment growth. And finally, general taxes, interest and other increased $0.05, again, attributable to our investment in infrastructure to provide reliable service to our customers.
I would also like to point out that although there was no year-over-year weather impact in our Regulated Business, we did have a favorable weather impact of $0.05 in 2016, mainly from the dry weather conditions in New Jersey that Walter discussed.
Next, the Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01 year-over-year. We previously shared with you some headwinds we were facing from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group and Keystone's efforts to manage their business to be earnings-neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market. With that said, the Military Services Group ended the year flat compared to last year. Although revenue was down $21 million due to lower capital upgrades compared to 2015, the impact was offset by the addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base and price redeterminations in the fourth quarter.
In our Homeowner Services Group, revenue was up $11 million compared to last year, but it was more than offset by higher claims, increased marketing expenses and costs associated with investment in a new Homeowner Services Group customer information system. And lastly, Keystone's results for the year were essentially earnings-neutral as we anticipated.
Parent and other costs were higher by $0.02, primarily from higher interest expense on long-term debt, higher short-term debt balances and increased interest rates on short-term debt compared to the prior year. Also in 2016, we contributed $2.3 million to the American Water Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization which exists to help the communities we serve offer a better quality of life to their citizens.
Turning to Slide 19. We have a total of $125.4 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of 2016. This includes $92.2 million of new authorized revenue in 2016, of which about 2/3 was from infrastructure mechanisms, with the remaining 1/3 from rate cases. And we have another $33.2 million in new annualized revenues that have been authorized since the beginning of 2017. We have also filed and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases, a California step increase and 2 infrastructure surcharge requests, for a total outstanding revenue request of $71.7 million.
Slide 20 highlights our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. You heard Susan and Walter talk about our record level of capital investment this year of $1.5 billion. This includes $1.3 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers. These investments increased our estimated rate base at year-end 2016 to $10.7 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year. The remaining $200 million was for acquisition, with Scranton being the largest acquisition with an adjusted net purchase price of $151 million.
Our cash flow from operations grew 8.2% to $1.3 billion in 2016. This was driven by our strong adjusted net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services business, continuous improvements in collection efforts in our Regulated Businesses and the timing of expenses.
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.6%. With the conclusion of our Illinois rate case, including the 45 basis point improvement in the authorized ROE in that state, our weighted average authorized return on equity across our Regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9%. And we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized and achieved return through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcome.
Turning to Slide 21 and looking forward to 2017. We are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've shown you before, with plus or minus $0.07 of weather, or what we consider normal weather variability, being the most significant. Events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ.
We also continue to be a leader in dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility Average, the UTY and our water utility peers. In fact, over the last 4 years, we have had dividend increases at the top end of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate. Subject to Board of Directors' approval, we project our 2017 dividend growth to be at the top of that 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth range.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, I want to highlight very briefly our company value of environmental leadership and what it means to our customers. As a company that relies on environmental protection for the services we provide, American Water is naturally focused on sustainability, not just because it's the right thing to do, which it certainly is, but also because it's our business imperative. It is more than just compliance with laws and regulations, although we are proud that our systems are 21x better than the industry. It extends to partnerships with environmental groups in our local watershed to foster protection and education on water issues. It also means that we are front and center on national policy issues around sustainable water supply, water quality and replacing aging infrastructure. There are approximately 53,000 water treatment plants in the United States, with about 400 of those participating in the EPA and AWWA partnership for safe water program. In 2016, only 33 plants received the Presidents Award, the program's highest honor. Pennsylvania American Water was awarded 9 of these 33, out of a total of 53,000 water treatment plants. Also in 2016, American Water was recognized by the Environmental Business Journal for our water quality and sustainability and named by Newsweek as one of America's Top Green Companies.
Our efforts have also translated into 8 patents, most dealing with water treatment technology, as well as $43 million of research grants awarded over the years. And of course, that is because of the people we have at American Water. Our R&D group of 15 employees includes 8 Ph.Ds and 4 people with other advanced degrees. They work hard every day with researchers across the globe to find better ways to sustain, treat, deliver and recycle our precious water resources. And our 6,800 employees, including operations, engineering, water quality and environmental lab professionals, are always finding better ways to serve our customers and protect our environment. While awards are good, the best recognition is highly satisfied customers and their peace of mind.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So our Keystone clearstone operations are in the Appalachian Basin. And we're the only water services provider that does the cycle of water management, except, of course, we do not, at the end of the cycle, take the waste at the site and put them into the deep wells that have been controversial. So because of that, we're finding that more and more of the E&Ps want to deploy their capital for their own, for example, development of pipeline and for their own services. So we can step in and basically handle providing the water and recycling the water on the site, and they don't have to worry about it. So we've gone from 20% when we purchased them in July 2015 to 35% now. We still believe that there are opportunities for growth in the area. And in fact, what we're finding now is that there's so much work in the area that we're seeing some of the -- pre-kind of 2016 downturn, we're seeing some of the pricing come back for the services and the need for the large E&Ps especially to feel comfortable that they have a partner who has a very strong commitment to environmental sustainability. So we do think that there is further room to grow in Appalachian Basin."

One of the big advantages we have as a company is we're able to deploy technology in one area, take the learnings of that technology and then apply it across American Water and realize significant value. So I would say the technology I highlighted, the technologies I highlighted in the past around non-revenue water and finding leaks in West Virginia, doing things like using technology to streamline our routes so that our people in the field are more efficient, those are the things we're going to be doing across American Water to drive efficiencies. And a lot of the low-hanging fruit we've already gotten, but the technologies are going to be a key enabler."

I will start, and then Walter can talk specifically about the New Jersey situation. So interestingly, I've been involved with the Bipartisan Policy Center working on -- looking at the whole infrastructure issue around the administration and their efforts. And it's interesting, there are a lot of parties that are interested. We have a coalition with the U.S. Chamber and NAM and several groups that are looking at this. I think the question is -- remains is where's the money coming from. So for us in the infrastructure, we are very excited that there is a focus on infrastructure. We like that there is a lot of interest from both sides of the aisle on public-private partnerships. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. But the good news for us is regardless of what plays out nationally, we have such a strong capital investment program. And being an investor-owned water utility, we could see a bump, but for us, we're just continuing to do our business, which is robust, and as we said, we continue to invest more and more capital. So there could be something down there. We're monitoring it closely, and hopefully, we will see something come from that. The last question you asked, and then Walter can talk about what's going on in New Jersey with the issue around municipalities, we are constantly -- as we said in Investor Day, we survey the landscape of all municipalities and companies that are out there that meet our guidelines and our discipline in terms of acquisition. But we are very disciplined. So when we look, we don't see the need to grow for the sake of growing, unless it is a good investment for us for the long term. Our financial models, we're always looking at so what would this mean in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and ensuring that we have a discipline around those acquisitions. But that doesn't mean we're not looking or that we don't have substantial data and information on these opportunities. It just means that we will not get out there and do something for the sake of just saying that we have an acquisition. And I do think, it's interesting, we've been waiting, as you know, following the water industry as long as you have, everybody keeps talking about there will be, no pun intended, floodgates opened on municipalities to be privatized. But it's a one-by-one battle. Municipalities have to look at their own particular circumstances and they -- and all the options that they have available to them. So our entire strategy is we're in these communities, we're on the ground, we're there to be a solutions provider. We think, in many cases, we can provide services at a lower cost, and we believe that we can improve water quality, improve service and give predictability of cost in many locations better than what exists there. And it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we tell our story. And the New Jersey situation is very interesting. Walter, if you want to talk about that."

And let me give you a couple of examples of what they're looking at. The testing of valves and hydrants per New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' requirements would be not just required of investor-owned but required of all municipalities within New Jersey. Cyber-security program requirements, action plans for any notice of violation, developing a comprehensive capital, long-term capital plan and a replacement rate for pipe targeted about 150 years. These are all the things that we're required to do in the investor-owned side, and it's really going to have the same requirements for municipalities around New Jersey. And the whole purpose is to make sure that the water quality is protected in New Jersey, and that's really the focus of Senator Sweeney's bill that he introduced."

I mean, you can just look at natural gas prices even though they've come down a bit because of the really warm weather we've had this winter, we know that, of course, going into the summer -- 2015 natural gas was 33% of power generation, coal was 33%, nuclear was 20%. Now we're starting to see as gas prices are so affordable that, that will probably continue, and we will probably see gas increase. And those of you all who cover electric also know that regardless of what happens with the clean power plant, a lot of plans are already underway and people are already building significant new combined cycle facilities. So we believe that we've turned the corner. We see activity tremendously growing. As I said in my comments, we're seeing rig counts up. We're seeing well completion activities up, along with the natural gas prices. We believe that we're getting back to a more normal -- what that normal is, I think we're going to have to see over the next few months. And we'll continue at our quarterly discussions to say is it higher than we thought or less than we thought, but we do, as we always are, want to be conservative and make sure that we have a few more months under us to see what can we look at that's more predictable.

And before I turn the call over to Susan, let me briefly talk about the American Water Investor Relations team. As you know, Melissa Schwarzell was promoted recently to a new position in our rates team. And almost at the same time, Cathy DeMots, our IR Executive Assistant, decided to retire after 30 years with American Water. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Melissa and Cathy for all their hard work, dedication and camaraderie during their time in the Investor Relations group.
Now as part of American Water's commitment to developing talent from within, we promoted Ralph Jedlicka, who has been part of the finance team since 2007, to be our new Director of Investor Relations. And then we were lucky to find Kelley Uyeda, a professional with 10 years of IR experience, to be our new Executive Assistant. I'm personally very excited about our new team. Most of you folks have already interacted with Kelley and Ralph, and we look forward to meeting you all when we go out on the road on investor visits.

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. We will highlight a number of 2016 company records and achievements throughout our presentation. Just to name a few, we accomplished record levels in safety, capital investment, O&M efficiency and regulated acquisitions. All of these achievements are possible because of our engaged employees, our safe and efficient operations and our smart investments. And this enables us to achieve top-quartile customer satisfaction, continued 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth and top dividend growth.
Our employees delivered another strong year of results by successfully executing our strategy. In 2016, we invested about $1.5 billion, the highest in our company's history. $1.3 billion of that was invested in our regulated systems to improve service reliability and water quality for our customers. We're able to increase our investment to this level because our hardworking employees continually improve both O&M and capital efficiency. We're proud of our ability to deliver on our growth goal while effectively managing every dollar so we can deliver excellent customer service while limiting the impact on our customer's bill. Most importantly, we know our customers need to trust that the water we provide them is clean and is safe. Once again, we met or surpassed EPA requirements in 2016. In fact, our systems were 21x better than the industry in drinking water quality and compliance as measured by the EPA drinking water database. This is absolutely foundational to our business.
Our customer base is growing by a record 82,000 customers through closed and pending regulated acquisitions. This is in addition to the 13,000 customers added from organic growth in our existing service areas in 2016. Our Military Services Group completed 2 price redeterminations in the fourth quarter for a total of $0.75 million in annual fee adjustment.
Keystone Clearwater ended 2016 as we projected. For 2017, natural gas prices have rebounded, and both drilling rig count and well completion activity have increased significantly. Keystone continues to increase market share by offering total water management solutions at competitive pricing to Appalachian Basin E&P. At the same time, they expanded their overall services outside the oil and gas industry to the municipal water services market.
As you can see on Slide 7, operating revenues were $802 million during our fourth quarter. We experienced continued growth in our regulated businesses from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. And while we faced headwinds throughout the year in our military-based -- in our Market-Based Military Services Group, we benefited from 2 price redeterminations in the fourth quarter and 4 in the full year. Linda will discuss the quarter's drivers in more detail in just a few minutes.
Operating revenues for the year increased 4.5% over 2015, and our 2016 annual earnings, without the effect of the Freedom Industries binding agreement in principle, were $2.84 per share, up 7.6% over 2015 EPS.
Turning now to Slide 8. Today, we affirmed our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share and continue our progress towards achieving 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2021. Additionally, we project we will grow our dividend in 2017 at the top of our long-term EPS growth range, following the double-digit growth we have had for dividends over the past 4 years.
In summary, it was another really good year, and we thank all of our employees who made it happen.
With that, Walter will now give his update."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong year all around, with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains to benefit our customers.
Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the fourth quarter 2016. In December, we received an order adjusting rates for Illinois American Water. The case was driven by approximately $340 million in infrastructure investments across Illinois to ensure reliable service. The order will result in $35.2 million in additional annual base rate revenue. Additionally, it included a volume balancing account, which is a
type of revenue stabilization mechanism. I would also like to note that Illinois American Water was rated a Top Water Utility in Customer Satisfaction in the Midwest by J.D. Power.
In West Virginia, we received approval for a distribution system improvement charge, which will enable us to accelerate our infrastructure replacement reliability program. Through DSIC, West Virginia American Water will make approximately $29 million in systemwide upgrades in 2017, which will mean a 40% increase of pipeline replacement from 2016 and only impact our average customer by about $0.52 per month.
We're also awaiting the West Virginia Commission's decision of an agreement related to the PSC's review of the Freedom Industries chemical spill. The settlement recognized the important changes made over the past 3 years to improve customer confidence in the water system. And additional effort is planned in areas like source water monitoring, protection planning and public communication. We believe this resolution is in the best interest of our customers, our employees and our company. As always, we'll continue to bring our customers the best service possible, and we believe that we're positioned to be an industry leader in source water protection and planning.
In addition, California American Water is requesting an extension of its current cost of capital and is awaiting a response from the California Public Utility Commission. This would affect rates starting in January 2018, and of course, we'll keep you updated.
I also want to mention that last week, we announced multiple promotions and state leadership positions. From time to time, we talk about our commitment to developing talent within, leveraging our internal expertise and having robust and sustainable succession plan. Last week was a perfect example of that. Long-time leaders with proven records of accomplishment were promoted to take on new challenges at American Water. Having a strong bench is a critical part of any company's success. We believe that our efforts in this regard have positioned American Water very well for the future from a talent perspective. I congratulate all our newly promoted leaders.
On Slide 11. Our employees drive legislative and regulatory relations, and through their efforts, we made additional progress in 2016. Fair market legislation continues to expand, most recently in Indiana and Pennsylvania. And in the past 5 years, legislation has been enacted in 5 of the states we serve that directly help communities address the stressed water and wastewater system. Our employees will continue to work with state and federal officials to help the nation and our states tackle serious water infrastructure challenges beyond our own company.
Turning to Slide 12. 2016 was also a great year for growth. We added 13,000 customers through organic growth in our existing service areas. And through pending and closed acquisitions, we'll add approximately 82,000 customers in our Regulated Businesses. This includes our newest wastewater customers in Scranton and Dunmore.
We completed the acquisition of Scranton last December, and we were so pleased to welcome 31,000 new customers as well as the new employees who joined our Pennsylvania American Water team.
Moving on to Slide 13. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested more capital this year than in any other, with $1.3 billion going into our Regulated Operations. This is critical to reliable service, but it's also about affordable service. We spoke about this at our Investor Conference. You can see the progress we made on our O&M efficiency ratio, going from 44.2% in 2010 to 34.9% for the last 12 months ending December 2016. We established a new target of 32.5% by 2021. And our success here is 100% due to our employees and a culture of continuous improvement and a commitment to our customers.
For example, in our Pennsylvania operations, we found and repaired more than 5 million gallons per day of unknown non-surface leaks using cell loggers. This technology provides remote alarming and automatic data upload from any location where cell service is available. We estimate that we'll save $75,000 per month in just one operating area. We'll now look to expand this across our footprint, saving money and valuable water for our customers.
Finally, on Slide 14. I just want to highlight some of the examples of how our operations really demonstrate our vision: clean water for life every day. In both New Jersey and Tennessee, we help areas struggling with water source challenges. A local leader in the surrounding county of Bledsoe asked Tennessee American Water if we could help a small community in private wells during the exceptional drought of 2016. We were able to quickly mobilize a water tanker and deliver to the local volunteer fire department. As soon as we arrived, residents were lining up to fill containers for use in their homes.
In New Jersey, we transferred 4 million gallons a day to the northern part of the state under a drought watch. We're able to provide assistance here because of our expansive distribution network and interconnects throughout the state. We're also completing an internal project that will increase our capacity to transfer volumes greater than 10 million gallons a day, in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
In California, our project to remove the San Clemente Dam and reroute to Carmel River was named Green Project of the Year by the American Infrastructure Magazine. This project was a win for the local people and the environment. The removal of the dam and restoration of the river has many benefits, including the recovery of threatened wildlife, the preservation of more than 900 acres of coastal watershed lands and the permanent removal of the public safety risk posed by the San Clemente Dam.
And of course, we're proud of the excellent water quality results that Susan mentioned. This gives -- these results give our customers confidence in the water they drink and use every day. So it was a great year of growth, smart investments and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda now for more detail on our financial performance."

We reported earnings of $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, up $0.02 over the same quarter last year. As shown on Slide 16, our Regulated segment and Market-Based Businesses were each up $0.01, and",1153,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. We reported earnings of $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, up $0.02 over the same quarter last year. As shown on Slide 16, our Regulated segment and Market-Based Businesses were each up $0.01, and parent was flat to the prior year. For the full year, we reported earnings of $2.62 per share. Excluding the $0.22 charge from the binding agreement, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.84, up $0.20 or 7.6% compared to the prior year. These adjusted results were driven by our Regulated segment, which was up $0.23 or 8.7%. Our Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01, and parent was down $0.02, as expected.
Turning to Slide 17. Let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment compared to fourth quarter last year. Our Regulated Operations were up $0.01 overall. Revenue was up $0.12 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support investment growth, acquisitions and organic growth. O&M expense was higher by $0.05, $0.03 of which was due to timing. As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we expected about $10 million of certain maintenance, repairs and tank painting expenses to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.03 each, driven primarily by our investment growth.
For our Market-Based Businesses, we were up $0.01, mainly from the 2016 addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base in our Military Services Group and price redeterminations at several military bases. We record price redeterminations related to prior periods in the quarter they are completed.
Turning to Slide 18. Let me walk through our 2016 adjusted earnings per share compared to the prior year. The Regulated Businesses adjusted earnings were up $0.23 or 8.7% with 4 major drivers. First, revenue was higher by $0.43 per share. Of this $0.43, $0.32 was from infrastructure surcharges and authorized rate increases to support investment growth. $0.08 was from acquisitions and organic growth, and $0.03 was from balancing account and other.
Second, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.06 from several factors. We had higher production- and employee-related costs to support growth in our business. We also had a $0.05 negative impact from several nonrecurring items, including a judgment on a contract dispute, a technology write-off and the 2015 benefit from finalization of the California general rate case. These increases were partially offset by lower casualty insurance claims and lower uncollectible expense.
Third, depreciation expense increased $0.09 from investment growth. And finally, general taxes, interest and other increased $0.05, again, attributable to our investment in infrastructure to provide reliable service to our customers.
I would also like to point out that although there was no year-over-year weather impact in our Regulated Business, we did have a favorable weather impact of $0.05 in 2016, mainly from the dry weather conditions in New Jersey that Walter discussed.
Next, the Market-Based Businesses were down $0.01 year-over-year. We previously shared with you some headwinds we were facing from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group and Keystone's efforts to manage their business to be earnings-neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market. With that said, the Military Services Group ended the year flat compared to last year. Although revenue was down $21 million due to lower capital upgrades compared to 2015, the impact was offset by the addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base and price redeterminations in the fourth quarter.
In our Homeowner Services Group, revenue was up $11 million compared to last year, but it was more than offset by higher claims, increased marketing expenses and costs associated with investment in a new Homeowner Services Group customer information system. And lastly, Keystone's results for the year were essentially earnings-neutral as we anticipated.
Parent and other costs were higher by $0.02, primarily from higher interest expense on long-term debt, higher short-term debt balances and increased interest rates on short-term debt compared to the prior year. Also in 2016, we contributed $2.3 million to the American Water Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization which exists to help the communities we serve offer a better quality of life to their citizens.
Turning to Slide 19. We have a total of $125.4 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of 2016. This includes $92.2 million of new authorized revenue in 2016, of which about 2/3 was from infrastructure mechanisms, with the remaining 1/3 from rate cases. And we have another $33.2 million in new annualized revenues that have been authorized since the beginning of 2017. We have also filed and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases, a California step increase and 2 infrastructure surcharge requests, for a total outstanding revenue request of $71.7 million.
Slide 20 highlights our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. You heard Susan and Walter talk about our record level of capital investment this year of $1.5 billion. This includes $1.3 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers. These investments increased our estimated rate base at year-end 2016 to $10.7 billion, a 7% increase from the prior year. The remaining $200 million was for acquisition, with Scranton being the largest acquisition with an adjusted net purchase price of $151 million.
Our cash flow from operations grew 8.2% to $1.3 billion in 2016. This was driven by our strong adjusted net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services business, continuous improvements in collection efforts in our Regulated Businesses and the timing of expenses.
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.6%. With the conclusion of our Illinois rate case, including the 45 basis point improvement in the authorized ROE in that state, our weighted average authorized return on equity across our Regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9%. And we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized and achieved return through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcome.
Turning to Slide 21 and looking forward to 2017. We are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've shown you before, with plus or minus $0.07 of weather, or what we consider normal weather variability, being the most significant. Events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ.
We also continue to be a leader in dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility Average, the UTY and our water utility peers. In fact, over the last 4 years, we have had dividend increases at the top end of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate. Subject to Board of Directors' approval, we project our 2017 dividend growth to be at the top of that 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth range.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

As a company that relies on environmental protection for the services we provide, American Water is naturally focused on sustainability, not just because it's the right thing to do, which it certainly is, but also because it's our business imperative. It is more than just compliance with laws and regulations, although we are proud that our systems are 21x better than the industry. It extends to partnerships with environmental groups in our local watershed to foster protection and education on water issues. It also means that we are front and center on national policy issues around sustainable water supply, water quality and replacing aging infrastructure. There are approximately 53,000 water treatment plants in the United States, with about 400 of those participating in the EPA and AWWA partnership for safe water program. In 2016, only 33 plants received the Presidents Award, the program's highest honor. Pennsylvania American Water was awarded 9 of these 33, out of a total of 53,000 water treatment plants. Also in 2016, American Water was recognized by the Environmental Business Journal for our water quality and sustainability and named by Newsweek as one of America's Top Green Companies.
Our efforts have also translated into 8 patents, most dealing with water treatment technology, as well as $43 million of research grants awarded over the years. And of course, that is because of the people we have at American Water. Our R&D group of 15 employees includes 8 Ph.Ds and 4 people with other advanced degrees. They work hard every day with researchers across the globe to find better ways to sustain, treat, deliver and recycle our precious water resources. And our 6,800 employees, including operations, engineering, water quality and environmental lab professionals, are always finding better ways to serve our customers and protect our environment. While awards are good, the best recognition is highly satisfied customers and their peace of mind.
With that, we're happy to take your questions."

So our Keystone clearstone operations are in the Appalachian Basin. And we're the only water services provider that does the cycle of water management, except, of course, we do not, at the end of the cycle, take the waste at the site and put them into the deep wells that have been controversial. So because of that, we're finding that more and more of the E&Ps want to deploy their capital for their own, for example, development of pipeline and for their own services. So we can step in and basically handle providing the water and recycling the water on the site, and they don't have to worry about it. So we've gone from 20% when we purchased them in July 2015 to 35% now. We still believe that there are opportunities for growth in the area. And in fact, what we're finding now is that there's so much work in the area that we're seeing some of the -- pre-kind of 2016 downturn, we're seeing some of the pricing come back for the services and the need for the large E&Ps especially to feel comfortable that they have a partner who has a very strong commitment to environmental sustainability. So we do think that there is further room to grow in Appalachian Basin."

One of the big advantages we have as a company is we're able to deploy technology in one area, take the learnings of that technology and then apply it across American Water and realize significant value. So I would say the technology I highlighted, the technologies I highlighted in the past around non-revenue water and finding leaks in West Virginia, doing things like using technology to streamline our routes so that our people in the field are more efficient, those are the things we're going to be doing across American Water to drive efficiencies. And a lot of the low-hanging fruit we've already gotten, but the technologies are going to be a key enabler."

I will start, and then Walter can talk specifically about the New Jersey situation. So interestingly, I've been involved with the Bipartisan Policy Center working on -- looking at the whole infrastructure issue around the administration and their efforts. And it's interesting, there are a lot of parties that are interested. We have a coalition with the U.S. Chamber and NAM and several groups that are looking at this. I think the question is -- remains is where's the money coming from. So for us in the infrastructure, we are very excited that there is a focus on infrastructure. We like that there is a lot of interest from both sides of the aisle on public-private partnerships. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. But the good news for us is regardless of what plays out nationally, we have such a strong capital investment program. And being an investor-owned water utility, we could see a bump, but for us, we're just continuing to do our business, which is robust, and as we said, we continue to invest more and more capital. So there could be something down there. We're monitoring it closely, and hopefully, we will see something come from that. The last question you asked, and then Walter can talk about what's going on in New Jersey with the issue around municipalities, we are constantly -- as we said in Investor Day, we survey the landscape of all municipalities and companies that are out there that meet our guidelines and our discipline in terms of acquisition. But we are very disciplined. So when we look, we don't see the need to grow for the sake of growing, unless it is a good investment for us for the long term. Our financial models, we're always looking at so what would this mean in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and ensuring that we have a discipline around those acquisitions. But that doesn't mean we're not looking or that we don't have substantial data and information on these opportunities. It just means that we will not get out there and do something for the sake of just saying that we have an acquisition. And I do think, it's interesting, we've been waiting, as you know, following the water industry as long as you have, everybody keeps talking about there will be, no pun intended, floodgates opened on municipalities to be privatized. But it's a one-by-one battle. Municipalities have to look at their own particular circumstances and they -- and all the options that they have available to them. So our entire strategy is we're in these communities, we're on the ground, we're there to be a solutions provider. We think, in many cases, we can provide services at a lower cost, and we believe that we can improve water quality, improve service and give predictability of cost in many locations better than what exists there. And it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we tell our story. And the New Jersey situation is very interesting. Walter, if you want to talk about that."

Yes, what we're referring to here is Water Quality Accountability Act, and it was introduced by Senator Sweeney recently in New Jersey, and it's working its way through the Senate. It's got to work its way to the assembly, obviously, and then get signed by the governor. But what it does is really requires the same thing from municipalities and investor-owned utilities. And let me give you a couple of examples of what they're looking at. The testing of valves and hydrants per New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' requirements would be not just required of investor-owned but required of all municipalities within New Jersey. Cyber-security program requirements, action plans for any notice of violation, developing a comprehensive capital, long-term capital plan and a replacement rate for pipe targeted about 150 years. These are all the things that we're required to do in the investor-owned side, and it's really going to have the same requirements for municipalities around New Jersey. And the whole purpose is to make sure that the water quality is protected in New Jersey, and that's really the focus of Senator Sweeney's bill that he introduced."

And I think one of the things we learned from Flint, Michigan, is safe water is for everybody, and regardless of who provides that water, whether it's private or public, there should be the same standards for safe, clean water, and that we have great wastewater services and sanitation services. So I think that as some of these things have happened, people have realized it doesn't matter who the purveyor is, there needs to be standards that everybody follows, and for us, it's the ability to have a level playing field."

Now we're starting to see as gas prices are so affordable that, that will probably continue, and we will probably see gas increase. And those of you all who cover electric also know that regardless of what happens with the clean power plant, a lot of plans are already underway and people are already building significant new combined cycle facilities.

We're seeing well completion activities up, along with the natural gas prices. We believe that we're getting back to a more normal -- what that normal is, I think we're going to have to see over the next few months.

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover the first quarter financial results and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. 
The employees of American Water again delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2017. Our strategies include providing excellent service to our customers, building constructive regulatory relationship, growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operation to improve affordability and value for our customers. The foundation for our earnings growth is the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations. We invested $242 million this quarter, with $223 million for regulated infrastructure. We plan to invest about $1.5 billion this year with $1.3 billion dedicated to water and wastewater system improvement and upgrade. We minimized our customer bill impacts while making these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost and through constructive regulatory mechanism. 
Our Regulated Business closed several acquisitions during the quarter and in April. The largest was Shorelands Water Company, and we are pleased to welcome these 11,000 New Jersey families and businesses to the American Water family. We have added around 16,700 customers since the start of the year through closed acquisition and organic growth. Earnings were up slightly in our Market-Based Businesses. We saw increases in our Homeowner Services Group as well as our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary. However, as we noted at both our December Investor Day and on February's year end earnings call, Military Services continues to experience a downturn in ongoing capital projects on basis. This is due to previous sequestration mandate and their effects on base budgets. The sequestration was lifted earlier this year and we could see the benefits of this in the DOD's next fiscal year, which starts October 1.  Linda will discuss the financial implications of this in more detail in just a few minutes. 
Keystone is continuing to see a pickup in business with more well completions and drilling rigs operating in the Appalachian Basin. We expect to see fuller financial impacts in the second half of the year. As Slide 6 summarizes, our results were solid with first quarter 2017 earnings per diluted share up 13% compared to last year. As Linda will discuss in more detail in just a few minutes, this includes excellent year-over-year growth in our Regulated Businesses, year-over-year improvement in our Market-Based Businesses and a $0.02 positive impact from a parent related tax accounting treatment of equity compensation. She will also outline a second quarter one-time income tax headwind from our New York operations which will likely more than offset the anticipated equity compensation pick up this year. 
On April 21, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.375 to $0.415 per share, a 10.7% increase. This increase is the fifth consecutive year that dividend increases are at the very top or above our long term 7% to 10% EPS growth range. We are also affirming our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. 
Walter will now give you his update on our Regulated business."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated businesses has had a strong first quarter, making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while continuing to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. 
Let's walk through some of the highlights of the quarter. In Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in April 28, requesting an increase of $108 million and a return on equity of 10.8%. We've invested approximately $1.3 billion in Pennsylvania infrastructure and slightly decreased O&M expense since our last rate filing in 2013. This is a great example of increasing our system reliability and making it affordable for our customers. 
California American Water's cost of capital filing was not extended, so on April 3, we filed an application requesting 10.8% return on equity, along with 55.4% equity and 44.6% debt. The outcome of this proceeding with affect rates starting in January 2018. 
In Virginia, on April 5, the legislature and governor enacted new legislation that will benefit our customers. Senate Bill 1492 allows for statewide single tier pricing, 1 for water and 1 for wastewater for proceedings after July 1, 2017. Consolidated rates, which we have now in 9 states, allows us to spread the cost of infrastructure investments across a larger customer base and helps ease the financial burden in any one community. 
In Tennessee, the Public Utility Commission approved the infrastructure surcharge for 2017 projects. We'll invest almost $16 million in projects that improve service and reliability and will only impact our average residential bill by about $0.77 per month. This type of constructed regulatory policy allows our subsidiaries to make needed improvements while reducing the possibility of large rate increases. 
The Iowa Utilities Board issued an order, adjusting rates for Iowa American Water. We invested approximately $38 million in water system improvements and reduced operating expense by almost 10% since our last rate filing in 2013. We also received approval for [indiscernible] which is the basic mechanism in Iowa. This helps us make improvement, while limiting customer bill impact. This is a great job for our Iowa team. Again, for every  dollar we save, we can invest 7 in our systems with no customer bill impact. 
Turning to Slide 10. As Susan mentioned, we added 16,700 new customers through April through completed acquisition and organic growth. The largest acquisition was Shorelands Water Company, adding 11,000 customers in Mammoth County, New Jersey. This is another case where we leverage our scale and size by acquiring a system adjacent to systems we already own and operate. We can now connect the new system with our existing union beach system. It will enhance our supply and increased liability for all of our customers in that county. 
We also have a number of pending acquisitions, which when closed, will about 33,000 customers. Just last week, we announced the California American Water entered into an agreement to acquire the operating assets of the [ Footbridge ] Water Company for approximately $20 million and to become the new water provider to its approximately 4,800 customers. 
Moving on to Slide 11. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested $223 million in our Regulated Operations this quarter. This is critical to reliable service but it's also about affordable service. Our talented people continue to make progress in our O&M efficiency ratio, down to 34.6% for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2017. We keep making progress towards our long-term goal of 32.5% because of our employees and their commitment to our customers. 
Let me give you 2 examples. Pennsylvania American Water's comprehensive energy efficiency program has been delivering positive results for many years. Activities include competitive electricity sourcing, pump and motor upgrades, lighting upgrades, demand response programs and utility rebates for energy efficiency projects. At a high level, in 2010 to 2016, their fuel embarrassment as a percent of total revenues dropped from 3.1% to 2.1%. This improved efficiency amounts to about $24 million of cost avoidance over the last 6 years. 
In California, by partnering with the Sacramento Ministry of Utility District, California American Water was able to save 2.5 gigawatt hours of electricity each in the past 3 years. To put that into perspective, 2.5 gigawatts could power about 230 average household annually. By improving efficiency and enhancing equipment reliability, this unique partnership has helped us achieve an almost 11% reduction in yearly electricity usage with annual savings of about $150,000. 
I also want to recognize our customers in California for their response to the drought. They collectively reduced water use by more than 15 billion gallons in just under 2 years. To help customers save, California American Water launched award-winning communication campaign that included heavy emphasis on personal outreach, social media and smartphone applications as well as traditional communications. It was a tremendous effort by our customers and our California team. 
So it was a good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance"
250885,420006583,1189333,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone.

Today, I will cover the first quarter results and key financial metrics that bring customer and shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 13. We had a solid first quarter. Earnings were $0.52 per share, $0.06 above the first quarter last year. The Regulated Businesses were up $0.04 per share, the Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01 and the parent was also favorable $0.01. I'd like to point out that our first quarter results include a $0.02 per share tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. Excluding this benefit, first quarter EPS increased 8.7% over the same period last year. Again, representing solid quarterly result. 
Let me walk through our results by business segment. Our Regulated Operations were up $0.04 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 per share from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support growth and acquisition, partially offset by slightly lower demand. Next, we had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.04 per share, also driven by our investment growth. I'd also like to point out that O&M expense was flat in the Regulated Businesses compared to the prior year, as our employees across the company continue to focus on driving efficient operation that help make capital investments affordable for our customers. 
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. They were up $0.01 compared to the same period last year. Homeowner Services was up $0.01 on revenue and contracts growth and Keystone was favorable from continued cost management. And as Susan mentioned, we are seeing improved market condition that are expected to impact results in the second half of the year. These increases were partially offset by lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group of $0.01 per share, which includes the quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016. 
Lastly, the parent was up $0.01 in the quarter from the tax benefit of about $0.02 related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.01 to support growth. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $46.9 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $34.2 million authorized through general rate cases and $12.7 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge for a total annualized revenue request of $169.5 million. This includes the Pennsylvania rate case Walter discussed that was filed on April 28. 
Slide 15 highlights our key financial metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. Revenue was $756 million for the first quarter, an increase of $13 million or 1.7% compared to the first quarter last year. Regulated revenue increased $25 million or 3.9%, partially offset by a decrease of $11 million at the Market-Based Businesses, due mainly to the lower capital upgrades. It is important to note that our regulated revenue growth is typically lower than earnings growth due to the continued improvement in O&M efficiency across our Regulated Businesses. 
Total capital investments for the quarter were $242 million, primarily in our Regulated Businesses for replacement and renewal of transition and distribution infrastructure. We expect capital investments, including regulated acquisitions, to be about $1.5 billion in 2017. Our cash flow from operations grew 6.5% to $277 million in the first quarter of 2017. This was driven by net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Business and continuous improvements in our collection efforts in the Regulated Businesses. 
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.7%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9%. And we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcome. 
Turning to Slide 16. Today, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 per share to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items included in the earnings guidance range. First; as we mentioned at our December investor conference and February's earnings call, we expect to lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 due to the completion of the large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduced military budget. To give you additional transparency, included in our 2017 earnings guidance range is an expected net income reduction from 2016 of approximately $5 million to $6 million or about $0.03 per share from these lower capital upgrades. More than offsetting this reduction is continued growth expected in both our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone Clearwater Solutions. 
Second, on April 11, New York passed legislations that will no longer allow water utilities to use a zero percent tax rate for manufacturing activity. Previously, the electric and gas utilities were excluded from the zero percent rate. This will result in an increase our effective state tax rate in New York of approximately 5% beginning January of 2018. Although this rate change will not occur until 2018, we are required to record a one-time cumulative adjustment to remeasure our deferred taxes in the second quarter of 2017 or the period of the tax law change. The portion of this cumulative adjustment calculated on a stand-alone basis for our New York regulated subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and is not expected to impact earnings. However, the remaining portion, which is allocated through our state tax proportionate factors is expected to negatively affect second quarter 2017 earnings. Our preliminary estimate of this one-time noncash charge is about $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Now this negative tax impact will be partially offset by the $0.02 tax benefit already recorded in the first quarter related to the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. 
And then finally, we also included in our earnings guidance range plus or minus $0.07 for weather variability. Again, these items are included in our earnings guidance range and we are calling them out today of additional transparency. 
Transitioning to dividends on Page 17. We continue to be a leader in dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility Average, the Philadelphia Utility Index and our water utility peers. On April 21, we announced a $0.415 common stock dividend, which represents a 10.7% increase over the previous dividend. This dividend is payable on June 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of May 5, 2017. This increase represents the fifth year in a row that we have had dividend increases at or above the top end of our long term 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, many of you have asked about the Trump administration's infrastructure plans and how they might impact us. So I'll speak to that very briefly. As you know, tackling our nation's infrastructure challenges for roads, bridges, airports and water infrastructure is a priority for this administration. And for a good reason. First and foremost are the safety and health of our citizens and there are also compelling economic and competitive justifications. We know reliable infrastructure is foundational for communities and businesses to thrive and investment also stimulates the economy through job creation. For example, every 1 million in water infrastructure investment yield 16 jobs. So American Water's $1.3 billion invested in water and wastewater infrastructure this year will support 165,000 jobs. The details of an infrastructure package are still not clear, but the administration has been clear on the need for private sector involvement. 
For us, a focus on the need to invest in infrastructure is a good thing. For as long as you have been listening to our calls, we've been talking about the need for and our efforts to upgrade and maintain our systems to ensure clean, safe and reliable water services, all while running our business safely and efficiently so that our customer bills are affordable. So as we applaud these efforts by the administration and are actively involved in this policy development efforts to support our customers' interest, it doesn't really change our ongoing investment's scope, plans or commitments. Regardless of what happens in Washington, we will continue to focus on serving our customers, assuring water quality and strengthening our infrastructure. And we will do this as we also partner and assist communities seeking help with your own water and wastewater service challenge.

So if you look at American Water, in the past 4 years, we've actually doubled our market capitalization. We've increased our regulated acquisitions, we've also increased our capital investment. And you also pair that with the fact that we have an aging workforce. And so we've, over the past 2 to 3 years, been looking at strengthening an already really strong team. We have so many professional who have worked here for a long time. But for example, last year, we brought in a new Chief of Innovation and Technology Officer, because he brought some unique capabilities from his time in electric utility industry and what they had done in technology. We brought in a new head of R&D and emerging technology because Dr. [indiscernible] is retiring as at the end of this year. We brought in a new controller, [ Melissa Weikel ] and we also promoted several people inside to bigger and higher jobs. So really with Eric and Brian, it's a continuation of that. And Eric is actually in business development in Mark Strauss' group. And that group, as we talked about at Investor Day in December, that group supports their regulated acquisitions strategies that are state employ, but also are always looking at the landscape of are there new states we want to enter. And we've talked about the conditions that we would have to have before we did that. And we also look at are there other opportunities, but that's not the basis of our growth triangle and that's not the focus mainly of what we're doing. And with Brian, actually, it's a different role than that is that as we've gotten bigger and as we look at our corporate strategy in our financial strategy convergence, we're bringing in talent that has decades of experience of looking at creating financial planning, how you integrate corporate strategy with financial planning, being able to look at financial modeling, how we evaluate, making sure we make really good smart financial decisions. And I'll tell you, with the addition of Melissa and Brian and the continued outstanding work that Ed Vallejo bring, our VP and Treasurer Jen Gamble, our team here, really, we brought these hires in to really make us even stronger than we have been in the past.

And it is one of the reasons that in December, we shared kind of the long [indiscernible] deck. Today, we shared the long process it takes in terms of acquiring a municipality that even if there is interest and they expressed an interest, when you're a municipality, there's a lot of efforts all this are in play. You have to get a lot of people on board. You have to get a lot of people aligned. It's not quick. It would be much faster if the business was corporate acquisitions, which has its own set of issues. But in the municipality, we also understand that the these are elected officials and they want to make sure not just that they're getting a good price for their system, but that the people who buy their systems and other assets are able to serve the citizens well over the coming years. And this is a big interest. A lot of these mayors and council folks say, yes price is one thing and yes we need to have more capital, but on the other hand, I have to make sure that this is going to last for the next several years and that we don't put our city in a situation where we have service use. So you're exactly right, Angie. As we do more and more work with emerging contaminants, as we are looking not just at lead but other contaminants that are regulated, that we have growing concerns about and we're looking at ways to deal with them, we are sharing with municipalities all over the country our efforts, our value proposition and some of them are interested, some of them aren't, but it's not a fast process. And I don't think it'll ever be a fast process because of the politics involved. And I know one thing that will help though and Walter can mention the Water Quality Accountability Act in New Jersey is one thing that it takes effect across the country because basically, private water companies like us are held to higher standards or where actually the regulations are enforced more strongly with us than they are with municipalities. And we believe that all people deserve clean water. You may want to talk about what's going on in New Jersey, Walter."

So it would take such huge numbers of, I'll call free money, to have a big impact. However, there's a big issue and one of the things we're doing for what offer customers is our customers pay taxes just like the customers of his municipality. So what we're asking for is a level playing field. For example, the state revolving fund that gets funding nationally, federally, we can participate in states that allow us to on the waterside but not on the wastewater side. So we're working on policy efforts to ensure that if there are pools of low-cost money that we have access to them equal to what the municipals have access to. And again, because all of our customers pay taxes also. So for us, it is -- there's also in some conversations that we've been involved with in Washington, the trillion dollar infrastructure is not a trillion dollars in actual funding.

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover the first quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. 
The employees of American Water again delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2017. Our strategies include: Providing excellent service to our customers, building constructive regulatory relationships, growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operation to improve affordability and value for our customers. 
The foundation for our earnings growth is the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations. We invested $242 million this quarter, with $223 million for regulated infrastructure. We plan to invest about $1.5 billion this year with $1.3 billion dedicated to water and wastewater system improvements and upgrades. We minimized our customer bill impacts while making these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost and through constructive regulatory mechanisms. 
Our Regulated Business closed several acquisitions during the quarter and in April. The largest was Shorelands Water Company, and we are pleased to welcome these 11,000 New Jersey families and businesses to the American Water family. We have added around 16,700 customers since the start of the year through closed acquisitions and organic growth. 
Earnings were up slightly in our Market-Based Businesses. We saw increases in our Homeowner Services Group as well as our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary. However, as we noted at both our December Investor Day and on February's year-end earnings call, Military Services continues to experience a downturn in ongoing capital projects on bases. This is due to previous sequestration mandate and their effects on base budgets. The sequestration was lifted earlier this year and we could see the benefits of this in the DOD's next fiscal year, which starts October 1.  Linda will discuss the financial implications of this in more detail in just a few minutes. 
Keystone is continuing to see a pickup in business with more well completions and drilling rigs operating in the Appalachian Basin. We expect to see fuller financial impacts in the second half of the year. 
As Slide 6 summarizes, our results were solid with first quarter 2017 earnings per diluted share up 13% compared to last year. As Linda will discuss in more detail in just a few minutes, this includes excellent year-over-year growth in our Regulated Businesses, year-over-year improvement in our Market-Based Businesses and a $0.02 positive impact from a parent-related tax accounting treatment of equity compensation. She will also outline a second quarter onetime income tax headwind from our New York operations which will likely more than offset the anticipated equity compensation pick up this year. 
On April 21, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.375 to $0.415 per share, a 10.7% increase. This increase is the fifth consecutive year that dividend increases are at the very top or above our long term 7% to 10% EPS growth range. We are also affirming our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. 
Walter will now give you his update on our Regulated Business."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong first quarter, making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while continuing to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. 
Let's walk through some of the highlights of the quarter. In Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in April 28 requesting an increase of $108 million and a return on equity of 10.8%. We've invested approximately $1.3 billion in Pennsylvania infrastructure and slightly decreased O&M expense since our last rate filing in 2013. This is a great example of increasing our system's reliability and making it affordable for our customers. 
California American Water's cost of capital filing was not extended, so on April 3, we filed an application requesting 10.8% return on equity, along with 55.4% equity and 44.6% debt. The outcome of this proceeding would affect rates starting in January 2018. 
In Virginia, on April 5, the legislature and governor enacted new legislation that will benefit our customers. Senate Bill 1492 allows for statewide single-tariff pricing, 1 for water and 1 for wastewater, for proceedings after July 1, 2017. Consolidated rates, which we have now in 9 states, allows us to spread the cost of infrastructure investments across a larger customer base and helps ease the financial burden in any one community. 
In Tennessee, the Public Utility Commission approved the infrastructure surcharge for 2017 projects. We'll invest almost $16 million in projects that improve service and reliability and will only impact our average residential bill by about $0.77 per month. This type of constructive regulatory policy allows our subsidiaries to make needed improvements while reducing the possibility of large rate increases. 
The Iowa Utilities Board issued an order adjusting rates for Iowa American Water. We invested approximately $38 million in water system improvements and reduced operating expense by almost 10% since our last rate filing in 2013. We also received approval for a QIP, which is the DSIC mechanism in Iowa. This helps us make improvements while limiting customer bill impact. This is a great job by our Iowa team. Again, for every $1 we save, we can invest $7 in our systems with no customer bill impact. 
Turning to Slide 10. As Susan mentioned, we added 16,700 new customers through April through completed acquisitions and organic growth. The largest acquisition was Shorelands Water Company, adding 11,000 customers in Monmouth County, New Jersey. This is another case where we leverage our scale and size by acquiring a system adjacent to systems we already own and operate. We can now connect the new system with our existing Union Beach system. It will enhance our supply and increase liability for all of our customers in that county. 
We also have a number of pending acquisitions, which when closed, will add about 33,000 customers. Just last week, we announced that California America Water entered into an agreement to acquire the operating assets of the Fruitridge Vista Water Company for approximately $20 million and to become the new water provider to its approximately 4,800 customers. 
Moving on to Slide 11. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested $223 million in our Regulated Operations this quarter. This is critical to reliable service, but it's also about affordable service. Our talented people continue to make progress in our O&M efficiency ratio, down to 34.6% for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2017. We keep making progress towards our long-term goal of 32.5% because of our employees and their commitment to our customers. 
Let me give you 2 examples. Pennsylvania American Water's comprehensive energy efficiency program has been delivering positive results for many years. Activities include: Competitive electricity sourcing, pump and motor upgrades, lighting upgrades, demand response programs and utility rebates for energy efficiency projects. At a high level, in 2010 to 2016, their fuel and power spend as a percent of total revenues dropped from 3.1% to 2.1%. This improved efficiency amounts to about $24 million of cost avoidance over the last 6 years. 
In California, by partnering with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, California American Water was able to save 2.5 gigawatt hours of electricity each of the past 3 years. To put that into perspective, 2.5 gigawatts could power about 230 average household annually. By improving efficiency and enhancing equipment reliability, this unique partnership has helped us achieve an almost 11% reduction in yearly electricity usage with annual savings of about $150,000. 
I also want to recognize our customers in California for their response to the drought. They collectively reduced water use by more than 15 billion gallons in just under 2 years. To help customers save, California American Water launched award-winning communication campaigns that included a heavy emphasis on personal outreach, social media and smartphone applications as well as traditional communications. It was a tremendous effort by our customers and our California team. 
So it was a good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance"
250885,420006583,1189625,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone.

Today, I will cover our first quarter results and key financial metrics that bring customer and shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 13. We had a solid first quarter. Earnings were $0.52 per share, $0.06 above the first quarter last year. The Regulated Businesses were up $0.04 per share, the Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01 and the parent was also favorable $0.01. I'd like to point out that our first quarter results include a $0.02 per share tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. Excluding this benefit, first quarter EPS increased 8.7% over the same period last year. Again, representing solid quarterly results. 
Let me walk through our results by business segment. Our Regulated Operations were up $0.04 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 per share from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support growth and acquisitions, partially offset by slightly lower demand. Next, we had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.04 per share, also driven by our investment growth. I'd also like to point out that O&M expense was flat in the Regulated Businesses compared to the prior year as our employees across the company continue to focus on driving efficient operations that help make capital investments affordable for our customers. 
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. They were up $0.01 compared to the same period last year. Homeowner Services was up $0.01 on revenue and contract growth and Keystone was favorable from continued cost management. And as Susan mentioned, we are seeing improved market conditions that are expected to impact results in the second half of the year. These increases were partially offset by lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group of $0.01 per share, which includes the quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016. 
Lastly, the parent was up $0.01 in the quarter from the tax benefit of about $0.02 related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.01 to support growth. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $46.9 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $34.2 million authorized through general rate cases and $12.7 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge for a total annualized revenue request of $169.5 million. This includes the Pennsylvania rate case Walter discussed that was filed on April 28. 
Slide 15 highlights our key financial metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. Revenue was $756 million for the first quarter, an increase of $13 million or 1.7% compared to the first quarter last year. Regulated revenue increased $25 million or 3.9%, partially offset by a decrease of $11 million at the Market-Based Businesses, due mainly to the lower capital upgrades. It is important to note that our regulated revenue growth is typically lower than earnings growth due to the continued improvement in O&M efficiency across our Regulated Businesses. 
Total capital investments for the quarter were $242 million, primarily in our Regulated Businesses for replacement and renewal of transition and distribution infrastructure. We expect capital investments, including regulated acquisitions, to be about $1.5 billion in 2017. 
Our cash flow from operations grew 6.5% to $277 million in the first quarter of 2017. This was driven by net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Business and continuous improvements in our collection efforts in the Regulated Businesses. 
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.7%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9%. And we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
Turning to Slide 16. Today, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 per share to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items included in the earnings guidance range. First, as we mentioned at our December investor conference and February's earnings call, we expect the lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 due to the completion of a large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduced military budgets. 
To give you additional transparency, included in our 2017 earnings guidance range is an expected net income reduction from 2016 of approximately $5 million to $6 million or about $0.03 per share from these lower capital upgrades. More than offsetting this reduction is continued growth expected in both our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone Clearwater Solution. 
Second, on April 11, New York passed legislations that will no longer allow water utilities to use the 0% tax rate for manufacturing activities. Previously, the electric and gas utilities were excluded from the 0% rate. This will result in an increase our effective state tax rate in New York of approximately 5% beginning January of 2018. 
Although this rate change will not occur until 2018, we are required to record a onetime cumulative adjustment to remeasure our deferred taxes in the second quarter of 2017 or the period of the tax law change. The portion of this cumulative adjustment calculated on a stand-alone basis for our New York regulated subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and is not expected to impact earnings. However, the remaining portion which is allocated through our state tax proportionate factors is expected to negatively affect second quarter 2017 earnings. 
Our preliminary estimate of this onetime noncash charge is about $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Now this negative tax impact will be partially offset by the $0.02 tax benefit already recorded in the first quarter related to the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. 
And then finally, we also include in our earnings guidance range plus or minus $0.07 for weather variability. Again, these items are included in our earnings guidance range and we are calling them out today for additional transparency. 
Transitioning to dividends on Page 17. We continue to be a leader in dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility Average, the Philadelphia Utility Index and our water utility peers. On April 21, we announced a $0.415 common stock dividend which represents a 10.7% increase over the previous dividend. This dividend is payable on June 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of May 5, 2017. This increase represents the fifth year in a row that we have had dividend increases at or above the top end of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, many of you have asked about the Trump administration's infrastructure plans and how they might impact us. So I'll just speak to that very briefly. 
As you know, tackling our nation's infrastructure challenges for roads, bridges, airports and water infrastructure is a priority for the administration, and for good reasons. First and foremost are the safety and health of our citizens, and there are also compelling economic and competitive justifications. We know reliable infrastructure is foundational for communities and businesses to thrive and investment also stimulates the economy through job creation. For example, every $1 million in water infrastructure investment yields 16 jobs. So American Water's $1.3 billion invested in water and wastewater infrastructure this year will support 165,000 jobs. 
The details of an infrastructure package are still not clear, but the administration has been clear on the need for private sector involvement. For us, a focus on the need to invest in infrastructure is a good thing. For as long as you have been listening to our calls, we've been talking about the need for and our efforts to upgrade and maintain our systems to ensure clean, safe and reliable water services, all while running our business safely and efficiently so that our customer bills are affordable. 
So as we applaud these efforts by the administration and are actively involved in these policy development efforts to support our customers' interest, it doesn't really change our ongoing investment scope, plans or commitment. Regardless of what happens in Washington, we will continue to focus on serving our customers, assuring water quality and strengthening our infrastructure. And we will do this as we also partner and assist communities seeking help with their own water and wastewater service challenges. 
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

And just as some background, and I'm really glad you asked the question. So if you look at American Water, in the past 4 years, we've actually doubled our market capitalization. We've increased our regulated acquisitions. We've also increased our capital investment. And you also pair that with the fact that we have an aging workforce. And so we've, over the past 2 to 3 years, been looking at strengthening an already really strong team. And we have so many professional who have worked here for a long time. But for example, last year, we brought in a new Chief of Innovation and Technology Officer, Radha Swaminathan, because he brought some unique capabilities from his time in the electric utility industry and what they had done in technology. We brought in a new head of R&D and Emerging Technology because Dr. Mark LeChevallier is retiring as at the end of this year. We brought in a new controller, Melissa Wikle. And we also promoted several people inside to bigger and higher jobs. So really, with Eric and Brian, it's a continuation of that. And Eric is actually in business development in Mark Strauss' group. And that group -- as we talked about at Investor Day in December, that group supports the regulated acquisitions strategies that are state employ, but also, we're always looking at the landscape of are there new states we want to enter? And we've talked about the conditions that we would have to have before we did that. And we also look at are there other opportunities? But that's not the basis of our growth triangle and that's not the focus mainly of what we're doing. And with Brian, actually, it's a different role than that, is that as we've gotten bigger and as we look at our corporate strategies and our financial strategy convergence, we're bringing in talent that has decades of experience of looking at creative financial planning, how you integrate corporate strategy with financial planning, being able to look at financial modeling, how we evaluate, making sure we make really good, smart financial decisions. And I'll tell you, with the addition of Melissa and Brian and the continued outstanding work that Ed Vallejo brings; our VP and Treasurer, Jen Gambol, our team here, really, we brought these hires in to really make us even stronger than we have been in the past. And it's pretty exciting."

And it is one of the reasons that, in December, we shared kind of the long -- and you see deck today, that we shared the long process it takes in terms of acquiring a municipality is, that even if there is interest and they expressed an interest, when you're a municipality, there's a lot of efforts, politics that are in play. You have to get a lot of people on board. You have to get a lot of people aligned. It's not quick. It would be much faster if the business was corporate acquisitions, which has its own set of issues. But in a municipality, we also understand that the these are elected officials and they want to make sure not just that they're getting a good price for their system, but that the people who buy their system and their assets are able to serve their citizens well over the coming years. And this is a big interest. A lot of these mayors and council folks say, ""Yes, price is one thing, and yes, we need to have more capital. But on the other hand, I have to make sure that this is going to last for the next several years and that we don't put our city in a situation where we have service issues."" So you're exactly right, Angie. As we do more and more work with emerging contaminants, as we are looking not just at lead but other contaminants that aren't regulated that we have growing concerns about and we're looking at ways to deal with them, we are sharing with municipalities all over the country our efforts, our value proposition. And some of them are interested, some of them aren't, but it's not a fast process. And I don't think it will ever be a fast process because of the politics involved. And I know one thing that will help, though, and Walter can mention, the Water Quality Accountability Act in New Jersey is one thing that it takes effect across the country because basically, private water companies like us are held to higher standards or where actually the regulations are enforced more strongly with us than they are with municipalities. And we believe that all people deserve clean water. And you may want to talk about what's going on in New Jersey, Walter."

So it would take such huge numbers of, I'll call, free money, to have a big impact. However, there's always the issue, and one of the things that we're doing for what out for our customers is our customers pay taxes just like the customers of municipalities, so what we're asking for is a level playing field. For example, the state revolving funds that get funding nationally, federally, we can participate in states that allow us to on the water side but not on the wastewater side. So we're working on policy efforts to ensure that if there are pools of low-cost money, that we have access to them equal to what the municipals have access to, and again, because all of our customers pay taxes also. So for us, it is -- there's also, in some conversations that we've been involved with in Washington, the trillion-dollar infrastructure is not a $1 trillion in actual funding. It is finding ways that you have offset the need for that. So our ability to invest, job creation, those types of things could actually be used as a measure to count toward that.

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover the first quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. 
The employees of American Water again delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2017. Our strategies include providing excellent service to our customers, building constructive regulatory relationships, growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operation to ensure affordability and value for our customers. 
The foundation for our earnings growth is the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations. We invested $242 million this quarter, with $223 million for regulated infrastructure. We plan to invest about $1.5 billion this year with $1.3 billion dedicated to water and wastewater system improvements and upgrades. We minimized our customer bill impacts while making these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost and through constructive regulatory mechanisms. 
Our Regulated Business closed several acquisitions during the quarter and in April. The largest was Shorelands Water Company, and we are pleased to welcome these 11,000 New Jersey families and businesses to the American Water family. We have added around 16,700 customers since the start of the year through closed acquisitions and organic growth. 
Earnings were up slightly in our Market-Based Businesses. We saw increases in our Homeowner Services Group as well as our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary. However, as we noted at both our December Investor Day and on February's year-end earnings call, Military Services continues to experience a downturn in ongoing capital projects on bases. This is due to previous sequestration mandate and their effects on base budgets. The sequestration was lifted earlier this year and we could see the benefits of this in the DOD's next fiscal year, which starts October 1. Linda will discuss the financial implications of this in more detail in just a few minutes. 
Keystone is continuing to see a pickup in business with more well completions and drilling rigs operating in the Appalachian Basin. We expect to see fuller financial impacts in the second half of the year. 
As Slide 6 summarizes, our results were solid with first quarter 2017 earnings per diluted share up 13% compared to last year. As Linda will discuss in more detail in just a few minutes, this includes excellent year-over-year growth in our Regulated Businesses, year-over-year improvement in our Market-Based Businesses and a $0.02 positive impact from a parent-related tax accounting treatment of equity compensation. She will also outline a second quarter onetime income tax headwind from our New York operations which will likely more than offset the anticipated equity compensation pickup this year. 
On April 21, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.375 to $0.415 per share, a 10.7% increase. This increase is the fifth consecutive year that dividend increases are at the very top or above our long term 7% to 10% EPS growth range. We are also affirming our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. 
Walter will now give you his update on our Regulated Business."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong first quarter, making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while continuing to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. 
Let's walk through some of the highlights of the quarter. In Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in April 28 requesting an increase of $108 million and a return on equity of 10.8%. We've invested approximately $1.3 billion in Pennsylvania infrastructure and slightly decreased O&M expense since our last rate filing in 2013. This is a great example of increasing our system's reliability and making it affordable for our customers. 
California American Water's cost of capital filing was not extended, so on April 3, we filed an application requesting 10.8% return on equity, along with 55.4% equity and 44.6% debt. The outcome of this proceeding would affect rates starting in January 2018. 
In Virginia, on April 5, the legislature and governor enacted new legislation that will benefit our customers. Senate Bill 1492 allows for statewide single-tariff pricing, 1 for water and 1 for wastewater, for proceedings after July 1, 2017. Consolidated rates, which we have now in 9 states, allows us to spread the cost of infrastructure investments across a larger customer base and helps ease the financial burden in any one community. 
In Tennessee, the Public Utility Commission approved the infrastructure surcharge for 2017 projects. We'll invest almost $16 million in projects that improve service and reliability and will only impact our average residential bill by about $0.77 per month. This type of constructive regulatory policy allows our subsidiaries to make needed improvements while reducing the possibility of large rate increases. 
The Iowa Utilities Board issued an order adjusting rates for Iowa American Water. We invested approximately $38 million in water system improvements and reduced operating expense by almost 10% since our last rate filing in 2013. We also received approval for a QIP, which is the DSIC mechanism in Iowa. This helps us make improvements while limiting customer bill impact. This is a great job by our Iowa team. Again, for every $1 we save, we can invest $7 in our systems with no customer bill impact. 
Turning to Slide 10. As Susan mentioned, we added 16,700 new customers through April through completed acquisitions and organic growth. The largest acquisition was Shorelands Water Company, adding 11,000 customers in Monmouth County, New Jersey. This is another case where we leverage our scale and size by acquiring a system adjacent to systems we already own and operate. We can now connect the new system with our existing Union Beach system. It will enhance our supply and increase reliability for all of our customers in that county. 
We also have a number of pending acquisitions, which when closed, will add about 33,000 customers. Just last week, we announced that California America Water entered into an agreement to acquire the operating assets of the Fruitridge Vista Water Company for approximately $20 million and to become the new water provider to its approximately 4,800 customers. 
Moving on to Slide 11. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested $223 million in our Regulated Operations this quarter. This is critical to reliable service, but it's also about affordable service. Our talented people continue to make progress in our O&M efficiency ratio, down to 34.6% for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2017. We keep making progress towards our long-term goal of 32.5% because of our employees and their commitment to our customers. 
Let me give you 2 examples. Pennsylvania American Water's comprehensive energy efficiency program has been delivering positive results for many years. Activities include competitive electricity sourcing, pump and motor upgrades, lighting upgrades, demand response programs and utility rebates for energy efficiency projects. At a high level, from 2010 to 2016, their fuel and power spend as a percent of total revenues dropped from 3.1% to 2.1%. This improved efficiency amounts to about $24 million of cost avoidance over the last 6 years. 
In California, by partnering with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, California American Water was able to save 2.5 gigawatt hours of electricity each of the past 3 years. To put that into perspective, 2.5 gigawatts could power about 230 average household annually. By improving efficiency and enhancing equipment reliability, this unique partnership has helped us achieve an almost 11% reduction in yearly electricity usage with annual savings of about $150,000. 
I also want to recognize our customers in California for their response to the drought. They collectively reduced water use by more than 15 billion gallons in just under 2 years. To help customers save, California American Water launched award-winning communication campaigns that included a heavy emphasis on personal outreach, social media and smartphone applications as well as traditional communications. It was a tremendous effort by our customers and our California team. 
So it was a good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance"
250885,420006583,1189778,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone.

Earnings were $0.52 per share, $0.06 abo",1136,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and key financial metrics that bring customer and shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 13. We had a solid first quarter. Earnings were $0.52 per share, $0.06 above the first quarter last year. The Regulated Businesses were up $0.04 per share, the Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01 and the parent was also favorable $0.01. I'd like to point out that our first quarter results include a $0.02 per share tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. Excluding this benefit, first quarter EPS increased 8.7% over the same period last year. Again, representing solid quarterly results. 
Let me walk through our results by business segment. Our Regulated Operations were up $0.04 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 per share from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support growth and acquisitions, partially offset by slightly lower demand. Next, we had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.04 per share, also driven by our investment growth. I'd also like to point out that O&M expense was flat in the Regulated Businesses compared to the prior year as our employees across the company continued to focus on driving efficient operations that help make capital investments affordable for our customers. 
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. They were up $0.01 compared to the same period last year. Homeowner Services was up $0.01 on revenue and contract growth, and Keystone was favorable from continued cost management. And as Susan mentioned, we are seeing improved market conditions that are expected to impact results in the second half of the year. These increases were partially offset by lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group of $0.01 per share, which includes the quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016. 
Lastly, the parent was up $0.01 in the quarter from the tax benefit of about $0.02 related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.01 to support growth. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $46.9 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $34.2 million authorized through general rate cases and $12.7 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge for a total annualized revenue request of $169.5 million. This includes the Pennsylvania rate case Walter discussed that was filed on April 28. 
Slide 15 highlights our key financial metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. Revenue was $756 million for the first quarter, an increase of $13 million or 1.7% compared to the first quarter last year. Regulated revenue increased $25 million or 3.9%, partially offset by a decrease of $11 million at the Market-Based Businesses, due mainly to the lower capital upgrades. It is important to note that our regulated revenue growth is typically lower than earnings growth due to the continued improvement in O&M efficiency across our Regulated Businesses. 
Total capital investments for the quarter were $242 million, primarily in our Regulated Businesses for replacement and renewal of transition and distribution infrastructure. We expect capital investments, including regulated acquisitions to be about $1.5 billion in 2017. 
Our cash flow from operations grew 6.5% to $277 million in the first quarter of 2017. This was driven by net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Business and continuous improvements in our collection efforts in the Regulated Businesses. 
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.7%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9%. And we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
Turning to Slide 16. Today, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 per share to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items included in the earnings guidance range. First, as we mentioned at our December investor conference and February's earnings call, we expect the lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 due to the completion of a large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduced military budgets. 
To give you additional transparency, included in our 2017 earnings guidance range is an expected net income reduction from 2016 of approximately $5 million to $6 million or about $0.03 per share from these lower capital upgrades. More than offsetting this reduction is continued growth expected in both our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone Clearwater Solution. 
Second, on April 11, New York passed legislation that will no longer allow water utilities to use the 0% tax rate for manufacturing activities. Previously, the electric and gas utilities were excluded from the 0% rate. This will result in an increase to our effective state tax rate in New York of approximately 5% beginning January of 2018. 
Although this rate change will not occur until 2018, we are required to record a onetime cumulative adjustment to remeasure our deferred taxes in the second quarter of 2017 or the period of the tax law change. A portion of this cumulative adjustment calculated on a stand-alone basis for our New York regulated subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and is not expected to impact earnings. However, the remaining portion which is allocated through our state tax proportionate factors is expected to negatively affect second quarter 2017 earnings. 
Our preliminary estimate of this onetime noncash charge is about $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Now this negative tax impact will be partially offset by the $0.02 tax benefit already recorded in the first quarter related to the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. 
And then finally, we also include in our earnings guidance range plus or minus $0.07 for weather variability. Again, these items are included in our earnings guidance range, and we are calling them out today for additional transparency. 
Transitioning to dividends on Page 17. We continue to be a leader in dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility Average, the Philadelphia Utility Index and our water utility peers. On April 21, we announced a $0.415 common stock dividend which represents a 10.7% increase over the previous dividend. This dividend is payable on June 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of May 5, 2017. This increase represents the fifth year in a row that we have had dividend increases at or above the top end of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, many of you have asked about the Trump administration's infrastructure plans and how they might impact us. So I'll just speak to that very briefly.

Before taking your questions, many of you have asked about the Trump administration's infrastructure plans and how they might impact us. So I'll just speak to that very briefly. 
As you know, tackling our nation's infrastructure challenges for roads, bridges, airports and water infrastructure is a priority for the administration, and for good reasons. First and foremost are the safety and health of our citizens, and there are also compelling economic and competitive justifications. We know reliable infrastructure is foundational for communities and businesses to thrive, and investment also stimulates the economy through job creation. For example, every $1 million in water infrastructure investment yields 16 jobs. So American Water's $1.3 billion invested in water and wastewater infrastructure this year will support 165,000 jobs. 
The details of an infrastructure package are still not clear, but the administration has been clear on the need for private sector involvement. For us, a focus on the need to invest in infrastructure is a good thing. For as long as you have been listening to our calls, we've been talking about the need for and our efforts to upgrade and maintain our systems to ensure clean, safe and reliable water services, all while running our business safely and efficiently so that our customer bills are affordable. 
So as we applaud these efforts by the administration and are actively involved in these policy development efforts to support our customers' interest, it doesn't really change our ongoing investment scope, plans or commitment. Regardless of what happens in Washington, we will continue to focus on serving our customers, assuring water quality and strengthening our infrastructure. And we will do this as we also partner and assist communities seeking help with their own water and wastewater service challenges. 
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

And just as some background, and I'm really glad you asked the question. So if you look at American Water, in the past 4 years, we've actually doubled our market capitalization. We've increased our regulated acquisitions. We've also increased our capital investment. And you also pair that with the fact that we have an aging workforce. And so we've, over the past 2 to 3 years, been looking at strengthening an already really strong team. And we have so many professional who have worked here for a long time. But for example, last year, we brought in a new Chief of Innovation and Technology Officer, Radha Swaminathan, because he brought some unique capabilities from his time in the electric utility industry and what they had done in technology. We brought in a new head of R&D and Emerging Technology because Dr. Mark LeChevallier is retiring at the end of this year. We brought in a new controller, Melissa Wikle. And we also promoted several people inside to bigger and higher jobs. So really, with Eric and Brian, it's a continuation of that. And Eric is actually in business development in Mark Strauss' group. And that group -- as we talked about at Investor Day in December, that group supports the regulated acquisitions strategies that are states employ, but also, we're always looking at the landscape of are there new states we want to enter? And we've talked about the conditions that we would have to have before we did that. And we also look at are there other opportunities. But that's not the basis of our growth triangle and that's not the focus mainly of what we're doing. And with Brian, actually, it's a different role than that, is that as we've gotten bigger and as we look at our corporate strategies and our financial strategy convergence, we're bringing in talent that has decades of experience of looking at creative financial planning, how you integrate corporate strategy with financial planning, being able to look at financial modeling, how we evaluate, making sure we make really good, smart financial decisions. And I'll tell you, with the addition of Melissa and Brian and the continued outstanding work that Ed Vallejo brings; our VP and Treasurer, Jen Gambol, our team here, really, we brought these hires in to really make us even stronger than we have been in the past. And it's pretty exciting."

And it is one of the reasons that, in December, we shared kind of the long -- and you see in the deck today, that we shared the long process it takes in terms of acquiring a municipality is, that even if there is interest and they expressed an interest, when you're a municipality, there's a lot of efforts, politics that are in play. You have to get a lot of people on board. You have to get a lot of people aligned. It's not quick. It would be much faster if the business was corporate acquisitions, which has its own set of issues. But in a municipality, we also understand that these are elected officials, and they want to make sure not just that they're getting a good price for their system, but that the people who buy their system and their assets are able to serve their citizens well over the coming years. And this is a big interest. A lot of these mayors and council folks say, ""Yes, price is one thing, and yes, we need to have more capital. But on the other hand, I have to make sure that this is going to last for the next several years and that we don't put our city in a situation where we have service issues."" So you're exactly right, Angie. As we do more and more work with emerging contaminants, as we are looking not just at lead but other contaminants that aren't regulated that we have growing concerns about and we're looking at ways to deal with them, we are sharing with municipalities all over the country our efforts, our value proposition. And some of them are interested, some of them aren't, but it's not a fast process. And I don't think it will ever be a fast process because of the politics involved. And I know one thing that will help, though, and Walter can mention, the Water Quality Accountability Act in New Jersey is one thing that it takes effect across the country because basically, private water companies like us are held to higher standards or we’re -- actually the regulations are enforced more strongly with us than they are with municipalities. And we believe that all people deserve clean water. And so you may want to talk about what's going on in New Jersey, Walter."

So it would take such huge numbers of, I'll call, free money, to have a big impact. However, there's always the issue, and one of the things that we're doing to watch out for our customers is our customers pay taxes just like the customers of municipalities, so what we're asking for is a level playing field. For example, the state revolving funds that get funding nationally, federally, we can participate in states that allow us to on the water side but not on the wastewater side. So we're working on policy efforts to ensure that if there are pools of low-cost money, that we have access to them equal to what the municipals have access to, and again, because all of our customers pay taxes also. So for us, it is -- there's also, in some conversations that we've been involved with in Washington, the trillion-dollar infrastructure is not $1 trillion in actual funding. It is finding ways that you have offset the need for that. So our ability to invest, job creation, those types of things could actually be used as a measure to count toward that. And that's one thing that we're involved and making sure that we get recognized for that."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover the first quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. 
The employees of American Water again delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2017. Our strategies include providing excellent service to our customers, building constructive regulatory relationships, growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operation to ensure affordability and value for our customers. 
The foundation for our earnings growth is the capital investment we make in our Regulated Operations. We invested $242 million this quarter, with $223 million for regulated infrastructure. We plan to invest about $1.5 billion this year with $1.3 billion dedicated to water and wastewater system improvements and upgrades. We minimized our customer bill impacts while making these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost and through constructive regulatory mechanisms. 
Our Regulated Business closed several acquisitions during the quarter and in April. The largest was Shorelands Water Company, and we are pleased to welcome these 11,000 New Jersey families and businesses to the American Water family. We have added around 16,700 customers since the start of the year through closed acquisitions and organic growth. 
Earnings were up slightly in our Market-Based Businesses. We saw increases in our Homeowner Services Group as well as our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary. However, as we noted at both our December Investor Day and on February's year-end earnings call, Military Services continues to experience a downturn in ongoing capital projects on bases. This is due to previous sequestration mandate and their effects on base budgets. The sequestration was lifted earlier this year and we could see the benefits of this in the DOD's next fiscal year, which starts October 1. Linda will discuss the financial implications of this in more detail in just a few minutes. 
Keystone is continuing to see a pickup in business with more well completions and drilling rigs operating in the Appalachian Basin. We expect to see fuller financial impacts in the second half of the year. 
As Slide 6 summarizes, our results were solid with first quarter 2017 earnings per diluted share up 13% compared to last year. As Linda will discuss in more detail in just a few minutes, this includes excellent year-over-year growth in our Regulated Businesses, year-over-year improvement in our Market-Based Businesses and a $0.02 positive impact from a parent-related tax accounting treatment of equity compensation. She will also outline a second quarter onetime income tax headwind from our New York operations which will likely more than offset the anticipated equity compensation pickup this year. 
On April 21, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.375 to $0.415 per share, a 10.7% increase. This increase is the fifth consecutive year that dividend increases are at the very top or above our long-term 7% to 10% EPS growth range. We are also affirming our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. 
Walter will now give you his update on our Regulated Business."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong first quarter, making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while continuing to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. 
Let's walk through some of the highlights of the quarter. In Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in April 28 requesting an increase of $108 million and a return on equity of 10.8%. We've invested approximately $1.3 billion in Pennsylvania infrastructure and slightly decreased O&M expense since our last rate filing in 2013. This is a great example of increasing our system's reliability and making it affordable for our customers. 
California American Water's cost of capital filing was not extended, so on April 3, we filed an application requesting 10.8% return on equity, along with 55.4% equity and 44.6% debt. The outcome of this proceeding would affect rates starting in January 2018. 
In Virginia, on April 5, the legislature and governor enacted new legislation that will benefit our customers. Senate Bill 1492 allows for statewide single-tariff pricing, 1 for water and 1 for wastewater, for proceedings after July 1, 2017. Consolidated rates, which we have now in 9 states, allows us to spread the cost of infrastructure investments across a larger customer base and helps ease the financial burden in any one community. 
In Tennessee, the Public Utility Commission approved the infrastructure surcharge for 2017 projects. We'll invest almost $16 million in projects that improve service and reliability and will only impact our average residential bill by about $0.77 per month. This type of constructive regulatory policy allows our subsidiaries to make needed improvements while reducing the possibility of large rate increases. 
The Iowa Utilities Board issued an order adjusting rates for Iowa American Water. We invested approximately $38 million in water system improvements and reduced operating expense by almost 10% since our last rate filing in 2013. We also received approval for a QIP, which is the DSIC mechanism in Iowa. This helps us make improvements while limiting customer bill impact. This is a great job by our Iowa team. Again, for every $1 we save, we can invest $7 in our systems with no customer bill impact. 
Turning to Slide 10. As Susan mentioned, we added 16,700 new customers through April through completed acquisitions and organic growth. The largest acquisition was Shorelands Water Company, adding 11,000 customers in Monmouth County, New Jersey. This is another case where we leverage our scale and size by acquiring a system adjacent to systems we already own and operate. We can now connect the new system with our existing Union Beach system. It will enhance our supply and increase reliability for all of our customers in that county. 
We also have a number of pending acquisitions, which when closed, will add about 33,000 customers. Just last week, we announced that California America Water entered into an agreement to acquire the operating assets of the Fruitridge Vista Water Company for approximately $20 million and to become the new water provider to its approximately 4,800 customers. 
Moving on to Slide 11. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested $223 million in our Regulated Operations this quarter. This is critical to reliable service, but it's also about affordable service. Our talented people continue to make progress in our O&M efficiency ratio, down to 34.6% for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2017. We keep making progress towards our long-term goal of 32.5% because of our employees and their commitment to our customers. 
Let me give you 2 examples. Pennsylvania American Water's comprehensive energy efficiency program has been delivering positive results for many years. Activities include competitive electricity sourcing, pump and motor upgrades, lighting upgrades, demand response programs and utility rebates for energy efficiency projects. At a high level, from 2010 to 2016, their fuel and power spend as a percent of total revenues dropped from 3.1% to 2.1%. This improved efficiency amounts to about $24 million of cost avoidance over the last 6 years. 
In California, by partnering with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, California American Water was able to save 2.5 gigawatt hours of electricity each of the past 3 years. To put that into perspective, 2.5 gigawatts could power about 230 average household annually. By improving efficiency and enhancing equipment reliability, this unique partnership has helped us achieve an almost 11% reduction in yearly electricity usage with annual savings of about $150,000. 
I also want to recognize our customers in California for their response to the drought. They collectively reduced water use by more than 15 billion gallons in just under 2 years. To help customers save, California American Water launched award-winning communication campaigns that included a heavy emphasis on personal outreach, social media and smartphone applications as well as traditional communications. It was a tremendous effort by our customers and our California team. 
So it was a good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance"
250885,420006583,1194829,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 04, 2017",2017-05-04,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone.

Earnings were $0.52 per share, $0.06 abo",1136,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and key financial metrics that bring customer and shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 13. We had a solid first quarter. Earnings were $0.52 per share, $0.06 above the first quarter last year. The Regulated Businesses were up $0.04 per share, the Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01 and the parent was also favorable $0.01. I'd like to point out that our first quarter results include a $0.02 per share tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. Excluding this benefit, first quarter EPS increased 8.7% over the same period last year. Again, representing solid quarterly results. 
Let me walk through our results by business segment. Our Regulated Operations were up $0.04 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 per share from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support growth and acquisitions, partially offset by slightly lower demand. Next, we had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.04 per share, also driven by our investment growth. I'd also like to point out that O&M expense was flat in the Regulated Businesses compared to the prior year as our employees across the company continued to focus on driving efficient operations that help make capital investments affordable for our customers. 
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. They were up $0.01 compared to the same period last year. Homeowner Services was up $0.01 on revenue and contract growth, and Keystone was favorable from continued cost management. And as Susan mentioned, we are seeing improved market conditions that are expected to impact results in the second half of the year. These increases were partially offset by lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group of $0.01 per share, which includes the quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016. 
Lastly, the parent was up $0.01 in the quarter from the tax benefit of about $0.02 related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.01 to support growth. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $46.9 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $34.2 million authorized through general rate cases and $12.7 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge for a total annualized revenue request of $169.5 million. This includes the Pennsylvania rate case Walter discussed that was filed on April 28. 
Slide 15 highlights our key financial metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. Revenue was $756 million for the first quarter, an increase of $13 million or 1.7% compared to the first quarter last year. Regulated revenue increased $25 million or 3.9%, partially offset by a decrease of $11 million at the Market-Based Businesses, due mainly to the lower capital upgrades. It is important to note that our regulated revenue growth is typically lower than earnings growth due to the continued improvement in O&M efficiency across our Regulated Businesses. 
Total capital investments for the quarter were $242 million, primarily in our Regulated Businesses for replacement and renewal of transition and distribution infrastructure. We expect capital investments, including regulated acquisitions to be about $1.5 billion in 2017. 
Our cash flow from operations grew 6.5% to $277 million in the first quarter of 2017. This was driven by net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Business and continuous improvements in our collection efforts in the Regulated Businesses. 
Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.7%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9%. And we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcomes. 
Turning to Slide 16. Today, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 per share to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items included in the earnings guidance range. First, as we mentioned at our December investor conference and February's earnings call, we expect the lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 due to the completion of a large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduced military budgets. 
To give you additional transparency, included in our 2017 earnings guidance range is an expected net income reduction from 2016 of approximately $5 million to $6 million or about $0.03 per share from these lower capital upgrades. More than offsetting this reduction is continued growth expected in both our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone Clearwater Solution. 
Second, on April 11, New York passed legislation that will no longer allow water utilities to use the 0% tax rate for manufacturing activities. Previously, the electric and gas utilities were excluded from the 0% rate. This will result in an increase to our effective state tax rate in New York of approximately 5% beginning January of 2018. 
Although this rate change will not occur until 2018, we are required to record a onetime cumulative adjustment to remeasure our deferred taxes in the second quarter of 2017 or the period of the tax law change. A portion of this cumulative adjustment calculated on a stand-alone basis for our New York regulated subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and is not expected to impact earnings. However, the remaining portion which is allocated through our state tax proportionate factors is expected to negatively affect second quarter 2017 earnings. 
Our preliminary estimate of this onetime noncash charge is about $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Now this negative tax impact will be partially offset by the $0.02 tax benefit already recorded in the first quarter related to the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. 
And then finally, we also include in our earnings guidance range plus or minus $0.07 for weather variability. Again, these items are included in our earnings guidance range, and we are calling them out today for additional transparency. 
Transitioning to dividends on Page 17. We continue to be a leader in dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility Average, the Philadelphia Utility Index and our water utility peers. On April 21, we announced a $0.415 common stock dividend which represents a 10.7% increase over the previous dividend. This dividend is payable on June 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of May 5, 2017. This increase represents the fifth year in a row that we have had dividend increases at or above the top end of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, many of you have asked about the Trump administration's infrastructure plans and how they might impact us. So I'll just speak to that very briefly. 
As you know, tackling our nation's infrastructure challenges for roads, bridges, airports and water infrastructure is a priority for the administration, and for good reasons. First and foremost are the safety and health of our citizens, and there are also compelling economic and competitive justifications. We know reliable infrastructure is foundational for communities and businesses to thrive, and investment also stimulates the economy through job creation. For example, every $1 million in water infrastructure investment yields 16 jobs. So American Water's $1.3 billion invested in water and wastewater infrastructure this year will support 165,000 jobs. 
The details of an infrastructure package are still not clear, but the administration has been clear on the need for private sector involvement. For us, a focus on the need to invest in infrastructure is a good thing. For as long as you have been listening to our calls, we've been talking about the need for and our efforts to upgrade and maintain our systems to ensure clean, safe and reliable water services, all while running our business safely and efficiently so that our customer bills are affordable. 
So as we applaud these efforts by the administration and are actively involved in these policy development efforts to support our customers' interest, it doesn't really change our ongoing investment scope, plans or commitment. Regardless of what happens in Washington, we will continue to focus on serving our customers, assuring water quality and strengthening our infrastructure. And we will do this as we also partner and assist communities seeking help with their own water and wastewater service challenges. 
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

And just as some background, and I'm really glad you asked the question. So if you look at American Water, in the past 4 years, we've actually doubled our market capitalization. We've increased our regulated acquisitions. We've also increased our capital investment. And you also pair that with the fact that we have an aging workforce. And so we've, over the past 2 to 3 years, been looking at strengthening an already really strong team. And we have so many professional who have worked here for a long time. But for example, last year, we brought in a new Chief of Innovation and Technology Officer, Radha Swaminathan, because he brought some unique capabilities from his time in the electric utility industry and what they had done in technology. We brought in a new head of R&D and Emerging Technology because Dr. Mark LeChevallier is retiring at the end of this year. We brought in a new controller, Melissa Wikle. And we also promoted several people inside to bigger and higher jobs. So really, with Eric and Brian, it's a continuation of that. And Eric is actually in business development in Mark Strauss' group. And that group -- as we talked about at Investor Day in December, that group supports the regulated acquisitions strategies that are states employ, but also, we're always looking at the landscape of are there new states we want to enter? And we've talked about the conditions that we would have to have before we did that. And we also look at are there other opportunities. But that's not the basis of our growth triangle and that's not the focus mainly of what we're doing. And with Brian, actually, it's a different role than that, is that as we've gotten bigger and as we look at our corporate strategies and our financial strategy convergence, we're bringing in talent that has decades of experience of looking at creative financial planning, how you integrate corporate strategy with financial planning, being able to look at financial modeling, how we evaluate, making sure we make really good, smart financial decisions. And I'll tell you, with the addition of Melissa and Brian and the continued outstanding work that Ed Vallejo brings; our VP and Treasurer, Jen Gambol, our team here, really, we brought these hires in to really make us even stronger than we have been in the past. And it's pretty exciting."

And it is one of the reasons that, in December, we shared kind of the long -- and you see in the deck today, that we shared the long process it takes in terms of acquiring a municipality is, that even if there is interest and they expressed an interest, when you're a municipality, there's a lot of efforts, politics that are in play. You have to get a lot of people on board. You have to get a lot of people aligned. It's not quick. It would be much faster if the business was corporate acquisitions, which has its own set of issues. But in a municipality, we also understand that these are elected officials, and they want to make sure not just that they're getting a good price for their system, but that the people who buy their system and their assets are able to serve their citizens well over the coming years. And this is a big interest. A lot of these mayors and council folks say, ""Yes, price is one thing, and yes, we need to have more capital. But on the other hand, I have to make sure that this is going to last for the next several years and that we don't put our city in a situation where we have service issues."" So you're exactly right, Angie. As we do more and more work with emerging contaminants, as we are looking not just at lead but other contaminants that aren't regulated that we have growing concerns about and we're looking at ways to deal with them, we are sharing with municipalities all over the country our efforts, our value proposition. And some of them are interested, some of them aren't, but it's not a fast process. And I don't think it will ever be a fast process because of the politics involved. And I know one thing that will help, though, and Walter can mention, the Water Quality Accountability Act in New Jersey is one thing that it takes effect across the country because basically, private water companies like us are held to higher standards or we’re -- actually the regulations are enforced more strongly with us than they are with municipalities. And we believe that all people deserve clean water. And so you may want to talk about what's going on in New Jersey, Walter."

So it would take such huge numbers of, I'll call, free money, to have a big impact. However, there's always the issue, and one of the things that we're doing to watch out for our customers is our customers pay taxes just like the customers of municipalities, so what we're asking for is a level playing field. For example, the state revolving funds that get funding nationally, federally, we can participate in states that allow us to on the water side but not on the wastewater side. So we're working on policy efforts to ensure that if there are pools of low-cost money, that we have access to them equal to what the municipals have access to, and again, because all of our customers pay taxes also. So for us, it is -- there's also, in some conversations that we've been involved with in Washington, the trillion-dollar infrastructure is not $1 trillion in actual funding. It is finding ways that you have offset the need for that. So our ability to invest, job creation, those types of things could actually be used as a measure to count toward that.

The primary negatives for the quarter were 2 key 2017 items and 2 favorable items in the second quarter of 2016, which did not recur this year. $0.02 of earnings were down quarter-over-quarter from the lower capital upgrade in our Military Services Group. We've covered this on past calls, and it's related to reduced military budgets, combined with the completion of a large wastewater project at Fort Polk in the first half of 2016. Additionally, we had a one-time $0.02 tax adjustment from a state income tax change in New York that Linda mentioned on our last quarter call. She'll discuss this in more detail, as well as another state income tax change in Illinois. 
The quarter was also impacted by last year's favorable weather of $0.02 per share compared to a more normal second quarter this year and a 2016 one time $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract. However, even including these items in our range, we continue to affirm our $2.98 to $3.08 EPS guidance for 2017. 
Our regulated core business continues solid growth, delivering a 3.7% increase in net income for the quarter. During the first half of 2017, we added approximately 15,000 customers through closed acquisitions and 7,000 from organic growth. Walter will speak a little bit more about the pending acquisition agreements we have in place as of July 31 that will add about 34,000 additional customers. 
We continue to invest in our regulated business. This year, we will invest $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion total capital with the vast majority dedicated to water and wastewater system improvement and upgrade. We balanced those investments by operating efficiently and effectively, which is reflected in our O&M efficiency ratio. 
On the marketplace side, although we are experiencing lower capital upgrades in Military Services, we continue to perform our 50-year O&M contract quite affectively. We are completing the capital upgrades we do have, and we're working with basis to identify potential infrastructure projects for the 2018 fiscal year. Additionally, we have 8 RFPs outstanding, with the possibility of 1 or 2 awards being made this year by the Department of Defense. 
We continue to expand Homeowner Services, including a new partnership with Yonkers, New York. At Keystone Clearwater, we are seeing increases in rig count and well completions in the Appalachian region and have an increased backlog of work scheduled in the second half of the year. 
So while there are a number of items impacting this quarter's results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings for 2017 in our guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08. 
Beyond 2017 and for the longer term, our business fundamentals and outlook continue to be strong and compelling. Our growth triangle still holds, as does our long-term 7% to 10% EPS guidance. 
Now, let me turn the call over to Walter to give you his update on our regulated business."
250885,420006590,1264598,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. And Susan mentioned, our regulated business as delivered year-over-year second quarter growth by continuing capital investments and driving operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. Let's walk through some high",944,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. And Susan mentioned, our regulated business as delivered year-over-year second quarter growth by continuing capital investments and driving operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. 
Let's walk through some highlights of this quarter. On July 21, after a strong show of support in the New Jersey Legislature, Governor Christie signed a Water Quality Accountability Act. In fact, the New Jersey State Assembly and a bipartisan show of support passed the legislation 76 to 0, which was followed by the state Senate vote of 39 to 0. This legislation calls for such things like regular testing of valves and hydrants, a 150-year pipe replacement rate, implementation of a cybersecurity program and action plans for notices of violation. 
We see this as a good thing because, first and foremost, it ensures that all citizens in New Jersey have safe, secure and clean water. It's also a great model for future legislation across the nation. American Water stands ready to be a solutions provider as other systems look to make needed investments. 
This quarter, 2 states received orders to adjust rates. The New York Public Service Commission issued an order they will add $3.6 million in annualized revenue to recover about $150 million in water system improvements. These investments made over the past 5 years include the replacing of over 33 miles of water mains and bringing 1 new iron removal treatment plan online, while making improvements to 3 other treatment plants. We also reduced operating expenses by $2.7 million in the same time period. 
In Virginia, the State Corporation Commission issued an order that add $5.2 million in annualized revenue to recover $53 million in infrastructure improvements made since 2012. Here too, we reduced operating expenses by 2% since our last rate case. This is a great job by our New York and Virginia teams as every dollar we save, we can invest $7 in our systems with no customer goal impact. 
During the quarter, we filed 2 rate request, 1 in Pennsylvania, which we discussed last quarter, and 1 in Missouri. On June 30, we filed a rate case in Missouri, requesting an increase of $84 million in annualized revenue. This request covers investment of $490 million in water and wastewater infrastructure. Included in this investment is the replacement of a large treatment plan at Parkville and installation of AMI meters in St. Louis County, while will give customers more timely billing information. It also helps us monitor usage better, which is important in monitoring leaks. 
Finally, in West Virginia, we filed for an updated infrastructure surcharge to incorporate new project to be started in 2018 over and above the 2017 projects now underway. The 2018 projects include $29.9 million that we'll invest in various systemwide upgrades, including replacement or upgrade of more than 39 miles of water mains and upsizing 2 water storage tanks. These investments will drive system reliability and equate to only $1 increase per customer per month. 
Turning to Slide 10. We added about a 15,000 new customers from closed acquisitions through June. As discussed last quarter, we closed on our [indiscernible] New Jersey acquisition, adding 11,000 customers. In California, we closed the Meadowbrook Water Company, serving approximately 1,700 customers. We also entered into a contract to purchase the Fruitridge Vista Water Company, which serves approximately 4,800 customers. 
Among the acquisitions pending approval, the largest is McKeesport Pennsylvania, which will add 22,000 customers. We expect that acquisition will close later this year or in early 2018. This and other pending acquisitions will add approximately 34,000 customers. The remaining 7,000 new customers added during the first half of the year came from organic growth. 
Moving to Slide 11. We continue to increase operating efficiencies across our company so that we can make smart investments without significantly impacting customer bills. Our adjusted O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2017. We continue to work towards our goal of 32.5% by 2021. 
Let me highlight 2 examples of the steps we've taken to drive the efficiencies. After modifying our process for a new service installation, the field worker now has the ability to tap the main, run the service line and install the meter on 1 visit as opposed to multiple visits in the past. As a result, the project team generated nearly $0.25 million in savings in 8 states over the past 12 months. We plan to roll this new process out nationally. In addition, they continue to drive efficiencies, reduce waste and improve the safety across the entire company by routinely conducting waste walks. 1 waste walk in Tennessee resulted in a modification of existing meter lids, which improved meter reading accuracy and resulted in annual savings of about $150,000. We are looking to expand this modification across all of our systems. 
On Slide 12. One final highlight is in the town of Bel Air, Maryland, where we've identified a much needed backup water supply. We recently broke ground for a 90 million-gallon water and pump and reservoir and a new intake. If all goes as planned, the $50 million [indiscernible] will provide service in 2019. This is a great example of many parties coming together to ensure a long-term water supply solution. We thank state and local officials, community members from Bel Air and Harford County for helping make this solution a reality. In fact, the Town Administrator, Jessie Bane, said that the solution saved the town from what could have been its eventual demise if it didn't have a reliable source for water. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail in our financial performance."
250885,420006590,1264598,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our second quarter results, 2 legislative tax changes impacting us of this year and our earnings guidance range. Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.73 per share, do",874,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our second quarter results, 2 legislative tax changes impacting us of this year and our earnings guidance range. 
Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.73 per share, down $0.04 from second quarter last year. Susan outlined the primary drivers of the lower quarter-over-quarter results, so let me walk through the results by business segment. I'll start with our regulated segment. 
For the quarter, our Regulated Businesses were up $0.02 per share. Revenue was up $0.12 per share. Included in that $0.12 increase was about $0.09 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support capital growth, and $0.04 from acquisitions and organic growth, partially offsetting this was $0.01 of lower demand. 
Next, as Susan mentioned, we had favorable weather and the second quarter of last year, which negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. O&M expense was high or $0.04 per share from increased production costs mainly in California, increased waste disposal cost driven by acquisition growth and higher customer uncollectible expense. 
Finally, we had higher depreciation and interest expense of $0.04 per share driven by our investment growth. 
I would like to point out that although the growth rate for the Regulated Businesses was lower this quarter, their results are on plan for the year. 
Turning to the Market-Based Businesses. We were down $0.02 per share compared to the same period last year. As anticipated, we continue to experience lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group, which includes a quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016. In addition, as Susan mentioned, in the second quarter of 2016, we had a $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract settlement. 
Homeowner Services came in relatively flat for the quarter as revenue growth of $4 million was offset by higher claims expense and several true-ups related to our system implementation of last year. [indiscernible] results were also relatively flat for the quarter, although we are seeing increased activity and backlog expected to favorably impact the second half of the year. 
Lastly, the parent was down $0.04 per share in the quarter. $0.02 was due to the one-time cumulative tax adjustment from the legislative changes adopted in New York during the second quarter, which I'll cover in more detail in a moment. We also had higher interest expense and other of $0.02 to support growth. 
On Slide 15, let me discuss in more detail 2 legislative tax changes that occurred this year. As I discussed last quarter, we had a legislative change in New York that no longer allowed water utilities to qualify for the manufacturing exemption. This will increase our effective state tax rate in New York beginning in January of 2018. Also, effective July 1 of this year, Illinois increased the state's corporate income tax rate from 7.75% to 9.5%. Both of these changes require us to remeasure our deferred tax balances at the new rate in the period of the tax law change, so in the second quarter for New York and the third quarter for Illinois. This one-time, noncash, cumulative adjustment of the deferred tax balances will total $17 million. A portion of this adjustment calculated on a stand-alone basis for each regulated state subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates, but will be recorded as a regulatory asset of $10 million in total. 
The remaining portion will be allocated to the parent through our state tax apportionment factors and will reduce 2017 earnings by $7 million or $0.04 per share in total. This earnings decrease is included in our annual earnings guidance range from today. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $65.4 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $43 million authorized through general rate cases and $22.4 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 2 infrastructure charges for a total annualized revenue request of $234.9 million. 
Turning to Slide 17. Today, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items that are included in the earnings guidance range. First, weather variability of plus or minus $0.07 is included in the range. The third quarter is generally when we experience a majority for weather impacts. And through July, we've experienced warmer weather in several states, approximately $0.01 benefit versus normal weather in July. However, as you know, we are only 1 month into the third quarter. Second, as we mentioned at our December and previous earnings call, we expect to lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 due to the completion of a large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduced military budget. 
And then finally, included in the guidance range are the portion of the onetime cumulative tax adjustments expected to reduce 2017 earnings by $0.04 per share as I discussed earlier. Again, these items are included in our affirmed earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your requests, I'd like to talk a few minutes about customer owned lead service lines in American Water's efforts to address this growing national issue. With the problems of leadpipe highlighted in Flint last year,",480,"Thanks, Walter and Linda. Before taking your requests, I'd like to talk a few minutes about customer owned lead service lines in American Water's efforts to address this growing national issue. With the problems of leadpipe highlighted in Flint last year, we know that having confidence in the quality of their water is most critical to our customers. American Water has increased our communication and educational efforts to our customers about lead, and we're taking progressive steps to help them with their own lead lines. Our scientists, along with the EPA, had determined that when we're replacing our water main, it's in the customers best interest to replace their own lead service lines at the same time. So we're working with our states to develop plans to do just that, which includes a priority focus on low income customers. 
Pennsylvania American Water has filed a PC request to replace customer owned lead service lines when we're repairing or replacing company-owned lines. Customers there who believe they have a lead line may also contact the company, and once verified, we will replace them over a period of time. In New Jersey, we conducted a lead service line replacement pilot project in a financially distressed communities and replaced customer lead lines when we found them. We're working with our regulators at the BTU on recovery of these investments. We will continue to replace customer owned lead lines as they are encountered during our main renewal and replacement programs. 
In Missouri, we had filed the plan and have already replaced around 60 customer lines in a pilot project. We expect to replace lead service lines of about 100 to 150 customer homes this year in Missouri. In fact, you can see a picture on the bottom left of an impressive hard-working crew with 1 lightweight on the far right side in here steel toed boots and hardhat. While in St. Louis County last week, I had opportunity to watch our crews do a water main replacement and identify those homes with customer lead service lines for replacement. They said everyone was very positive, and one customer even gave our guy a bear hug. 
In Indiana, enabling legislation passed for replacement of customer owned lead service line. We're working with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for approval for our plan under the new law, including projects in financially distressed communities with higher lead line concentration. 
And finally, the Virginia Department of Health is funding a grant program for lead service line replacement. And we're pleased that Virginia American was approved for some of the funding. Our efforts are beyond anything that is required and are driven first and foremost by our commitment to the safety of our customers and our communities. It is simply the right thing to do. 
So with that, operator, we're happy to take the questions of any of our participants."

And it shouldn't matter who is running their water system as in terms of its quality of that water. So we think it's good model legislation. The fact, as Walter mentioned, that it was unanimously passed in the assembly. The Senate, is just really extraordinary in this day and age. So we're very encouraged by that.

There's a timing issue there, and one of the comments I made is that we scheduled projects, we plan projects, we schedule projects and we run a backlog schedule for the second half of the year. What we found in the Appalachian is that it did pick up, but it's not picked up as quickly. And interesting think that's happening in Appalachian now because things have been quite busy in the Permian that a lot of the E&Ps have actually had trouble keeping group, keeping the crews on the rig side. So now they are trying to get more people up here. So it's been a little slower than they thought. So that's one of the things that we're hearing from our Keystone Clearwater. They are now trying to make sure that we're able to recruit enough people. I mean, we have hired 75 people just this year and are trying to higher even more to staff our crews. So it's pretty competitive to get crews. Now  with what's happening in the oil markets now, don't know if that's going to slowdown in the Permian and release more for work in Appalachian, we certainly hope so. But we do have active projects planned, an interesting just from a statistic standpoint, as of July 28, there were 192 active rigs in the U.S. and 75 were in the Appalachian basin. And just last year, that was 86. So we do see an increase in the number of rigs, a number of completions and hopefully, some of the labor shortage issues will be taken cared off so we can see more of a buildup and Appalachian work more quickly."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our second quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. I'll start with what I'm sure are your 2 main questions today: why our earnings were down $0.04 for the quarter, and why we're affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.98 to $3.08. A key fact is that our Regulated Business continues to execute and deliver solid results. 
Second quarter 2017 results we're impacted by several items, some of which we've noted in earlier calls. The primary negatives for the quarter were 2 key 2017 items and 2 favorable items in the second quarter of 2016, which did not recur this year. $0.02 of earnings were down quarter-over-quarter from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group. We've covered this on past calls, and it's related to reduced military budgets combined with the completion of a large wastewater project at Fort Polk in the first half of 2016. Additionally, we had a onetime $0.02 tax adjustment from a state income tax change in New York that Linda mentioned on our last quarter call. She'll discuss this in more detail as well as another state income tax change in Illinois. 
The quarter was also impacted by last year's favorable weather of $0.02 per share compared to a more normal second quarter this year and a 2016 onetime $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract settlement. However, even including these items in our range, we continue to affirm our $2.98 to $3.08 EPS guidance for 2017. 
Our Regulated core business continues solid growth, delivering a 3.7% increase in net income for the quarter. During the first half of 2017, we added approximately 15,000 customers through closed acquisitions and 7,000 from organic growth. Walter will speak a little bit more about the pending acquisition agreements we have in place as of July 31 that will add about 34,000 additional customers. We continue to invest in our Regulated Business. This year, we will invest $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion total capital with the vast majority dedicated to water and wastewater system improvements and upgrades. We balanced those investments by operating efficiently and effectively, which is reflected in our O&M efficiency ratio. 
On the Market-Based side, although we are experiencing lower capital upgrades in military services, we continue to perform our 50-year O&M contract quite affectively. We are completing the capital upgrades we do have, and we're working with basis to identify potential infrastructure projects for the 2018 fiscal year. Additionally, we have 8 RFPs outstanding with the possibility of 1 or 2 awards being made this year by the Department of Defense. 
We continue to expand homeowner services, including a new partnership with Yonkers, New York. At Keystone Clearwater, we are seeing increases in rig count and well completions in the Appalachian region and have an increased backlog of work scheduled in the second half of the year. 
So while there are a number of items impacting this quarter's results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings for 2017 in our guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08. Beyond 2017 and for the longer term, our business fundamental and outlook continue to be strong and compelling. Our growth triangle still holds as does our long-term 7% to 10% EPS guidance. 
Now let me turn the call over to Walter to give you his update on our Regulated Business."
250885,420006590,1264947,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Business has delivered year-over-year second quarter growth by continuing capital investments and driving operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. Let's walk through some high",939,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Business has delivered year-over-year second quarter growth by continuing capital investments and driving operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. 
Let's walk through some highlights of this quarter. On July 21, after a strong show of support in the New Jersey Legislature, Governor Christie signed the Water Quality Accountability Act. In fact, the New Jersey State Assembly, in a bipartisan show of support, passed the legislation 76 to 0, which was followed by the state Senate vote of 39 to 0. This legislation calls for such things like regular testing of valves and hydrants, a 150-year pipe replacement rate, implementation of a cybersecurity program and action plans for notices of violation. We see this as a good thing because, first and foremost, it ensures that all citizens in New Jersey have safe, secure and clean water. It's also a great model for future legislation across the nation. American Water stands ready to be a solutions provider as other systems look to make needed investments. 
This quarter, 2 states received orders to adjust rates. The New York Public Service Commission issued an order that will add $3.6 million in annualized revenue to recover about $150 million in water system improvements. These investments made over the past 5 years include replacing over 33 miles of water mains and bringing 1 new iron removal treatment plant online, while making improvements to 3 other treatment plants. We also reduced operating expenses by $2.7 million in the same time period. 
In Virginia, the State Corporation Commission issued an order that adds $5.2 million in annualized revenue to recover $53 million in infrastructure improvements made since 2012. Here, too, we reduced operating expenses by 2% since our last rate case. This is a great job by our New York and Virginia teams as every dollar we save, we can invest $7 in our systems with no customer bill impact. 
During the quarter, we filed 2 rate requests, 1 in Pennsylvania, which we discussed last quarter; and 1 in Missouri. On June 30, we filed a rate case in Missouri requesting an increase of $84 million in annualized revenue. This request covers investment of $490 million in water and wastewater infrastructure. Included in this investment is the replacement of a large treatment plant at Parkville and the installation of AMI meters in St. Louis County, while will give customers more timely billing information. It also helps us monitor usage better, which is important in identifying leaks. 
Finally, in West Virginia, we filed for an updated infrastructure surcharge to incorporate new projects to be started in 2018 over and above the 2017 projects now underway. The 2018 projects include $29.9 million that we'll invest in various systemwide upgrades, including replacement or upgrade of more than 39 miles of water mains and upsizing 2 water storage tanks. These investments will drive system reliability and equate to only a $1 increase per customer per month. 
Turning to Slide 10. We added about a 15,000 new customers from closed acquisitions through June. As discussed last quarter, we closed on our Shorelands, New Jersey acquisition, adding 11,000 customers. In California, we closed the Meadowbrook Water Company, serving approximately 1,700 customers. We also entered into a contract to purchase the Fruitridge Vista Water Company, which serves approximately 4,800 customers. Among the acquisitions pending approval, the largest is McKeesport, Pennsylvania, which will add 22,000 customers. We expect that acquisition will close later this year or in early 2018. This and other pending acquisitions will add approximately 34,000 customers. The remaining 7,000 new customers added during the first half of the year came from organic growth. 
Moving to Slide 11. We continue to increase operating efficiencies across our company so that we can make smart investments without significantly impacting customer bills. Our adjusted O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2017. We continue to work towards our goal of 32.5% by 2021. 
Let me highlight 2 examples of the steps we're taking to drive efficiencies. After modifying our process for a new service installation, a field worker now has the ability to tap the main, run the service line and install the meter on one visit as opposed to multiple visits in the past. As a result, the project team generated nearly $0.25 million in savings in 8 states over the past 12 months. We plan to roll this new process out nationally. In addition, we continue to drive efficiencies, reduce waste and improve safety across the entire company by routinely conducting waste walks. One waste walk in Tennessee resulted in a modification of existing meter lids, which improved meter reading accuracy and resulted in annual savings of about $150,000. We're looking to expand this modification across all of our systems. 
On Slide 12. One final highlight is in the town of Bel Air, Maryland, where we've identified a much needed backup water supply. We recently broke ground for a 90 million-gallon water impoundment reservoir and a new intake. If all goes as planned, the $15 million impoundment will provide service in 2019. This is a great example of many parties coming together to ensure a long-term water supply solution. We thank state and local officials, community members from Bel Air and Harford County for helping make this solution a reality. In fact, the town administrator, Jesse Bane, said that the solution saved the town from what could have been its eventual demise if it didn't have a reliable source for water. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

Today I will cover our second quarter results, 2 legislative tax changes impacting us this year and our earnings guidance range. Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.73 per share, down",874,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our second quarter results, 2 legislative tax changes impacting us this year and our earnings guidance range. 
Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.73 per share, down $0.04 from second quarter last year. Susan outlined the primary drivers of the lower quarter-over-quarter results, so let me walk through the results by business segment. I'll start with our Regulated segment. 
For the quarter, our Regulated Businesses were up $0.02 per share. Revenue was up $0.12 per share. Included in that $0.12 increase was about $0.09 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support capital growth, and $0.04 from acquisitions and organic growth. Partially offsetting this was $0.01 of lower demand. 
Next, as Susan mentioned, we had favorable weather in the second quarter of last year, which negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. O&M expense was higher $0.04 per share from increased production costs mainly in California, increased waste disposal costs driven by acquisition growth and higher customer uncollectible expense. 
Finally, we had higher depreciation and interest expense of $0.04 per share driven by our investment growth. I would like to point out that although the growth rate for the Regulated Businesses was lower this quarter, their results are on plan for the year. 
Turning to the Market-Based Businesses. We were down $0.02 per share compared to the same period last year. As anticipated, we continue to experience lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group, which includes the quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016. In addition, as Susan mentioned, in the second quarter of 2016, we had a $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract settlement. 
Homeowner services came in relatively flat for the quarter as revenue growth of $4 million was offset by higher claims expense and several true-ups related to our system implementation last year. Keystone results were also relatively flat for the quarter, although we are seeing increased activity and backlog expected to favorably impact the second half of the year. 
Lastly, the parent was down $0.04 per share in the quarter. $0.02 was due to the onetime cumulative tax adjustment from the legislative change adopted in New York during the second quarter, which I'll cover in more detail in a moment. We also had higher interest expense and other of $0.02 to support growth. 
On Slide 15, let me discuss in more detail 2 legislative tax changes that occurred this year. As I discussed last quarter, we had a legislative change in New York that no longer allowed water utilities to qualify for the manufacturing exemption. This will increase our effective state tax rate in New York beginning in January of 2018. Also, effective July 1 of this year, Illinois increased the state's corporate income tax rate from 7.75% to 9.5%. Both of these changes require us to remeasure our deferred tax balances at the new rates in the period of the tax law change so in the second quarter for New York and the third quarter for Illinois. This onetime, noncash, cumulative adjustment of the deferred tax balances will total $17 million. A portion of this adjustment calculated on a standalone basis for each regulated state subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and will be recorded as a regulatory asset of $10 million in total. The remaining portion will be allocated to the parent through our state tax apportionment factors and will reduce 2017 earnings by $7 million or $0.04 per share in total. This earnings decrease is included in our annual earnings guidance range affirmed today. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $65.4 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $43 million authorized through general rate cases and $22.4 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 2 infrastructure charges for a total annualized revenue request of $234.9 million. 
Turning to Slide 17. Today, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items that are included in the earnings guidance range. 
First, weather variability of plus or minus $0.07 is included in the range. The third quarter is generally when we experience a majority for weather impacts. And through July, we have experienced warmer weather in several states, approximately $0.01 benefit versus normal weather in July. However, as you know, we are only 1 month into the third quarter. Second, as we mentioned at our December Investor Conference and previous earnings calls, we expect the lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 due to the completion of the large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduced military budget. And then finally, included in the guidance range are the portion of the onetime cumulative tax adjustments expected to reduce 2017 earnings by $0.04 per share, as I discussed earlier. Again, these items are included in our affirmed earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your requests, I'd like to talk a few minutes about customer-owned lead service lines and American Water's efforts to address this growing national issue. With the problems of lead pipe highlighted in Flint last yea",477,"Thanks, Walter and Linda. Before taking your requests, I'd like to talk a few minutes about customer-owned lead service lines and American Water's efforts to address this growing national issue. With the problems of lead pipe highlighted in Flint last year, we know that having confidence in the quality of their water is most critical to our customers. American Water has increased our communications and educational efforts to our customers about lead, and we're taking progressive steps to help them with their own lead lines. Our scientists, along with the EPA, had determined that when we're replacing our water main, it's in the customers best interest to replace their own lead service lines at the same time. So we're working with our states to develop plans to do just that, which includes a priority focus on low income customers. 
Pennsylvania American Water has filed a PC request to replace customer-owned lead service lines when we're repairing or replacing company-owned lines. Customers there who believe they have a lead line may also contact the company. And once verified, we would replace them over a period of time. 
In New Jersey, we conducted a lead service line replacement pilot project in a financially distressed communities and replaced customer lead lines when we found them. We're working with our regulators at the BPU on recovery of these investments. We will continue to replace customer-owned lead lines as they are encountered during our main renewal and replacement programs. 
In Missouri, we have filed a plan and have already replaced around 60 customer lines in a pilot project. We expect to replace lead service lines of about 100 to 150 customer homes this year in Missouri. In fact, you can see a picture on the bottom left of an impressive hard-working crew with one lightweight on the far right side in her steel-toed boots and hard hat. While in St. Louis County last week, I had opportunity to watch our crews do a water main replacement and identify those homes with customer lead service lines for replacement. They said everyone was very positive, and one customer even gave our guy a bear hug. 
In Indiana, enabling legislation passed for replacement of customer-owned lead service lines. We're working with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for approval for our plan under the new law, including projects in financially distressed communities with higher lead line concentration. 
And finally, the Virginia Department of Health is funding a grant program for lead service line replacement, and we're pleased that Virginia American was approved for some of the funding. 
Our efforts are beyond anything that is required and are driven, first and foremost, by our commitment to the safety of our customers and our communities. It is simply the right thing to do.

And one of the comments I made is that we schedule projects -- we plan projects and schedule projects, and we have a backlog scheduled for the second half of the year. What we found in the Appalachian is that it did pick up, but it's not picked up as quickly. And interesting think that's happening in Appalachian now because things have been quite busy in the Permian that a lot of the E&Ps have actually had trouble keeping groups, keeping the crews on the rig sites, so now they're trying to get more people up here. So it's been a little slower than they thought. So that's one of the things that we're hearing from our Keystone Clearwater. They are now trying to make sure that we're able to recruit enough people. I mean, we have hired 75 people just this year and are trying to hire even more to staff our crews, so it's pretty competitive to get crews. Now with what's happening in the oil markets now, don't know if that's going to slow down in the Permian and release more for work in Appalachian. We certainly hope so, but we do have active projects planned. And interesting just from a statistic standpoint, as of July 28, there were 192 active rigs in the U.S. and 75 were in the Appalachian basin. And just last year, that was 86. So we do see an increase in the number of rigs, a number of completions and hopefully, some of the labor shortage issues will be taken care off so we can see more of a buildup in Appalachian more quickly."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our second quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. I'll start with what I'm sure are your 2 main q",577,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our second quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. I'll start with what I'm sure are your 2 main questions today: why our earnings were down $0.04 for the quarter, and why we're affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.98 to $3.08. A key fact is that our Regulated Business continues to execute and deliver solid results. 
Second quarter 2017 results we're impacted by several items, some of which we've noted in earlier calls. The primary negatives for the quarter were 2 key 2017 items and 2 favorable items in the second quarter of 2016, which did not recur this year. $0.02 of earnings were down quarter-over-quarter from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group. We've covered this on past calls, and it's related to reduced military budgets combined with the completion of a large wastewater project at Fort Polk in the first half of 2016. Additionally, we had a onetime $0.02 tax adjustment from a state income tax change in New York that Linda mentioned on our last quarter call. She'll discuss this in more detail as well as another state income tax change in Illinois. 
The quarter was also impacted by last year's favorable weather of $0.02 per share compared to a more normal second quarter this year and a 2016 onetime $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract settlement. However, even including these items in our range, we continue to affirm our $2.98 to $3.08 EPS guidance for 2017. 
Our Regulated core business continues solid growth, delivering a 3.7% increase in net income for the quarter. During the first half of 2017, we added approximately 15,000 customers through closed acquisitions and 7,000 from organic growth. Walter will speak a little bit more about the pending acquisition agreements we have in place as of July 31 that will add about 34,000 additional customers. We continue to invest in our Regulated Business. This year, we will invest $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion total capital with a vast majority dedicated to water and wastewater system improvements and upgrades. We balance those investments by operating efficiently and effectively, which is reflected in our O&M efficiency ratio. 
On the Market-Based side, although we are experiencing lower capital upgrades in military services, we continue to perform our 50-year O&M contracts quite affectively. We are completing the capital upgrades we do have, and we're working with bases to identify potential infrastructure projects for the 2018 fiscal year. Additionally, we have 8 RFPs outstanding with the possibility of 1 or 2 awards being made this year by the Department of Defense. 
We continue to expand homeowner services, including a new partnership with Yonkers, New York. At Keystone Clearwater, we are seeing increases in rig count and well completions in the Appalachian region and have an increased backlog of work scheduled in the second half of the year. 
So while there are a number of items impacting this quarter's results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings for 2017 in our guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08. Beyond 2017 and for the longer term, our business fundamentals and outlook continue to be strong and compelling. Our growth triangle still holds as does our long-term 7% to 10% EPS guidance. 
Now let me turn the call over to Walter to give you his update on our Regulated Business."

In fact, the New Jersey State Assembly, in a bipartisan show of support, passed the legislation 76 to 0, which was followed by the state Senate vote of 39 to 0. This legislation calls for such things like regular testing of valves and hydrants, a 150-year pipe replacement rate, implementation of a cybersecurity program and action plans for notices of violation. We see this as a good thing because, first and foremost, it ensures that all citizens in New Jersey have safe, secure and clean water. It's also a great model for future legislation across the nation. American Water stands ready to be a solutions provider as other systems look to make needed investments. 
This quarter, 2 states received orders to adjust rates. The New York Public Service Commission issued an order that will add $3.6 million in annualized revenue to recover about $150 million in water system improvements. These investments made over the past 5 years include replacing over 33 miles of water mains and bringing 1 new iron removal treatment plant online, while making improvements to 3 other treatment plants. We also reduced operating expenses by $2.7 million in the same time period. 
In Virginia, the State Corporation Commission issued an order that adds $5.2 million in annualized revenue to recover $53 million in infrastructure improvements made since 2012. Here, too, we reduced operating expenses by 2% since our last rate case. This is a great job by our New York and Virginia teams as every dollar we save, we can invest $7 in our systems with no customer bill impact. 
During the quarter, we filed 2 rate requests, 1 in Pennsylvania, which we discussed last quarter; and 1 in Missouri. On June 30, we filed a rate case in Missouri requesting an increase of $84 million in annual revenue. This request covers investment of $490 million in water and wastewater infrastructure. Included in this investment is the replacement of a large treatment plant at Parkville and the installation of AMI meters in St. Louis County, which will give customers more timely billing information. It also helps us monitor usage better, which is important in identifying leaks. 
Finally, in West Virginia, we filed for an updated infrastructure surcharge to incorporate new projects to be started in 2018 over and above the 2017 projects now underway. The 2018 projects include $29.9 million that we'll invest in various systemwide upgrades, including replacement or upgrade of more than 39 miles of water mains and upsizing 2 water storage tanks. These investments will drive system reliability and equate to only a $1 increase per customer per month. 
Turning to Slide 10. We added about a 15,000 new customers from closed acquisitions through June. As discussed last quarter, we closed on our Shorelands, New Jersey acquisition, adding 11,000 customers. In California, we closed the Meadowbrook Water Company, serving approximately 1,700 customers. We also entered into a contract to purchase the Fruitridge Vista Water Company, which serves approximately 4,800 customers. Among the acquisitions pending approval, the largest is McKeesport, Pennsylvania, which will add 22,000 customers. We expect that acquisition will close later this year or in early 2018. This and other pending acquisitions will add approximately 34,000 customers. The remaining 7,000 new customers added during the first half of the year came from organic growth. 
Moving to Slide 11. We continue to increase operating efficiencies across our company so that we can make smart investments without significantly impacting customer bills. Our adjusted O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2017. We continue to work towards our goal of 32.5% by 2021. 
Let me highlight 2 examples of the steps we're taking to drive efficiencies. After modifying our process for a new service installation, a field worker now has the ability to tap the main, run the service line and install the meter on one visit as opposed to multiple visits in the past. As a result, the project team generated nearly $0.25 million in savings in 8 states over the past 12 months. We plan to roll this new process out nationally. In addition, we continue to drive efficiencies, reduce waste and improve safety across the entire company by routinely conducting waste walks. One waste walk in Tennessee resulted in a modification of existing meter lids, which improved meter reading accuracy and resulted in annual savings of about $150,000. We're looking to expand this modification across all of our systems. 
On Slide 12. One final highlight is in the town of Bel Air, Maryland, where we've identified a much needed backup water supply. We recently broke ground for a 90 million-gallon water impoundment reservoir and a new intake. If all goes as planned, the $15 million impoundment will provide service in 2019. This is a great example of many parties coming together to ensure a long-term water supply solution. We thank state and local officials, community members from Bel Air and Harford County for helping make this solution a reality. In fact, the town administrator, Jesse Bane, said that the solution saved the town from what could have been its eventual demise if it didn't have a reliable source for water. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

Today I will cover our second quarter results, 2 legislative tax changes impacting us this year and our earnings guidance range. Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.73 per share, down",876,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our second quarter results, 2 legislative tax changes impacting us this year and our earnings guidance range. 
Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.73 per share, down $0.04 from second quarter last year. Susan outlined the primary drivers of the lower quarter-over-quarter results, so let me walk through the results by business segment. I'll start with our Regulated segment. 
For the quarter, our Regulated Businesses were up $0.02 per share. Revenue was up $0.12 per share. Included in that $0.12 increase was about $0.09 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support capital growth, and $0.04 from acquisitions and organic growth. Partially offsetting this was $0.01 of lower demand. 
Next, as Susan mentioned, we had favorable weather in the second quarter of last year, which negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. O&M expense was higher $0.04 per share from increased production costs mainly in California, increased waste disposal costs driven by acquisition growth and higher customer uncollectible expense. 
Finally, we had higher depreciation and interest expense of $0.04 per share driven by our investment growth. I would like to point out that although the growth rate for the Regulated Businesses was lower this quarter, their results are on plan for the year. 
Turning to the Market-Based Businesses. We were down $0.02 per share compared to the same period last year. As anticipated, we continue to experience lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group, which includes the quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016. In addition, as Susan mentioned, in the second quarter of 2016, we had a $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract settlement. 
Homeowner services came in relatively flat for the quarter as revenue growth of $4 million was offset by higher claims expense and several true-ups related to our system implementation last year. Keystone results were also relatively flat for the quarter, although we are seeing increased activity and backlog expected to favorably impact the second half of the year. 
Lastly, the parent was down $0.04 per share in the quarter. $0.02 was due to the onetime cumulative tax adjustment from the legislative change adopted in New York during the second quarter, which I'll cover in more detail in a moment. We also had higher interest expense and other of $0.02 to support growth. 
On Slide 15, let me discuss in more detail 2 legislative tax changes that occurred this year. As I discussed last quarter, we had a legislative change in New York that no longer allowed water utilities to qualify for the manufacturing exemption. This will increase our effective state tax rate in New York beginning in January of 2018. Also, effective July 1 of this year, Illinois increased the state's corporate income tax rate from 7.75% to 9.5%. Both of these changes require us to remeasure our deferred tax balances at the new rates in the period of the tax law change so in the second quarter for New York and the third quarter for Illinois. This onetime, noncash, cumulative adjustment of the deferred tax balances will total $17 million. A portion of this adjustment calculated on a standalone basis for each regulated state subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and will be recorded as a regulatory asset of $10 million in total. The remaining portion will be allocated to the parent through our state tax apportionment factors and will reduce 2017 earnings by $7 million or $0.04 per share in total. This earnings decrease is included in our annual earnings guidance range affirmed today. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $65.4 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $43 million authorized through general rate cases and $22.4 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 2 infrastructure charges for a total annualized revenue request of $234.9 million. 
Turning to Slide 17. Today, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items that are included in the earnings guidance range. 
First, weather variability of plus or minus $0.07 is included in the range. The third quarter is generally when we experience the majority of our weather impacts. And through July, we have experienced warmer weather in several states, approximately a $0.01 benefit versus normal weather in July. However, as you know, we are only 1 month into the third quarter. Second, as we mentioned at our December Investor Conference and previous earnings calls, we expect the lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 due to the completion of the large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduced military budget. And then finally, included in the guidance range are the portion of the onetime cumulative tax adjustments expected to reduce 2017 earnings by $0.04 per share, as I discussed earlier. Again, these items are included in our affirmed earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your requests, I'd like to talk a few minutes about customer-owned lead service lines and American Water's efforts to address this growing national issue. With the problems of lead pipe highlighted in Flint last year, we know that having confidence in the quality of their water is most critical to our customers. American Water has increased our communications and educational efforts to our customers about lead, and we're taking progressive steps to help them with their own lead lines. Our scientists, along with the EPA, have determined that when we're replacing our water main, it's in the customers best interest to replace their own lead service lines at the same time. So we're working with our states to develop plans to do just that, which includes a priority focus on low income customers. 
Pennsylvania American Water has filed a PUC request to replace customer-owned lead service lines when we're repairing or replacing company-owned lines. Customers there who believe they have a lead line may also contact the company. And once verified, we would replace them over a period of time. 
In New Jersey, we conducted a lead service line replacement pilot project in a financially distressed community and replaced customer lead lines when we found them. We're working with our regulators at the BPU on recovery of these investments. We will continue to replace customer-owned lead lines as they are encountered during our main renewal and replacement programs. 
In Missouri, we have filed a plan and have already replaced around 60 customer lines in a pilot project. We expect to replace lead service lines of about 100 to 150 customer homes this year in Missouri. In fact, you can see a picture on the bottom left of an impressive hard-working crew with one lightweight on the far right side in her steel-toed boots and hard hat. While in St. Louis County last week, I had opportunity to watch our crews do a water main replacement and identify those homes with customer lead service lines for replacement. They said everyone was very positive, and one customer even gave our guy a bear hug. 
In Indiana, enabling legislation passed for replacement of customer-owned lead service lines. We're working with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for approval for our plan under the new law, including projects in financially distressed communities with higher lead line concentration. 
And finally, the Virginia Department of Health is funding a grant program for lead service line replacements, and we're pleased that Virginia American was approved for some of the funding. 
Our efforts are beyond anything that is required and are driven, first and foremost, by our commitment to the safety of our customers and our communities. It is simply the right thing to do. 
So with that, operator, we're happy to take the questions of any of our participants."

And one of the comments I made is that we schedule projects -- we plan projects and schedule projects, and we have a backlog scheduled for the second half of the year. What we found in the Appalachian is that it did pick up, but it's not picked up as quickly. And interesting think that's happening in Appalachian now because things have been quite busy in the Permian that a lot of the E&Ps have actually had trouble keeping groups, keeping the crews on the rig sites, so now they're trying to get more people up here. So it's been a little slower than they thought. So that's one of the things that we're hearing from our Keystone Clearwater. They are now trying to make sure that we're able to recruit enough people. I mean, we have hired 75 people just this year and are trying to hire even more to staff our crews, so it's pretty competitive to get crews. Now with what's happening in the oil markets now, don't know if that's going to slow down in the Permian and release more for work in Appalachian. We certainly hope so, but we do have active projects planned. And interesting just from a statistic standpoint, as of July 28, there were 192 active rigs in the U.S. and 75 were in the Appalachian basin. And just last year, that was 86. So we do see an increase in the number of rigs, the number of completions and hopefully, some of the labor shortage issues will be taken care off so we can see more of a buildup in Appalachia more quickly."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our second quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. I'll start with what I'm sure are your 2 main questions today: why our earnings were down $0.04 for the quarter, and why we're affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.98 to $3.08. A key fact is that our Regulated Business continues to execute and deliver solid results. 
Second quarter 2017 results we're impacted by several items, some of which we've noted in earlier calls. The primary negatives for the quarter were 2 key 2017 items and 2 favorable items in the second quarter of 2016, which did not recur this year. $0.02 of earnings were down quarter-over-quarter from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group. We've covered this on past calls, and it's related to reduced military budgets combined with the completion of a large wastewater project at Fort Polk in the first half of 2016. Additionally, we had a onetime $0.02 tax adjustment from a state income tax change in New York that Linda mentioned on our last quarter call. She'll discuss this in more detail as well as another state income tax change in Illinois. 
The quarter was also impacted by last year's favorable weather of $0.02 per share compared to a more normal second quarter this year and a 2016 onetime $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract settlement. However, even including these items in our range, we continue to affirm our $2.98 to $3.08 EPS guidance for 2017. 
Our Regulated core business continues solid growth, delivering a 3.7% increase in net income for the quarter. During the first half of 2017, we added approximately 15,000 customers through closed acquisitions and 7,000 from organic growth. Walter will speak a little bit more about the pending acquisition agreements we have in place as of July 31 that will add about 34,000 additional customers. We continue to invest in our Regulated Business. This year, we will invest $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion total capital with a vast majority dedicated to water and wastewater system improvements and upgrades. We balance those investments by operating efficiently and effectively, which is reflected in our O&M efficiency ratio. 
On the Market-Based side, although we are experiencing lower capital upgrades in military services, we continue to perform our 50-year O&M contracts quite affectively. We are completing the capital upgrades we do have, and we're working with bases to identify potential infrastructure projects for the 2018 fiscal year. Additionally, we have 8 RFPs outstanding with the possibility of 1 or 2 awards being made this year by the Department of Defense. 
We continue to expand homeowner services, including a new partnership with Yonkers, New York. At Keystone Clearwater, we are seeing increases in rig count and well completions in the Appalachian region and have an increased backlog of work scheduled in the second half of the year. 
So while there are a number of items impacting this quarter's results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings for 2017 in our guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08. Beyond 2017 and for the longer term, our business fundamentals and outlook continue to be strong and compelling. Our growth triangle still holds as does our long-term 7% to 10% EPS guidance. 
Now let me turn the call over to Walter to give you his update on our Regulated Business."
250885,420006590,1269152,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Business has delivered year-over-year second quarter growth by continuing capital investments and driving operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. Let's walk through some high",939,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Business has delivered year-over-year second quarter growth by continuing capital investments and driving operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. 
Let's walk through some highlights of this quarter. On July 21, after a strong show of support in the New Jersey Legislature, Governor Christie signed the Water Quality Accountability Act. In fact, the New Jersey State Assembly, in a bipartisan show of support, passed the legislation 76 to 0, which was followed by the state Senate vote of 39 to 0. This legislation calls for such things like regular testing of valves and hydrants, a 150-year pipe replacement rate, implementation of a cybersecurity program and action plans for notices of violation. We see this as a good thing because, first and foremost, it ensures that all citizens in New Jersey have safe, secure and clean water. It's also a great model for future legislation across the nation. American Water stands ready to be a solutions provider as other systems look to make needed investments. 
This quarter, 2 states received orders to adjust rates. The New York Public Service Commission issued an order that will add $3.6 million in annualized revenue to recover about $150 million in water system improvements. These investments made over the past 5 years include replacing over 33 miles of water mains and bringing 1 new iron removal treatment plant online, while making improvements to 3 other treatment plants. We also reduced operating expenses by $2.7 million in the same time period. 
In Virginia, the State Corporation Commission issued an order that adds $5.2 million in annualized revenue to recover $53 million in infrastructure improvements made since 2012. Here, too, we reduced operating expenses by 2% since our last rate case. This is a great job by our New York and Virginia teams as every dollar we save, we can invest $7 in our systems with no customer bill impact. 
During the quarter, we filed 2 rate requests, 1 in Pennsylvania, which we discussed last quarter; and 1 in Missouri. On June 30, we filed a rate case in Missouri requesting an increase of $84 million in annual revenue. This request covers investment of $490 million in water and wastewater infrastructure. Included in this investment is the replacement of a large treatment plant at Parkville and the installation of AMI meters in St. Louis County, which will give customers more timely billing information. It also helps us monitor usage better, which is important in identifying leaks. 
Finally, in West Virginia, we filed for an updated infrastructure surcharge to incorporate new projects to be started in 2018 over and above the 2017 projects now underway. The 2018 projects include $29.9 million that we'll invest in various systemwide upgrades, including replacement or upgrade of more than 39 miles of water mains and upsizing 2 water storage tanks. These investments will drive system reliability and equate to only a $1 increase per customer per month. 
Turning to Slide 10. We added about a 15,000 new customers from closed acquisitions through June. As discussed last quarter, we closed on our Shorelands, New Jersey acquisition, adding 11,000 customers. In California, we closed the Meadowbrook Water Company, serving approximately 1,700 customers. We also entered into a contract to purchase the Fruitridge Vista Water Company, which serves approximately 4,800 customers. Among the acquisitions pending approval, the largest is McKeesport, Pennsylvania, which will add 22,000 customers. We expect that acquisition will close later this year or in early 2018. This and other pending acquisitions will add approximately 34,000 customers. The remaining 7,000 new customers added during the first half of the year came from organic growth. 
Moving to Slide 11. We continue to increase operating efficiencies across our company so that we can make smart investments without significantly impacting customer bills. Our adjusted O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2017. We continue to work towards our goal of 32.5% by 2021. 
Let me highlight 2 examples of the steps we're taking to drive efficiencies. After modifying our process for a new service installation, a field worker now has the ability to tap the main, run the service line and install the meter on one visit as opposed to multiple visits in the past. As a result, the project team generated nearly $0.25 million in savings in 8 states over the past 12 months. We plan to roll this new process out nationally. In addition, we continue to drive efficiencies, reduce waste and improve safety across the entire company by routinely conducting waste walks. One waste walk in Tennessee resulted in a modification of existing meter lids, which improved meter reading accuracy and resulted in annual savings of about $150,000. We're looking to expand this modification across all of our systems. 
On Slide 12. One final highlight is in the town of Bel Air, Maryland, where we've identified a much needed backup water supply. We recently broke ground for a 90 million-gallon water impoundment reservoir and a new intake. If all goes as planned, the $15 million impoundment will provide service in 2019. This is a great example of many parties coming together to ensure a long-term water supply solution. We thank state and local officials, community members from Bel Air and Harford County for helping make this solution a reality. In fact, the town administrator, Jesse Bane, said that the solution saved the town from what could have been its eventual demise if it didn't have a reliable source for water. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

Today I will cover our second quarter results, 2 legislative tax changes impacting us this year and our earnings guidance range. Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.73 per share, down",876,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our second quarter results, 2 legislative tax changes impacting us this year and our earnings guidance range. 
Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.73 per share, down $0.04 from second quarter last year. Susan outlined the primary drivers of the lower quarter-over-quarter results, so let me walk through the results by business segment. I'll start with our Regulated segment. 
For the quarter, our Regulated Businesses were up $0.02 per share. Revenue was up $0.12 per share. Included in that $0.12 increase was about $0.09 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support capital growth, and $0.04 from acquisitions and organic growth. Partially offsetting this was $0.01 of lower demand. 
Next, as Susan mentioned, we had favorable weather in the second quarter of last year, which negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. O&M expense was higher $0.04 per share from increased production costs mainly in California, increased waste disposal costs driven by acquisition growth and higher customer uncollectible expense. 
Finally, we had higher depreciation and interest expense of $0.04 per share driven by our investment growth. I would like to point out that although the growth rate for the Regulated Businesses was lower this quarter, their results are on plan for the year. 
Turning to the Market-Based Businesses. We were down $0.02 per share compared to the same period last year. As anticipated, we continue to experience lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group, which includes the quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016. In addition, as Susan mentioned, in the second quarter of 2016, we had a $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract settlement. 
Homeowner services came in relatively flat for the quarter as revenue growth of $4 million was offset by higher claims expense and several true-ups related to our system implementation last year. Keystone results were also relatively flat for the quarter, although we are seeing increased activity and backlog expected to favorably impact the second half of the year. 
Lastly, the parent was down $0.04 per share in the quarter. $0.02 was due to the onetime cumulative tax adjustment from the legislative change adopted in New York during the second quarter, which I'll cover in more detail in a moment. We also had higher interest expense and other of $0.02 to support growth. 
On Slide 15, let me discuss in more detail 2 legislative tax changes that occurred this year. As I discussed last quarter, we had a legislative change in New York that no longer allowed water utilities to qualify for the manufacturing exemption. This will increase our effective state tax rate in New York beginning in January of 2018. Also, effective July 1 of this year, Illinois increased the state's corporate income tax rate from 7.75% to 9.5%. Both of these changes require us to remeasure our deferred tax balances at the new rates in the period of the tax law change so in the second quarter for New York and the third quarter for Illinois. This onetime, noncash, cumulative adjustment of the deferred tax balances will total $17 million. A portion of this adjustment calculated on a standalone basis for each regulated state subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and will be recorded as a regulatory asset of $10 million in total. The remaining portion will be allocated to the parent through our state tax apportionment factors and will reduce 2017 earnings by $7 million or $0.04 per share in total. This earnings decrease is included in our annual earnings guidance range affirmed today. 
Turning to Slide 16. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $65.4 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $43 million authorized through general rate cases and $22.4 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases and 2 infrastructure charges for a total annualized revenue request of $234.9 million. 
Turning to Slide 17. Today, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items that are included in the earnings guidance range. 
First, weather variability of plus or minus $0.07 is included in the range. The third quarter is generally when we experience the majority of our weather impacts. And through July, we have experienced warmer weather in several states, approximately a $0.01 benefit versus normal weather in July. However, as you know, we are only 1 month into the third quarter. Second, as we mentioned at our December Investor Conference and previous earnings calls, we expect the lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 due to the completion of the large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduced military budget. And then finally, included in the guidance range are the portion of the onetime cumulative tax adjustments expected to reduce 2017 earnings by $0.04 per share, as I discussed earlier. Again, these items are included in our affirmed earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your requests, I'd like to talk a few minutes about customer-owned lead service lines and American Water's efforts to address this growing national issue. With the problems of lead pipe highlighted in Flint last yea",477,"Thanks, Walter and Linda. Before taking your requests, I'd like to talk a few minutes about customer-owned lead service lines and American Water's efforts to address this growing national issue. With the problems of lead pipe highlighted in Flint last year, we know that having confidence in the quality of their water is most critical to our customers. American Water has increased our communications and educational efforts to our customers about lead, and we're taking progressive steps to help them with their own lead lines. Our scientists, along with the EPA, have determined that when we're replacing our water main, it's in the customers best interest to replace their own lead service lines at the same time. So we're working with our states to develop plans to do just that, which includes a priority focus on low income customers. 
Pennsylvania American Water has filed a PUC request to replace customer-owned lead service lines when we're repairing or replacing company-owned lines. Customers there who believe they have a lead line may also contact the company. And once verified, we would replace them over a period of time. 
In New Jersey, we conducted a lead service line replacement pilot project in a financially distressed community and replaced customer lead lines when we found them. We're working with our regulators at the BPU on recovery of these investments. We will continue to replace customer-owned lead lines as they are encountered during our main renewal and replacement programs. 
In Missouri, we have filed a plan and have already replaced around 60 customer lines in a pilot project. We expect to replace lead service lines of about 100 to 150 customer homes this year in Missouri. In fact, you can see a picture on the bottom left of an impressive hard-working crew with one lightweight on the far right side in her steel-toed boots and hard hat. While in St. Louis County last week, I had opportunity to watch our crews do a water main replacement and identify those homes with customer lead service lines for replacement. They said everyone was very positive, and one customer even gave our guy a bear hug. 
In Indiana, enabling legislation passed for replacement of customer-owned lead service lines. We're working with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for approval for our plan under the new law, including projects in financially distressed communities with higher lead line concentration. 
And finally, the Virginia Department of Health is funding a grant program for lead service line replacements, and we're pleased that Virginia American was approved for some of the funding. 
Our efforts are beyond anything that is required and are driven, first and foremost, by our commitment to the safety of our customers and our communities. It is simply the right thing to do. 
So with that, operator, we're happy to take the questions of any of our participants."

I mean, we invest very, very little capital, actual capital to the same point of it's not taking capital away from the Regulated Business because we do very little capital investment. And in fact, when we talk about the capital projects or the fixed capital upgrades on our military bases, that's working capital only. Because the way the Department of Defense operates is typically they like to own the assets, so we basically get recovery plus a margin on that working capital. So another way to look at it is it's more of a margin business."

And one of the comments I made is that we schedule projects -- we plan projects and schedule projects, and we have a backlog scheduled for the second half of the year. What we found in the Appalachian is that it did pick up, but it's not picked up as quickly. And interesting think that's happening in Appalachian now because things have been quite busy in the Permian that a lot of the E&Ps have actually had trouble keeping groups, keeping the crews on the rig sites, so now they're trying to get more people up here. So it's been a little slower than they thought. So that's one of the things that we're hearing from our Keystone Clearwater. They are now trying to make sure that we're able to recruit enough people. I mean, we have hired 75 people just this year and are trying to hire even more to staff our crews, so it's pretty competitive to get crews. Now with what's happening in the oil markets now, don't know if that's going to slow down in the Permian and release more for work in Appalachian. We certainly hope so, but we do have active projects planned. And interesting just from a statistic standpoint, as of July 28, there were 192 active rigs in the U.S. and 75 were in the Appalachian basin. And just last year, that was 86. So we do see an increase in the number of rigs, the number of completions and hopefully, some of the labor shortage issues will be taken care off so we can see more of a buildup in Appalachia more quickly."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan will cover our third quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. Moving to Slide 5. Our employees delivered so",722,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan will cover our third quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. Moving to Slide 5. 
Our employees delivered solid financial performance and continue to execute on our strategies in the third quarter. These strategies include: prioritizing employee and customer safety; building constructive regulatory relationships through transparency and credibility; providing excellent service to our customers; growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operations to keep bills affordable for our customers. 
Our third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share, an increase of $0.03 per share or 2.9% over the same period in 2016. This 2017 third quarter adjusted numbers excludes a positive $0.07 related to an entrance settlement from the Freedom Industry's chemical spill, which you may remember was a negative $0.22 in last year's third quarter.  This quarter's adjusted number also excludes $0.02 of an early debt refinancing charge at the parent. Linda will discuss this in more detail in her comments.
With a solid results we've seen year-to-date and projected through the year end, we've narrowed our adjusted earnings guidance to $3 to $3.06 per share. Our foundation for growth continues to be providing safe and reliable service by investing wisely and effectively in our regulated operations. We've made more than a $1 billion in capital investments in the first 9-month, and we're on track to invest about $1.65 billion for the full year, with a vast majority dedicated to water and wastewater system replacement and improvement. We remained focused on controlling our O&M expenses to ensure that every dollar we spend on infrastructure replacement has minimal impact on our customers' bill. We're extremely proud of our employees efforts to improve efficiencies, and their commitment comes from a deeply ingrained culture at American Water to provide the best-quality water and water services to our customers at an affordable price.
Our folks live in the communities we serve, and all of our employees are keenly aware of the importance of keeping customer bills affordable. This commitment to customer care contributes to our growth. This year, we have welcomed about 16,000 new customers from acquisition and 10,400 customers from organic growth in our service area. We also have signed agreement, representing another 45,000 customers pending regulatory approvals. We also saw growth this quarter in our market-based businesses, mainly driven by our Homeowner Services Group. HOS currently has $1.7 million customer contracts that serve more than 825,000 customers in 43 states and Washington, DC. Keystone Clearwater remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, but is still projected to be accretive this year due to increased activity and work during the latter part of the year.
A real highlight of the quarter was our Military Services Group win of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. We consider it an honor and a privilege to serve the military men and women, who defend our country and our liberty. This base is the 13th installation to partner with American Water. We're fully committed to providing industry-leading water and wastewater services to Wright-Patterson for next 50 years. We also had 3 other significant accomplishments, I'd like to highlight for the quarter. First, we completed a $1.35 billion debt financing, which is the largest since our IPO in 2008. These interest savings will provide significant long-term benefit, primarily for our regulated customers. Linda will discuss this financing in more detail. 
Second, you may remember that in the third quarter of last year, we entered into a global bonding agreement in principle related to the Freedom Industry's chemicals spill in West Virginia. 2 of our insurance carriers providing coverage of up to $25 million each, chose not to participate in that settlement agreement at that time. We have now settled with 1 of those carriers. And this $22 million settlement reduces West Virginia American Water's total pretax cost from $65 million to $43 million. We continue in arbitration with the remaining insurance carriers. 
And third, Walter will discuss in a moment, our filing for a proposed black-box settlement agreement among intervenors in our Pennsylvania rate case, which remains subject to approval. So all said, we're on track to meet our long-term 7% to 10% long-term EPS guidance. Walter will, now, give you his update on our regulated business."
250885,420006595,1329344,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2017",2017-11-02,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our regulated businesses continue to show strength through growth, increase investment in infrastructure, improve customer service and progress made to manage our expenses. Let's walk through so",966,"Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. 
As Susan mentioned, our regulated businesses continue to show strength through growth, increase investment in infrastructure, improve customer service and progress made to manage our expenses. Let's walk through some of the highlights of the quarter. 
We currently have active rate cases in our 3 largest states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Missouri. In Pennsylvania, we entered into a proposed settlement agreement in October 16 that will provide additional annualized water and wastewater revenues of $62 million. As you may recall, this case was driven by $1.3 billion in capital investments to ensure reliable service. The proposed settlement agreement is under review by the presiding Ministry of Law Judges, and will then go before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for approval. We anticipate a decision before year end, and are hopeful, we can discuss the settlement further on our December 11 guidance call. 
Moving to New Jersey. We filed a general rate case in September 15, seeking $129 million in annualized revenue over 3 years. Since our last rate adjustment in 2015, we invested more than $868 million in infrastructure upgrades. These investments included replacing more than 200 miles of water main and a flood protection project at our Stone water treatment facility.  Susan will talk about our efforts to mitigate extreme weather impacts later, but this project will ensure the sustainability of the water supply for more than 1 million people in 7 counties in central New Jersey. That level of investment also had a positive impact to New Jersey's economy, creating approximately 14,000 jobs across the state.
As we mentioned last call, we filed a rate case in Missouri, requesting an increase of $84 million in annual revenue, driven by more than $490 million in investment in our systems. This case marks the first future test filing by Missouri American Water, and we appreciate the commission's openness to consider in this case. 
Moving to California. The fires that occurred last month in Sinoma and Napa counties have been devastating to the communities there, including 1 of our service areas, Larkfield. We're still assessing the damage. But we estimate that about a 1/4 of our service district, about 600 homes have been destroyed. We're working with our impacted customers during this difficult time. While recovery work is still underway to replace damaged equipment, we were pleased that we maintained water service for firefighting during the event, and restored full portable water services for the vast majority of residents there within a matter of days. We're also very pleased to announce that California American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation provided a grant of $100,000 to the North Bay fire relief for individuals and families impacted by the wildfires.
I want to thank our team in California for responding quickly to our customers during this crisis, and most importantly, for staying safe. 
Turning to Slide 9. Let me touch briefly on weather for the quarter. As you know, we had a $0.02 benefit from hot, dry weather in third quarter of 2016. In the third quarter of 2017, we experienced warmer weather in several states through July. However, during the remainder of the quarter, we saw more rain and cooler temperatures in the Northeast. We've spoken in the past about how our geographic diversity allows us to manage the weather fluctuation and limit their impact. As a result, weather did net positively or negatively impact our revenues for the third quarter of 2017.
Linda will cover the quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date earnings impact. 
Turning to Slide 10. We added about 16,000 new customers to date through completed acquisitions and more than 10,000 through organic growth. In October, we also received an approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission of our McKeesport Pennsylvania Wastewater acquisition. This is great progress, and we expect this acquisition will close later this year. We're excited to add these 22,000 new customers and welcome our new employees. As Susan mentioned, we have pending agreements to welcome 45,000 more customers, which includes McKeesport acquisition. We're pleased that this represents 11,000 more pending customers than we had last quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 11. Doing right by our customer is key to our ability to grow, this means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. During the first 9 months of the year, we invested $963 million of which the majority was dedicated to regulated operations to keep our service reliable.  We also continue to keep our service affordable by working more efficiently throughout our business. 
Our O&M efficiency ratio decreased from 34.9% to 34.2% for the last 12 months ending September 30, 2017. We're on track to achieve our long-term goal of 32.5% by 2021. Thanks, again, to our employees and their commitment our customers. 
Technology is also being a critical role. Let me give you a couple of examples of this. In Illinois, we're using technology to make the operation of our Bradley Avenue treatment plan in Champagne more cost-efficient through automation. During a 9-month period this year, we've already saved more than $200,000, while effectively managing our plant. We expect to achieve savings of about $300,000 annually. 
In Pennsylvania, our operations team is using cellular leak detection instruments to find and fix leaks before they lead to 2 main breaks. This technology provides remote alarming and automatic data uploads from any location, where self-service is available. Through this technology, we're saving 11 million gallons of water per day. Additionally, it's estimated that it's about 10x cheaper to fix a leak before the watermain breaks. The technology and operational efficiency are core to our strategies, and these examples demonstrate how our company is using innovation to better serve our customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start with our third quarter 2017 results on Slide 13. GAAP earnings were $1.13 per share, an increase of $0.30 compared to the same period last year. We had a few non-GAAP adjustments in both period",1317,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our third quarter 2017 results on Slide 13. 
GAAP earnings were $1.13 per share, an increase of $0.30 compared to the same period last year. We had a few non-GAAP adjustments in both periods, so let me start with those. 
First, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the Freedom Industries' chemical spill settlement activity. In 2016, we entered into a binding global agreement in principle to settle all claims associated with this matter, of which West Virginia American Water's share, net of insurance recovery was a pretax charge of $65 million or $0.22 per share. At that time, 2 of our insurers providing coverage of up to $25 million each did not agree to participate in the settlement and we initiated legal actions to pursue recovery.  In the third quarter of 2017, we reached a settlement with 1 of those insurers to recover $22 million pretax or a $0.07 per share benefit. With this insurance settlement, West Virginia American Water's share of its $126 million Freedom Industries settlement was reduced from $65 million to $43 million pretax. 
Consistent with prior year treatment of the settlement, this benefit was reflected as a non-GAAP adjustment. 
Also in August, we completed a $1.35 billion financing, which I will discuss in greater detail in few slides. A portion of the proceeds was used to refinance certain higher cost debt before their original maturity days in 2018 and 2021. This resulted in early debt extinguishment charges of $34 million in total. The majority of this amount or $28 million is expected to be recovered through customer rates and was recorded as regulatory assets and did not impact earnings. However, $6 million or $0.02 per share was associated with parent company debt and recorded as a charge to earnings. We've reflected this item as non-GAAP adjustment consistent with prior year treatment of similar charges. 
Excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share, an increase of $0.03 or 2.9% over the same period in 2016, with the regulated segment up $0.05, the market-based businesses up $0.03 and the parent was unfavorable $0.05.
Turning to Slide 14. Let me walk through our adjusted quarterly results by each business. Our regulated operations were up $0.05 in total. Revenue was up $0.08 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support growth and acquisition, and this is net of lower demand or declining usage of about 1%. Also in the third quarter of 2016, we had warmer weather as Walter discussed, which negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. Next, we had higher net depreciation, interest and general taxes of $0.03 driven by investment growth. And then finally, all other items the resulted in a benefit of $0.02 mainly from our continuous focus on cost management.
Turning to our market-based businesses. We were up $0.03 compared to the same period last year. The majority of this increase was from Homeowner Services, from customer growth and price increases. Although we continue to experience lower capital projects in the Military Services Group, we are excited to announce the agreement with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, which represents partnership with our 13th military base. This contract will add $490 million in revenue over the 50-year contract term. And with the addition of this base, our backlog of revenue associated with our military contract is over $3.5 billion over the remaining contract terms. And then lastly, the parent was down $0.05 per share in the quarter. $0.02 was due to the cumulative tax adjustment, I discussed last quarter, related to the July 1 increase in our state income tax rate in Illinois. This change required us to remeasure our deferred tax balances at the new rate in the third quarter.
The cumulative adjustment totaled $7 million. The portion calculated on a stand-alone basis for Illinois is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and was recorded as a regulatory asset. The remaining portion was allocated to the parent through our state tax factors and reduced 2017 earnings by $0.02 per share. The remaining $0.03 of the parent was from higher interest expense to support growth of $0.01, and an overlap of interest expense related to our August financing of about $0.01. The overlap was because we had $428 million of parent debt that didn't actually mature until October of this year, but was part of the financing in August. And lastly, we had a $0.01 tax benefit recognized last year.
Turning to Slide 15. Our year-to-date adjusted earnings were $2.34 per share or a 3% increase over adjusted earnings in the same period last year. Our regulated operations were up $0.12 per share in total, which includes the $0.04 negative year-over-year impact from weather as Walter discussed. Our market based businesses were up $0.01 with the favorable third quarter results in our Homeowner Services Group exceeding the impact from lower capital project in our Military Services Group. Parent and other were down $0.06, mainly due to the 2 discrete tax adjustments associated with legislative changes in New York and Illinois, impacting state tax 
Now let me discuss in more detailed the August $1.35 billion financing on Slide 16. This was the largest financing at American Water since our IPO in 2008, and our team did an extraordinary job executing this transaction.
Overall, the transaction reduced our long-term embedded cost of debt by 48 basis points, mainly for the benefit of our regulated customers. It reduced our 5-year debt maturities by $876 million, and it increased the average tenure of our debt from about 13 years to almost 16 years. Those are the highlights. Now let me discuss the deal. 
We financed $1.35 billion with $750 million of 30-year debt at a 3.75% interest rate and $600 million of 10-year debt at a 2.95% interest rate. The funds will be used for 3 primary per possess. New debt to support growth of $440 million, refinancing of debt maturing in 2017 of $557 million, and $353 million for early refinancing of debt maturing in 2018 and 2021, including the make whole.  These transactions were designed to take advantage of lower interest rates for our customers. 
Turning to Slide 17. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filing. We have $66 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year from general rate cases and infrastructure mechanism. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on rate cases, infrastructure surcharges and proposed settlement for a total annualized revenue request of $321 million. This includes the Pennsylvania rate case proposed settlement of $62 million that Walter discussed.
Turning to Slide 18. Our cash flow from operations grew about 4.3% to $986 million for the first 9 months of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by net income growth in our regulated and market based businesses. 
Turning to dividends. On October 31, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly cash dividend of $0.41.5 per share to shareholders of record on November 10 and payable on December 1 of this year. And as a reminder, for 5 years straight, we have grown our dividend at or above the top of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS growth range. 
Turning to Slide 19. Today, we are narrowing our 2017 adjusted earnings guidance range to $3 to $3.06 per share. As you know, we traditionally do not make many non-GAAP adjustments, and when we do, we want to be consistent and transparent. This year, we have had 2 items excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance range. The $0.07 per share benefit from the insurance settlement related to Freedom Industries' chemical spill and the $0.02 per share charge from early debt extinguishment at the parent company. These are reported as non-GAAP adjustments consistent with our treatment in prior years. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to mention the extraordinary weather and fire events that we've experienced in our country and our American Water service areas over the past few months. Given our geographic diversity, we are oftentimes located within natural disaster areas or close enough to offer help to other communities. With every event we say, safety comes first. We prepare, we leverage national resources and we look to help impacted community. 
In August, hurricane Harvey hit our operations in Louisiana, dumping about 20 inches of rain on the bay. The storm also had a lesser effect on our Texas operations. Our employees, who work there and those who came to help worked tirelessly during and after the storm to maintain service to both military communities. In September, Hurricane Irma made landfall in Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm. By the time the storm moved of the cost to deceleration facility, we operate in Tampa, our Contract Services Group had emergency plant and facility made it through the storm with a little to no damage and no flooding.  The plant and our people were there to help the community during the recovery. And just last month, as Walter shared, our team in California responded to the tragic fires in Sonoma and Napa Counties, maintaining water service for firefighting during the event and restoring full portable water service for the vast majority of our residents there within a matter of few days. Whether it's hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, storms or wildfires, our response to all of these events highlight our commitment to resiliency of water and sanitation services for our customers. We use a systematic approach to assess the vulnerability of all of our assets, and we continually prioritize our critical infrastructure investment.
Our engineering and operations team examined every facility we own and our regional water supply to develop a capital plan to determine how much and what kind of investment is needed to ensure ongoing safe and reliable service to our customers, both during and after these disasters. We evaluate historic conditions combined with future predictions and we consider factors like a 100-year flood, which now seems to be occurring every 20 years and other impacts of climate variability. These engineering planning studies drive our capital needs assessment, business planning and our financial forecasting. 
During a significant weather event, a water utilities level of preparedness can literally remain the difference between a temporary inconvenience or a serious health or environmental consequence for our customers. We know that and we prepare for it. It's our job and we do it well.
I'm extremely proud of our people and their commitment to doing what's right for our customers and our communities every day. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people, who are recovering from these natural disasters. 
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

I'll start on your last question, and then turn it over to Walter, let him add and then address the issue of Water Quality and Accountability Act in New Jersey. So with the fair market value in Pennsylvania, we think it's important to have an appraisal process that fairy values the systems we're acquiring, and also sets a fair and sustainable base rate for our customers. We don't want a high appraisal value just to get a higher base rate and we want the right base rate for us and our customers for the long term. We don't think system should be undervalued or overvalued because we think either 1 hurts the process long-term and the spirit of the law. Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation requires appraisals to meet the uniform standards that professional appraisal sector has. And there've been some questions about, so what is the Pennsylvania PUC, what their role, what's not. In our look, and we've gotten an approval for McKeesport under that. We think that the Pennsylvania PUC can see the appraisal and determine if they comply. If appraisers do not comply, just should be made, complying with the standards is a check and balance that we think, clearly, the Public Utility Commission has authority for. So in our recent PUC application for the McKeesport acquisition, we sat down with the parties. We sat down with PUC staff, we sat down with advocates. We listened to their issues and we try to find a way forward that we could all lived with. And we're very pleased that this was approved -- the settlement that we reached with the staff, with the consumers there all approved by the public commission last week. So Walter, do you want to add anything to that."

And I think the acquisition is example of that. The first acquisition in the state where we are dealing with the issue of combined sewer and storm water, currently Pennsylvania American Water tariff for wastewater. We have a number of different tariffs because we've done so many acquisitions over the years. So working through the first issue that I said, the combined sewage and storm water and also working through not having the combined on the sewer side, it takes a lot of cooperation and lot of dialogue with the number of parties, including the Office of Consumer Advocate and Commission Staff to get the right place. But I think we've done that, the team is than great job in working with all the parties. I think it's another example, of how we're working to make sure we get settlement for all in as a perfect example of that."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our third quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations.
Moving to Slide 5. Our employees delivered solid financial performance and continue to execute on our strategies in the third quarter. These strategies include: prioritizing employee and customer safety, building constructive regulatory relationships through transparency and credibility, providing excellent service to our customers, growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operations to keep bills affordable for our customers.
Our third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share, an increase of $0.03 per share or 2.9% over the same period in 2016. This 2017 third quarter adjusted number excludes a positive $0.07 related to an insurance settlement from the Freedom Industries chemical spill, which you may remember was a negative $0.22 in last year's third quarter.  This quarter's adjusted number also excludes $0.02 of an early debt refinancing charge at the parent. Linda will discuss this in more detail in her comments.
With the solid results we've seen year-to-date and projected through the year-end, we've narrowed our adjusted earnings guidance to $3 to $3.06 per share. Our foundation for growth continues to be providing safe and reliable service by investing wisely and effectively in our Regulated operations. We've made more than a $1 billion in capital investments in the first 9 months, and we're on track to invest about $1.65 billion for the full year, with a vast majority dedicated to water and wastewater system replacements and improvements. We remained focused on controlling our O&M expenses to ensure that every dollar we spend on infrastructure replacement has minimal impact on our customers' bill.
We're extremely proud of our employees efforts to improve efficiencies, and their commitment comes from a deeply ingrained culture at American Water to provide the best-quality water and water services to our customers at an affordable price. Our folks live in the communities we serve, and all of our employees are keenly aware of the importance of keeping customer bills affordable. This commitment to customer care contributes to our growth. This year, we have welcomed about 16,000 new customers from acquisitions and 10,400 customers from organic growth in our service areas. We also have signed agreements, representing another 45,000 customers pending regulatory approvals.
We also saw growth this quarter in our market-based businesses, mainly driven by our Homeowner Services Group. HOS currently has $1.7 million customer contracts that serve more than 825,000 customers in 43 states and Washington, D.C. Keystone Clearwater remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter but is still projected to be accretive this year due to increased activity and work during the latter part of the year.
A real highlight of the quarter was our Military Services Group win of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. We consider it an honor and a privilege to serve the military men and women who defend our country and our liberty. This base is the 13th installation to partner with American Water. We're fully committed to providing industry-leading water and wastewater services to Wright-Patterson for the next 50 years.
We also had 3 other significant accomplishments I'd like to highlight for the quarter. First, we completed a $1.35 billion debt financing, which is the largest since our IPO in 2008. These interest savings will provide significant long-term benefits, primarily for our Regulated customers. Linda will discuss this financing in more detail.
Second, you may remember that in the third quarter of last year, we entered into a global bonding agreement in principle related to the Freedom Industries chemicals spill in West Virginia. Two of our insurance carriers providing coverage of up to $25 million each chose not to participate in that settlement agreement at that time. We have now settled with one of those carriers. And this $22 million settlement reduces West Virginia American Water's total pretax cost from $65 million to $43 million. We continue in arbitration with the remaining insurance carrier.
And third, Walter will discuss in a moment, our filing for a proposed black-box settlement agreement among intervenors in our Pennsylvania rate case, which remains subject to approval. So all said, we're on track to meet our long-term 7% to 10% long-term EPS guidance.
Walter will now give you his update on our Regulated Business."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses continue to show strength through growth, increased investment in infrastructure, improved customer service and progress made to manage our expenses. Let's walk through so",973,"Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses continue to show strength through growth, increased investment in infrastructure, improved customer service and progress made to manage our expenses. Let's walk through some of the highlights of the quarter.
We currently have active rate cases in our 3 largest states: Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Missouri. In Pennsylvania, we entered into a proposed settlement agreement in October '16 that will provide additional annualized water and wastewater revenues of $62 million. As you may recall, this case was driven by $1.3 billion in capital investments to ensure reliable service. The proposed settlement agreement is under review by the presiding administrative law judges, and will then go before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for approval. We anticipate a decision before year-end and are hopeful we can discuss the settlement further on our December 11 guidance call.
Moving to New Jersey. We filed a general rate case in September '15, seeking $129 million in annualized revenue over 3 years. Since our last rate adjustment in 2015, we invested more than $868 million in infrastructure upgrades. These investments included replacing more than 200 miles of water main and a flood protection project at our Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Facility. Susan will talk about our efforts to mitigate extreme weather impacts later, but this project will ensure the sustainability of the water supply for more than 1 million people in 7 counties in Central New Jersey. That level of investment also had a positive impact to New Jersey's economy, creating approximately 14,000 jobs across the state.
As we mentioned in the last call, we filed a rate case in Missouri, requesting an increase of $84 million in annual revenue, driven by more than $490 million in investment in our systems. This case marks the first future test year filing by Missouri American Water, and we appreciate the commission's openness to consider and choose in this case. 
Moving to California. The fires that occurred last month in Sonoma and Napa counties have been devastating to the communities there, including one of our service areas, Larkfield. We're still assessing the damage, but we estimate that about a 1/4 of our service district, about 600 homes, have been destroyed. We're working with our impacted customers during this difficult time. While the recovery work is still underway to replace damaged equipment, we were pleased that we maintained water service for firefighting during the event and restored full potable water services for the vast majority of residents there within a matter of days.
We're also very pleased to announce that California American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation provided a grant of $100,000 to the  North Bay Fire Relief for individuals and families impacted by the wildfires. I want to thank our team in California for responding quickly to our customers during this crisis and, most importantly, for staying safe.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me touch briefly on weather for the quarter. As you know, we had a $0.02 benefit from hot, dry weather in third quarter of 2016. In the third quarter of 2017, we experienced warmer weather in several states through July. However, during the remainder of the quarter, we saw more rain and cooler temperatures in the northeast. We've spoken in the past about how our geographic diversity allows us to manage through weather fluctuations and limit their impact. As a result, weather did not positively or negatively impact our revenues for the third quarter of 2017.
Linda will cover the quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date earnings impact.
Turning to Slide 10. We added about 16,000 new customers to date through completed acquisitions and more than 10,000 through organic growth. In October, we also received an approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission of our McKeesport Pennsylvania wastewater acquisition. This is great progress, and we expect this acquisition will close later this year. We're excited to add these 22,000 new customers and welcome our new employees. As Susan mentioned, we have pending agreements to welcome 45,000 more customers, which includes the McKeesport acquisition. We're pleased that this represents 11,000 more pending customers than we had last quarter.
Moving on to Slide 11. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. During the first 9 months of the year, we invested $963 million of which the majority was dedicated to regulated operations to keep our services reliable. We also continue to keep our service affordable by working more efficiently throughout our business. Our O&M efficiency ratio decreased from 34.9% to 34.2% for the last 12 months ending September 30, 2017. We're on track to achieve our long-term goal of 32.5% by 2021. Thanks, again, to our employees and their commitment to our customers. 
Technology is also playing a critical role. Let me give you a couple of examples of this. In Illinois, we're using technology to make the operation of our Bradley Avenue treatment plant in Champaign more cost-efficient through automation. During the 9-month period this year, we've already saved more than $200,000, while effectively managing our plant. We expect to achieve savings of about $300,000 annually.
In Pennsylvania, our operations team is using cellular leak detection instruments to find and fix leaks before they lead to main breaks. This technology provides remote alarming and automatic data uploads from any location, where self-service is available. Through this technology, we're saving 11 million gallons of water per day. Additionally, it's estimated that it's about 10x cheaper than to fix a leak before the water main breaks. The technology and operational efficiency are core to our strategies, and these examples demonstrate how our company is using innovation to better serve our customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start with our third quarter 2017 results on Slide 13.GAAP earnings were $1.13 per share, an increase of $0.30 compared to the same period last year. We had a few non-GAAP adjustments in both periods",1320,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our third quarter 2017 results on Slide 13.
GAAP earnings were $1.13 per share, an increase of $0.30 compared to the same period last year. We had a few non-GAAP adjustments in both periods. So let me start with those.
First, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the Freedom Industries' chemical spill settlement activity. In 2016, we entered into a binding global agreement in principle to settle all claims associated with this matter, of which West Virginia American Water's share, net of insurance recovery, was a pretax charge of $65 million or $0.22 per share. At that time, 2 of our insurers providing coverage of up to $25 million each did not agree to participate in the settlement, and we initiated legal actions to pursue recovery. In the third quarter of 2017, we reached a settlement with one of those insurers to recover $22 million pretax or a $0.07 per share benefit. With this insurance settlement, West Virginia American Water's share of its $126 million Freedom Industries' settlement was reduced from $65 million to $43 million pretax. Consistent with prior year treatment of the settlement, this benefit was reflected as a non-GAAP adjustment.
Also, in August, we completed a $1.35 billion financing, which I will discuss in greater details in a few slides. A portion of the proceeds was used to refinance certain higher cost debt before their original maturity dates in 2018 and 2021. This resulted in early debt extinguishment charges of $34 million in total. The majority of this amount or $28 million is expected to be recovered through customer rates and was recorded as regulatory assets and did not impact earnings. However, $6 million or $0.02 per share was associated with parent company debt and recorded as a charge to earnings. We have reflected this item as a non-GAAP adjustment, consistent with prior year treatment of similar charges.
Excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share, an increase of $0.03 or 2.9% over the same period in 2016, with the Regulated segment up $0.05, the Market-Based Businesses up $0.03 and the parent was unfavorable $0.05.
Turning to Slide 14. Let me walk through our adjusted quarterly results by each business. Our regulated operations were up $0.05 in total. Revenue was up $0.08 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support growth and acquisitions, and this is net of lower demand or declining usage of about 1%. Also, in the third quarter of 2016, we had warmer weather as Walter discussed, which negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. Next, we had higher net depreciation, interest and general taxes of $0.03 driven by investment growth. And then finally, all other items the resulted in a benefit of $0.02, mainly from our continuous focus on cost management.
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. We were up $0.03 compared to the same period last year. The majority of this increase was from Homeowner Services, from customer growth and price increases. Although we continue to experience lower capital projects in the Military Services Group, we are excited to announce the agreement with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, which represents partnership with our 13th military base. This contract will add $490 million in revenue over the 50-year contract term. And with the addition of this base, our backlog of revenue associated with our military contracts is over $3.5 billion over the remaining contract terms.
And then lastly, the parent was down $0.05 per share in the quarter. $0.02 was due to the cumulative tax adjustment I discussed last quarter related to the July 1 increase in our state income tax rate in Illinois. This change required us to remeasure our deferred tax balances at the new rates in the third quarter. The cumulative adjustment totaled $7 million. The portion calculated on a stand-alone basis for Illinois is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and was recorded as a regulatory asset. The remaining portion was allocated to the parent through our state tax apportionment factors and reduced 2017 earnings by $0.02 per share. The remaining $0.03 of the parent was from higher interest expense to support growth of $0.01 and an overlap of interest expense related to our August financing of about $0.01. The overlap was because we had $428 million of parent debt that didn't actually mature until October of this year but was part of the financing in August. And lastly, we had a $0.01 tax benefit recognized last year.
Turning to Slide 15. Our year-to-date adjusted earnings were $2.34 per share or a 3% increase over adjusted earnings in the same period last year. Our regulated operations were up $0.12 per share in total, which includes the $0.04 negative year-over-year impact from weather, as Walter discussed. Our Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01, with the favorable third quarter results in our Homeowner Services Group exceeding the impact from lower capital projects in our Military Services Group. Parent and other were down $0.06, mainly due to the 2 discrete tax adjustments associated with legislative changes in New York and Illinois impacting state tax apportionment.
Now let me discuss in more detail the August $1.35 billion financing on Slide 16. This was the largest financing at American Water since our IPO in 2008, and our team did an extraordinary job executing this transaction. Overall, the transaction reduced our long-term embedded cost of debt by 48 basis points, mainly for the benefit of our regulated customers. It reduced our 5-year debt maturities by $876 million, and it increased the average tenor of our debt from about 13 years to almost 16 years. Those are the highlights. Now let me discuss the deal.
We financed $1.35 billion with $750 million of 30-year debt at a 3.75% interest rate and $600 million of 10-year debt at a 2.95% interest rate. The funds will be used for 3 primary purposes: new debt to support growth of $440 million; refinancing of debt maturing in 2017 of $557 million; and $353 million for early refinancing of debt maturing in 2018 and 2021, including the make whole.  These transactions were designed to take advantage of lower interest rates for our customers.
Turning to Slide 17. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $66 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year from general rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on rate cases, infrastructure surcharges and proposed settlement for a total annualized revenue request of $321 million. This includes the Pennsylvania rate case proposed settlement of $62 million that Walter discussed.
Turning to Slide 18. Our cash flow from operations grew about 4.3% to $986 million for the first 9 months of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by net income growth in our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses.
Turning to dividends. On October 31, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly cash dividend of $0.415 per share to shareholders of record on November 10 and payable on December 1 of this year. And as a reminder, for 5 years straight, we have grown our dividend at or above the top of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS growth range.
Turning to Slide 19. Today, we are narrowing our 2017 adjusted earnings guidance range to $3 to $3.06 per share. As you know, we traditionally do not make many non-GAAP adjustments, and when we do, we want to be consistent and transparent. This year, we have had 2 items excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance range: the $0.07 per share benefit from the insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries' chemical spill and the $0.02 per share charge from early debt extinguishment at the parent company. These are reported as non-GAAP adjustments, consistent with our treatment in prior years. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to mention the extraordinary weather and fire events that we've experienced in our country and our American Water service areas over the past few months. Given our geographic diversity, we are oftentimes located within natural disaster areas or close enough to offer help to other communities. With every event we say, safety comes first. We prepare, we leverage national resources, and we look to help impacted communities.
In August, Hurricane Harvey hit our operations in Fort Polk, Louisiana, dumping about 20 inches of rain on the bay. The storm also had a lesser effect on our Fort Hood, Texas, operations. Our employees, who work there and those who came to help, worked tirelessly during and after the storm to maintain service to both military communities.
In September, Hurricane Irma made landfall in Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm. By the time the storm moved up the cost to the desalination facility we operate in Tampa, our Contract Services Group had enacted this emergency plan and the facility made it through the storm with a little to no damage and no flooding. The plant and our people were there to help the community during the recovery.
And just last month, as Walter shared, our team in California responded to the tragic fires in Sonoma and Napa counties, maintaining water service for firefighting during the event and restoring full potable water service for the vast majority of our residents there within a matter of a few days. Whether it's hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, storms or wildfires, our response to all of these events highlight our commitment to resiliency of water and sanitation services for our customers. We use a systematic approach to assess the vulnerability of all of our assets, and we continually prioritize our critical infrastructure investment.
Our engineering and operations teams examine every facility we own and our regional water supplies to develop a capital plan to determine how much and what kind of investment is needed to ensure ongoing safe and reliable service to our customers, both during and after these disasters. We evaluate historic conditions combined with future predictions, and we consider factors like a 100-year flood, which now seems to be occurring every 20 years and other impacts of climate variability. These engineering planning studies drive our capital needs assessments, business planning and our financial forecasting.
During a significant weather event, a water utility's level of preparedness can literally mean the difference between a temporary inconvenience or a serious health or environmental consequence for our customers. We know that, and we prepare for it. It's our job, and we do it well.
I'm extremely proud of our people and their commitment to doing what's right for our customers and our communities every day. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people, who are recovering from these natural disasters.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

I'm going to start on your last question, and then turn it over to Walter and let him add anything to that and then address the issue of the Water Quality Accountability Act in New Jersey. So the fair market value in Pennsylvania, we think it's important to have an appraisal process that fairy values the systems we're acquiring and also sets a fair and sustainable base rate for our customers. We don't want a high appraisal value just to get a higher base rate, and we don't -- we want the right base rate for us and our customers for the long term. We don't think systems should be undervalued or overvalued because we think either one hurts the process long term in the spirit of the law. Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation requires appraisals to meet a uniform standard that the professional appraisal sector has. And there've been some questions about so what is the Pennsylvania PUC, what's their role, what's it not. In our look, and we have gotten an approval for McKeesport under that, we think that the Pennsylvania PUC can see the appraisals and determine if they comply. If appraisals don't comply, adjustment should be made, complying with standards is a check and balance that we think, clearly, the public utility commission has the authority for. So in our recent PUC application for the McKeesport acquisition, we sat down with the parties. We sat down with PUC staff. We sat down with consumers advocates. We listened to their issues, and we try to find a way forward that we could all lived with. And we're very pleased that this was approved -- the settlement that we reached with the staff, with the consumers advocates were all approved by the public commission last week. So Walter, do you want to add anything to that?"

And I think the scran and sewer acquisition is an example of that. It's the first acquisition in the state where we're dealing with the issue of combined sewer and storm water. Currently, Pennsylvania American Water doesn't have a combined tariff for wastewater. We have a number of different tariffs because we've done so many acquisitions over the years. So working through the first issue that I said, the combined sewer and storm water, and also working through not having a combined tariff on the sewer side, it takes a lot of cooperation and a lot of dialogue with a number of parties, including the Office of Consumer Advocate and commission staff to get to the right place. But I think we've done that. I'm confident we've done that. The team has done a great job in working with all the parties. I think it's another example of how we're working to make sure that we get a fair settlement for all, and the scran sewer authority again is a perfect example of that."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our third quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations.
Moving to Slide 5. Our employees delivered solid financial performance and continue to execute on our strategies in the third quarter. These strategies include: prioritizing employee and customer safety, building constructive regulatory relationships through transparency and credibility, providing excellent service to our customers, growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operations to keep bills affordable for our customers.
Our third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share, an increase of $0.03 per share or 2.9% over the same period in 2016. This 2017 third quarter adjusted number excludes a positive $0.07 related to an insurance settlement from the Freedom Industries chemical spill, which you may remember was a negative $0.22 in last year's third quarter.  This quarter's adjusted number also excludes $0.02 of an early debt refinancing charge at the parent. Linda will discuss this in more detail in her comments.
With the solid results we've seen year-to-date and projected through the year-end, we've narrowed our adjusted earnings guidance to $3 to $3.06 per share. Our foundation for growth continues to be providing safe and reliable service by investing wisely and effectively in our Regulated operations. We've made more than a $1 billion in capital investments in the first 9 months, and we're on track to invest about $1.65 billion for the full year, with a vast majority dedicated to water and wastewater system replacements and improvements. We remained focused on controlling our O&M expenses to ensure that every dollar we spend on infrastructure replacement has minimal impact on our customers' bill.
We're extremely proud of our employees efforts to improve efficiencies, and their commitment comes from a deeply ingrained culture at American Water to provide the best-quality water and water services to our customers at an affordable price. Our folks live in the communities we serve, and all of our employees are keenly aware of the importance of keeping customer bills affordable. This commitment to customer care contributes to our growth. This year, we have welcomed about 16,000 new customers from acquisitions and 10,400 customers from organic growth in our service areas. We also have signed agreements, representing another 45,000 customers pending regulatory approvals.
We also saw growth this quarter in our market-based businesses, mainly driven by our Homeowner Services Group. HOS currently has $1.7 million customer contracts that serve more than 825,000 customers in 43 states and Washington, D.C. Keystone Clearwater remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter but is still projected to be accretive this year due to increased activity and work during the latter part of the year.
A real highlight of the quarter was our Military Services Group win of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. We consider it an honor and a privilege to serve the military men and women who defend our country and our liberty. This base is the 13th installation to partner with American Water. We're fully committed to providing industry-leading water and wastewater services to Wright-Patterson for the next 50 years.
We also had 3 other significant accomplishments I'd like to highlight for the quarter. First, we completed a $1.35 billion debt financing, which is the largest since our IPO in 2008. These interest savings will provide significant long-term benefits, primarily for our Regulated customers. Linda will discuss this financing in more detail.
Second, you may remember that in the third quarter of last year, we entered into a global bonding agreement in principle related to the Freedom Industries chemicals spill in West Virginia. Two of our insurance carriers providing coverage of up to $25 million each chose not to participate in that settlement agreement at that time. We have now settled with one of those carriers. And this $22 million settlement reduces West Virginia American Water's total pretax cost from $65 million to $43 million. We continue in arbitration with the remaining insurance carrier.
And third, Walter will discuss in a moment, our filing for a proposed black-box settlement agreement among intervenors in our Pennsylvania rate case, which remains subject to approval. So all said, we're on track to meet our long-term 7% to 10% long-term EPS guidance.
Walter will now give you his update on our Regulated Business."

As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses continue to show strength through growth, increased investment in infrastructure, improved customer service and progress made to manage our expenses. Let's walk through so",973,"Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses continue to show strength through growth, increased investment in infrastructure, improved customer service and progress made to manage our expenses. Let's walk through some of the highlights of the quarter.
We currently have active rate cases in our 3 largest states: Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Missouri. In Pennsylvania, we entered into a proposed settlement agreement in October '16 that will provide additional annualized water and wastewater revenues of $62 million. As you may recall, this case was driven by $1.3 billion in capital investments to ensure reliable service. The proposed settlement agreement is under review by the presiding administrative law judges, and will then go before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for approval. We anticipate a decision before year-end and are hopeful we can discuss the settlement further on our December 11 guidance call.
Moving to New Jersey. We filed a general rate case in September '15, seeking $129 million in annualized revenue over 3 years. Since our last rate adjustment in 2015, we invested more than $868 million in infrastructure upgrades. These investments included replacing more than 200 miles of water main and a flood protection project at our Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Facility. Susan will talk about our efforts to mitigate extreme weather impacts later, but this project will ensure the sustainability of the water supply for more than 1 million people in 7 counties in Central New Jersey. That level of investment also had a positive impact to New Jersey's economy, creating approximately 14,000 jobs across the state.
As we mentioned in the last call, we filed a rate case in Missouri, requesting an increase of $84 million in annual revenue, driven by more than $490 million in investment in our systems. This case marks the first future test year filing by Missouri American Water, and we appreciate the commission's openness to consider and choose in this case. 
Moving to California. The fires that occurred last month in Sonoma and Napa counties have been devastating to the communities there, including one of our service areas, Larkfield. We're still assessing the damage, but we estimate that about a 1/4 of our service district, about 600 homes, have been destroyed. We're working with our impacted customers during this difficult time. While the recovery work is still underway to replace damaged equipment, we were pleased that we maintained water service for firefighting during the event and restored full potable water services for the vast majority of residents there within a matter of days.
We're also very pleased to announce that California American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation provided a grant of $100,000 to the  North Bay Fire Relief for individuals and families impacted by the wildfires. I want to thank our team in California for responding quickly to our customers during this crisis and, most importantly, for staying safe.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me touch briefly on weather for the quarter. As you know, we had a $0.02 benefit from hot, dry weather in third quarter of 2016. In the third quarter of 2017, we experienced warmer weather in several states through July. However, during the remainder of the quarter, we saw more rain and cooler temperatures in the northeast. We've spoken in the past about how our geographic diversity allows us to manage through weather fluctuations and limit their impact. As a result, weather did not positively or negatively impact our revenues for the third quarter of 2017.
Linda will cover the quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date earnings impact.
Turning to Slide 10. We added about 16,000 new customers to date through completed acquisitions and more than 10,000 through organic growth. In October, we also received an approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission of our McKeesport Pennsylvania wastewater acquisition. This is great progress, and we expect this acquisition will close later this year. We're excited to add these 22,000 new customers and welcome our new employees. As Susan mentioned, we have pending agreements to welcome 45,000 more customers, which includes the McKeesport acquisition. We're pleased that this represents 11,000 more pending customers than we had last quarter.
Moving on to Slide 11. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. During the first 9 months of the year, we invested $963 million of which the majority was dedicated to regulated operations to keep our services reliable. We also continue to keep our service affordable by working more efficiently throughout our business. Our O&M efficiency ratio decreased from 34.9% to 34.2% for the last 12 months ending September 30, 2017. We're on track to achieve our long-term goal of 32.5% by 2021. Thanks, again, to our employees and their commitment to our customers. 
Technology is also playing a critical role. Let me give you a couple of examples of this. In Illinois, we're using technology to make the operation of our Bradley Avenue treatment plant in Champaign more cost-efficient through automation. During the 9-month period this year, we've already saved more than $200,000, while effectively managing our plant. We expect to achieve savings of about $300,000 annually.
In Pennsylvania, our operations team is using cellular leak detection instruments to find and fix leaks before they lead to main breaks. This technology provides remote alarming and automatic data uploads from any location, where self-service is available. Through this technology, we're saving 11 million gallons of water per day. Additionally, it's estimated that it's about 10x cheaper than to fix a leak before the water main breaks. The technology and operational efficiency are core to our strategies, and these examples demonstrate how our company is using innovation to better serve our customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start with our third quarter 2017 results on Slide 13.GAAP earnings were $1.13 per share, an increase of $0.30 compared to the same period last year. We had a few non-GAAP adjustments in both periods",1320,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our third quarter 2017 results on Slide 13.
GAAP earnings were $1.13 per share, an increase of $0.30 compared to the same period last year. We had a few non-GAAP adjustments in both periods. So let me start with those.
First, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the Freedom Industries' chemical spill settlement activity. In 2016, we entered into a binding global agreement in principle to settle all claims associated with this matter, of which West Virginia American Water's share, net of insurance recovery, was a pretax charge of $65 million or $0.22 per share. At that time, 2 of our insurers providing coverage of up to $25 million each did not agree to participate in the settlement, and we initiated legal actions to pursue recovery. In the third quarter of 2017, we reached a settlement with one of those insurers to recover $22 million pretax or a $0.07 per share benefit. With this insurance settlement, West Virginia American Water's share of its $126 million Freedom Industries' settlement was reduced from $65 million to $43 million pretax. Consistent with prior year treatment of the settlement, this benefit was reflected as a non-GAAP adjustment.
Also, in August, we completed a $1.35 billion financing, which I will discuss in greater details in a few slides. A portion of the proceeds was used to refinance certain higher cost debt before their original maturity dates in 2018 and 2021. This resulted in early debt extinguishment charges of $34 million in total. The majority of this amount or $28 million is expected to be recovered through customer rates and was recorded as regulatory assets and did not impact earnings. However, $6 million or $0.02 per share was associated with parent company debt and recorded as a charge to earnings. We have reflected this item as a non-GAAP adjustment, consistent with prior year treatment of similar charges.
Excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share, an increase of $0.03 or 2.9% over the same period in 2016, with the Regulated segment up $0.05, the Market-Based Businesses up $0.03 and the parent was unfavorable $0.05.
Turning to Slide 14. Let me walk through our adjusted quarterly results by each business. Our regulated operations were up $0.05 in total. Revenue was up $0.08 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support growth and acquisitions, and this is net of lower demand or declining usage of about 1%. Also, in the third quarter of 2016, we had warmer weather as Walter discussed, which negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. Next, we had higher net depreciation, interest and general taxes of $0.03 driven by investment growth. And then finally, all other items the resulted in a benefit of $0.02, mainly from our continuous focus on cost management.
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. We were up $0.03 compared to the same period last year. The majority of this increase was from Homeowner Services, from customer growth and price increases. Although we continue to experience lower capital projects in the Military Services Group, we are excited to announce the agreement with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, which represents partnership with our 13th military base. This contract will add $490 million in revenue over the 50-year contract term. And with the addition of this base, our backlog of revenue associated with our military contracts is over $3.5 billion over the remaining contract terms.
And then lastly, the parent was down $0.05 per share in the quarter. $0.02 was due to the cumulative tax adjustment I discussed last quarter related to the July 1 increase in our state income tax rate in Illinois. This change required us to remeasure our deferred tax balances at the new rates in the third quarter. The cumulative adjustment totaled $7 million. The portion calculated on a stand-alone basis for Illinois is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and was recorded as a regulatory asset. The remaining portion was allocated to the parent through our state tax apportionment factors and reduced 2017 earnings by $0.02 per share. The remaining $0.03 of the parent was from higher interest expense to support growth of $0.01 and an overlap of interest expense related to our August financing of about $0.01. The overlap was because we had $428 million of parent debt that didn't actually mature until October of this year but was part of the financing in August. And lastly, we had a $0.01 tax benefit recognized last year.
Turning to Slide 15. Our year-to-date adjusted earnings were $2.34 per share or a 3% increase over adjusted earnings in the same period last year. Our regulated operations were up $0.12 per share in total, which includes the $0.04 negative year-over-year impact from weather, as Walter discussed. Our Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01, with the favorable third quarter results in our Homeowner Services Group exceeding the impact from lower capital projects in our Military Services Group. Parent and other were down $0.06, mainly due to the 2 discrete tax adjustments associated with legislative changes in New York and Illinois impacting state tax apportionment.
Now let me discuss in more detail the August $1.35 billion financing on Slide 16. This was the largest financing at American Water since our IPO in 2008, and our team did an extraordinary job executing this transaction. Overall, the transaction reduced our long-term embedded cost of debt by 48 basis points, mainly for the benefit of our regulated customers. It reduced our 5-year debt maturities by $876 million, and it increased the average tenor of our debt from about 13 years to almost 16 years. Those are the highlights. Now let me discuss the deal.
We financed $1.35 billion with $750 million of 30-year debt at a 3.75% interest rate and $600 million of 10-year debt at a 2.95% interest rate. The funds will be used for 3 primary purposes: new debt to support growth of $440 million; refinancing of debt maturing in 2017 of $557 million; and $353 million for early refinancing of debt maturing in 2018 and 2021, including the make whole.  These transactions were designed to take advantage of lower interest rates for our customers.
Turning to Slide 17. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $66 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year from general rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on rate cases, infrastructure surcharges and proposed settlement for a total annualized revenue request of $321 million. This includes the Pennsylvania rate case proposed settlement of $62 million that Walter discussed.
Turning to Slide 18. Our cash flow from operations grew about 4.3% to $986 million for the first 9 months of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by net income growth in our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses.
Turning to dividends. On October 31, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly cash dividend of $0.415 per share to shareholders of record on November 10 and payable on December 1 of this year. And as a reminder, for 5 years straight, we have grown our dividend at or above the top of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS growth range.
Turning to Slide 19. Today, we are narrowing our 2017 adjusted earnings guidance range to $3 to $3.06 per share. As you know, we traditionally do not make many non-GAAP adjustments, and when we do, we want to be consistent and transparent. This year, we have had 2 items excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance range: the $0.07 per share benefit from the insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries' chemical spill and the $0.02 per share charge from early debt extinguishment at the parent company. These are reported as non-GAAP adjustments, consistent with our treatment in prior years. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to mention the extraordinary weather and fire events that we've experienced in our country and our American Water service areas over the past few months. Given our geographic diversity, we are oftentimes located within natural disaster areas or close enough to offer help to other communities. With every event we say, safety comes first. We prepare, we leverage national resources, and we look to help impacted communities.
In August, Hurricane Harvey hit our operations in Fort Polk, Louisiana, dumping about 20 inches of rain on the bay. The storm also had a lesser effect on our Fort Hood, Texas, operations. Our employees, who work there and those who came to help, worked tirelessly during and after the storm to maintain service to both military communities.
In September, Hurricane Irma made landfall in Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm. By the time the storm moved up the cost to the desalination facility we operate in Tampa, our Contract Services Group had enacted this emergency plan and the facility made it through the storm with a little to no damage and no flooding. The plant and our people were there to help the community during the recovery.
And just last month, as Walter shared, our team in California responded to the tragic fires in Sonoma and Napa counties, maintaining water service for firefighting during the event and restoring full potable water service for the vast majority of our residents there within a matter of a few days. Whether it's hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, ice storms or wildfires, our response to all of these events highlight our commitment to resiliency of water and sanitation services for our customers. We use a systematic approach to assess the vulnerability of all of our assets, and we continually prioritize our critical infrastructure investment.
Our engineering and operations teams examine every facility we own and our regional water supplies to develop a capital plan to determine how much and what kind of investment is needed to ensure ongoing safe and reliable service to our customers, both during and after these disasters. We evaluate historic conditions combined with future predictions, and we consider factors like a 100-year flood, which now seems to be occurring every 20 years and other impacts of climate variability. These engineering planning studies drive our capital needs assessments, business planning and our financial forecasting.
During a significant weather event, a water utility's level of preparedness can literally mean the difference between a temporary inconvenience or a serious health or environmental consequence for our customers. We know that, and we prepare for it. It's our job, and we do it well.
I'm extremely proud of our people and their commitment to doing what's right for our customers and our communities every day. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people, who are recovering from these natural disasters.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

I'm going to start on your last question, and then turn it over to Walter and let him add anything to that and then address the issue of the Water Quality Accountability Act in New Jersey. So the fair market value in Pennsylvania, we think it's important to have an appraisal process that fairy values the systems we're acquiring and also sets a fair and sustainable base rate for our customers. We don't want a high appraisal value just to get a higher base rate, and we don't -- we want the right base rate for us and our customers for the long term. We don't think systems should be undervalued or overvalued because we think either one hurts the process long term in the spirit of the law. Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation requires appraisals to meet a uniform standard that the professional appraisal sector has. And there've been some questions about so what is the Pennsylvania PUC, what's their role, what's it not. In our look, and we have gotten an approval for McKeesport under that, we think that the Pennsylvania PUC can review the appraisals and determine if they comply. If appraisals don't comply, adjustment should be made, complying with standards is a check and balance that we think, clearly, the public utility commission has the authority for. So in our recent PUC application for the McKeesport acquisition, we sat down with the parties. We sat down with PUC staff. We sat down with consumers advocates. We listened to their issues, and we try to find a way forward that we could all live with. And we're very pleased that this was approved -- the settlement that we reached with the staff, with the consumers advocates were all approved by the public commission last week. So Walter, do you want to add anything to that?"

And I think the Scranton and sewer acquisition is an example of that. It's the first acquisition in the state where we're dealing with the issue of combined sewer and storm water. Currently, Pennsylvania American Water doesn't have a combined tariff for wastewater. We have a number of different tariffs because we've done so many acquisitions over the years. So working through the first issue that I said, the combined sewer and storm water, and also working through not having a combined tariff on the sewer side, it takes a lot of cooperation and a lot of dialogue with a number of parties, including the Office of Consumer Advocate and commission staff to get to the right place. But I think we've done that. I'm confident we've done that. The team has done a great job in working with all the parties. I think it's another example of how we're working to make sure that we get a fair settlement for all, and the Scranton Sewer Authority again is a perfect example of that."

So we're going to continue to do some of the smaller wins where it makes sense in and around our footprint. Our real focus is on the larger 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 5,000 to 30,000 customers to make sure that these acquisitions are more sizable, they move the needle and they represent, I think, opportunities for us to improve the systems that we buy. Many of these systems need significant investment, and the systems of 5,000 to 30,000 seem to meet -- need more investment than some of the others. So that's really our focus."

Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our third quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations.
Moving to Slide 5. Our employees delivered solid financial performance and continue to execute on our strategies in the third quarter. These strategies include: prioritizing employee and customer safety, building constructive regulatory relationships through transparency and credibility, providing excellent service to our customers, growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operations to keep bills affordable for our customers.
Our third quarter adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share, an increase of $0.03 per share or 2.9% over the same period in 2016. This 2017 third quarter adjusted number excludes a positive $0.07 related to an insurance settlement from the Freedom Industries chemical spill, which you may remember was a negative $0.22 in last year's third quarter.  This quarter's adjusted number also excludes $0.02 of an early debt refinancing charge at the parent. Linda will discuss this in more detail in her comments.
With the solid results we've seen year-to-date and projected through the year-end, we've narrowed our adjusted earnings guidance to $3 to $3.06 per share. Our foundation for growth continues to be providing safe and reliable service by investing wisely and effectively in our Regulated operations. We've made more than a $1 billion in capital investments in the first 9 months, and we're on track to invest about $1.65 billion for the full year, with a vast majority dedicated to water and wastewater system replacements and improvements. We remained focused on controlling our O&M expenses to ensure that every dollar we spend on infrastructure replacement has minimal impact on our customers' bill.
We're extremely proud of our employees efforts to improve efficiencies, and their commitment comes from a deeply ingrained culture at American Water to provide the best-quality water and water services to our customers at an affordable price. Our folks live in the communities we serve, and all of our employees are keenly aware of the importance of keeping customer bills affordable. This commitment to customer care contributes to our growth. This year, we have welcomed about 16,000 new customers from acquisitions and 10,400 customers from organic growth in our service areas. We also have signed agreements, representing another 45,000 customers pending regulatory approvals.
We also saw growth this quarter in our market-based businesses, mainly driven by our Homeowner Services Group. HOS currently has $1.7 million customer contracts that serve more than 825,000 customers in 43 states and Washington, D.C. Keystone Clearwater remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter but is still projected to be accretive this year due to increased activity and work during the latter part of the year.
A real highlight of the quarter was our Military Services Group win of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. We consider it an honor and a privilege to serve the military men and women who defend our country and our liberty. This base is the 13th installation to partner with American Water. We're fully committed to providing industry-leading water and wastewater services to Wright-Patterson for the next 50 years.
We also had 3 other significant accomplishments I'd like to highlight for the quarter. First, we completed a $1.35 billion debt financing, which is the largest since our IPO in 2008. These interest savings will provide significant long-term benefits, primarily for our Regulated customers. Linda will discuss this financing in more detail.
Second, you may remember that in the third quarter of last year, we entered into a global bonding agreement in principle related to the Freedom Industries chemicals spill in West Virginia. Two of our insurance carriers providing coverage of up to $25 million each chose not to participate in that settlement agreement at that time. We have now settled with one of those carriers. And this $22 million settlement reduces West Virginia American Water's total pretax cost from $65 million to $43 million. We continue in arbitration with the remaining insurance carrier.
And third, Walter will discuss in a moment, our filing for a proposed black-box settlement agreement among intervenors in our Pennsylvania rate case, which remains subject to approval. So all said, we're on track to meet our long-term 7% to 10% long-term EPS guidance.
Walter will now give you his update on our Regulated Business."

Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses continue to show strength through growth, increased investment in infrastructure, improved customer service and progress made to manage our expenses. Let's walk through so",973,"Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses continue to show strength through growth, increased investment in infrastructure, improved customer service and progress made to manage our expenses. Let's walk through some of the highlights of the quarter.
We currently have active rate cases in our 3 largest states: Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Missouri. In Pennsylvania, we entered into a proposed settlement agreement in October '16 that will provide additional annualized water and wastewater revenues of $62 million. As you may recall, this case was driven by $1.3 billion in capital investments to ensure reliable service. The proposed settlement agreement is under review by the presiding administrative law judges, and will then go before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for approval. We anticipate a decision before year-end and are hopeful we can discuss the settlement further on our December 11 guidance call.
Moving to New Jersey. We filed a general rate case in September '15, seeking $129 million in annualized revenue over 3 years. Since our last rate adjustment in 2015, we invested more than $868 million in infrastructure upgrades. These investments included replacing more than 200 miles of water main and a flood protection project at our Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Facility. Susan will talk about our efforts to mitigate extreme weather impacts later, but this project will ensure the sustainability of the water supply for more than 1 million people in 7 counties in Central New Jersey. That level of investment also had a positive impact to New Jersey's economy, creating approximately 14,000 jobs across the state.
As we mentioned in the last call, we filed a rate case in Missouri, requesting an increase of $84 million in annual revenue, driven by more than $490 million in investment in our systems. This case marks the first future test year filing by Missouri American Water, and we appreciate the commission's openness to consider and choose in this case. 
Moving to California. The fires that occurred last month in Sonoma and Napa counties have been devastating to the communities there, including one of our service areas, Larkfield. We're still assessing the damage, but we estimate that about a 1/4 of our service district, about 600 homes, have been destroyed. We're working with our impacted customers during this difficult time. While the recovery work is still underway to replace damaged equipment, we were pleased that we maintained water service for firefighting during the event and restored full potable water services for the vast majority of residents there within a matter of days.
We're also very pleased to announce that California American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation provided a grant of $100,000 to the  North Bay Fire Relief for individuals and families impacted by the wildfires. I want to thank our team in California for responding quickly to our customers during this crisis and, most importantly, for staying safe.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me touch briefly on weather for the quarter. As you know, we had a $0.02 benefit from hot, dry weather in third quarter of 2016. In the third quarter of 2017, we experienced warmer weather in several states through July. However, during the remainder of the quarter, we saw more rain and cooler temperatures in the northeast. We've spoken in the past about how our geographic diversity allows us to manage through weather fluctuations and limit their impact. As a result, weather did not positively or negatively impact our revenues for the third quarter of 2017.
Linda will cover the quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date earnings impact.
Turning to Slide 10. We added about 16,000 new customers to date through completed acquisitions and more than 10,000 through organic growth. In October, we also received an approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission of our McKeesport Pennsylvania wastewater acquisition. This is great progress, and we expect this acquisition will close later this year. We're excited to add these 22,000 new customers and welcome our new employees. As Susan mentioned, we have pending agreements to welcome 45,000 more customers, which includes the McKeesport acquisition. We're pleased that this represents 11,000 more pending customers than we had last quarter.
Moving on to Slide 11. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. During the first 9 months of the year, we invested $963 million of which the majority was dedicated to regulated operations to keep our services reliable. We also continue to keep our service affordable by working more efficiently throughout our business. Our O&M efficiency ratio decreased from 34.9% to 34.2% for the last 12 months ending September 30, 2017. We're on track to achieve our long-term goal of 32.5% by 2021. Thanks, again, to our employees and their commitment to our customers. 
Technology is also playing a critical role. Let me give you a couple of examples of this. In Illinois, we're using technology to make the operation of our Bradley Avenue treatment plant in Champaign more cost-efficient through automation. During the 9-month period this year, we've already saved more than $200,000, while effectively managing our plant. We expect to achieve savings of about $300,000 annually.
In Pennsylvania, our operations team is using cellular leak detection instruments to find and fix leaks before they lead to main breaks. This technology provides remote alarming and automatic data uploads from any location, where self-service is available. Through this technology, we're saving 11 million gallons of water per day. Additionally, it's estimated that it's about 10x cheaper than to fix a leak before the water main breaks. The technology and operational efficiency are core to our strategies, and these examples demonstrate how our company is using innovation to better serve our customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance."

Let me start with our third quarter 2017 results on Slide 13.GAAP earnings were $1.13 per share, an increase of $0.30 compared to the same period last year. We had a few non-GAAP adjustments in both periods",1320,"Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our third quarter 2017 results on Slide 13.
GAAP earnings were $1.13 per share, an increase of $0.30 compared to the same period last year. We had a few non-GAAP adjustments in both periods. So let me start with those.
First, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the Freedom Industries' chemical spill settlement activity. In 2016, we entered into a binding global agreement in principle to settle all claims associated with this matter, of which West Virginia American Water's share, net of insurance recovery, was a pretax charge of $65 million or $0.22 per share. At that time, 2 of our insurers providing coverage of up to $25 million each did not agree to participate in the settlement, and we initiated legal actions to pursue recovery. In the third quarter of 2017, we reached a settlement with one of those insurers to recover $22 million pretax or a $0.07 per share benefit. With this insurance settlement, West Virginia American Water's share of its $126 million Freedom Industries' settlement was reduced from $65 million to $43 million pretax. Consistent with prior year treatment of the settlement, this benefit was reflected as a non-GAAP adjustment.
Also, in August, we completed a $1.35 billion financing, which I will discuss in greater details in a few slides. A portion of the proceeds was used to refinance certain higher cost debt before their original maturity dates in 2018 and 2021. This resulted in early debt extinguishment charges of $34 million in total. The majority of this amount or $28 million is expected to be recovered through customer rates and was recorded as regulatory assets and did not impact earnings. However, $6 million or $0.02 per share was associated with parent company debt and recorded as a charge to earnings. We have reflected this item as a non-GAAP adjustment, consistent with prior year treatment of similar charges.
Excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share, an increase of $0.03 or 2.9% over the same period in 2016, with the Regulated segment up $0.05, the Market-Based Businesses up $0.03 and the parent was unfavorable $0.05.
Turning to Slide 14. Let me walk through our adjusted quarterly results by each business. Our regulated operations were up $0.05 in total. Revenue was up $0.08 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support growth and acquisitions, and this is net of lower demand or declining usage of about 1%. Also, in the third quarter of 2016, we had warmer weather as Walter discussed, which negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. Next, we had higher net depreciation, interest and general taxes of $0.03 driven by investment growth. And then finally, all other items the resulted in a benefit of $0.02, mainly from our continuous focus on cost management.
Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. We were up $0.03 compared to the same period last year. The majority of this increase was from Homeowner Services, from customer growth and price increases. Although we continue to experience lower capital projects in the Military Services Group, we are excited to announce the agreement with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, which represents partnership with our 13th military base. This contract will add $490 million in revenue over the 50-year contract term. And with the addition of this base, our backlog of revenue associated with our military contracts is over $3.5 billion over the remaining contract terms.
And then lastly, the parent was down $0.05 per share in the quarter. $0.02 was due to the cumulative tax adjustment I discussed last quarter related to the July 1 increase in our state income tax rate in Illinois. This change required us to remeasure our deferred tax balances at the new rates in the third quarter. The cumulative adjustment totaled $7 million. The portion calculated on a stand-alone basis for Illinois is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and was recorded as a regulatory asset. The remaining portion was allocated to the parent through our state tax apportionment factors and reduced 2017 earnings by $0.02 per share. The remaining $0.03 of the parent was from higher interest expense to support growth of $0.01 and an overlap of interest expense related to our August financing of about $0.01. The overlap was because we had $428 million of parent debt that didn't actually mature until October of this year but was part of the financing in August. And lastly, we had a $0.01 tax benefit recognized last year.
Turning to Slide 15. Our year-to-date adjusted earnings were $2.34 per share or a 3% increase over adjusted earnings in the same period last year. Our regulated operations were up $0.12 per share in total, which includes the $0.04 negative year-over-year impact from weather, as Walter discussed. Our Market-Based Businesses were up $0.01, with the favorable third quarter results in our Homeowner Services Group exceeding the impact from lower capital projects in our Military Services Group. Parent and other were down $0.06, mainly due to the 2 discrete tax adjustments associated with legislative changes in New York and Illinois impacting state tax apportionment.
Now let me discuss in more detail the August $1.35 billion financing on Slide 16. This was the largest financing at American Water since our IPO in 2008, and our team did an extraordinary job executing this transaction. Overall, the transaction reduced our long-term embedded cost of debt by 48 basis points, mainly for the benefit of our regulated customers. It reduced our 5-year debt maturities by $876 million, and it increased the average tenor of our debt from about 13 years to almost 16 years. Those are the highlights. Now let me discuss the deal.
We financed $1.35 billion with $750 million of 30-year debt at a 3.75% interest rate and $600 million of 10-year debt at a 2.95% interest rate. The funds will be used for 3 primary purposes: new debt to support growth of $440 million; refinancing of debt maturing in 2017 of $557 million; and $353 million for early refinancing of debt maturing in 2018 and 2021, including the make whole.  These transactions were designed to take advantage of lower interest rates for our customers.
Turning to Slide 17. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $66 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year from general rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on rate cases, infrastructure surcharges and proposed settlement for a total annualized revenue request of $321 million. This includes the Pennsylvania rate case proposed settlement of $62 million that Walter discussed.
Turning to Slide 18. Our cash flow from operations grew about 4.3% to $986 million for the first 9 months of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by net income growth in our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses.
Turning to dividends. On October 31, our Board of Directors approved our quarterly cash dividend of $0.415 per share to shareholders of record on November 10 and payable on December 1 of this year. And as a reminder, for 5 years straight, we have grown our dividend at or above the top of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS growth range.
Turning to Slide 19. Today, we are narrowing our 2017 adjusted earnings guidance range to $3 to $3.06 per share. As you know, we traditionally do not make many non-GAAP adjustments, and when we do, we want to be consistent and transparent. This year, we have had 2 items excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance range: the $0.07 per share benefit from the insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries' chemical spill and the $0.02 per share charge from early debt extinguishment at the parent company. These are reported as non-GAAP adjustments, consistent with our treatment in prior years. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan."

Before taking your questions, I'd like to mention the extraordinary weather and fire events that we've experienced in our country and our American Water service areas over the past few months. Given our geographic diversity, we are oftentimes located within natural disaster areas or close enough to offer help to other communities. With every event we say, safety comes first. We prepare, we leverage national resources, and we look to help impacted communities.
In August, Hurricane Harvey hit our operations in Fort Polk, Louisiana, dumping about 20 inches of rain on the bay. The storm also had a lesser effect on our Fort Hood, Texas, operations. Our employees, who work there and those who came to help, worked tirelessly during and after the storm to maintain service to both military communities.
In September, Hurricane Irma made landfall in Florida Keys as a Category 4 storm. By the time the storm moved up the cost to the desalination facility we operate in Tampa, our Contract Services Group had enacted this emergency plan and the facility made it through the storm with a little to no damage and no flooding. The plant and our people were there to help the community during the recovery.
And just last month, as Walter shared, our team in California responded to the tragic fires in Sonoma and Napa counties, maintaining water service for firefighting during the event and restoring full potable water service for the vast majority of our residents there within a matter of a few days. Whether it's hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, ice storms or wildfires, our response to all of these events highlight our commitment to resiliency of water and sanitation services for our customers. We use a systematic approach to assess the vulnerability of all of our assets, and we continually prioritize our critical infrastructure investment.
Our engineering and operations teams examine every facility we own and our regional water supplies to develop a capital plan to determine how much and what kind of investment is needed to ensure ongoing safe and reliable service to our customers, both during and after these disasters. We evaluate historic conditions combined with future predictions, and we consider factors like a 100-year flood, which now seems to be occurring every 20 years and other impacts of climate variability. These engineering planning studies drive our capital needs assessments, business planning and our financial forecasting.
During a significant weather event, a water utility's level of preparedness can literally mean the difference between a temporary inconvenience or a serious health or environmental consequence for our customers. We know that, and we prepare for it. It's our job, and we do it well.
I'm extremely proud of our people and their commitment to doing what's right for our customers and our communities every day. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people, who are recovering from these natural disasters.
And with that, we're happy to take your questions."

I'm going to start on your last question, and then turn it over to Walter and let him add anything to that and then address the issue of the Water Quality Accountability Act in New Jersey. So the fair market value in Pennsylvania, we think it's important to have an appraisal process that fairy values the systems we're acquiring and also sets a fair and sustainable base rate for our customers. We don't want a high appraisal value just to get a higher base rate, and we don't -- we want the right base rate for us and our customers for the long term. We don't think systems should be undervalued or overvalued because we think either one hurts the process long term in the spirit of the law. Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation requires appraisals to meet a uniform standard that the professional appraisal sector has. And there've been some questions about so what is the Pennsylvania PUC, what's their role, what's it not. In our look, and we have gotten an approval for McKeesport under that, we think that the Pennsylvania PUC can review the appraisals and determine if they comply. If appraisals don't comply, adjustment should be made, complying with standards is a check and balance that we think, clearly, the public utility commission has the authority for. So in our recent PUC application for the McKeesport acquisition, we sat down with the parties. We sat down with PUC staff. We sat down with consumers advocates. We listened to their issues, and we try to find a way forward that we could all live with. And we're very pleased that this was approved -- the settlement that we reached with the staff, with the consumers advocates were all approved by the public commission last week. So Walter, do you want to add anything to that?"

And I think the Scranton and sewer acquisition is an example of that. It's the first acquisition in the state where we're dealing with the issue of combined sewer and storm water. Currently, Pennsylvania American Water doesn't have a combined tariff for wastewater. We have a number of different tariffs because we've done so many acquisitions over the years. So working through the first issue that I said, the combined sewer and storm water, and also working through not having a combined tariff on the sewer side, it takes a lot of cooperation and a lot of dialogue with a number of parties, including the Office of Consumer Advocate and commission staff to get to the right place. But I think we've done that. I'm confident we've done that. The team has done a great job in working with all the parties. I think it's another example of how we're working to make sure that we get a fair settlement for all, and the Scranton Sewer Authority again is a perfect example of that."

So you probably won't see a price redetermination for Wright-Patterson for another 2 to 3 years because we just put in a bid that in that bid we look at the first 2 to 3 years in what we think it will take to do some of the capital upgrades on the project and what the initial O&M cost will be."

We've also had a renewed focus on wastewater. And over the last 3 to 4 years, we focused on buying wastewater systems in areas where we serve water customers. So we're going to continue to do some of the smaller wins where it makes sense in and around our footprint. Our real focus is on the larger 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 5,000 to 30,000 customers to make sure that these acquisitions are more sizable, they move the needle and they represent, I think, opportunities for us to improve the systems that we buy. Many of these systems need significant investment, and the systems of 5,000 to 30,000 seem to meet -- need more investment than some of the others. So that's really our focus."
