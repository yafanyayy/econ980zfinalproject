We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted in the release, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our reportable segments to align with the company's new global operating model. As a result, our reportable segments now comprise: Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate. In addition, we also enhanced our disclosures by adding key segment profitability metrics and other relevant data points to our financial supplement. Most notably, we now include the combined ratio for risk-based business and the pretax margin for Connected Living, our fee-based, capital-light offering in Global Lifestyle. These metrics enable investors to better track our performance in these critical businesses.
As a reminder, net operating income includes contributions from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits business, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company.
Related prior period results in the financial supplement and the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better align with our new operating structure.
On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and the reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including Form 10-K and 10-Qs.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alan."

Our performance for fourth quarter 2016 was in line with our expectations. While net operating income was lower, driven by higher reportable catastrophes and lender-placed normalization, Global Lifestyle performance improved year-over-year.
As we reflect on 2016, we view the year as one of transition. Our efforts were focused on implementing the critical building blocks of our transformation and continuing to position the company for long-term profitable growth.
The progress made this year to complete our portfolio realignment and implement a new organizational framework will allow us to do 3 things: first, continue to expand in our targeted growth areas; second, develop innovative solutions for our clients and consumers; and third, realize efficiencies in 2017 and beyond. While we have more work to do this year, the foundational elements are in place and have made us a stronger Assurant.
In 2016, we established the global business unit structure and completed the realignment of our technology, risk, strategy and finance organizations. In addition, our enterprise transformation office has already begun to help ensure we capture the value for more integrated global enterprise.
A key milestone in our portfolio realignment includes the wind-down of Assurant Health, which is now substantially complete. We received the majority of the risk mitigation payment due from CMS, including a $14 million payment in January, and have only $17 million in net receivables still outstanding. At the end of December, less than 200 policies remained. And in the fourth quarter, we received an additional $120 million in dividends from Health, totaling $458 million for the year.
These dividends, along with nearly $900 million from the sale of Employee Benefits, contributed to our strong capital position, as did [ph] another $350 million from our operating segments. This allowed us to both return capital to shareholders and to invest in the housing and lifestyle markets where we believe we can outperform long term.
Let's shift now to some business highlights for the quarter and the year. In Global Housing, we strengthened our leadership position in the manufactured housing market with the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition. With nearly $40 million in annualized revenues and $25 million in expected incremental premium, Green Tree expands our voluntary housing offering and deepens our alignment with this leading mortgage company.
In late December, we reached an agreement related to the lender-placed multistate market conduct examination and a separate agreement with the Minnesota [ph] State Insurance Department. In addition to settlement payments, the agreed modifications put into practice various procedures already largely implemented across Assurant lender-placed business. We are pleased to resolve these regulatory matters.
Over the course of the year, we continued to invest in the transformation of our lender-placed platform to further enhance our strong customer service offering. We also increased our loans track [ph] to $36 million, up 8%, further solidifying our leadership position in this market.
Turning to our housing fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multi-family housing increased revenues by 14% to $320 million in 2016. We now protect almost 1.5 million renters across the growing property management network and affinity relationship nationwide.
Additionally, mortgage solutions is investing in key technology enhancements to support continued growth across field and valuation services. And we added products and services through the acquisition of American Title. In 2016, the business grew fee income by 14% to nearly $330 million. Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions now account for 28% of the segment's revenue. And we continue to expand our business with new and existing clients while adding innovative offerings.
In Global Lifestyle, we reinforced our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect nearly 32 million devices worldwide. In 2016, we processed 8.8 million devices at our repair and logistics operations in the U.S., helping to drive nearly 20% growth in fee income for Global Lifestyle. Recently, we also made a small investment in mobile device and asset disposition in South Korea, strengthening our footprint in Asia, an important priority for Assurant.
In addition to this acquisition, we also grew organically through expanded relationships and new offerings across mobile carriers, e-commerce and OEM distribution channels. At the same time, we are continuing to manage the impact to [ph] the clients in legacy businesses. Our focus remains on ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. These factors, in addition to increasing scale, are important to margin expansion over time.
In Global Preneed, we now provide prefunded funeral insurance to 1.9 million policyholders across North America. Our breadth and depth of experience in this area, along with our long-term partnerships, gives us the scale and data that enables us to help our clients grow their business. Our integrated approach also allows us to be a single point of contact for the agent and the funeral home, offering a seamless experience for the end consumer.
As we continue to make progress in our multiyear transformation, performance is measured against 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses, given the inherent volatility of the weather.
For full year 2016, net operating income decreased by 9% to $379 million, primarily due to the expected decline of lender-placed. Despite lower income, operating earnings per diluted share increased modestly to $6.12, up from $6.06 in 2015, driven by our disciplined capital deployment.
Full year operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.5%. Fee-based, capital-light offerings now represent 52% of revenue. Continuing to grow these businesses will be an important driver in achieving our goal of 15% ROE by 2020.
At the end of December, holding company capital totaled $775 million. This is after returning $995 million to shareholders in 2016. We have now delivered 2/3 of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017.
We also deployed approximately $210 million in strategic investments last year to strengthen our offerings, capability and distribution in housing and lifestyle. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect Assurant's net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, to be roughly level with 2016 earnings, also excluding cat losses.
Growth in Connected Living, multi-family housing, mortgage solutions and our vehicle protection business will offsite -- offset declines in lender-placed and other legacy businesses. We're already realizing savings from our enterprise transformation projects, while in the short term, we are investing in procurement, IT and other initiatives that will drive profitable growth over time.
We also expect to grow operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, by double digits this year, primarily due to the share repurchase activity already executed throughout 2016.
Over the long term, we are committed to growing net operating income and generating 15% average annual growth in operating earnings per share. We are confident the progress made in 2016 will enable us to produce meaningful operating earnings growth longer term as we progress further toward our 2020 objectives.
We believe our attractive business portfolio and a more efficient operating structure will produce more diversified earnings, while continuing to generate strong cash flow to support our disciplined capital management strategy.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook for 2017 in greater detail. Richard?"

Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically mentioned, all of my comments are related to fourth quarter 2016 as compared to the prior period last year.
Overall, as Alan said, Assurant's results came in as we expected. We'll start with Global Housing, which produced earnings of $10.8 million, including $44 million of reportable catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Matthew. Excluding cat losses, net operating income was down $13 million. This was due to continued lender-placed normalization and additional regulatory expenses. 
The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 15% to 105%, driven by higher cats. Excluding cat losses, the combined ratio was 88.8%, up 2 percentage points. This was the result of higher regulatory and new client on-boarding expenses. More favorable non-cat losses related to lower frequency and severity of claims were a [ph] modest offset.
Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 11.2%, down 50 basis points. Expanded profitability in multi-family housing was more than offset by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses.
Turning to revenue. Fourth quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 5%, primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates. Our placement rate of 2.13% in the third quarter decreased to 2% at year-end. As we mentioned on our last call, we started to onboard 2.7 million loans in the third quarter and lowered the average placement rates. These new loans drove about 9 of the 13 basis point decline. The remaining 4 basis point reduction relates to the ongoing lender-placed normalization.
Now let's move to revenue for our fee-based Global Housing businesses. Multi-family housing increased 11%. This reflects double-digit growth in renters' policies sold through our affinity channels and property management network. For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 5%, including the acquisition of American Title. If we exclude the acquisition, mortgage solutions was down 10%, primarily related to lower volumes in field services.
As we continue to work toward our 2020 goal of 15% to 20% pretax margins in the housing fee-based business, we will continue to invest in technology that supports business expansion, while we also look to create efficiencies.
As Alan mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Green Tree Insurance Agency last week. Through this deal, Assurant will retain its existing book of voluntary insurance or [ph] borrowers service by Daitec [ph] Financial Services. And we'll have the opportunity to write additional housing business, all at attractive double-digit margins. Taking into account the amortization of intangibles, we expect this transaction to have minimal impact on Global Housing's earnings in 2017 and to be accretive over time.
For 2017, we anticipate a continued decline in Global Housing premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, as we move closer to a normalized steady state in lender-placed. Revenue growth in our fee-based businesses is expected to continue. And overall, we believe these offerings will account for a larger portion of the segment's earnings as we capture market share.
Additional expense savings from initiatives implemented across our Global Housing are also expected. Longer term, we continue to expect Global Housing to produce a 20%-plus operating ROE as we maintain our leadership position in lender-placed and grow our fee-based product and services.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment's earnings increased by $15 million to $35 million. This was largely due to improved performance in mobile and service contracts, along with higher investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Year-over-year, mobile improvement was driven by lower expenses, along with a more profitable mix of devices.
Revenue in Global Lifestyle decreased by 4%, mainly driven by premium declines from a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, revenue was lowered by the impact of foreign exchange and also continued reductions in legacy retailers and credit [ph] insurance. This was partially offset by growth in our vehicle protection business as well as fee income from expanded mobile service offerings.
In the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, there was a change in the program structure for a large service contract client. While this change has no bottom line impact, it did reduce revenues by $47 million. We expect it also to reduce 2017 premium and expenses by $500 million. The revised contract does allow us to deepen our relationship with the long-term client. This change will also affect our global Connected Living pretax margin, which we now expect to increase from 8% to 9.5% by 2020.
The combined ratio for the risk-based business, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, increased by approximately 100 basis points to 95.6%. A modest increase in vehicle protection losses was partially offset by better credit loss experience. Overall, the quarterly and full year combined ratios are within the 96% to 98% range, which we would be expect to maintain through 2020.
The pretax margin for the fee-based business [ph] or global Connected Living was up from negative 1% to a positive 3.7% this quarter. The key drivers were improved performance from both mobile as well as service contracts.
In 2017, we expect net operating income in Global Lifestyle to increase. This will come from Connected Living, driven primarily by mobile, along with higher profitability from the vehicle protection business and expense savings. At the same time, we will continue to manage declines from U.S. credit insurance and lower production from North American retail clients.
Net earned premiums and fees for the segment overall will be down for the year due to the client contract change. However, excluding this change, revenue is expected to increase from growth in mobile and vehicle protection. Our results are also subject to the impact of foreign exchange and variability in the mobile market. While fluctuations from year to year are likely, we continue to expect 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term. 
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased modestly to $10.9 million, mainly the result of $1.4 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Underlying performance of the business was otherwise stable.
Total revenue for the quarter was up 7%. This was due in part to sales written in previous years that are now beginning to earn. In 2017, we expect fee income and earnings to grow in Preneed from increased production across North America and operational efficiencies.
Before turning to Corporate, I did want to point out one additional change. A part of our new segment reporting, the goodwill in former Solutions segment was distributed between Lifestyle and Preneed. Approximately $140 million of Solutions' goodwill has been allocated to Preneed as of December 31. Therefore, our previously announced ROE target of 12% is now 11%.
Moving to Corporate. The fourth quarter loss decreased $10 million to $20 million. The change was due to lower taxes and increased investment income from higher assets at the holding company. This was partially offset by an increase in expenses to support our multiyear transformation. For the full year 2017, we expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million as expense savings are offset by investments to support our multiyear transformation.
Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with $525 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $341 million in total dividends comprised of $245 million from capital previously supporting the Employee Benefits business and Health runoff operations and $96 million from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed.
For 2017, we expect the segment dividends will approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the business and rating agency requirements. In addition, we anticipate receiving about $100 million in dividends from Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, pending regulatory approval.
Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to: first, return $212 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends; second, to complete a tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2034, reducing deployable capital by $125 million; and finally, to set aside $130 million in advance of the February close of the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition as well as for the investment in mobile device capabilities. Through February 3, we bought back an additional 378,000 shares for a total of $36 million.
So to summarize, there are a few things we want to take away from today's call. 2016 was another critical year in our multiyear transformation. We're making great progress implementing a stronger and more efficient operating model. And we are expanding profitably within our targeted growth areas.
All of these elements, in aggregate, will help position the company for long-term profitable growth.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted in the release, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our reportable segments to align with the company's new global operating model. As a result, our reportable segments now comprise: Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate. In addition, we also enhanced our disclosures by adding key segment profitability metrics and other relevant data points to our financial supplement. Most notably, we now include the combined ratio for risk-based business and the pretax margin for Connected Living, our fee-based, capital-light offering in Global Lifestyle. These metrics enable investors to better track our performance in these critical businesses.
As a reminder, net operating income includes contributions from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits business, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company.
Related prior period results in the financial supplement and the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better align with our new operating structure.
On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and the reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.

Our performance for fourth quarter 2016 was in line with our expectations. While net operating income was lower, driven by higher reportable catastrophes and lender-placed normalization, Global Lifestyle performance improved year-over-year.
As we reflect on 2016, we view the year as one of transition. Our efforts were focused on implementing the critical building blocks of our transformation and continuing to position the company for long-term profitable growth.
The progress made this year to complete our portfolio realignment and implement a new organizational framework will allow us to do 3 things: first, continue to expand in our targeted growth areas; second, develop innovative solutions for our clients and consumers; and third, realize efficiencies in 2017 and beyond. While we have more work to do this year, the foundational elements are in place and have made us a stronger Assurant.
In 2016, we established the global business unit structure and completed the realignment of our technology, risk, strategy and finance organizations. In addition, our enterprise transformation office has already begun to help ensure we capture the value for more integrated global enterprise.
A key milestone in our portfolio realignment includes the wind-down of Assurant Health, which is now substantially complete. We received the majority of the risk mitigation payment due from CMS, including a $14 million payment in January, and have only $17 million in net receivables still outstanding. At the end of December, less than 200 policies remained. And in the fourth quarter, we received an additional $120 million in dividends from Health, totaling $458 million for the year.
These dividends, along with nearly $900 million from the sale of Employee Benefits, contributed to our strong capital position, as did another $350 million from our operating segments. This allowed us to both return capital to shareholders and to invest in the housing and lifestyle markets where we believe we can outperform long term.
Let's shift now to some business highlights for the quarter and the year. In Global Housing, we strengthened our leadership position in the manufactured housing market with the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition. With nearly $40 million in annualized revenues and $25 million in expected incremental premium, Green Tree expands our voluntary housing offering and deepens our alignment with this leading mortgage company.
In late December, we reached an agreement related to the lender-placed multistate market conduct examination and a separate agreement with the Minnesota State Insurance Department. In addition to settlement payments, the agreed modifications put into practice various procedures already largely implemented across Assurant lender-placed business. We are pleased to resolve these regulatory matters.
Over the course of the year, we continued to invest in the transformation of our lender-placed platform to further enhance our strong customer service offering. We also increased our loans tracked to $36 million, up 8%, further solidifying our leadership position in this market.
Turning to our housing fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multi-family housing increased revenues by 14% to $320 million in 2016. We now protect almost 1.5 million renters across the growing property management network and affinity relationship nationwide.
Additionally, mortgage solutions is investing in key technology enhancements to support continued growth across field and valuation services. And we added products and services through the acquisition of American Title. In 2016, the business grew fee income by 14% to nearly $330 million. Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions now account for 28% of the segment's revenue. And we continue to expand our business with new and existing clients while adding innovative offerings.
In Global Lifestyle, we reinforced our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect nearly 32 million devices worldwide. In 2016, we processed 8.8 million devices at our repair and logistics operations in the U.S., helping to drive nearly 20% growth in fee income for Global Lifestyle. Recently, we also made a small investment in mobile device and asset disposition in South Korea, strengthening our footprint in Asia, an important priority for Assurant.
In addition to this acquisition, we also grew organically through expanded relationships and new offerings across mobile carriers, e-commerce and OEM distribution channels. At the same time, we are continuing to manage the impact to the clients in legacy businesses. Our focus remains on ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. These factors, in addition to increasing scale, are important to margin expansion over time.
In Global Preneed, we now provide prefunded funeral insurance to 1.9 million policyholders across North America. Our breadth and depth of experience in this area, along with our long-term partnerships, gives us the scale and data that enables us to help our clients grow their business. Our integrated approach also allows us to be a single point of contact for the agent and the funeral home, offering a seamless experience for the end consumer.
As we continue to make progress in our multiyear transformation, performance is measured against 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses, given the inherent volatility of the weather.
For full year 2016, net operating income decreased by 9% to $379 million, primarily due to the expected decline of lender-placed. Despite lower income, operating earnings per diluted share increased modestly to $6.12, up from $6.06 in 2015, driven by our disciplined capital deployment.
Full year operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.5%. Fee-based, capital-light offerings now represent 52% of revenue. Continuing to grow these businesses will be an important driver in achieving our goal of 15% ROE by 2020.
At the end of December, holding company capital totaled $775 million. This is after returning $995 million to shareholders in 2016. We have now delivered 2/3 of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017.
We also deployed approximately $210 million in strategic investments last year to strengthen our offerings, capability and distribution in housing and lifestyle. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect Assurant's net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, to be roughly level with 2016 earnings, also excluding cat losses.
Growth in Connected Living, multi-family housing, mortgage solutions and our vehicle protection business will offsite -- offset declines in lender-placed and other legacy businesses. We're already realizing savings from our enterprise transformation projects, while in the short term, we are investing in procurement, IT and other initiatives that will drive profitable growth over time.
We also expect to grow operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, by double digits this year, primarily due to the share repurchase activity already executed throughout 2016.
Over the long term, we are committed to growing net operating income and generating 15% average annual growth in operating earnings per share. We are confident the progress made in 2016 will enable us to produce meaningful operating earnings growth longer term as we progress further toward our 2020 objectives.
We believe our attractive business portfolio and a more efficient operating structure will produce more diversified earnings, while continuing to generate strong cash flow to support our disciplined capital management strategy.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook for 2017 in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,415710408,1127214,"Assurant, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2017",2017-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically mentioned, all of my comments are related to fourth quarter 2016 as compared to the prior period last year.Overall, as Alan said, Assurant's",1451,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically mentioned, all of my comments are related to fourth quarter 2016 as compared to the prior period last year.
Overall, as Alan said, Assurant's results came in as we expected. We'll start with Global Housing, which produced earnings of $10.8 million, including $44 million of reportable catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Matthew. Excluding cat losses, net operating income was down $13 million. This was due to continued lender-placed normalization and additional regulatory expenses. 
The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 15% to 105%, driven by higher cats. Excluding cat losses, the combined ratio was 88.8%, up 2 percentage points. This was the result of higher regulatory and new client on-boarding expenses. More favorable non-cat losses related to lower frequency and severity of claims were a modest offset.
Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 11.2%, down 50 basis points. Expanded profitability in multi-family housing was more than offset by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses.
Turning to revenue. Fourth quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 5%, primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates. Our placement rate of 2.13% in the third quarter decreased to 2% at year-end. As we mentioned on our last call, we started to onboard 2.7 million loans in the third quarter and lowered the average placement rates. These new loans drove about 9 of the 13 basis point decline. The remaining 4 basis point reduction relates to the ongoing lender-placed normalization.
Now let's move to revenue for our fee-based Global Housing businesses. Multi-family housing increased 11%. This reflects double-digit growth in renters' policies sold through our affinity channels and property management network. For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 5%, including the acquisition of American Title. If we exclude the acquisition, mortgage solutions was down 10%, primarily related to lower volumes in field services.
As we continue to work toward our 2020 goal of 15% to 20% pretax margins in the housing fee-based business, we will continue to invest in technology that supports business expansion, while we also look to create efficiencies.
As Alan mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Green Tree Insurance Agency last week. Through this deal, Assurant will retain its existing book of voluntary insurance for borrowers serviced by Ditech Financial Services. And we'll have the opportunity to write additional housing business, all at attractive double-digit margins. Taking into account the amortization of intangibles, we expect this transaction to have minimal impact on Global Housing's earnings in 2017 and to be accretive over time.
For 2017, we anticipate a continued decline in Global Housing premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, as we move closer to a normalized steady state in lender-placed. Revenue growth in our fee-based businesses is expected to continue. And overall, we believe these offerings will account for a larger portion of the segment's earnings as we capture market share.
Additional expense savings from initiatives implemented across our Global Housing are also expected. Longer term, we continue to expect Global Housing to produce a 20%-plus operating ROE as we maintain our leadership position in lender-placed and grow our fee-based product and services.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment's earnings increased by $15 million to $35 million. This was largely due to improved performance in mobile and service contracts, along with higher investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Year-over-year, mobile improvement was driven by lower expenses, along with a more profitable mix of devices.
Revenue in Global Lifestyle decreased by 4%, mainly driven by premium declines from a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, revenue was lowered by the impact of foreign exchange and also continued reductions in legacy retailers and credit insurance. This was partially offset by growth in our vehicle protection business as well as fee income from expanded mobile service offerings.
In the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, there was a change in the program structure for a large service contract client. While this change has no bottom line impact, it did reduce revenues by $47 million. We expect it also to reduce 2017 premium and expenses by $500 million. The revised contract does allow us to deepen our relationship with the long-term client. This change will also affect our global Connected Living pretax margin, which we now expect to increase from 8% to 9.5% by 2020.
The combined ratio for the risk-based business, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, increased by approximately 100 basis points to 95.6%. A modest increase in vehicle protection losses was partially offset by better credit loss experience. Overall, the quarterly and full year combined ratios are within the 96% to 98% range, which we would be expect to maintain through 2020.
The pretax margin for the fee-based business or global Connected Living was up from negative 1% to a positive 3.7% this quarter. The key drivers were improved performance from both mobile as well as service contracts.
In 2017, we expect net operating income in Global Lifestyle to increase. This will come from Connected Living, driven primarily by mobile, along with higher profitability from the vehicle protection business and expense savings. At the same time, we will continue to manage declines from U.S. credit insurance and lower production from North American retail clients.
Net earned premiums and fees for the segment overall will be down for the year due to the client contract change. However, excluding this change, revenue is expected to increase from growth in mobile and vehicle protection. Our results are also subject to the impact of foreign exchange and variability in the mobile market. While fluctuations from year to year are likely, we continue to expect 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term. 
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased modestly to $10.9 million, mainly the result of $1.4 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Underlying performance of the business was otherwise stable.
Total revenue for the quarter was up 7%. This was due in part to sales written in previous years that are now beginning to earn. In 2017, we expect fee income and earnings to grow in Preneed from increased production across North America and operational efficiencies.
Before turning to Corporate, I did want to point out one additional change. A part of our new segment reporting, the goodwill in former Solutions segment was distributed between Lifestyle and Preneed. Approximately $140 million of Solutions' goodwill has been allocated to Preneed as of December 31. Therefore, our previously announced ROE target of 12% is now 11%.
Moving to Corporate. The fourth quarter loss decreased $10 million to $20 million. The change was due to lower taxes and increased investment income from higher assets at the holding company. This was partially offset by an increase in expenses to support our multiyear transformation. For the full year 2017, we expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million as expense savings are offset by investments to support our multiyear transformation.
Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with $525 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $341 million in total dividends comprised of $245 million from capital previously supporting the Employee Benefits business and Health runoff operations and $96 million from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed.
For 2017, we expect the segment dividends will approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the business and rating agency requirements. In addition, we anticipate receiving about $100 million in dividends from Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, pending regulatory approval.
Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to: first, return $212 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends; second, to complete a tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2034, reducing deployable capital by $125 million; and finally, to set aside $130 million in advance of the February close of the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition as well as for the investment in mobile device capabilities. Through February 3, we bought back an additional 378,000 shares for a total of $36 million.
So to summarize, there are a few things we want to take away from today's call. 2016 was another critical year in our multiyear transformation. We're making great progress implementing a stronger and more efficient operating model. And we are expanding profitably within our targeted growth areas.
All of these elements, in aggregate, will help position the company for long-term profitable growth.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted in the release, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our reportable segments to align with the company's new global operating model. As a result, our reportable segments now comprise Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate. In addition, we also enhanced our disclosures by adding key segment profitability metrics and other relevant data points to our financial supplement. Most notably, we now include the combined ratio for risk-based business and the pretax margin for Connected Living, our fee-based, capital-light offering in Global Lifestyle. These metrics enable investors to better track our performance in these critical businesses.
As a reminder, net operating income includes contributions from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits business, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company.
Related prior period results in the financial supplement and the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better align with our new operating structure.
On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including Form 10-K and 10-Qs.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alan."

Our performance for fourth quarter 2016 was in line with our expectations. While net operating income was lower, driven by higher reportable catastrophes and lender-placed normalization, Global Lifestyle performance improved year-over-year.
As we reflect on 2016, we view the year as one of transition. Our efforts were focused on implementing the critical building blocks of our transformation and continuing to position the company for long-term profitable growth.
The progress made this year to complete our portfolio realignment and implement a new organizational framework will allow us to do 3 things: first, continue to expand in our targeted growth areas; second, develop innovative solutions for our clients and consumers; and third, realize efficiencies in 2017 and beyond. While we have more work to do this year, the foundational elements are in place and have made us a stronger Assurant.
In 2016, we established the global business unit structure and completed the realignment of our technology, risk, strategy and finance organizations. In addition, our enterprise transformation office has already begun to help ensure we capture the value for more integrated global enterprise.
A key milestone in our portfolio realignment includes the wind-down of Assurant Health, which is now substantially complete. We received the majority of the risk mitigation payments due from CMS, including a $14 million payment in January, and have only $17 million in net receivables still outstanding. At the end of December, less than 200 policies remained. And then in the fourth quarter, we received an additional $120 million in dividends from Health, totaling $458 million for the year.
These dividends, along with nearly $900 million from the sale of Employee Benefits, contributed to our strong capital position, as did another $350 million from our operating segments. This allowed us to both return capital to shareholders and to invest in the housing and lifestyle markets where we believe we can outperform long term.
Let's shift now to some business highlights for the quarter and the year. In Global Housing, we strengthened our leadership position in the manufactured housing market with the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition. With nearly $40 million in annualized revenues and $25 million in expected incremental premium, Green Tree expands our voluntary housing offering and deepens our alignment with this leading mortgage company.
In late December, we reached an agreement related to the lender-placed multistate market conduct examination and a separate agreement with the Minnesota State Insurance Department. In addition to settlement payments, the agreed modifications put into practice various procedures already largely implemented across Assurant's lender-placed business. We are pleased to resolve these regulatory matters.
Over the course of the year, we continued to invest in the transformation of our lender-placed platform to further enhance our strong customer service offering. We also increased our loans tracked to $36 million, up 8%, further solidifying our leadership position in this market.
Turning to our housing fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multi-family housing increased revenues by 14% to $320 million in 2016. We now protect almost 1.5 million renters across the growing property management network and affinity relationship nationwide.
Additionally, mortgage solutions is investing in key technology enhancements to support continued growth across field and valuation services. And we added products and services through the acquisition of American Title. In 2016, the business grew fee income by 14% to nearly $330 million. Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions now account for 28% of the segment's revenue. And we continue to expand our business with new and existing clients while adding innovative offerings.
In Global Lifestyle, we reinforced our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect nearly 32 million devices worldwide. In 2016, we processed 8.8 million devices at our repair and logistics operations in the U.S., helping to drive nearly 20% growth in fee income for Global Lifestyle. Recently, we also made a small investment in a mobile device and asset disposition in South Korea, strengthening our footprint in Asia, an important priority for Assurant.
In addition to this acquisition, we also grew organically through expanded relationships and new offerings across mobile carriers, e-commerce and OEM distribution channels. At the same time, we are continuing to manage the impact of declines in the clients in legacy businesses. Our focus remains on ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. These factors, in addition to increasing scale, are important to margin expansion over time.
In Global Preneed, we now provide prefunded funeral insurance to 1.9 million policyholders across North America. Our breadth and depth of experience in this area, along with our long-term partnerships, gives us the scale and data that enables us to help our clients grow their business. Our integrated approach also allows us to be a single point of contact for the agent and the funeral home, offering a seamless experience for the end consumer.
As we continue to make progress in our multiyear transformation, performance is measured against 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses, given the inherent volatility of the weather.
For full year 2016, net operating income decreased by 9% to $379 million, primarily due to the expected decline of lender-placed. Despite lower income, operating earnings per diluted share increased modestly to $6.12, up from $6.06 in 2015, driven by our disciplined capital deployment.
Full year operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.5%. Fee-based, capital-light offerings now represent 52% of revenue. Continuing to grow these businesses will be an important driver in achieving our goal of 15% ROE by 2020.
At the end of December, holding company capital totaled $775 million. This is after returning $995 million to shareholders in 2016. We have now delivered 2/3 of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017.
We also deployed approximately $210 million in strategic investments last year to strengthen our offerings, capability and distribution in housing and lifestyle. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect Assurant's net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, to be roughly level with 2016 earnings, also excluding cat losses.
Growth in Connected Living, multi-family housing, mortgage solutions and our vehicle protection business will offsite -- offset declines in lender-placed and other legacy businesses. We're already realizing savings from our enterprise transformation projects, while in the short-term, we are investing in procurement, IT and other initiatives that will drive profitable growth over time.
We also expect to grow operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, by double digits this year, primarily due to the share repurchase activity already executed throughout 2016.
Over the long term, we are committed to growing net operating income and generating 15% average annual growth in operating earnings per share. We are confident the progress made in 2016 will enable us to produce meaningful operating earnings growth longer term as we progress further toward our 2020 objectives.
We believe our attractive business portfolio and a more efficient operating structure will produce more diversified earnings while continuing to generate strong cash flow to support our disciplined capital management strategy.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook for 2017 in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,415710408,1127472,"Assurant, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2017",2017-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically mentioned, all of my comments are related to fourth quarter 2016 as compared to the prior period last year.Overall, as Alan said, Assurant's",1450,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically mentioned, all of my comments are related to fourth quarter 2016 as compared to the prior period last year.
Overall, as Alan said, Assurant's results came in as we expected. We'll start with Global Housing, which produced earnings of $10.8 million, including $44 million of reportable catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Matthew. Excluding cat losses, net operating income was down $13 million. This was due to continued lender-placed normalization and additional regulatory expenses. 
The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 15% to 105%, driven by higher cats. Excluding cat losses, the combined ratio was 88.8%, up 2 percentage points. This was the result of higher regulatory and new client onboarding expenses. More favorable non-cat losses related to lower frequency and severity of claims were a modest offset.
Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 11.2%, down 50 basis points. Expanded profitability in multi-family housing was more than offset by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses.
Turning to revenue. Fourth quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 5%, primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates. Our placement rate of 2.13% in the third quarter decreased to 2% at year-end. As we mentioned on our last call, we started to onboard 2.7 million loans in the third quarter and lower than average placement rates. These new loans drove about 9 of the 13 basis point decline. The remaining 4 basis point reduction relates to the ongoing lender-placed normalization.
Now let's move to revenue for our fee-based Global Housing businesses. Multi-family housing increased 11%. This reflects double-digit growth in renters' policies sold through our affinity channels and property management network. For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 5%, including the acquisition of American Title. If we exclude the acquisition, mortgage solutions was down 10%, primarily related to lower volumes in field services.
As we continue to work toward our 2020 goal of 15% to 20% pretax margins in the housing fee-based business, we will continue to invest in technology that supports business expansion, while we also look to create efficiencies.
As Alan mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Green Tree Insurance Agency last week. Through this deal, Assurant will retain its existing book of voluntary insurance for borrowers serviced by Ditech Financial Services. And we'll have the opportunity to write additional housing business, all at attractive double-digit margins. Taking into account the amortization of intangibles, we expect this transaction to have minimal impact on Global Housing's earnings in 2017 and to be accretive over time.
For 2017, we anticipate a continued decline in Global Housing premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, as we move closer to a normalized steady-state in lender-placed. Revenue growth in our fee-based businesses is expected to continue. And overall, we believe these offerings will account for a larger portion of the segment's earnings as we capture market share.
Additional expense savings from initiatives implemented across our Global Housing are also expected. Longer term, we continue to expect Global Housing to produce a 20%-plus operating ROE as we maintain our leadership position in lender-placed and grow our fee-based product and services.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment's earnings increased by $15 million to $35 million. This was largely due to improved performance in mobile and service contracts, along with higher investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Year-over-year, mobile improvement was driven by lower expenses, along with a more profitable mix of devices.
Revenue in Global Lifestyle decreased by 4%, mainly driven by premium declines from a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, revenue was lowered by the impact of foreign exchange and also continued reductions in legacy retailers and credit insurance. This was partially offset by growth in our vehicle protection business as well as fee income from expanded mobile service offerings.
In the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, there was a change in the program structure for a large service contract client. While this change has no bottom line impact, it did reduce revenues by $47 million. We expect it also to reduce 2017 premium and expenses by $500 million. The revised contract does allow us to deepen our relationship with the long-term client. This change will also affect our global Connected Living pretax margin, which we now expect to increase from 8% to 9.5% by 2020.
The combined ratio for the risk-based business, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, increased by approximately 100 basis points to 95.6%. A modest increase in vehicle protection losses was partially offset by better credit loss experience. Overall, the quarterly and full year combined ratios are within the 96% to 98% range, which we would be expected to maintain through 2020.
The pretax margin for the fee-based business or global Connected Living was up from negative 1% to a positive 3.7% this quarter. The key drivers were improved performance from both mobile as well as service contracts.
In 2017, we expect net operating income in Global Lifestyle to increase. This will come from Connected Living, driven primarily by mobile, along with higher profitability from the vehicle protection business and expense savings. At the same time, we will continue to manage declines from U.S. credit insurance and lower production from North American retail clients.
Net earned premiums and fees for the segment overall will be down for the year due to the client contract change. However, excluding this change, revenue is expected to increase from growth in mobile and vehicle protection. Our results are also subject to the impact of foreign exchange and variability in the mobile market. While fluctuations from year to year are likely, we continue to expect 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term. 
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased modestly to $10.9 million, mainly the result of $1.4 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Underlying performance of the business was otherwise stable.
Total revenue for the quarter was up 7%. This was due in part to sales written in previous years that are now beginning to earn. In 2017, we expect fee income and earnings to grow in Preneed from increased production across North America and operational efficiencies.
Before turning to Corporate, I did want to point out one additional change. A part of our new segment reporting, the goodwill in former Solutions segment was distributed between Lifestyle and Preneed. Approximately $140 million of Solutions' goodwill has been allocated to Preneed as of December 31. Therefore, our previously announced ROE target of 12% is now 11%.
Moving to Corporate. The fourth quarter loss decreased $10 million to $20 million. The change was due to lower taxes and increased investment income from higher assets at the holding company. This was partially offset by an increase in expenses to support our multiyear transformation. For the full year 2017, we expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million as expense savings are offset by investments to support our multiyear transformation.
Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with $525 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $341 million in total dividends comprised of $245 million from capital previously supporting the Employee Benefits business and Health runoff operations and $96 million from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed.
For 2017, we expect the segment dividends will approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the business and rating agency requirements. In addition, we anticipate receiving about $100 million in dividends from Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, pending regulatory approval.
Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to: first, return $212 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends; second, to complete a tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2034, reducing deployable capital by $125 million; and finally, to set aside $130 million in advance of the February close of the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition as well as for the investment in mobile device capabilities. Through February 3, we bought back an additional 378,000 shares for a total of $36 million.
So to summarize, there are a few things we want to take away from today's call. 2016 was another critical year in our multiyear transformation. We're making great progress implementing a stronger and more efficient operating model. And we are expanding profitably within our targeted growth areas.
All of these elements, in aggregate, will help position the company for long-term profitable growth.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

If you go back to when we made our first acquisitions in this area now about 2.5 years ago, we knew that broadly, the market would decline as foreclosure volumes normalized, but we had an explicit strategy to gain share by partnering with the leading companies that are already our partner around lender-placed homeowners. That has worked very well. Part of the issue in Q4, you have some normal seasonality in the field side of the business, where volumes are higher in Q2 and Q3 and lower in Q4 and Q1. But we feel very good about the progress. We have a new leader that just joined, probably to really integrate all of the 4 businesses together and give us a platform to drive even further growth in that business."

We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted in the release, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our reportable segments to align with the company's new global operating model. As a result, our reportable segments now comprise Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate. In addition, we also enhanced our disclosures by adding key segment profitability metrics and other relevant data points to our financial supplement. Most notably, we now include the combined ratio for risk-based business and the pretax margin for Connected Living, our fee-based, capital-light offering in Global Lifestyle. These metrics enable investors to better track our performance in these critical businesses.
As a reminder, net operating income includes contributions from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits business, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company.
Related prior period results in the financial supplement and the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better align with our new operating structure.
On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including Form 10-K and 10-Qs.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alan."

Our performance for fourth quarter 2016 was in line with our expectations. While net operating income was lower, driven by higher reportable catastrophes and lender-placed normalization, Global Lifestyle performance improved year-over-year.
As we reflect on 2016, we view the year as one of transition. Our efforts were focused on implementing the critical building blocks of our transformation and continuing to position the company for long-term profitable growth.
The progress made this year to complete our portfolio realignment and implement a new organizational framework will allow us to do 3 things: first, continue to expand in our targeted growth areas; second, develop innovative solutions for our clients and consumers; and third, realize efficiencies in 2017 and beyond. While we have more work to do this year, the foundational elements are in place and have made us a stronger Assurant.
In 2016, we established the global business unit structure and completed the realignment of our technology, risk, strategy and finance organizations. In addition, our enterprise transformation office has already begun to help ensure we capture the value for more integrated global enterprise.
A key milestone in our portfolio realignment includes the wind-down of Assurant Health, which is now substantially complete. We received the majority of the risk mitigation payments due from CMS, including a $14 million payment in January, and have only $17 million in net receivables still outstanding. At the end of December, less than 200 policies remained. And then in the fourth quarter, we received an additional $120 million in dividends from Health, totaling $458 million for the year.
These dividends, along with nearly $900 million from the sale of Employee Benefits, contributed to our strong capital position, as did another $350 million from our operating segments. This allowed us to both return capital to shareholders and to invest in the housing and lifestyle markets where we believe we can outperform long term.
Let's shift now to some business highlights for the quarter and the year. In Global Housing, we strengthened our leadership position in the manufactured housing market with the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition. With nearly $40 million in annualized revenues and $25 million in expected incremental premium, Green Tree expands our voluntary housing offering and deepens our alignment with this leading mortgage company.
In late December, we reached an agreement related to the lender-placed multistate market conduct examination and a separate agreement with the Minnesota State Insurance Department. In addition to settlement payments, the agreed modifications put into practice various procedures already largely implemented across Assurant's lender-placed business. We are pleased to resolve these regulatory matters.
Over the course of the year, we continued to invest in the transformation of our lender-placed platform to further enhance our strong customer service offering. We also increased our loans tracked to $36 million, up 8%, further solidifying our leadership position in this market.
Turning to our housing fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multi-family housing increased revenues by 14% to $320 million in 2016. We now protect almost 1.5 million renters across the growing property management network and affinity relationship nationwide.
Additionally, mortgage solutions is investing in key technology enhancements to support continued growth across field and valuation services. And we added products and services through the acquisition of American Title. In 2016, the business grew fee income by 14% to nearly $330 million. Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions now account for 28% of the segment's revenue. And we continue to expand our business with new and existing clients while adding innovative offerings.
In Global Lifestyle, we reinforced our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect nearly 32 million devices worldwide. In 2016, we processed 8.8 million devices at our repair and logistics operations in the U.S., helping to drive nearly 20% growth in fee income for Global Lifestyle. Recently, we also made a small investment in a mobile device and asset disposition in South Korea, strengthening our footprint in Asia, an important priority for Assurant.
In addition to this acquisition, we also grew organically through expanded relationships and new offerings across mobile carriers, e-commerce and OEM distribution channels. At the same time, we are continuing to manage the impact of declines in the clients in legacy businesses. Our focus remains on ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. These factors, in addition to increasing scale, are important to margin expansion over time.
In Global Preneed, we now provide prefunded funeral insurance to 1.9 million policyholders across North America. Our breadth and depth of experience in this area, along with our long-term partnerships, gives us the scale and data that enables us to help our clients grow their business. Our integrated approach also allows us to be a single point of contact for the agent and the funeral home, offering a seamless experience for the end consumer.
As we continue to make progress in our multiyear transformation, performance is measured against 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses, given the inherent volatility of the weather.
For full year 2016, net operating income decreased by 9% to $379 million, primarily due to the expected decline of lender-placed. Despite lower income, operating earnings per diluted share increased modestly to $6.12, up from $6.06 in 2015, driven by our disciplined capital deployment.
Full year operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.5%. Fee-based, capital-light offerings now represent 52% of revenue. Continuing to grow these businesses will be an important driver in achieving our goal of 15% ROE by 2020.
At the end of December, holding company capital totaled $775 million. This is after returning $995 million to shareholders in 2016. We have now delivered 2/3 of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017.
We also deployed approximately $210 million in strategic investments last year to strengthen our offerings, capability and distribution in housing and lifestyle. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect Assurant's net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, to be roughly level with 2016 earnings, also excluding cat losses.
Growth in Connected Living, multi-family housing, mortgage solutions and our vehicle protection business will offsite -- offset declines in lender-placed and other legacy businesses. We're already realizing savings from our enterprise transformation projects, while in the short term, we are investing in procurement, IT and other initiatives that will drive profitable growth over time.
We also expect to grow operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, by double digits this year, primarily due to the share repurchase activity already executed throughout 2016.
Over the long term, we are committed to growing net operating income and generating 15% average annual growth in operating earnings per share. We are confident the progress made in 2016 will enable us to produce meaningful operating earnings growth longer term as we progress further toward our 2020 objectives.
We believe our attractive business portfolio and a more efficient operating structure will produce more diversified earnings while continuing to generate strong cash flow to support our disciplined capital management strategy.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook for 2017 in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,415710408,1128874,"Assurant, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2017",2017-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically mentioned, all of my comments are related to fourth quarter 2016 as compared to the prior period last year.Overall, as Alan said, Assurant's",1450,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically mentioned, all of my comments are related to fourth quarter 2016 as compared to the prior period last year.
Overall, as Alan said, Assurant's results came in as we expected. We'll start with Global Housing, which produced earnings of $10.8 million, including $44 million of reportable catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Matthew. Excluding cat losses, net operating income was down $13 million. This was due to continued lender-placed normalization and additional regulatory expenses. 
The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 15% to 105%, driven by higher cats. Excluding cat losses, the combined ratio was 88.8%, up 2 percentage points. This was the result of higher regulatory and new client onboarding expenses. More favorable non-cat losses related to lower frequency and severity of claims were a modest offset.
Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 11.2%, down 50 basis points. Expanded profitability in multi-family housing was more than offset by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses.
Turning to revenue. Fourth quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 5%, primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates. Our placement rate of 2.13% in the third quarter decreased to 2% at year-end. As we mentioned on our last call, we started to onboard 2.7 million loans in the third quarter and lower than average placement rates. These new loans drove about 9 of the 13 basis point decline. The remaining 4 basis point reduction relates to the ongoing lender-placed normalization.
Now let's move to revenue for our fee-based Global Housing businesses. Multi-family housing increased 11%. This reflects double-digit growth in renters' policies sold through our affinity channels and property management network. For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 5%, including the acquisition of American Title. If we exclude the acquisition, mortgage solutions was down 10%, primarily related to lower volumes in field services.
As we continue to work toward our 2020 goal of 15% to 20% pretax margins in the housing fee-based business, we will continue to invest in technology that supports business expansion, while we also look to create efficiencies.
As Alan mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Green Tree Insurance Agency last week. Through this deal, Assurant will retain its existing book of voluntary insurance for borrowers serviced by Ditech Financial Services. And we'll have the opportunity to write additional housing business, all at attractive double-digit margins. Taking into account the amortization of intangibles, we expect this transaction to have minimal impact on Global Housing's earnings in 2017 and to be accretive over time.
For 2017, we anticipate a continued decline in Global Housing premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, as we move closer to a normalized steady-state in lender-placed. Revenue growth in our fee-based businesses is expected to continue. And overall, we believe these offerings will account for a larger portion of the segment's earnings as we capture market share.
Additional expense savings from initiatives implemented across our Global Housing are also expected. Longer term, we continue to expect Global Housing to produce a 20%-plus operating ROE as we maintain our leadership position in lender-placed and grow our fee-based product and services.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment's earnings increased by $15 million to $35 million. This was largely due to improved performance in mobile and service contracts, along with higher investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Year-over-year, mobile improvement was driven by lower expenses, along with a more profitable mix of devices.
Revenue in Global Lifestyle decreased by 4%, mainly driven by premium declines from a change in program structure for a large service contract client. In addition, revenue was lowered by the impact of foreign exchange and also continued reductions in legacy retailers and credit insurance. This was partially offset by growth in our vehicle protection business as well as fee income from expanded mobile service offerings.
In the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, there was a change in the program structure for a large service contract client. While this change has no bottom line impact, it did reduce revenues by $47 million. We expect it also to reduce 2017 premium and expenses by $500 million. The revised contract does allow us to deepen our relationship with the long-term client. This change will also affect our global Connected Living pretax margin, which we now expect to increase from 8% to 9.5% by 2020.
The combined ratio for the risk-based business, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, increased by approximately 100 basis points to 95.6%. A modest increase in vehicle protection losses was partially offset by better credit loss experience. Overall, the quarterly and full year combined ratios are within the 96% to 98% range, which we would be expected to maintain through 2020.
The pretax margin for the fee-based business or global Connected Living was up from negative 1% to a positive 3.7% this quarter. The key drivers were improved performance from both mobile as well as service contracts.
In 2017, we expect net operating income in Global Lifestyle to increase. This will come from Connected Living, driven primarily by mobile, along with higher profitability from the vehicle protection business and expense savings. At the same time, we will continue to manage declines from U.S. credit insurance and lower production from North American retail clients.
Net earned premiums and fees for the segment overall will be down for the year due to the client contract change. However, excluding this change, revenue is expected to increase from growth in mobile and vehicle protection. Our results are also subject to the impact of foreign exchange and variability in the mobile market. While fluctuations from year to year are likely, we continue to expect 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term. 
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased modestly to $10.9 million, mainly the result of $1.4 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Underlying performance of the business was otherwise stable.
Total revenue for the quarter was up 7%. This was due in part to sales written in previous years that are now beginning to earn. In 2017, we expect fee income and earnings to grow in Preneed from increased production across North America and operational efficiencies.
Before turning to Corporate, I did want to point out one additional change. A part of our new segment reporting, the goodwill in former Solutions segment was distributed between Lifestyle and Preneed. Approximately $140 million of Solutions' goodwill has been allocated to Preneed as of December 31. Therefore, our previously announced ROE target of 12% is now 11%.
Moving to Corporate. The fourth quarter loss decreased $10 million to $20 million. The change was due to lower taxes and increased investment income from higher assets at the holding company. This was partially offset by an increase in expenses to support our multiyear transformation. For the full year 2017, we expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million as expense savings are offset by investments to support our multiyear transformation.
Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with $525 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $341 million in total dividends comprised of $245 million from capital previously supporting the Employee Benefits business and Health runoff operations and $96 million from Global Housing, Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed.
For 2017, we expect the segment dividends will approximate segment earnings, subject to the growth of the business and rating agency requirements. In addition, we anticipate receiving about $100 million in dividends from Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits, pending regulatory approval.
Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to: first, return $212 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends; second, to complete a tender offer for a portion of our senior notes maturing in 2034, reducing deployable capital by $125 million; and finally, to set aside $130 million in advance of the February close of the Green Tree Insurance Agency acquisition as well as for the investment in mobile device capabilities. Through February 3, we bought back an additional 378,000 shares for a total of $36 million.
So to summarize, there are a few things we want to take away from today's call. 2016 was another critical year in our multiyear transformation. We're making great progress implementing a stronger and more efficient operating model. And we are expanding profitably within our targeted growth areas.
All of these elements, in aggregate, will help position the company for long-term profitable growth.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

If you go back to when we made our first acquisitions in this area now about 2.5 years ago, we knew that broadly, the market would decline as foreclosure volumes normalized, but we had an explicit strategy to gain share by partnering with the leading companies that are already our partner around lender-placed homeowners. That has worked very well. Part of the issue in Q4, you have some normal seasonality in the field side of the business, where volumes are higher in Q2 and Q3 and lower in Q4 and Q1. But we feel very good about the progress. We have a new leader that just joined, probably to really integrate all of the 4 businesses together and give us a platform to drive even further growth in that business."

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2017 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As a reminder, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our reportable segments to align with the company's new global operating model. As a result, our reportable segments now comprise Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate.
Net operating income includes contributions from these 4 reportable segments as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude health runoff operation, the divested employee benefits and amortization of deferred gains from this division and other items that did not represent the ongoing operations of the company.
Related prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform with the new presentation. On today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin the call this morning with prepared remarks, before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our Form 10-K.

Global Lifestyle reported strong earnings, better than we had expected. While segment results were helped by some onetime items in the quarter, we were pleased with our underlying performance. Overall, for Assurant this year, we continue to believe that our total operating earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, will be generally level with 2016 and that operating earnings per share will increase double digits.
As we move through 2017, we expect to see continued growth across our targeted areas as well as in vehicle protection. Our success has been largely driven by our ability to adapt to evolving client and consumer expectations. Extending our competitive advantage will require ongoing investments in our technology infrastructure and other capabilities.
Across Assurant, expense management efforts are ongoing and remained central to our culture of continuous improvement. We've identified savings to fund our technology enhancements and moderate the impact from expected declines in lender-placed and legacy businesses. Overall, the results may vary by quarter. We are confident the growth in our targeted areas, together with expense efficiencies, will enable us to deliver our commitments for 2017. And importantly, we believe our transformation is solidifying a foundation for profitable growth and ongoing cash flow in 2018 and beyond.
Let me now offer a few updates from the first quarter. In Global Housing, we completed the first client beta implementation of our new lender-placed platform. This represents a milestone for the business. Work began several years ago in partnership with our clients, when we saw the opportunity to create greater standardization, while providing an even better customer experience.
During the course of this year and next, we'll be transferring other clients onto this new platform, enabling us to deliver efficiencies long-term, as we work to mitigate the impact of lender-placed normalization.
Mortgage solutions posted weaker results for the quarter, driven by softer-than-expected demand. We took action in the quarter to reduce variable expenses and are implementing a number of technology enhancements to strengthen the business and support growth long-term.
In multi-family housing, year-over-year, we increased our policies enforced by more than 200,000 to nearly 1.6 million. Turning to Global Lifestyle. First quarter results came in better than anticipated. Overall, we were pleased with the segment's underlying performance, which benefited from higher contributions from service contracts in vehicle protection and Connected Living.
Despite less favorable experience in Europe, our mobile business performed largely as expected. The sustained momentum will continue to focus our efforts on innovation to anticipate both client and consumer needs.
As an example, we worked with T-Mobile to launch a new premium device protection plan that now includes AppleCare services. We believe this unique offering makes for a better consumer experience by providing 24/7 priority access to AppleCare services technical support as well as device repair or replacement through Apple.
We're proud of our ability to act as a catalyst, bringing together leading companies in the mobile arena to deliver new and compelling offerings. And as our mobile business continues to ramp up, the wind down of Assurant Health is now essentially complete. In the first quarter, the runoff of claims was faster than expected, and we collected all outstanding net recoverables related to the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs.
I want to thank the employees and leadership at Health for their tremendous efforts over the last couple of years to ensure a successful wind down.
Let me now provide an update on our progress as measured by our 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses, given the inherent volatility of weather.
For the first quarter, net operating income decreased $3 million year-over-year to $106 million, reflecting declines in lender-placed, partially offset by better profitability in extended service contracts and certain onetime items in Global Lifestyle. Operating earnings per diluted share increased 13% to $1.88 for the quarter, driven by share repurchase activity. And finally, annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.8%, up from 10.5% at year end. Continuing to grow fee-based capital light offerings will be an important driver of ROE expansion by 2020.
Our balance sheet also remained strong. At the end of March, we had $605 million of holding company capital, after returning $135 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Our capital position allows us to continue investing in our businesses, organically and through select acquisitions, while also committing our commitment to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of this year.
Overall, we're encouraged by the progress we are making in our transformation, as we build an even stronger Assurant for the future.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review segment results for the quarter in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,426581038,1186804,"Assurant, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing, which produced earnings of $62 million, down $14 million from the same period last year. The change was primarily driven by declines in lender-placed as well as softer results w",1216,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing, which produced earnings of $62 million, down $14 million from the same period last year. The change was primarily driven by declines in lender-placed as well as softer results within mortgage solutions.
The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 220 basis points to 82.9%. Lower placements rates in the lender-placed business as well as higher expenses to onboard new client loans drove the increase.
The first quarter of 2017 benefited for more favorable loss experience, reportable catastrophe losses totaled $900,000 pretax, net of $5.2 million of favorable reserve development related to Hurricane Matthew. The pretax margin for our fee-based capital-light businesses decreased 220 basis points to 8.8%, a weaker performance in mortgage solutions comment from softer market conditions, originations and field services, coupled with lower client volumes, contributed to the decline.
As Alan discussed earlier, we are rightsizing expenses in mortgage solutions, while at the same time implementing technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies long-term. Meanwhile, our multi-family housing business continued to grow profitably, largely through expansion within our affinity channels as well as more favorable loss experience.
Turning to revenue. First quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%, primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates in our lender-placed insurance business. Our placement rate was 1.96% at the end of the first quarter, down from 2% at year-end. This 4-basis-point reduction is consistent with trends seen in prior years.
Now, let's move to revenue for our fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multi-family housing increased 11% during the quarter. This reflects double-digit growth in renter's policies sold to our affinity channels and property management network.
In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 20%, primarily related to decline in volumes in originations and field services discussed earlier. For 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing, net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. The key variables will be the pace of lender-placed normalization and our progress in driving operating efficiencies near-term. We expect continued profitable growth in our fee-based, capital-light businesses overall, with a focus on improving underlying earnings in mortgage solutions.
Now, let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment's earnings increased by $11 million to $52 million, ahead of our expectations for the quarter. This was largely attributable to $7.5 million after-tax of onetime client recoverables within Connected Living and credit and is representative of our ongoing efforts to improve client mix and profitability internationally. Underlying results were solid across most lines of business. We recorded higher profitability in extended service contracts, resulting from favorable experience, expense savings and a broader shift to OEMs and online channels. The vehicle protection also grew due to prior period sales.
Overall earnings growth within Global Lifestyle was partially offset by higher multiple claim costs in Europe, which now have largely been remunerated. Revenue for the segment decreased by 14%, entirely due to a $137 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the change in the client program structure implemented late last year. As a reminder, this change also extended our relationship with an important Connected Living client and had no impact on earnings.
Excluding this change, and the client recoverables, revenues for Global Lifestyle were essentially flat as ongoing declines in legacy businesses were offset by higher volumes of vehicle service contracts and growth in our Canadian credit business.
Within mobile, growth in covered devices was offset by lower fee income from mobile repair and logistics services. First quarter of 2016 benefited from stronger [indiscernible] logistics volumes, driven by the timing of new product launches into the market.
Turning to key performance metrics. The combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, improved by approximately 240 basis points to 92.2%, driven largely by client recoverables. In addition, we saw favorable loss experience in credit. Going forward, we expect the combined ratio to trend within the long-term range of 96% to 98%. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based business, or Connected Living, rose to 7.1% from 4.5% last year, approximately 230 basis points of the increase was driven by client recoverables and change in the client program structure referenced earlier. The balance reflected better underlying results and extended contracts, partially offset by mobile.
For the full year 2017, we have not changed our expectations for Global Lifestyle overall. We expect segment net operating income to increase from Connected Living, driven primarily by mobile as we implement new offerings and expand share with existing clients. Higher profitability from the vehicle protection business is also expected to be a driver, along with expense management efforts already underway across Global Lifestyle. All of this is expected to help mitigate declines in legacy businesses.
While earnings may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, depending on volumes, loss experience and other factors, we are confident that the segment will continue to deliver long-term earnings growth of 10% or more on an average annual basis.
Now, let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased $4 million to $10 million. But as a reminder, first quarter 2016 results were negatively impacted by $3.9 million coming from an adjustment to reserves and deferred acquisition costs related to an older block of policies. Excluding this adjustment, underlying earnings increased slightly, with additional investment income offsetting higher mortality rates.
Total revenue for the quarter was up about 3%, while new sales increased by 2% year-over-year. In 2017, we continue to expect fee income and earnings to grow in pre-need, driven by increased production across North America and operational efficiencies.
Moving to Corporate. The first quarter net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $10 million. This was due in part to reductions in estimated employee-related costs and additional investment income generated from assets transferred to Corporate after the sale of employee benefits.
While still early, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million as we redeploy most savings this year to support our multiyear transformation. These investments include the implementation of a centralized procurement function, along with investments in technology and other key capabilities. Throughout the year, we will update you on our progress as we are committed to reducing Corporate expenses over time.
Moving on to capital. We ended the quarter with approximately $355 million in deployable capital. We upstreamed $43 million of capital to the holding company during the quarter. This included $28 million in dividends from our operating segments and $15 million in capital from Health.
For the full year, we continued to expect operating segment dividends to approximate segment earnings. And in addition, to receive approximately $100 million in total from health and employee benefits as we release residual capital.
During the first quarter, we returned $135 million to shareholders, with $105 million returned via share buybacks, and the remaining $30 million through common stock dividends. Also, throughout April, we repurchased another $38 million of stock, bringing the total amount returned to shareholders since January 2016 to nearly $1.2 billion.
To summarize, we've continued to make good progress in the first quarter and have delivered solid results. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

I mean, first of all, in mobile, I think we felt good about the first quarter, it was in line with what we had expected. As we look to the second quarter and beyond, really 3 things are going on that will continue to drive performance in that business. One is we are expanding with our existing clients. In my prepared remarks, I've mentioned the roll out with T-Mobile of AppleCare. We're also in the process of launching premium technical support, which is another fee income service, with some of our clients. Also, later in the year, we expect significant increase in trading activity, both with carrier promotions, but unfortunately, the new products that are expected -- are is expected later in the year. And then finally, we continue to onboard new clients, some of which will impact '17, the majority of which are going to impact '18. We actually have a backlog as we implement. And then, finally, the mix is shifting. If you think back a few years, traditionally that business was a premium business, enhance our protection, now it's heavily also a fee income business. And that just shows up differently in the geography of the P&L, but we feel great about the progress of mobile."

Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2017 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As a reminder, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our reportable segments to align with the company's new global operating model. As a result, our reportable segments now comprise Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate. Net operating income includes contributions from these 4 reportable segments as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Health runoff operations, the divested employee benefits and amortization of deferred gains from this division and other items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company. Related prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform with the new presentation. 
On today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin the call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements.

Global Lifestyle reported strong earnings, better than we had expected. While segment results were helped by some onetime items in the quarter, we were pleased with our underlying performance. Overall, for Assurant this year, we continue to believe that our total operating earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, will be generally level with 2016 and that operating earnings per share will increase double digits. As we move through 2017, we expect to see continued growth across our targeted areas as well as in vehicle protection. 
Our success has been largely driven by our ability to adapt to evolving client and consumer expectations. Extending our competitive advantage will require ongoing investments in our technology infrastructure and other capabilities. Across Assurant, expense management efforts are ongoing and remain central to our culture of continuous improvement. We've identified savings to fund our technology enhancements and moderate the impact from expected declines in lender-placed and legacy businesses. 
Overall, though results may vary by quarter, we're confident that growth in our targeted areas, together with expense efficiencies, will enable us to deliver our commitments for 2017. And importantly, we believe our transformation is solidifying a foundation for profitable growth and ongoing cash flow in 2018 and beyond.
Let me now offer a few updates from the first quarter. In Global Housing, we completed the first client beta implementation of our new lender-placed platform. This represents a milestone for the business. Work began several years ago in partnership with our clients when we saw the opportunity to create greater standardization while providing an even better customer experience. During the course of this year and next, we'll be transferring other clients onto this new platform, enabling us to deliver efficiencies long term as we work to mitigate the impact of lender-placed normalization.
Mortgage solutions posted weaker results for the quarter, driven by softer-than-expected demand. We took action in the quarter to reduce variable expenses and are implementing a number of technology enhancements to strengthen the business and support growth long term. In multifamily housing, year-over-year, we increased our policies enforced by more than 200,000 to nearly 1.6 million. 
Turning to Global Lifestyle. First quarter results came in better than anticipated. Overall, we were pleased with the segment's underlying performance, which benefited from higher contributions from service contracts in vehicle protection and Connected Living. 
Despite less favorable experience in Europe, our mobile business performed largely as expected. The sustained momentum will continue to focus our efforts on innovation to anticipate both client and consumer needs. As an example, we worked with T-Mobile to launch a new premium device protection plan that now includes AppleCare services. We believe this unique offering makes for a better consumer experience by providing 24/7 priority access to AppleCare services technical support as well as device repair or replacement through Apple. We're proud of our ability to act as a catalyst, bringing together leading companies in the mobile arena to deliver new and compelling offerings. 
And as our mobile business continues to ramp up, the wind-down of Assurant Health is now essentially complete. In the first quarter, the runoff of claims was faster than expected, and we collected all outstanding net recoverables related to the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs. I want to thank the employees and leadership at Health for their tremendous efforts over the last couple of years to ensure a successful wind-down.
Let me now provide an update on our progress as measured by our 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses, given the inherent volatility of weather. For the first quarter, net operating income decreased $3 million year-over-year to $106 million, reflecting declines in lender-placed, partially offset by better profitability in extended service contracts and certain onetime items in Global Lifestyle. Operating earnings per diluted share increased 13% to $1.88 for the quarter, driven by share repurchase activity. And finally, annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.8%, up from 10.5% at year-end. Continuing to grow fee-based capital-light offerings will be an important driver of ROE expansion by 2020.
Our balance sheet also remained strong. At the end of March, we had $605 million of holding company capital after returning $135 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Our capital position allows us to continue investing in our businesses, organically and through select acquisitions, while also meeting our commitment to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of this year. Overall, we're encouraged by the progress we are making in our transformation as we build an even stronger Assurant for the future.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review segment results for the quarter in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,426581038,1186860,"Assurant, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing, which produced earnings of $62 million, down $14 million from the same period last year. The change was primarily driven by declines in lender-placed as well as softer results w",1221,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing, which produced earnings of $62 million, down $14 million from the same period last year. The change was primarily driven by declines in lender-placed as well as softer results within mortgage solutions. 
The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 220 basis points to 82.9%. Lower placements rates in the lender-placed business as well as higher expenses to onboard new client loans drove the increase. 
The first quarter of 2017 benefited for more favorable loss experience. Reportable catastrophe losses totaled $900,000 pretax, net of $5.2 million of favorable reserve development related to Hurricane Matthew. The pretax margin for our fee-based capital-light businesses decreased 220 basis points to 8.8%. A weaker performance in mortgage solutions coming from softer market conditions, originations and field services, coupled with lower client volumes, contributed to the decline. 
As Alan discussed earlier, we are rightsizing expenses in mortgage solutions while, at the same time, implementing technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies long term. Meanwhile, our multifamily housing business continued to grow profitably, largely through expansion within our affinity channels as well as more favorable loss experience.
Turning to revenue. First quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%, primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates in our lender-placed insurance business. Our placement rate was 1.96% at the end of the first quarter, down from 2% at year-end. This 4 basis point reduction is consistent with trends seen in prior years.
Now let's move to revenue for our fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multifamily housing increased 11% during the quarter. This reflects double-digit growth in renter's policies sold to our affinity channels and property management network. In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 20%, primarily related to declining volumes in originations and field services discussed earlier. 
For 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing, net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. The key variables will be the pace of lender-placed normalization and our progress in driving operating efficiencies near term. We expect continued profitable growth in our fee-based, capital-light businesses overall with a focus on improving underlying earnings in mortgage solutions.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment's earnings increased by $11 million to $52 million, ahead of our expectations for the quarter. This was largely attributable to $7.5 million after tax of onetime client recoverables within Connected Living and credit and is representative of our ongoing efforts to improve client mix and profitability internationally. 
Underlying results were solid across most lines of business. We recorded higher profitability in extended service contracts, resulting from favorable experience, expense savings and a broader shift to OEMs and online channels. Vehicle protection also grew due to prior period sales. Overall earnings growth within Global Lifestyle was partially offset by higher multiple claim costs in Europe, which now have largely been remunerated. 
Revenue for the segment decreased by 14%, entirely due to a $137 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the change in a client program structure implemented late last year. As a reminder, this change also extended our relationship with an important Connected Living client and had no impact on earnings. Excluding this change, and the client recoverables, revenues for Global Lifestyle were essentially flat as ongoing declines in legacy businesses were offset by higher volumes of vehicle service contracts and growth in our Canadian credit business. Within mobile, growth in covered devices was offset by lower fee income from mobile repair and logistics services. First quarter of 2016 benefited from strong repair and logistics volumes, driven by the timing of new product launches into the market.
Turning to key performance metrics. The combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, improved by approximately 240 basis points to 92.2%, driven largely by client recoverables. In addition, we saw favorable loss experience in credit. Going forward, we expect the combined ratio to trend within the long-term range of 96% to 98%. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based business, or Connected Living, rose to 7.1% from 4.5% last year, approximately 230 basis points of the increase was driven by client recoverables and change in the client program structure referenced earlier. The balance reflected better underlying results in extended service contracts, partially offset by mobile.
For the full year 2017, we have not changed our expectations for Global Lifestyle overall. We expect segment net operating income to increase from Connected Living, driven primarily by mobile, as we implement new offerings and expand share with existing clients. Higher profitability from the vehicle protection business is also expected to be a driver, along with expense management efforts already underway across Global Lifestyle. All of this is expected to help mitigate declines in legacy businesses. While earnings may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, depending on volumes, loss experience and other factors, we are confident that the segment will continue to deliver long-term earnings growth of 10% or more on an average annual basis.
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased $4 million to $10 million. But as a reminder, first quarter 2016 results were negatively impacted by $3.9 million coming from an adjustment to reserves and deferred acquisition costs related to an older block of policies. Excluding this adjustment, underlying earnings increased slightly with additional investment income offsetting higher mortality rates. Total revenue for the quarter was up about 3% while new sales increased by 2% year-over-year. In 2017, we continue to expect fee income and earnings to grow in preneed, driven by increased production across North America and operational efficiencies.
Moving to Corporate. The first quarter net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $10 million. This was due in part to reductions in estimated employee-related costs and additional investment income generated from assets transferred to Corporate after the sale of employee benefits. While still early, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million as we redeploy most savings this year to support our multiyear transformation. These investments include the implementation of a centralized procurement function, along with investments in technology and other key capabilities. Throughout the year, we will update you on our progress as we are committed to reducing Corporate expenses over time.
Moving on to capital. We ended the quarter with approximately $355 million in deployable capital. We upstreamed $43 million of capital to the holding company during the quarter. This included $28 million in dividends from our operating segments and $15 million in capital from Health. For the full year, we continue to expect operating segment dividends to approximate segment earnings and, in addition, to receive approximately $100 million in total from Health and employee benefits as we release residual capital.
During the first quarter, we returned $135 million to shareholders with $105 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $30 million through common stock dividends. Also, throughout April, we repurchased another $38 million of stock, bringing the total amount returned to shareholders since January 2016 to nearly $1.2 billion.
To summarize, we've continued to make good progress in the first quarter and have delivered solid results. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.

I mean, first of all, in mobile, I think we felt good about the first quarter. It was in line with what we had expected. As we look to the second quarter and beyond, really 3 things are going on that will continue to drive performance in that business. One is we are expanding with our existing clients. In my prepared remarks, I've mentioned the rollout with T-Mobile of AppleCare. We're also in the process of launching premium technical support, which is another fee income service, with some of our clients. Also, later in the year, we expect significant increase in trading activity, both with carrier promotions, but unfortunately, the new products that are expected -- or is expected in later of the year. And then finally, we continue to onboard new clients. Some of which will impact '17. The majority of which are going to impact '18. We actually have a backlog as we implement. And then finally, the mix is shifting. If you think back a few years, traditionally, that business was a premium business, hence, our protection. Now it's heavily also a fee income business, and that just shows up differently in the geography of the P&L. But we feel good about the progress of mobile."

Really, a couple things happened late last year, early into this year, none of which changed our long-term perspective on the business. One is market demand has gotten softer than anybody had forecasted, really driven by the uncertainty in the economy and uncertainty on interest rate direction. And then as we have been implementing our technology upgrades to really bring these businesses together, we've had some short-term kind of client allocation shifts, but they don't fundamentally change how we think about this.

We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2017 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2017 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As a reminder, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our reportable segments to align with the company's new global operating model. As a result, our reportable segments now comprise Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate. Net operating income includes contributions from these 4 reportable segments as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Health runoff operations, the divested employee benefits and amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company. Related prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform with the new presentation. 
On today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin the call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our Form 10-K.

Global Lifestyle reported strong earnings, better than we had expected. While segment results were helped by some one-time items in the quarter, we were pleased with our underlying performance. Overall, for Assurant this year, we continue to believe that our total operating earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, will be generally level with 2016 and that operating earnings per share will increase double digits. As we move through 2017, we expect to see continued growth across our targeted areas as well as in vehicle protection. 
Our success has been largely driven by our ability to adapt to evolving client and consumer expectations. Extending our competitive advantage will require ongoing investments in our technology infrastructure and other capabilities. Across Assurant, expense management efforts are ongoing and remain central to our culture of continuous improvement. We've identified savings to fund our technology enhancements and moderate the impact from expected declines in lender-placed and legacy businesses. 
Overall, though results may vary by quarter, we're confident that growth in our targeted areas, together with expense efficiencies, will enable us to deliver on our commitments for 2017. And importantly, we believe our transformation is solidifying a foundation for profitable growth and ongoing cash flow in 2018 and beyond.
Let me now offer a few updates from the first quarter. In Global Housing, we completed the first client beta implementation of our new lender-placed platform. This represents a milestone for the business. Work began several years ago in partnership with our clients when we saw the opportunity to create greater standardization while providing an even better customer experience. During the course of this year and next, we'll be transferring other clients onto this new platform, enabling us to deliver efficiencies long term as we work to mitigate the impact of lender-placed normalization.
Mortgage solutions posted weaker results for the quarter, driven by softer-than-expected demand. We took action in the quarter to reduce variable expenses and are implementing a number of technology enhancements to strengthen the business and support growth long term. In multifamily housing, year-over-year, we increased our policies enforced by more than 200,000 to nearly 1.6 million. 
Turning to Global Lifestyle. First quarter results came in better than anticipated. Overall, we were pleased with the segment's underlying performance, which benefited from higher contributions from service contracts in vehicle protection and Connected Living. 
Despite less favorable experience in Europe, our mobile business performed largely as expected. The sustained momentum will continue to focus our efforts on innovation to anticipate both client and consumer needs. As an example, we worked with T-Mobile to launch a new premium device protection plan that now includes AppleCare services. We believe this unique offering makes for a better consumer experience by providing 24/7 priority access to AppleCare services technical support as well as device repair or replacement through Apple. We're proud of our ability to act as a catalyst, bringing together leading companies in the mobile arena to deliver new and compelling offerings. 
And as our mobile business continues to ramp up, the wind-down of Assurant Health is now essentially complete. In the first quarter, the runoff of claims was faster than expected, and we collected all outstanding net recoverables related to the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs. I want to thank the employees and leadership at Health for their tremendous efforts over the last couple of years to ensure a successful wind-down.
Let me now provide an update on our progress as measured by our 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses, given the inherent volatility of weather. For the first quarter, net operating income decreased $3 million year-over-year to $106 million, reflecting declines in lender-placed, partially offset by better profitability in extended service contracts and certain one-time items in Global Lifestyle. Operating earnings per diluted share increased 13% to $1.88 for the quarter, driven by share repurchase activity. And finally, annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.8%, up from 10.5% at year-end. Continuing to grow fee-based capital-light offerings will be an important driver of ROE expansion by 2020.
Our balance sheet also remained strong. At the end of March, we had $605 million of holding company capital after returning $135 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Our capital position allows us to continue investing in our businesses, organically and through select acquisitions, while also meeting our commitment to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of this year. Overall, we're encouraged by the progress we are making in our transformation as we build an even stronger Assurant for the future.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review segment results for the quarter in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,426581038,1187074,"Assurant, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing, which produced earnings of $62 million, down $14 million from the same period last year. The change was primarily driven by declines in lender-placed as well as softer results w",1221,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing, which produced earnings of $62 million, down $14 million from the same period last year. The change was primarily driven by declines in lender-placed as well as softer results within mortgage solutions. 
The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 220 basis points to 82.9%. Lower placement rates in the lender-placed business, as well as higher expenses to onboard new client loans, drove the increase. 
The first quarter of 2017 benefited from more favorable loss experience. Reportable catastrophe losses totaled $900,000 pretax, net of $5.2 million of favorable reserve development related to Hurricane Matthew. The pretax margin for our fee-based capital-light businesses decreased 220 basis points to 8.8%. A weaker performance in mortgage solutions coming from softer market conditions, originations and field services, coupled with lower client volumes, contributed to the decline. 
As Alan discussed earlier, we are rightsizing expenses in mortgage solutions while, at the same time, implementing technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies long term. Meanwhile, our multifamily housing business continued to grow profitably, largely through expansion within our affinity channels as well as more favorable loss experience.
Turning to revenue. First quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%, primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates in our lender-placed insurance business. Our placement rate was 1.96% at the end of the first quarter, down from 2% at year-end. This 4 basis point reduction is consistent with trends seen in prior years.
Now let's move to revenue for our fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multifamily housing increased 11% during the quarter. This reflects double-digit growth in renter's policies sold to our affinity channels and property management network. In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 20%, primarily related to declining volumes in originations and field services discussed earlier. 
For 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing, net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. The key variables will be the pace of lender-placed normalization and our progress in driving operating efficiencies near term. We expect continued profitable growth in our fee-based, capital-light businesses overall with a focus on improving underlying earnings in mortgage solutions.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment's earnings increased by $11 million to $52 million, ahead of our expectations for the quarter. This was largely attributable to $7.5 million after tax of one-time client recoverables within Connected Living and credit and is representative of our ongoing efforts to improve client mix and profitability internationally. 
Underlying results were solid across most lines of business. We recorded higher profitability in extended service contracts, resulting from favorable experience, expense savings and a broader shift to OEMs and online channels. Vehicle protection also grew due to prior period sales. Overall earnings growth within Global Lifestyle was partially offset by higher multiple claim costs in Europe, which now have largely been remunerated. 
Revenue for the segment decreased by 14%, entirely due to a $137 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the change in a client program structure implemented late last year. As a reminder, this change also extended our relationship with an important Connected Living client and had no impact on earnings. Excluding this change and the client recoverables, revenues for Global Lifestyle were essentially flat as ongoing declines in legacy businesses were offset by higher volumes of vehicle service contracts and growth in our Canadian credit business. Within mobile, growth in covered devices was offset by lower fee income from mobile repair and logistics services. First quarter of 2016 benefited from strong repair and logistics volumes, driven by the timing of new product launches into the market.
Turning to key performance metrics. The combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, improved by approximately 240 basis points to 92.2%, driven largely by client recoverables. In addition, we saw favorable loss experience in credit. Going forward, we expect the combined ratio to trend within the long-term range of 96% to 98%. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based business, or Connected Living, rose to 7.1% from 4.5% last year, approximately 230 basis points of the increase was driven by client recoverables and change in the client program structure referenced earlier. The balance reflected better underlying results in extended service contracts, partially offset by mobile.
For the full year 2017, we have not changed our expectations for Global Lifestyle overall. We expect segment net operating income to increase from Connected Living, driven primarily by mobile, as we implement new offerings and expand share with existing clients. Higher profitability from the vehicle protection business is also expected to be a driver, along with expense management efforts already underway across Global Lifestyle. All of this is expected to help mitigate declines in legacy businesses. While earnings may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, depending on volumes, loss experience and other factors, we are confident that the segment will continue to deliver long-term earnings growth of 10% or more on an average annual basis.
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased $4 million to $10 million. But as a reminder, first quarter 2016 results were negatively impacted by $3.9 million coming from an adjustment to reserves and deferred acquisition costs related to an older block of policies. Excluding this adjustment, underlying earnings increased slightly with additional investment income offsetting higher mortality rates. Total revenue for the quarter was up about 3% while new sales increased by 2% year-over-year. In 2017, we continue to expect fee income and earnings to grow in preneed, driven by increased production across North America and operational efficiencies.
Moving to Corporate. The first quarter net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $10 million. This was due in part to reductions in estimated employee-related costs and additional investment income generated from assets transferred to Corporate after the sale of employee benefits. While still early, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million as we redeploy most savings this year to support our multiyear transformation. These investments include the implementation of a centralized procurement function, along with investments in technology and other key capabilities. Throughout the year, we will update you on our progress as we are committed to reducing Corporate expenses over time.
Moving on to capital. We ended the quarter with approximately $355 million in deployable capital. We upstreamed $43 million of capital to the holding company during the quarter. This included $28 million in dividends from our operating segments and $15 million in capital from Health. For the full year, we continue to expect operating segment dividends to approximate segment earnings and, in addition, to receive approximately $100 million in total from Health and employee benefits as we release residual capital.
During the first quarter, we returned $135 million to shareholders with $105 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $30 million through common stock dividends. Also, throughout April, we repurchased another $38 million of stock, bringing the total amount returned to shareholders since January 2016 to nearly $1.2 billion.
To summarize, we've continued to make good progress in the first quarter and have delivered solid results. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.

I mean, first of all, in mobile, I think we felt good about the first quarter. It was in line with what we had expected. As we look to the second quarter and beyond, really 3 things are going on that will continue to drive performance in that business. One is we are expanding with our existing clients. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned the rollout with T-Mobile of AppleCare. We're also in the process of launching premium technical support, which is another fee income service, with some of our clients. Also, later in the year, we expect significant increase in trading activity, both with carrier promotions, but importantly, the new products that are expected -- or is expected later in the year. And then finally, we continue to onboard new clients. Some of which will impact '17. The majority of which are going to impact '18. We actually have a backlog as we implement.

One is market demand has gotten softer than anybody had forecasted, really driven by the uncertainty in the economy and uncertainty on interest rate direction. And then as we have been implementing our technology upgrades to really bring these businesses together, we've had some short-term kind of client allocation shifts, but they don't fundamentally change how we think about this.

Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2017 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As a reminder, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our reportable segments to align with the company's new global operating model. As a result, our reportable segments now comprise Global Housing, Global Lifestyle, Global Preneed and Corporate. Net operating income includes contributions from these 4 reportable segments as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Health runoff operations, the divested employee benefits and amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other items that do not represent the ongoing operations of the company. Related prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform with the new presentation. 
On today's call, we will also refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance.

Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our Form 10-K.

Global Lifestyle reported strong earnings, better than we had expected. While segment results were helped by some one-time items in the quarter, we were pleased with our underlying performance. Overall, for Assurant this year, we continue to believe that our total operating earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, will be generally level with 2016 and that operating earnings per share will increase double digits. As we move through 2017, we expect to see continued growth across our targeted areas as well as in vehicle protection. 
Our success has been largely driven by our ability to adapt to evolving client and consumer expectations. Extending our competitive advantage will require ongoing investments in our technology infrastructure and other capabilities. Across Assurant, expense management efforts are ongoing and remain central to our culture of continuous improvement. We've identified savings to fund our technology enhancements and moderate the impact from expected declines in lender-placed and legacy businesses. 
Overall, though results may vary by quarter, we're confident that growth in our targeted areas, together with expense efficiencies, will enable us to deliver on our commitments for 2017. And importantly, we believe our transformation is solidifying a foundation for profitable growth and ongoing cash flow in 2018 and beyond.
Let me now offer a few updates from the first quarter. In Global Housing, we completed the first client beta implementation of our new lender-placed platform. This represents a milestone for the business. Work began several years ago in partnership with our clients when we saw the opportunity to create greater standardization while providing an even better customer experience. During the course of this year and next, we'll be transferring other clients onto this new platform, enabling us to deliver efficiencies long term as we work to mitigate the impact of lender-placed normalization.
Mortgage solutions posted weaker results for the quarter, driven by softer-than-expected demand. We took action in the quarter to reduce variable expenses and are implementing a number of technology enhancements to strengthen the business and support growth long term. In multifamily housing, year-over-year, we increased our policies enforced by more than 200,000 to nearly 1.6 million. 
Turning to Global Lifestyle. First quarter results came in better than anticipated. Overall, we were pleased with the segment's underlying performance, which benefited from higher contributions from service contracts in vehicle protection and Connected Living. 
Despite less favorable experience in Europe, our mobile business performed largely as expected. The sustained momentum will continue to focus our efforts on innovation to anticipate both client and consumer needs. As an example, we worked with T-Mobile to launch a new premium device protection plan that now includes AppleCare services. We believe this unique offering makes for a better consumer experience by providing 24/7 priority access to AppleCare services technical support as well as device repair or replacement through Apple. We're proud of our ability to act as a catalyst, bringing together leading companies in the mobile arena to deliver new and compelling offerings. 
And as our mobile business continues to ramp up, the wind-down of Assurant Health is now essentially complete. In the first quarter, the runoff of claims was faster than expected, and we collected all outstanding net recoverables related to the 2015 ACA risk mitigation programs. I want to thank the employees and leadership at Health for their tremendous efforts over the last couple of years to ensure a successful wind-down.
Let me now provide an update on our progress as measured by our 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses, given the inherent volatility of weather. For the first quarter, net operating income decreased $3 million year-over-year to $106 million, reflecting declines in lender-placed, partially offset by better profitability in extended service contracts and certain one-time items in Global Lifestyle. Operating earnings per diluted share increased 13% to $1.88 for the quarter, driven by share repurchase activity. And finally, annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.8%, up from 10.5% at year-end. Continuing to grow fee-based capital-light offerings will be an important driver of ROE expansion by 2020.
Our balance sheet also remained strong. At the end of March, we had $605 million of holding company capital after returning $135 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Our capital position allows us to continue investing in our businesses, organically and through select acquisitions, while also meeting our commitment to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of this year. Overall, we're encouraged by the progress we are making in our transformation as we build an even stronger Assurant for the future.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review segment results for the quarter in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,426581038,1191725,"Assurant, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing, which produced earnings of $62 million, down $14 million from the same period last year. The change was primarily driven by declines in lender-placed as well as softer results w",1221,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing, which produced earnings of $62 million, down $14 million from the same period last year. The change was primarily driven by declines in lender-placed as well as softer results within mortgage solutions. 
The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased 220 basis points to 82.9%. Lower placement rates in the lender-placed business, as well as higher expenses to onboard new client loans, drove the increase. 
The first quarter of 2017 benefited from more favorable loss experience. Reportable catastrophe losses totaled $900,000 pretax, net of $5.2 million of favorable reserve development related to Hurricane Matthew. The pretax margin for our fee-based capital-light businesses decreased 220 basis points to 8.8%. A weaker performance in mortgage solutions coming from softer market conditions, originations and field services, coupled with lower client volumes, contributed to the decline. 
As Alan discussed earlier, we are rightsizing expenses in mortgage solutions while, at the same time, implementing technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies long term. Meanwhile, our multifamily housing business continued to grow profitably, largely through expansion within our affinity channels as well as more favorable loss experience.
Turning to revenue. First quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%, primarily due to lower placement and lower premium rates in our lender-placed insurance business. Our placement rate was 1.96% at the end of the first quarter, down from 2% at year-end. This 4 basis point reduction is consistent with trends seen in prior years.
Now let's move to revenue for our fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multifamily housing increased 11% during the quarter. This reflects double-digit growth in renter's policies sold to our affinity channels and property management network. In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 20%, primarily related to declining volumes in originations and field services discussed earlier. 
For 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing, net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. The key variables will be the pace of lender-placed normalization and our progress in driving operating efficiencies near term. We expect continued profitable growth in our fee-based, capital-light businesses overall with a focus on improving underlying earnings in mortgage solutions.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment's earnings increased by $11 million to $52 million, ahead of our expectations for the quarter. This was largely attributable to $7.5 million after tax of one-time client recoverables within Connected Living and credit and is representative of our ongoing efforts to improve client mix and profitability internationally. 
Underlying results were solid across most lines of business. We recorded higher profitability in extended service contracts, resulting from favorable experience, expense savings and a broader shift to OEMs and online channels. Vehicle protection also grew due to prior period sales. Overall earnings growth within Global Lifestyle was partially offset by higher multiple claim costs in Europe, which now have largely been remunerated. 
Revenue for the segment decreased by 14%, entirely due to a $137 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the change in a client program structure implemented late last year. As a reminder, this change also extended our relationship with an important Connected Living client and had no impact on earnings. Excluding this change and the client recoverables, revenues for Global Lifestyle were essentially flat as ongoing declines in legacy businesses were offset by higher volumes of vehicle service contracts and growth in our Canadian credit business. Within mobile, growth in covered devices was offset by lower fee income from mobile repair and logistics services. First quarter of 2016 benefited from strong repair and logistics volumes, driven by the timing of new product launches into the market.
Turning to key performance metrics. The combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, improved by approximately 240 basis points to 92.2%, driven largely by client recoverables. In addition, we saw favorable loss experience in credit. Going forward, we expect the combined ratio to trend within the long-term range of 96% to 98%. 
The pretax margin for the fee-based business, or Connected Living, rose to 7.1% from 4.5% last year, approximately 230 basis points of the increase was driven by client recoverables and change in the client program structure referenced earlier. The balance reflected better underlying results in extended service contracts, partially offset by mobile.
For the full year 2017, we have not changed our expectations for Global Lifestyle overall. We expect segment net operating income to increase from Connected Living, driven primarily by mobile, as we implement new offerings and expand share with existing clients. Higher profitability from the vehicle protection business is also expected to be a driver, along with expense management efforts already underway across Global Lifestyle. All of this is expected to help mitigate declines in legacy businesses. While earnings may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, depending on volumes, loss experience and other factors, we are confident that the segment will continue to deliver long-term earnings growth of 10% or more on an average annual basis.
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased $4 million to $10 million. But as a reminder, first quarter 2016 results were negatively impacted by $3.9 million coming from an adjustment to reserves and deferred acquisition costs related to an older block of policies. Excluding this adjustment, underlying earnings increased slightly with additional investment income offsetting higher mortality rates. Total revenue for the quarter was up about 3% while new sales increased by 2% year-over-year. In 2017, we continue to expect fee income and earnings to grow in preneed, driven by increased production across North America and operational efficiencies.
Moving to Corporate. The first quarter net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $10 million. This was due in part to reductions in estimated employee-related costs and additional investment income generated from assets transferred to Corporate after the sale of employee benefits. While still early, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million as we redeploy most savings this year to support our multiyear transformation. These investments include the implementation of a centralized procurement function, along with investments in technology and other key capabilities. Throughout the year, we will update you on our progress as we are committed to reducing Corporate expenses over time.
Moving on to capital. We ended the quarter with approximately $355 million in deployable capital. We upstreamed $43 million of capital to the holding company during the quarter. This included $28 million in dividends from our operating segments and $15 million in capital from Health. For the full year, we continue to expect operating segment dividends to approximate segment earnings and, in addition, to receive approximately $100 million in total from Health and employee benefits as we release residual capital.
During the first quarter, we returned $135 million to shareholders with $105 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $30 million through common stock dividends. Also, throughout April, we repurchased another $38 million of stock, bringing the total amount returned to shareholders since January 2016 to nearly $1.2 billion.
To summarize, we've continued to make good progress in the first quarter and have delivered solid results. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond. 
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

I mean, first of all, in mobile, I think we felt good about the first quarter. It was in line with what we had expected. As we look to the second quarter and beyond, really 3 things are going on that will continue to drive performance in that business. One is we are expanding with our existing clients. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned the rollout with T-Mobile of AppleCare. We're also in the process of launching premium technical support, which is another fee income service, with some of our clients. Also, later in the year, we expect significant increase in trading activity, both with carrier promotions, but importantly, the new products that are expected -- or is expected later in the year. And then finally, we continue to onboard new clients. Some of which will impact '17. The majority of which are going to impact '18. We actually have a backlog as we implement. And then finally, the mix is shifting. If you think back a few years, traditionally, that business was a premium business, hence, our protection. Now it's heavily also a fee income business, and that just shows up differently in the geography of the P&L. But we feel good about the progress of mobile."

One is market demand has gotten softer than anybody had forecasted, really driven by the uncertainty in the economy and uncertainty on interest rate direction.

Overall, our second quarter results were solid and demonstrated ongoing progress toward achieving our financial commitments for 2017 and beyond. While Global Housing experienced higher noncatastrophe losses, our other business segments performed in line with our expectations. 
For the full year, we remained confident in our ability to maintain net operating earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, at 2016 levels and to generate double-digit earnings per share growth.
This now reflects a revised outlook for our Global Housing and Corporate segments, which Richard will discuss in greater detail. We are also well on our way to completing the $1.5 billion return of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. 
As we progress through this year, we will continue to focus on leveraging our capabilities to expand in key housing lifestyle markets to offset declines in our lender-placed and legacy businesses.
Let me now share a few recent highlights, beginning with Global Lifestyle. Within Connected Living, we continue to strengthen our leadership position across the mobile ecosystem. Earlier this month, we launched a protection plan with Comcast for Xfinity Mobile. Going forward, Xfinity Mobile customers can access a premier suite of protection, support and upgrade services for their mobile devices. It's one of the most comprehensive protection offerings available, including coverage for accidental damage, loss and theft, as well access to our technical support platform and self-diagnostic tools.
In addition, Xfinity iPhone users have full access to AppleCare services. We're also continuing to expand our mobile franchise globally. As an example, we launched a new mobile and gadget protection offering in France with Darthy, an electronics retailer with more than 350 stores in France. This program helps consolidate our position in France as a leading provider of mobile and extended service contracts sold through affinity partners. These new partnerships, along with contributions from existing clients, are expected to produce profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.
Now let's look at Global Housing. Despite the absence of reportable catastrophes in the quarter, results were impacted by a substantial level of weather-related claims, including various iso events. Well individually, these events did not reach our reportable catastrophe threshold of $5 million pretax, they were nonetheless, significant and serve as a reminder of the inherent variability of weather and the need for adequate protection for consumers. 
This quarter, we finalized our $1.4 billion Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, reducing Assurant's financial exposure while protecting more than 2.8 million homeowners and renters in the U.S. and Latin America against severe weather and other hazards. 
We purchased the coverage on attractive terms to ensure we continue to protect their homes and personal property.
Looking at our multi-family housing business, we again delivered double-digit revenue growth year-over-year as we continue to expand our share with affinity partners and property management companies in the U.S. We now partner with more than half of the top 50 PMC's. 
To sustain our leadership position, we've invested in enhancing the consumer experience with more digital and self-service capabilities. We are also identifying potential international markets to capitalize on global rental trends.
Strong results in our multi-family housing business helped offset weaker performance in mortgage solutions, where market demand for origination and field services remain soft. 
In response, we've reduced expenses and are continuing to implement technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies long term.
So let's look now at how we're performing against the key financial measures we use to track our progress, net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of such events. Through the first 6 months of this year, our net operating income decreased 8% to $197 million, primarily due to expected declines in lender-placed. 
Despite lower earnings, operating earnings per share of $3.51 increased 5% from the 6 months of 2016, driven by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10%, down from 10.5% for full year 2016, reflecting higher average equity this year.
At the end of June, our holding company capital totaled $625 million with $375 million available for deployment. During the past 18 months, we've now returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 85% of our stated commitment, while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet.
While we will continue to evolve our business as we build a stronger Assurant, we believe 2017 will represent the last major year of our multiyear transformation. We remained focused on driving profitable growth in 2018 and delivering on our long-term objectives for 2020. 
Our attractive business portfolio, innovative offerings and strong client partnerships, together with a more efficient and effective operating model, are expected to deliver greater and more diversified earnings. This should, in turn, continue to provide for strong cash flow generation and greater flexibility in capital deployment.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our second quarter in more detail. Richard?"
4026111,528704597,1262169,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. Earnings totaled $56 million compared to $57 million in the prior year period, as declines in our lender-placed insurance business were mostly offset by lower reportable catastr",1229,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. Earnings totaled $56 million compared to $57 million in the prior year period, as declines in our lender-placed insurance business were mostly offset by lower reportable catastrophe losses. 
While we did not have any reportable catastrophe losses in the quarter, we had a $10 million impact after tax from a higher noncatastrophe losses ratio. This stemmed, in part, from wind and hail damage related to 15 iso events, all of which fell below our reportable threshold.
Looking at our key metrics, the combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses improved 30 basis points to 87%. This primarily reflects the absence of catastrophe losses this quarter compared to $25 million pretax in the same quarter last year. This was partially offset by higher noncatastrophe losses and additional expenses to support new lender-placed loans. 
The pretax margin for our fee-based, capital-light businesses increased to 11.7%, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. This was due to growth in multi-family housing, largely to expansion within our affinity channels. 
While the performance of our mortgage solution business improved from earlier this year, second quarter results remained soft due to continued weak demand from loan originations and field services. Actions taken in the first half of the year reduced expenses and help mitigate margin pressure.
Turning to revenue. Second quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 2%, primarily due to a 26 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate in our lender-placed insurance business. We expect ongoing reductions to the placement rate in the range of 6 to 7 basis points per quarter through the end of 2017. This is driven by client mix, including a higher concentration of loans with lower-than-average placement rates. As we move into 2018, we expect placement rate declines to moderate.
Looking at our fee-based, capital-light businesses, multi-family housing revenue increased 15% during the second quarter. This reflects growth in renter's policies sold through our affinity and PMC channels, where we now serve more than 1.6 million renters nationwide. 
In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 12% year-over-year, primarily related to weaker market demand and client volume for originations income services. However, on a sequential basis, fee income increased by 14%, reflecting seasonality and additional working days.
For the full year 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing, net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. Lower premiums and lender-placed as well as weaker demand in mortgage solutions will present additional headwinds in the second half of this year. While expense initiatives are already underway, we do not expect that they will fully mitigate the impact of lower revenue in 2017.
Overall, we remain focused on driving profitable growth in multi-family housing and realizing operating efficiencies across Global Housing to deliver on our long-term target of 20% ROE for the segment.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment -- the segment's earnings decreased by $10 million to $40 million. This was attributable to an $18 million onetime tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2016. Absent this item, earnings increased $8 million, primarily reflecting higher contributions from our Connected Living business, partially offset by less favorable loss experience within vehicle protection.
Specifically, Connected Living results benefited from ongoing expense savings, a onetime adjustment from an extended service contract client and modest growth within mobile, as we ramped up new programs globally. 
Revenue for the segment overall decreased, entirely due to a $138 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the change in the client program structure implemented late last year. As a reminder, this change also extended our relationships with an important Connected Living client and had no impact on earnings.
Excluding this change, revenues for Global Lifestyle were up $59 million or 8%. We were pleased to see growth across all of our key lines of business globally, though this was partially offset by foreign exchange volatility largely associated with the pound.
Turning to key performance metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, rose 120 basis points to 97%, driven by less favorable experience in vehicle protection. We expect our combined ratio to remain within the range of 96% to 98% long-term.
The pretax margin for our fee-based Connected Living business rose to 6.4% from 3.2% last year, approximately 100 basis points of this increase was driven by the change in the client program structure referenced earlier. The balance reflected expense savings within extended service contracts, the onetime adjustment referenced earlier and growth in mobile, which was partially offset by investments to support new program launches.
For the full year 2017, we continue to expect segment net operating income to increase from Connected Living, driven primarily by growth in mobile in the second half of 2017. 
Growth in our vehicle protection business is also expected to be a driver along with expense management efforts already underway across mobile lifestyle. All of this has helped -- is expected to help mitigate declines in legacy businesses.
While earnings may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter depending on volumes, loss experience and investments required to support growth, we are confident that the segment will continue to deliver earnings growth of 10% or more on an average annual basis in the long term.
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased $2 million to $13 million, primarily reflecting higher fee and investment income, partially offset by expenses. Both revenue for pre-need increased by 7%, driven largely by growth within our Canadian pre-need business. 
New face sales this quarter decreased by 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes and final need policies. We believe this is just normal quarterly variability. Year-to-date, total phase sales were up 1%.
In 2017, we continue to expect fee income and earnings to increase in pre-need, driven by growth across North America and by operational efficiencies. 
Moving to Corporate, net operating loss decreased by $9 million to $11 million. As a reminder, in the second quarter last year, we incurred higher taxes and fees associated with employee benefits. Corporate expenses were also lower this quarter. We now expect our Corporate net operating loss for this year to total approximately $60 million, a reduction of $11 million from 2016. The drivers are lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced Corporate expenditures.
Moving on to capital, we ended the quarter with approximately $375 million in deployable capital. We upstreamed $160 million of capital to the holding company during the quarter. This included $89 million in dividends from our operating segments and $71 million of capital from Health and employee benefits.
We continue to expect operating segment dividends to approximate segment earnings for the full year and in addition to receive approximately $15 million more from Health and employee benefits as we release residual capital. 
During the second quarter, we returned $142 million to shareholders with $112 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $30 million through common stock dividends. Also in July, we repurchased another $25 million of our stock.
To summarize, we've continued to make good progress in the second quarter, and we delivered solid results. We remained focused on delivering on our commitments to shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.

It's actually taken us 6 years to get into that range given how the foreclosure prices played out in the market. The way to think about it longer term, this business is countercyclical, so as long as the housing market continues to improve, you'll see gradual declines in placement rates. Although we do expect that to moderate as we get into 2018. And then if we do get into any kind of housing issues again in the future, we'll see placement rates growing. But for now, expect continued gradual declines in the placement rate moderate as we get into 2018."

Overall, our second quarter results were solid and demonstrated ongoing progress toward achieving our financial commitments for 2017 and beyond. While Global Housing experienced higher noncatastrophe losses,",819,"Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our second quarter results were solid and demonstrated ongoing progress toward achieving our financial commitments for 2017 and beyond. While Global Housing experienced higher noncatastrophe losses, our other business segments performed in line with our expectations. 
For the full year, we remain confident in our ability to maintain net operating earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, at 2016 levels and to generate double-digit earnings per share growth. This now reflects a revised outlook for our Global Housing and Corporate segments, which Richard will discuss in greater detail. We are also well on our way to completing the $1.5 billion return of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. 
As we progress through this year, we will continue to focus on leveraging our capabilities to expand in key housing lifestyle markets to offset declines in our lender-placed and legacy businesses.
Let me now share a few recent highlights, beginning with Global Lifestyle. Within Connected Living, we continue to strengthen our leadership position across the mobile ecosystem. Earlier this month, we launched a protection plan with Comcast for XFINITY Mobile. Going forward, XFINITY Mobile customers can access a premier suite of protection, support and upgrade services for their mobile devices. It's one of the most comprehensive protection offerings available, including coverage for accidental damage, loss and theft, as well access to our technical support platform and self-diagnostic tools.
In addition XFINITY iPhone users have full access to AppleCare services. We're also continuing to expand our mobile franchise globally. As an example, we launched a new mobile and gadget protection offering in France with Darty, an electronics retailer with more than 350 stores in France. This program helps consolidate our position in France as a leading provider of mobile and extended service contracts sold through affinity partners. These new partnerships, along with contributions from existing clients, are expected to produce profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.
Now let's look at Global Housing. Despite the absence of reportable catastrophes in the quarter, results were impacted by a substantial level of weather-related claims, including various ISO events. While individually these events did not reach our reportable catastrophe threshold of $5 million pretax, they were, nonetheless, significant and serve as a reminder of the inherent variability of weather and the need for adequate protection for consumers. 
This quarter, we've finalized our $1.4 billion Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, reducing Assurant's financial exposure while protecting more than 2.8 million homeowners and renters in the U.S. and Latin America against severe weather and other hazards. We purchased the coverage on attractive terms to ensure we continue to protect their homes and personal property.
Looking at our multi-family housing business, we again delivered double-digit revenue growth year-over-year as we continue to expand our share with affinity partners and property management companies in the U.S. We now partner with more than half of the top 50 PMC's. 
To sustain our leadership position, we've invested in enhancing the consumer experience with more digital and self-service capabilities. We are also identifying potential international markets to capitalize on global rental trends.
Strong results in our multi-family housing business helped offset weaker performance in mortgage solutions, where market demand for origination and field services remained soft. In response, we've reduced expenses and are continuing to implement technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies long term.
So let's look now at how we're performing against the key financial measures we use to track our progress. Net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of such events. Through the first 6 months of this year, our net operating income decreased 8% to $197 million, primarily due to expected declines in lender-placed. 
Despite lower earnings, operating earnings per share of $3.51 increased 5% from the 6 months of 2016, driven by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10%, down from 10.5% for full year of 2016, reflecting higher average equity this year.
At the end of June, our holding company capital totaled $625 million with $375 million available for deployment. During the past 18 months, we've now returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 85% of our stated commitment, while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet.
While we will continue to evolve our business as we build a stronger Assurant, we believe 2017 will represent the last major year of our multiyear transformation. We remain focused on driving profitable growth in 2018 and delivering on our long-term objectives for 2020. 
Our attractive business portfolio, innovative offerings and strong client partnerships, together with a more efficient and effective operating model, are expected to deliver greater and more diversified earnings. This should, in turn, continue to provide for strong cash flow generation and greater flexibility in capital deployment.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our second quarter in more detail. Richard?"
4026111,528704597,1262384,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. Earnings totaled $56 million compared to $57 million in the prior year period, as declines in our lender-placed insurance business were mostly offset by lower reportable catastr",1231,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. Earnings totaled $56 million compared to $57 million in the prior year period, as declines in our lender-placed insurance business were mostly offset by lower reportable catastrophe losses. 
While we did not have any reportable catastrophe losses in the quarter, we had a $10 million impact after tax from a higher noncatastrophe loss ratio. This stemmed, in part, from wind and hail damage related to 15 iso events, all of which fell below our reportable threshold.
Looking at our key metrics, the combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses improved 30 basis points to 87%. This primarily reflects the absence of reportable catastrophe losses this quarter compared to $25 million pretax in the same quarter last year. This was partially offset by higher noncatastrophe losses and additional expenses to support new lender-placed loans. 
The pretax margin for our fee-based, capital-light businesses increased to 11.7%, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. This was due to growth in multi-family housing, largely to expansion within our affinity channels. 
While the performance of our mortgage solution business improved from earlier this year, second quarter results remained soft due to continued weak demand from new loan originations and field services. Actions taken in the first half of the year reduced expenses and help mitigate margin pressure.
Turning to revenue. Second quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 2%, primarily due to a 26 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate in our lender-placed insurance business. We expect ongoing reductions to the placement rate in the range of 6 to 7 basis points per quarter through the end of 2017. This is driven by client mix, including a higher concentration of loans with lower-than-average placement rates. As we move into 2018, we expect placement rate declines to moderate.
Looking at our fee-based, capital-light businesses, multi-family housing revenue increased 15% during the second quarter. This reflects growth in renter's policies sold through our affinity and PMC channels, where we now serve more than 1.6 million renters nationwide. 
In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 12% year-over-year, primarily related to weaker market demand and client volume for originations income services. However, on a sequential basis, fee income increased by 14%, reflecting seasonality and additional working days.
For the full year 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing, net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. Lower premiums in lender-placed as well as weaker demand within mortgage solutions will present additional headwinds in the second half of this year. While expense initiatives are already underway, we do not expect that they will fully mitigate the impact of lower revenue in 2017.
Overall, we remain focused on driving profitable growth in multi-family housing and realizing operating efficiencies across Global Housing to deliver on our long-term target of 20% ROE for the segment.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment -- the segment's earnings decreased by $10 million to $40 million. This was attributable to an $18 million onetime tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2016. Absent this item, earnings increased $8 million, primarily reflecting higher contributions from our Connected Living business, partially offset by less favorable loss experience within vehicle protection. Specifically, Connected Living results benefited from ongoing expense savings, a onetime adjustment from an extended service contract client and modest growth within mobile, as we ramped up new programs globally. 
Revenue for the segment overall decreased, entirely due to a $138 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the change in the client program structure implemented late last year. As a reminder, this change also extended our relationship with an important Connected Living client and had no impact on earnings.
Excluding this change, revenues for Global Lifestyle were up $59 million or 8%. We were pleased to see growth across all of our key lines of business globally, though this was partially offset by foreign exchange volatility largely associated with the pound.
Turning to key performance metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which include vehicle protection and credit insurance, rose 120 basis points to 97%, driven by less favorable experience in vehicle protection. We expect our combined ratio to remain within the range of 96% to 98% long-term.
The pretax margin for our fee-based Connected Living business rose to 6.4% from 3.2% last year, approximately 100 basis points of this increase was driven by the change in the client program structure referenced earlier. The balance reflected expense savings within extended service contracts, the onetime adjustment referenced earlier and growth in mobile, which was partially offset by investments to support new program launches.
For the full year 2017, we continue to expect segment net operating income to increase from Connected Living, driven primarily by growth in mobile in the second half of 2017. 
Growth in our vehicle protection business is also expected to be a driver along with expense management efforts already underway across mobile lifestyle. All of this has helped -- is expected to help mitigate declines in legacy businesses.
While earnings may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter depending on volumes, loss experience and investments required to support growth, we are confident that the segment will continue to deliver earnings growth of 10% or more on an average annual basis in the long term.
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased $2 million to $13 million, primarily reflecting higher fee and investment income, partially offset by expenses. Total revenue for pre-need increased by 7%, driven largely by growth within our Canadian pre-need business. 
New face sales this quarter decreased by 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes and final need policies. We believe this is just normal quarterly variability. Year-to-date, total face sales were up 1%. In 2017, we continue to expect fee income and earnings to increase in pre-need, driven by growth across North America and by operational efficiencies. 
Moving to Corporate, net operating loss decreased by $9 million to $11 million. As a reminder, in the second quarter last year, we incurred higher taxes and fees associated with employee benefits. Corporate expenses were also lower this quarter. We now expect our Corporate net operating loss for this year to total approximately $60 million, a reduction of $11 million from 2016. Key drivers are lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced Corporate expenditures.
Moving on to capital, we ended the quarter with approximately $375 million in deployable capital. We upstreamed $160 million of capital to the holding company during the quarter. This included $89 million in dividends from our operating segments and $71 million of capital from Health and employee benefits.
We continue to expect operating segment dividends to approximate segment earnings for the full year and, in addition, to receive approximately $15 million more from Health and employee benefits as we release residual capital. 
During the second quarter, we returned $142 million to shareholders with $112 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $30 million through common stock dividends. Also in July, we repurchased another $25 million of our stock.
To summarize, we've continued to make good progress in the second quarter, and we delivered solid results. We remained focused on delivering on our commitments to shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.

It's actually taken us 6 years to get into that range given how the foreclosure crisis played out in the market. The way to think about it longer term, this business is countercyclical. So as long as the housing market continues to improve, you'll see gradual declines in placement rates. Although we do expect that to moderate as we get into 2018. And then if we do get into any kind of housing issues again in the future, we'll see placement rates growing.

That's one of the reasons why we were able to lower the Corporate loss this year. You've seen our Connected Living margin expanding. It's up by, I think, almost 300 basis points versus a year ago, that's part of that. We are also investing though in the short-term. So for example, this year, we've been standing up and rolling out a procurement capability across Assurant. That's not going to generate any savings in the short term, but it will be a significant driver -- or any net savings in the short-term, but it will be a significant driver over time.

While Global Housing experienced higher noncatastrophe losses,",819,"Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our second quarter results were solid and demonstrated ongoing progress toward achieving our financial commitments for 2017 and beyond. While Global Housing experienced higher noncatastrophe losses, our other business segments performed in line with our expectations. 
For the full year, we remain confident in our ability to maintain net operating earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, at 2016 levels and to generate double-digit earnings per share growth. This now reflects a revised outlook for our Global Housing and Corporate segments, which Richard will discuss in greater detail. We are also well on our way to completing the $1.5 billion return of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. 
As we progress through this year, we will continue to focus on leveraging our capabilities to expand in key housing lifestyle markets to offset declines in our lender-placed and legacy businesses.
Let me now share a few recent highlights, beginning with Global Lifestyle. Within Connected Living, we continue to strengthen our leadership position across the mobile ecosystem. Earlier this month, we launched a protection plan with Comcast for XFINITY Mobile. Going forward, XFINITY Mobile customers can access a premier suite of protection, support and upgrade services for their mobile devices. It's one of the most comprehensive protection offerings available, including coverage for accidental damage, loss and theft, as well access to our technical support platform and self-diagnostic tools.
In addition XFINITY iPhone users have full access to AppleCare services. We're also continuing to expand our mobile franchise globally. As an example, we launched a new mobile and gadget protection offering in France with Darty, an electronics retailer with more than 350 stores in France. This program helps consolidate our position in France as a leading provider of mobile and extended service contracts sold through affinity partners. These new partnerships, along with contributions from existing clients, are expected to produce profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.
Now let's look at Global Housing. Despite the absence of reportable catastrophes in the quarter, results were impacted by a substantial level of weather-related claims, including various ISO events. While individually these events did not reach our reportable catastrophe threshold of $5 million pretax, they were, nonetheless, significant and serve as a reminder of the inherent variability of weather and the need for adequate protection for consumers. 
This quarter, we've finalized our $1.4 billion Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, reducing Assurant's financial exposure while protecting more than 2.8 million homeowners and renters in the U.S. and Latin America against severe weather and other hazards. We purchased the coverage on attractive terms to ensure we continue to protect their homes and personal property.
Looking at our multi-family housing business, we again delivered double-digit revenue growth year-over-year as we continue to expand our share with affinity partners and property management companies in the U.S. We now partner with more than half of the top 50 PMC's. 
To sustain our leadership position, we've invested in enhancing the consumer experience with more digital and self-service capabilities. We are also identifying potential international markets to capitalize on global rental trends.
Strong results in our multi-family housing business helped offset weaker performance in mortgage solutions, where market demand for origination and field services remained soft. In response, we've reduced expenses and are continuing to implement technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies long term.
So let's look now at how we're performing against the key financial measures we use to track our progress. Net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of such events. Through the first 6 months of this year, our net operating income decreased 8% to $197 million, primarily due to expected declines in lender-placed. 
Despite lower earnings, operating earnings per share of $3.51 increased 5% from the 6 months of 2016, driven by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10%, down from 10.5% for full year of 2016, reflecting higher average equity this year.
At the end of June, our holding company capital totaled $625 million with $375 million available for deployment. During the past 18 months, we've now returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 85% of our stated commitment, while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet.
While we will continue to evolve our business as we build a stronger Assurant, we believe 2017 will represent the last major year of our multiyear transformation. We remain focused on driving profitable growth in 2018 and delivering on our long-term objectives for 2020. 
Our attractive business portfolio, innovative offerings and strong client partnerships, together with a more efficient and effective operating model, are expected to deliver greater and more diversified earnings. This should, in turn, continue to provide for strong cash flow generation and greater flexibility in capital deployment.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our second quarter in more detail. Richard?"
4026111,528704597,1262655,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. Earnings totaled $56 million compared to $57 million in the prior year period, as declines in our lender-placed insurance business were mostly offset by lower reportable catastr",1232,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. Earnings totaled $56 million compared to $57 million in the prior year period, as declines in our lender-placed insurance business were mostly offset by lower reportable catastrophe losses. 
While we did not have any reportable catastrophe losses in the quarter, we had a $10 million impact after tax from a higher noncatastrophe loss ratio. This stemmed, in part, from wind and hail damage related to 15 ISO events, all of which fell below our reportable threshold.
Looking at our key metrics, the combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses improved 30 basis points to 87%. This primarily reflects the absence of reportable catastrophe losses this quarter compared to $25 million pretax in the same quarter last year. This was partially offset by higher noncatastrophe losses and additional expenses to support new lender-placed loans. 
The pretax margin for our fee-based, capital-light businesses increased to 11.7%, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. This was due to growth in multi-family housing, largely to expansion within our affinity channels. 
While the performance of our mortgage solution business improved from earlier this year, second quarter results remained soft due to continued weak demand for new loan originations and field services. Actions taken in the first half of the year reduced expenses and help mitigate margin pressure.
Turning to revenue. Second quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 2%, primarily due to a 26 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate in our lender-placed insurance business. We expect ongoing reductions to the placement rate in the range of 6 to 7 basis points per quarter through the end of 2017. This is driven by client mix, including a higher concentration of loans with lower-than-average placement rates. As we move into 2018, we expect placement rate declines to moderate.
Looking at our fee-based, capital-light businesses, multi-family housing revenue increased 15% during the second quarter. This reflects growth in renter's policies sold through our affinity and PMC channels, where we now serve more than 1.6 million renters nationwide. 
In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 12% year-over-year, primarily related to weaker market demand and client volume for originations and field services. However, on a sequential basis, fee income increased by 14%, reflecting seasonality and additional working days.
For the full year 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing, net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. Lower premiums in lender-placed as well as weaker demand within mortgage solutions will present additional headwinds in the second half of this year. While expense initiatives are already underway, we do not expect that they will fully mitigate the impact of lower revenue in 2017.
Overall, we remain focused on driving profitable growth in multi-family housing and realizing operating efficiencies across Global Housing to deliver on our long-term target of 20% ROE for the segment.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment -- the segment's earnings decreased by $10 million to $40 million. This was attributable to an $18 million onetime tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2016. Absent this item, earnings increased $8 million, primarily reflecting higher contributions from our Connected Living business, partially offset by less favorable loss experience within vehicle protection. Specifically, Connected Living results benefited from ongoing expense savings, a onetime adjustment from an extended service contract client and modest growth within mobile, as we ramped up new programs globally. 
Revenue for the segment overall decreased, entirely due to a $138 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the change in the client program structure implemented late last year. As a reminder, this change also extended our relationship with an important Connected Living client and had no impact on earnings.
Excluding this change, revenues for Global Lifestyle were up $59 million or 8%. We were pleased to see growth across all of our key lines of business globally, though this was partially offset by foreign exchange volatility largely associated with the pound.
Turning to key performance metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which include vehicle protection and credit insurance, rose 120 basis points to 97%, driven by less favorable experience in vehicle protection. We expect our combined ratio to remain within the range of 96% to 98% long-term.
The pretax margin for our fee-based Connected Living business rose to 6.4% from 3.2% last year, approximately 100 basis points of this increase was driven by the change in the client program structure referenced earlier. The balance reflected expense savings within extended service contracts, the onetime adjustment referenced earlier and growth in mobile, which was partially offset by investments to support new program launches.
For the full year 2017, we continue to expect segment net operating income to increase from Connected Living, driven primarily by growth in mobile in the second half of 2017. 
Growth in our vehicle protection business is also expected to be a driver along with expense management efforts already underway across Global Lifestyle. All of this has helped -- is expected to help mitigate declines in legacy businesses.
While earnings may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter depending on volumes, loss experience and investments required to support growth, we are confident that the segment will continue to deliver earnings growth of 10% or more on an average annual basis in the long term.
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased $2 million to $13 million, primarily reflecting higher fee and investment income, partially offset by expenses. Total revenue for pre-need increased by 7%, driven largely by growth within our Canadian pre-need business. 
New face sales this quarter decreased by 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes and final need policies. We believe this is just normal quarterly variability. Year-to-date, total face sales were up 1%. In 2017, we continue to expect fee income and earnings to increase in pre-need, driven by growth across North America and by operational efficiencies. 
Moving to Corporate, net operating loss decreased by $9 million to $11 million. As a reminder, in the second quarter last year, we incurred higher taxes and fees associated with employee benefits. Corporate expenses were also lower this quarter. We now expect our Corporate net operating loss for this year to total approximately $60 million, a reduction of $11 million from 2016. Key drivers are lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced Corporate expenditures.
Moving on to capital, we ended the quarter with approximately $375 million in deployable capital. We upstreamed $160 million of capital to the holding company during the quarter. This included $89 million in dividends from our operating segments and $71 million of capital from Health and employee benefits.
We continue to expect operating segment dividends to approximate segment earnings for the full year and, in addition, to receive approximately $15 million more from Health and employee benefits as we release residual capital. 
During the second quarter, we returned $142 million to shareholders with $112 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $30 million through common stock dividends. Also in July, we repurchased another $25 million of our stock.
To summarize, we've continued to make good progress in the second quarter, and we delivered solid results. We remained focused on delivering on our commitments to shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.

I think you've set it 1.8% to 2.1% in the past, but it seems like it will drift a little bit lower than that partly given some of the new loans that you've taken on that have a naturally lower placement rate.

It's actually taken us 6 years to get into that range, given how the foreclosure crisis played out in the market. The way to think about it longer term, this business is countercyclical. So as long as the housing market continues to improve, you'll see gradual declines in placement rates. Although we do expect that to moderate as we get into 2018. And then if we do get into any kind of housing issues again in the future, we'll see placement rates growing. But for now, expect continued gradual declines in the placement rate moderating as we get into 2018."

Overall, our second quarter results were solid and demonstrated ongoing progress toward achieving our financial commitments for 2017 and beyond. While Global Housing experienced higher noncatastrophe losses,",819,"Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our second quarter results were solid and demonstrated ongoing progress toward achieving our financial commitments for 2017 and beyond. While Global Housing experienced higher noncatastrophe losses, our other business segments performed in line with our expectations. 
For the full year, we remain confident in our ability to maintain net operating earnings, excluding catastrophe losses, at 2016 levels and to generate double-digit earnings per share growth. This now reflects a revised outlook for our Global Housing and Corporate segments, which Richard will discuss in greater detail. We are also well on our way to completing the $1.5 billion return of capital to shareholders by the end of 2017. 
As we progress through this year, we will continue to focus on leveraging our capabilities to expand in key housing lifestyle markets to offset declines in our lender-placed and legacy businesses.
Let me now share a few recent highlights, beginning with Global Lifestyle. Within Connected Living, we continue to strengthen our leadership position across the mobile ecosystem. Earlier this month, we launched a protection plan with Comcast for XFINITY Mobile. Going forward, XFINITY Mobile customers can access a premier suite of protection, support and upgrade services for their mobile devices. It's one of the most comprehensive protection offerings available, including coverage for accidental damage, loss and theft, as well access to our technical support platform and self-diagnostic tools.
In addition XFINITY iPhone users have full access to AppleCare services. We're also continuing to expand our mobile franchise globally. As an example, we launched a new mobile and gadget protection offering in France with Darty, an electronics retailer with more than 350 stores in France. This program helps consolidate our position in France as a leading provider of mobile and extended service contracts sold through affinity partners. These new partnerships, along with contributions from existing clients, are expected to produce profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.
Now let's look at Global Housing. Despite the absence of reportable catastrophes in the quarter, results were impacted by a substantial level of weather-related claims, including various ISO events. While individually these events did not reach our reportable catastrophe threshold of $5 million pretax, they were, nonetheless, significant and serve as a reminder of the inherent variability of weather and the need for adequate protection for consumers. 
This quarter, we've finalized our $1.4 billion Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, reducing Assurant's financial exposure while protecting more than 2.8 million homeowners and renters in the U.S. and Latin America against severe weather and other hazards. We purchased the coverage on attractive terms to ensure we continue to protect their homes and personal property.
Looking at our multi-family housing business, we again delivered double-digit revenue growth year-over-year as we continue to expand our share with affinity partners and property management companies in the U.S. We now partner with more than half of the top 50 PMC's. 
To sustain our leadership position, we've invested in enhancing the consumer experience with more digital and self-service capabilities. We are also identifying potential international markets to capitalize on global rental trends.
Strong results in our multi-family housing business helped offset weaker performance in mortgage solutions, where market demand for origination and field services remained soft. In response, we've reduced expenses and are continuing to implement technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies long term.
So let's look now at how we're performing against the key financial measures we use to track our progress. Net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of such events. Through the first 6 months of this year, our net operating income decreased 8% to $197 million, primarily due to expected declines in lender-placed. 
Despite lower earnings, operating earnings per share of $3.51 increased 5% from the 6 months of 2016, driven by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10%, down from 10.5% for full year of 2016, reflecting higher average equity this year.
At the end of June, our holding company capital totaled $625 million with $375 million available for deployment. During the past 18 months, we've now returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 85% of our stated commitment, while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet.
While we will continue to evolve our business as we build a stronger Assurant, we believe 2017 will represent the last major year of our multiyear transformation. We remain focused on driving profitable growth in 2018 and delivering on our long-term objectives for 2020. 
Our attractive business portfolio, innovative offerings and strong client partnerships, together with a more efficient and effective operating model, are expected to deliver greater and more diversified earnings. This should, in turn, continue to provide for strong cash flow generation and greater flexibility in capital deployment.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our second quarter in more detail. Richard?"
4026111,528704597,1266207,"Assurant, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. Earnings totaled $56 million compared to $57 million in the prior year period, as declines in our lender-placed insurance business were mostly offset by lower reportable catastr",1232,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. Earnings totaled $56 million compared to $57 million in the prior year period, as declines in our lender-placed insurance business were mostly offset by lower reportable catastrophe losses. 
While we did not have any reportable catastrophe losses in the quarter, we had a $10 million impact after tax from a higher noncatastrophe loss ratio. This stemmed, in part, from wind and hail damage related to 15 ISO events, all of which fell below our reportable threshold.
Looking at our key metrics, the combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses improved 30 basis points to 87%. This primarily reflects the absence of reportable catastrophe losses this quarter compared to $25 million pretax in the same quarter last year. This was partially offset by higher noncatastrophe losses and additional expenses to support new lender-placed loans. 
The pretax margin for our fee-based, capital-light businesses increased to 11.7%, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. This was due to growth in multi-family housing, largely to expansion within our affinity channels. 
While the performance of our mortgage solution business improved from earlier this year, second quarter results remained soft due to continued weak demand for new loan originations and field services. Actions taken in the first half of the year reduced expenses and help mitigate margin pressure.
Turning to revenue. Second quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 2%, primarily due to a 26 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate in our lender-placed insurance business. We expect ongoing reductions to the placement rate in the range of 6 to 7 basis points per quarter through the end of 2017. This is driven by client mix, including a higher concentration of loans with lower-than-average placement rates. As we move into 2018, we expect placement rate declines to moderate.
Looking at our fee-based, capital-light businesses, multi-family housing revenue increased 15% during the second quarter. This reflects growth in renter's policies sold through our affinity and PMC channels, where we now serve more than 1.6 million renters nationwide. 
In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 12% year-over-year, primarily related to weaker market demand and client volume for originations and field services. However, on a sequential basis, fee income increased by 14%, reflecting seasonality and additional working days.
For the full year 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing, net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. Lower premiums in lender-placed as well as weaker demand within mortgage solutions will present additional headwinds in the second half of this year. While expense initiatives are already underway, we do not expect that they will fully mitigate the impact of lower revenue in 2017.
Overall, we remain focused on driving profitable growth in multi-family housing and realizing operating efficiencies across Global Housing to deliver on our long-term target of 20% ROE for the segment.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. The segment -- the segment's earnings decreased by $10 million to $40 million. This was attributable to an $18 million onetime tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2016. Absent this item, earnings increased $8 million, primarily reflecting higher contributions from our Connected Living business, partially offset by less favorable loss experience within vehicle protection. Specifically, Connected Living results benefited from ongoing expense savings, a onetime adjustment from an extended service contract client and modest growth within mobile, as we ramped up new programs globally. 
Revenue for the segment overall decreased, entirely due to a $138 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the change in the client program structure implemented late last year. As a reminder, this change also extended our relationship with an important Connected Living client and had no impact on earnings.
Excluding this change, revenues for Global Lifestyle were up $59 million or 8%. We were pleased to see growth across all of our key lines of business globally, though this was partially offset by foreign exchange volatility largely associated with the pound.
Turning to key performance metrics, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which include vehicle protection and credit insurance, rose 120 basis points to 97%, driven by less favorable experience in vehicle protection. We expect our combined ratio to remain within the range of 96% to 98% long-term.
The pretax margin for our fee-based Connected Living business rose to 6.4% from 3.2% last year, approximately 100 basis points of this increase was driven by the change in the client program structure referenced earlier. The balance reflected expense savings within extended service contracts, the onetime adjustment referenced earlier and growth in mobile, which was partially offset by investments to support new program launches.
For the full year 2017, we continue to expect segment net operating income to increase from Connected Living, driven primarily by growth in mobile in the second half of 2017. 
Growth in our vehicle protection business is also expected to be a driver along with expense management efforts already underway across Global Lifestyle. All of this has helped -- is expected to help mitigate declines in legacy businesses.
While earnings may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter depending on volumes, loss experience and investments required to support growth, we are confident that the segment will continue to deliver earnings growth of 10% or more on an average annual basis in the long term.
Now let's turn to Global Preneed. Earnings increased $2 million to $13 million, primarily reflecting higher fee and investment income, partially offset by expenses. Total revenue for pre-need increased by 7%, driven largely by growth within our Canadian pre-need business. 
New face sales this quarter decreased by 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes and final need policies. We believe this is just normal quarterly variability. Year-to-date, total face sales were up 1%. In 2017, we continue to expect fee income and earnings to increase in pre-need, driven by growth across North America and by operational efficiencies. 
Moving to Corporate, net operating loss decreased by $9 million to $11 million. As a reminder, in the second quarter last year, we incurred higher taxes and fees associated with employee benefits. Corporate expenses were also lower this quarter. We now expect our Corporate net operating loss for this year to total approximately $60 million, a reduction of $11 million from 2016. Key drivers are lower tax and employee-related costs as well as reduced Corporate expenditures.
Moving on to capital, we ended the quarter with approximately $375 million in deployable capital. We upstreamed $160 million of capital to the holding company during the quarter. This included $89 million in dividends from our operating segments and $71 million of capital from Health and employee benefits.
We continue to expect operating segment dividends to approximate segment earnings for the full year and, in addition, to receive approximately $15 million more from Health and employee benefits as we release residual capital. 
During the second quarter, we returned $142 million to shareholders with $112 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $30 million through common stock dividends. Also in July, we repurchased another $25 million of our stock.
To summarize, we've continued to make good progress in the second quarter, and we delivered solid results. We remained focused on delivering on our commitments to shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

First, given the sort of change in the makeup of your LPI book, how do you think about placement rates? And if we stay in this type of a housing environment, barring any major correction, where do you think that the rate will stabilize? I think you've set it 1.8% to 2.1% in the past, but it seems like it will drift a little bit lower than that partly given some of the new loans that you've taken on that have a naturally lower placement rate. And then I have a couple other ones as well."

It's actually taken us 6 years to get into that range, given how the foreclosure crisis played out in the market. The way to think about it longer term, this business is countercyclical. So as long as the housing market continues to improve, you'll see gradual declines in placement rates. Although we do expect that to moderate as we get into 2018. And then if we do get into any kind of housing issues again in the future, we'll see placement rates growing. But for now, expect continued gradual declines in the placement rate moderating as we get into 2018."

But I think we feel good about the momentum there. You saw some of the impact coming through on our Corporate expense line. That's one of the reasons why we were able to lower the Corporate loss this year. You've seen our Connected Living margin expanding. It's up by, I think, almost 300 basis points versus a year ago, that's part of that. We are also investing, though, in the short-term. So for example, this year, we've been standing up and rolling out a procurement capability across Assurant. That's not going to generate any savings in the short term, but it will be a significant driver -- or any net savings in the short-term, but it will be a significant driver over time.

We recorde",934,"Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter marked one of the most active hurricane seasons on record. This serves as an important reminder of the protection Assurant provides to millions of their customers in their time of need. We recorded nearly $300 million in reportable catastrophes from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as the Mexico City earthquake. Devastation to the U.S. and in particular, the Caribbean, was quite extensive and our teams mobilized quickly. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and unwavering commitment to serve our customers during a tough time. This is especially true for many of our employees who were also personally affected by various catastrophes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico.
While our third quarter performance was impacted by these events, underlying results, excluding catastrophes, were in line with our expectations. We also made further progress towards achieving our 2017 financial commitments. 
For the full year, we now expect operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, to be up modestly from the $380 million recorded in 2016. Profitable growth in our fee-based, capital-light offerings, a lower corporate loss and some onetime benefits will more than offset the decline in lender-placed and legacy businesses.
In 2018 and beyond, we'll be focused on leveraging our expertise and leadership positions in the housing and lifestyle markets to drive profitable growth. Two weeks ago, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the Warranty Group, a premier provider of extended service contracts, worth $2.5 billion from TPG Capital. This transaction represents another important milestone in our transformation journey. The Warranty Group's focus aligns well with ours and will help enhance our position as a leading lifestyle provider with significant operating synergies and a more predictable and diversified earnings stream. In addition, the acquisition accelerates our ability to capitalize on trends within our expanding lifestyle business and deepens our footprint and product offerings in key international markets.
During the past few years, we've not only strengthened our business portfolio but have also continued to deepen our management bench. Earlier this week, we welcome Carey Roberts to Assurant as our new Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Carey is a 20-year insurance industry veteran and will be retiring after 10 years with the company. I'm going to thank Bart for his dedication and service and wish him all the best.
Let me now review some business highlights from the third quarter, beginning with Global Lifestyle. We are pleased by continued sales momentum in our lifestyle businesses as we further leverages our deep capabilities globally. 
During the quarter, we launched a new mobile device protection program with KD DI, the second-largest mobile carrier in Japan, with more than 49 million subscribers. This relationship strengthens our impressions in this critical postpaid market. New relationships like this, along with the planned acquisition of the Warranty Group, will help advance our position as a leading provider in the Global Lifestyle market with an attractive product and client portfolio, diversified growth profile and deeper global footprint.
Now let's look at Global Housing. In our multi-family housing business, revenue growth was strong, reflecting continued expansion within our affinity partners and property management in the U.S. We also recently signed an agreement with a leading e-commerce client to provide our insurance offering for small partial shipments in the U.S. and Europe. This builds our acquisition of Shipsurance in early 2016, and we are excited to expand our book of business with this important client.
Growth in multi-family housing partially offset declines in lender-placed and in mortgage solutions where we continue to see soft market conditions and field services and evaluations business. We have implemented various expense management efforts to cross Global Housing to help temper declines.
Now let's review our performance-to-date against the key financial measures we use to track our progress. Net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of such events. 
Through the first 9 months of this year, our net operating income was up modestly in comparison to the same period last year as the increased contribution from Connected Living and a lower loss at corporate more than offset the continued normalization of lender-placed. Operating earnings per share increased 15% to $5.64, driven by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 10.7%, level with the full year 2016. As of the end of September, our holding capital totaled $570 million, with $320 million available for deployment.
Over the last 7 quarters, we've returned over $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 90% of our stated commitment. We expect to return the remaining $160 million through buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to 2018, we'll be focused on delivering profitable growth and the successful integration of the Warranty Group. 
From a capital management perspective, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend as we have every year since our IPO, subject as always to board approval. In addition, we expect share repurchases will continue albeit in a more moderate pace in recent years as we set aside the funds needed to complete our acquisition of EK, an assistance company in Latin America where we currently have a 40% ownership stake.
Overall, we believe our attractive business portfolio, innovative offerings and strong client partnerships will deliver greater and more diversified earnings. This should result in strong cash flow generation and allow for greater flexibility in capital deployment over time. I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our third quarter results in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,540083833,1331948,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2017",2017-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $110 million, driven by $187 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Ma",1357,"Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Let's start with a look at Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $110 million, driven by $187 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as the Mexico City earthquake. This compares to $33 million of catastrophe losses in the third quarter of last year. The ongoing lender-placed normalization also drove the decline and was partially offset by $5 million of income from a real estate joint venture partnership. 
Looking at our key metrics. The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased to 155%, reflecting catastrophes in the quarter. Excluding the losses and reinstatement premiums, the combined ratio was 81%, roughly in line with the prior year period. Declining lender-placed premiums were offset by lower expenses to support the business. Pretax margin for our fee-based, capital-light businesses decreased to 9%. This represents a 70 basis point decline from the prior year period. This was mainly from $7 million of catastrophe losses and higher non-catastrophe losses within our multi-family housing business. 
Mortgage solutions results improved modestly due to prior expense actions, but remained soft overall given the continued weak market demand for originations and field services. While we continue to manage our expense base, we expect the margin pressure to persist as we exit 2017.
Turning to revenue. Third quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%. This was primarily due to a 31 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate and additional reinsurance premiums, largely for reinstatements. Growth in multi-family housing and premiums for new lender-placed clients partially offset the decline. The placement rate in the quarter was impacted by macro trends in client mix, including a higher concentration of loans with lower-than-average placement rates. With these loans now fully on boarded, we expect the placement rate decline to moderate in the fourth quarter and into 2018.
Moving to our fee-based, capital-light businesses, multi-family housing revenue increased 14% during the third quarter. This reflects growth in renters policies sold to through affinity and PMC channels. In mortgage solutions, the income was down 24% year-over-year, and down 3% from second quarter 2017, primarily related to weaker market demand and lower client volume for origination and field services. 
Consistent with our outlook for full year 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing, net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. This is due to an ongoing normalization of lender-placed and continued weak performance in mortgage solutions. While the Atlantic hurricane season officially ends later this month, we expect the losses from the California wildfires to be a reportable catastrophe event in the fourth quarter. We continue to monitor claims development and expect losses could be $6 million to $8 million pretax.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. This segment recorded a $43 million of net operating income, an increase of $14 million from the prior period. This was driven by a onetime $10 million tax benefit growth in our mobile business and additional joint venture real estate partnership income. This was partially offset by $5 million in losses, primarily in our vehicle protection business from flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. Revenue for the segment overall decreased entirely due to a $139 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the previously mentioned change in the client program structure. The change implemented late last year expanded our relationship with the client and had no impact on economics. Excluding this change, revenues for Global Lifestyle were up $53 million or 7%, driven by growth in mobile globally, vehicle protection and our Canadian credit business. This was partially offset by the declines from legacy retail clients.
Fee income within Global Lifestyle specifically was up 11%, driven by growth in new mobile programs and subscribers. In the quarter, however, we saw lower-than-expected volumes of trading activity, following the staggered introduction of new smartphone devices. Given the anticipated availability of these new devices, we expect trading volumes in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter with a more meaningful increase in early 2018.
The vehicle protection business generated 7% growth in revenue year-over-year as strong sales growth from prior year period begins to earn. Our strong returns and expanded profitability in this business over the last several years has been supported by comprehensive product and service offering as well as broad distribution. Our alignment with key TPAs and OEMs in North America and other selected countries in Latin America have also contributed to our success. 
Looking at the key performance metrics for this segment, the combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, rose by 130 basis points to 99%. This was primarily driven by vehicle protection losses from Harvey. Absent this, combined ratio was 96.6%, well within our targeted range of 96% to 98%. The pretax margin for our fee-based Connected Living business rose to 3.8%, up 1.2 percentage points from last year, approximately 70 basis points was related to the change in the program structure referenced earlier. The balance was due to growth in mobile programs and subscribers, partially offset by lower service contract results and additional expenses to support new business.
Turning to our Global Lifestyle outlook for the full year 2017. While mobile trading volumes in the fourth quarter may be lower than originally anticipated, we continue to expect 2017 segment earnings to meaningfully increase year-over-year. We also believe that we will be well-positioned to drive sustained growth in 2018. 
Now let's review results in global preneed. Earnings decreased $2 million to $12 million, primarily reflecting real estate joint venture partnership income in the prior period. Otherwise, results were flat. All assets continue to grow, yields remain pressured in the low interest rate environment. Total revenue for preneed increased by 3%, driven largely by growth with our U.S. and Canadian business, including our final need product.
New phase sales this quarter decreased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes. This was in key markets like Texas and Florida, the areas hit hardest by hurricane activity. While disappointing, we do not expect lower sales will impact our ability to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Moving to corporate. Net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $13 million. Lower expenses and a reduction in taxes drove the decline. We expect the lower taxes in the third quarter to reverse in the fourth quarter. We also expect corporate's fourth quarter results to include an increase in expenses, driven by additional third-party consulting spend and technology and other expenses as we continue to align our operating model. As such, we now estimate our corporate net operating loss for this year to be within the $55 million to $60 million range compared to $71 million in 2016.
Moving on to corporate. We ended the quarter with approximately $320 million in deployable capital. Because of the significant level of catastrophes, we only received $4 million in dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and preneed in the third quarter. We have streamed $38 million from health and employee benefits or $124 million year-to-date. This is well ahead of our initial full year estimate of $100 million.
We continue to expect dividends from operating segments to roughly approximate segment earnings for the full year.
During the third quarter, we returned $63 million to shareholders with $34 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $29 million through common stock dividends. Buybacks in September were lower due to cat activity and the pending announcement of the Warranty Group acquisition.
To summarize, we continue to make good progress in the third quarter, and we delivered solid results. We are developing a comprehensive integration plan for acquisition of the Warranty Group to ensure we operate as one company day 1. We also are beginning to prepare our S-4 filing, including pro forma financials, which we expect to be filed by year-end. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.
With that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Third quarter marked one of the most active hurricane seasons on record. This serves as an important reminder of the protection Assurant provides to millions of our customers in their time of need. We recorded nearly $300 million in reportable catastrophes from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria; as well as the Mexico City earthquake. Devastation to the U.S. and in particular the Caribbean was quite extensive, and our teams mobilized quickly. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and unwavering commitment to serve our customers during a tough time. This is especially true for many of our employees who were also personally affected by the various catastrophes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico.
While our third quarter performance was impacted by these events, underlying results excluding catastrophes were in line with our expectations. We also made further progress toward achieving our 2017 financial commitments. For the full year, we now expect operating earnings excluding reportable catastrophe losses to be up modestly from the $380 million recorded in 2016. Profitable growth in our fee-based, capital-light offerings; a lower corporate loss; and some onetime benefits will more than offset the decline in lender-placed and legacy businesses. In 2018 and beyond, we'll be focused on leveraging our expertise and leadership positions in the housing and lifestyle markets to drive profitable growth.
2 weeks ago, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire The Warranty Group, a premier provider of extended-service contracts, for $2.5 billion from TPG Capital. This transaction represents another important milestone in our transformation journey. The Warranty Group's focus aligns well with ours and will help enhance our position as a leading lifestyle provider with significant operating synergies and a more predictable and diversified earnings stream. In addition, the acquisition accelerates our ability to capitalize on trends within our expanding lifestyle business and deepens our footprint and product offerings in key international markets.
During the past few years, we've not only strengthened our business portfolio but have also continued to deepen our management bench. Earlier this week, we welcome Carey Roberts to Assurant as our new Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Carey is a 20-year insurance industry veteran; and will succeed Bart Schwartz, who will be retiring after 10 years with the company. I want to thank Bart for his dedication and service and wish him all the best.
Let me now review some business highlights from the third quarter, beginning with Global Lifestyle.
We are pleased by continued sales momentum in our lifestyle businesses as we further leverages our deep capabilities globally. During the quarter, we launched a new mobile device protection program with KDDI, the second largest mobile carrier in Japan with more than 49 million subscribers. This relationship strengthens our presence in this critical postpaid mobile market. New relationships like this, along with the planned acquisition of The Warranty Group, will help advance our position as a leading provider in the global lifestyle market with an attractive product and client portfolio, diversified growth profile and deeper global footprint.
Now let's look at Global Housing. In our multi-family housing business, revenue growth was strong, reflecting continued expansion within our affinity partners and property management companies in the U.S. We also recently signed an agreement with a leading e-commerce client to provide our insurance offering for small parcel shipments in the U.S. and Europe. This builds on our acquisition of Shipsurance in early 2016, and we are excited to expand our book of business with this important client. Growth in multi-family housing partially offset declines in lender-placed and in mortgage solutions, where we continue to see soft market conditions in field services and the valuations business. We have implemented various expense-management efforts across Global Housing to help temper declines.
Now let's review our performance to-date against the key financial measures we use to track our progress: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of such events.
Through the first 9 months of this year, our net operating income was up modestly in comparison to the same period last year, as the increased contribution from Connected Living and a lower loss at Corporate more than offset the continued normalization of lender placed. Operating earnings per share increased 15% to $5.64, driven by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE excluding AOCI was 10.7%, level with the full year 2016. As of the end of September, our holding company capital totaled $570 million, with $320 million available for deployment.
Over the last 7 quarters, we've returned over $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 90% of our stated commitment. We expect to return the remaining $160 million through buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to 2018, we'll be focused on delivering profitable growth and the successful integration of The Warranty Group. From a capital management perspective, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend, as we have every year since our IPO, subject as always to board approval. In addition, we expect share repurchases will continue, albeit at a more moderate pace than in recent years as we set aside the funds needed to complete our acquisition of Iké, an assistance company in Latin America where we currently have a 40% ownership stake.
Overall, we believe our attractive business portfolio, innovative offerings and strong client partnerships will deliver greater and more diversified earnings. This should result in strong cash flow generation and allow for greater flexibility in capital deployment over time.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our third quarter results in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,540083833,1332116,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2017",2017-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan. And good morning.Let's start with a look at Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $110 million driven by $187 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Ma",1361,"Thank you, Alan. And good morning.
Let's start with a look at Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $110 million driven by $187 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria; as well as the Mexico City earthquake. This compares to $33 million of catastrophe losses in the third quarter of last year. The ongoing lender-placed normalization also drove the decline and was partially offset by $5 million of income from a real estate joint venture partnership.
Looking at our key metrics. The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased to 155%, reflecting catastrophes in the quarter. Excluding the losses and reinstatement premiums, the combined ratio was 81%, roughly in line with the prior year period. Declining lender-placed premiums were offset by lower expenses to support the business. Pretax margin for our fee-based, capital-light businesses decreased to 9%. This represents a 70 basis point decline from the prior year period. This was mainly from $7 million of catastrophe losses and higher noncatastrophe losses within our multi-family housing business. Mortgage solutions results improved modestly due to prior expense actions but remained soft overall given the continued weak market demand for originations and field services. While we continue to manage our expense base, we expect the margin pressure to persist as we exit 2017.
Turning to revenue. Third quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%. This was primarily due to a 31 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate; and additional reinsurance premiums, largely for reinstatements. Growth in multi-family housing and premiums for new lender-placed clients partially offset the decline. The placement rate in the quarter was impacted by macro trends in client mix, including a higher concentration of loans with lower-than-average placement rates. With these loans now fully onboarded, we expect the placement rate decline to moderate in the fourth quarter and into 2018.
Moving to our fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multi-family housing revenue increased 14% during the third quarter. This reflects growth in renters' policies sold through our affinity and PMC channels. In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 24% year-over-year and down 3% from second quarter 2017, primarily related to weaker market demand and lower client volume for origination and field services.
Consistent with our outlook for full year 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. This is due to the ongoing normalization of lender placed and continued weak performance in mortgage solutions. While the Atlantic hurricane season officially ends later this month, we expect the losses from the California wildfires to be a reportable catastrophe event in the fourth quarter. We continue to monitor claims development and expect losses could be $6 million to $8 million pretax.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. This segment recorded a $43 million of net operating income, an increase of $14 million from the prior period. This was driven by a onetime $10 million tax benefit, growth in our mobile business and additional joint venture real estate partnership income. This was partially offset by $5 million in losses, primarily in our vehicle protection business, from flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. Revenue for the segment overall decreased entirely due to a $139 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the previously mentioned change in the client program structure. The change implemented late last year expanded our relationship with the client and had no impact on economics. Excluding this change, revenues for Global Lifestyle were up $53 million or 7%, driven by growth in mobile globally, vehicle protection and our Canadian credit business. This was partially offset by the declines from legacy retail clients.
Fee income within Global Lifestyle specifically was up 11%, driven by growth in new mobile programs and subscribers. In the quarter, however, we saw lower-than-expected volumes of trade-in activity following the staggered introduction of new smartphone devices. Given the anticipated availability of these new devices, we expect trade-in volumes in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter, with a more meaningful increase in early 2018. The vehicle protection business generated 7% growth in revenue year-over-year, as strong sales growth from prior year periods begins to earn. Our strong returns and expanded profitability in this business over the last several years has been supported by a comprehensive product and service offering as well as broad distribution. Our alignment with key TPAs and OEMs in North America and other selected countries in Latin America have also contributed to our success.
Looking at the key performance metrics for this segment. The combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, rose by 130 basis points to 99%. This was primarily driven by vehicle protection losses from Harvey. Absent this, combined ratio was 96.6%, well within our targeted range of 96% to 98%. The pretax margin for our fee-based Connected Living business rose to 3.8%, up 1.2 percentage points from last year. Approximately 70 basis points was related to the change in the program structure referenced earlier. The balance was due to growth in mobile programs and subscribers, partially offset by lower service contract results and additional expenses to support new business.
Turning to our Global Lifestyle outlook for the full year 2017. While mobile trade-in volumes in the fourth quarter may be lower than originally anticipated, we continue to expect 2017 segment earnings to meaningfully increase year-over-year. We also believe that we will be well positioned to drive sustained growth in 2018.
Now let's review results in Global Preneed. Earnings decreased $2 million to $12 million, primarily reflecting real estate joint venture partnership income in the prior period. Otherwise, results were flat. While assets continued to grow, yields remained pressured in a low interest rate environment. Total revenue for preneed increased by 3%, driven largely by growth with our U.S. and Canadian business, including our final need product. New face sales this quarter decreased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes. This was in key markets like Texas and Florida, the areas hit hardest by the hurricane activity. While disappointing, we do not expect lower sales will impact our ability to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Moving to Corporate. Net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $13 million. Lower expenses and a reduction in taxes drove the decline. We expect the lower taxes in third quarter to reverse in the fourth quarter. We also expect Corporate's fourth quarter results to include an increase in expenses driven by additional third-party consulting spend and technology and other expenses as we continue to align our operating model. As such, we now estimate our Corporate net operating loss for this year to be within the $55 million to $60 million range compared to $71 million in 2016.
Moving on to Corporate. We ended the quarter with approximately $320 million in deployable capital. Because of the significant level of catastrophes, we only received $4 million in dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and Preneed in the third quarter. We upstreamed $38 million from health and employee benefits or $124 million year-to-date. This is well ahead of our initial fee -- full year estimate of $100 million. We continue to expect dividends from operating segments to roughly approximate segment earnings for the full year.
During the third quarter, we returned $63 million to shareholders, with $34 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $29 million through common stock dividends. Buybacks through September were lower due to cat activity and the pending announcement of The Warranty Group acquisition.
To summarize. We continued to make good progress in the third quarter, and we delivered solid results. We are developing a comprehensive integration plan for our acquisition of The Warranty Group to ensure we operate as one company day 1. We also are beginning to prepare our S-4 filing including pro forma financials, which we expect to be filed by year-end. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.

And good morning, everyone.Third quarter marked one of the most active hurricane seasons on record.

Third quarter marked one of the most active hurricane seasons on record. This serves as an important reminder of the protection Assurant provides to millions of our customers in their time of need. We recorded nearly $300 million in reportable catastrophes from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria; as well as the Mexico City earthquake. Devastation to the U.S. and in particular the Caribbean was quite extensive, and our teams mobilized quickly. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and unwavering commitment to serve our customers during a tough time. This is especially true for many of our employees who were also personally affected by the various catastrophes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico.
While our third quarter performance was impacted by these events, underlying results excluding catastrophes were in line with our expectations. We also made further progress toward achieving our 2017 financial commitments. For the full year, we now expect operating earnings excluding reportable catastrophe losses to be up modestly from the $380 million recorded in 2016. Profitable growth in our fee-based, capital-light offerings; a lower corporate loss; and some one-time benefits will more than offset the decline in lender-placed and legacy businesses. In 2018 and beyond, we'll be focused on leveraging our expertise and leadership positions in the housing and lifestyle markets to drive profitable growth.
2 weeks ago, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire The Warranty Group, a premier provider of extended-service contracts, for $2.5 billion from TPG Capital. This transaction represents another important milestone in our transformation journey. The Warranty Group's focus aligns well with ours and will help enhance our position as a leading lifestyle provider with significant operating synergies and a more predictable and diversified earnings stream. In addition, the acquisition accelerates our ability to capitalize on trends within our expanding lifestyle business and deepens our footprint and product offerings in key international markets.
During the past few years, we've not only strengthened our business portfolio but have also continued to deepen our management bench. Earlier this week, we welcomed Carey Roberts to Assurant as our new Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Carey is a 20-year insurance industry veteran; and will succeed Bart Schwartz, who will be retiring after 10 years with the company. I want to thank Bart for his dedication and service and wish him all the best.
Let me now review some business highlights from the third quarter, beginning with Global Lifestyle.
We are pleased by continued sales momentum in our lifestyle businesses as we further leverage our deep capabilities globally. During the quarter, we launched a new mobile device protection program with KDDI, the second largest mobile carrier in Japan with more than 49 million subscribers. This relationship strengthens our presence in this critical postpaid mobile market. New relationships like this, along with the planned acquisition of The Warranty Group, will help advance our position as a leading provider in the global lifestyle market with an attractive product and client portfolio, diversified growth profile and deeper global footprint.
Now let's look at Global Housing. In our multi-family housing business, revenue growth was strong, reflecting continued expansion within our affinity partners and property management companies in the U.S. We also recently signed an agreement with a leading e-commerce client to provide our insurance offering for small parcel shipments in the U.S. and Europe. This builds on our acquisition of Shipsurance in early 2016, and we are excited to expand our book of business with this important client. Growth in multi-family housing partially offset declines in lender-placed and in mortgage solutions, where we continue to see soft market conditions in field services and the valuations business. We have implemented various expense-management efforts across Global Housing to help temper declines.
Now let's review our performance to-date against the key financial measures we use to track our progress: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of such events.
Through the first 9 months of this year, our net operating income was up modestly in comparison to the same period last year, as the increased contribution from Connected Living and a lower loss at Corporate more than offset the continued normalization of lender-placed. Operating earnings per share increased 15% to $5.64, driven by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE excluding AOCI was 10.7%, level with the full year 2016. As of the end of September, our holding company capital totaled $570 million, with $320 million available for deployment.
Over the last 7 quarters, we've returned over $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 90% of our stated commitment. We expect to return the remaining $160 million through buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to 2018, we'll be focused on delivering profitable growth and the successful integration of The Warranty Group. 
From a capital management perspective, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend, as we have every year since our IPO, subject as always to board approval. In addition, we expect share repurchases will continue, albeit at a more moderate pace than in recent years as we set aside the funds needed to complete our acquisition of Iké, an assistance company in Latin America where we currently have a 40% ownership stake.
Overall, we believe our attractive business portfolio, innovative offerings and strong client partnerships will deliver greater and more diversified earnings. This should result in strong cash flow generation and allow for greater flexibility in capital deployment over time.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our third quarter results in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,540083833,1332335,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2017",2017-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan. And good morning.Let's start with a look at Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $110 million driven by $187 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Ma",1357,"Thank you, Alan. And good morning.
Let's start with a look at Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $110 million driven by $187 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria; as well as the Mexico City earthquake. This compares to $33 million of catastrophe losses in the third quarter of last year. The ongoing lender-placed normalization also drove the decline and was partially offset by $5 million of income from a real estate joint venture partnership.
Looking at our key metrics. The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased to 155%, reflecting catastrophes in the quarter. Excluding the losses and reinstatement premiums, the combined ratio was 81%, roughly in line with the prior year period. Declining lender-placed premiums were offset by lower expenses to support the business. Pretax margin for our fee-based, capital-light businesses decreased to 9%. This represents a 70 basis point decline from the prior year period. This was mainly from $7 million of catastrophe losses and higher noncatastrophe losses within our multi-family housing business. Mortgage solutions results improved modestly due to prior expense actions but remained soft overall given the continued weak market demand for originations and field services. While we continue to manage our expense base, we expect the margin pressure to persist as we exit 2017.
Turning to revenue. Third quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%. This was primarily due to a 31 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate; and additional reinsurance premiums, largely for reinstatements. Growth in multi-family housing and premiums for new lender-placed clients partially offset the decline. The placement rate in the quarter was impacted by macro trends in client mix, including a higher concentration of loans with lower-than-average placement rates. With these loans now fully onboarded, we expect the placement rate decline to moderate in the fourth quarter and into 2018.
Moving to our fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multi-family housing revenue increased 14% during the third quarter. This reflects growth in renters' policies sold through our affinity and PMC channels. In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 24% year-over-year and down 3% from second quarter 2017, primarily related to weaker market demand and lower client volume for origination and field services.
Consistent with our outlook for full year 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. This is due to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed and continued weak performance in mortgage solutions. While the Atlantic hurricane season officially ends later this month, we expect the losses from the California wildfires to be a reportable catastrophe event in the fourth quarter. We continue to monitor claims development and expect losses could be $6 million to $8 million pretax.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. This segment recorded $43 million of net operating income, an increase of $14 million from the prior period. This was driven by a one-time $10 million tax benefit, growth in our mobile business and additional joint venture real estate partnership income. This was partially offset by $5 million in losses, primarily in our vehicle protection business, from flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. Revenue for the segment overall decreased entirely due to a $139 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the previously mentioned change in the client program structure. The change implemented late last year extended our relationship with the client and had no impact on economics. Excluding this change, revenues for Global Lifestyle were up $53 million or 7%, driven by growth in mobile globally, vehicle protection and our Canadian credit business. This was partially offset by the declines from legacy retail clients.
Fee income within Global Lifestyle specifically was up 11%, driven by growth in new mobile programs and subscribers. In the quarter, however, we saw lower-than-expected volumes of trade-in activity following the staggered introduction of new smartphone devices. Given the anticipated availability of these new devices, we expect trade-in volumes in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter, with a more meaningful increase in early 2018. The vehicle protection business generated 7% growth in revenue year-over-year, as strong sales growth from prior year periods begins to earn. Our strong returns and expanded profitability in this business over the last several years has been supported by a comprehensive product and service offering as well as broad distribution. Our alignment with key TPAs and OEMs in North America and other selected countries in Latin America have also contributed to our success.
Looking at the key performance metrics for this segment. The combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, rose by 130 basis points to 99%. This was primarily driven by vehicle protection losses from Harvey. Absent this, combined ratio was 96.6%, well within our targeted range of 96% to 98%. The pretax margin for our fee-based Connected Living business rose to 3.8%, up 1.2 percentage points from last year. Approximately 70 basis points was related to the change in the program structure referenced earlier. The balance was due to growth in mobile programs and subscribers, partially offset by lower service contract results and additional expenses to support new business.
Turning to our Global Lifestyle outlook for the full year 2017. While mobile trade-in volumes in the fourth quarter may be lower than originally anticipated, we continue to expect 2017 segment earnings to meaningfully increase year-over-year. We also believe that we will be well positioned to drive sustained growth in 2018.
Now let's review results in Global pre-need. Earnings decreased $2 million to $12 million, primarily reflecting real estate joint venture partnership income in the prior period. Otherwise, results were flat. While assets continued to grow, yields remained pressured in a low-interest rate environment. Total revenue for preneed increased by 3%, driven largely by growth with our U.S. and Canadian business, including our final need products. New face sales this quarter decreased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes. This was in key markets like Texas and Florida, the areas hit hardest by the hurricane activity. While disappointing, we do not expect lower sales will impact our ability to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Moving to Corporate. Net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $13 million. Lower expenses and a reduction in taxes drove the decline. We expect the lower taxes in third quarter to reverse in the fourth quarter. We also expect Corporate's fourth-quarter results to include an increase in expenses driven by additional third-party consulting spend and technology and other expenses as we continue to align our operating model. As such, we now estimate our Corporate net operating loss for this year to be within the $55 million to $60 million range compared to $71 million in 2016.
Moving on to Corporate. We ended the quarter with approximately $320 million in deployable capital. Because of the significant level of catastrophes, we only received $4 million in dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and pre-need in the third quarter. We upstreamed $38 million from health and employee benefits or $124 million year-to-date. This is well ahead of our initial fee -- full year estimate of $100 million. We continue to expect dividends from operating segments to roughly approximate segment earnings for the full year.
During the third quarter, we returned $63 million to shareholders, with $34 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $29 million through common stock dividends. Buybacks through September were lower due to cat activity and the pending announcement of The Warranty Group acquisition.
To summarize. We continued to make good progress in the third quarter, and we delivered solid results. We are developing a comprehensive integration plan for our acquisition of The Warranty Group to ensure we operate as one company day one. We also are beginning to prepare our S-4 filing including pro forma financials, which we expect to be filed by year-end. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.

Third quarter marked one of the most active hurricane seasons on record. This serves as an important reminder of the protection Assurant provides to millions of our customers in their time of need. We recorded nearly $300 million in reportable catastrophes from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria; as well as the Mexico City earthquake. Devastation to the U.S. and in particular the Caribbean was quite extensive, and our teams mobilized quickly. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and unwavering commitment to serve our customers during a tough time. This is especially true for many of our employees who were also personally affected by the various catastrophes in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico.
While our third quarter performance was impacted by these events, underlying results excluding catastrophes were in line with our expectations. We also made further progress toward achieving our 2017 financial commitments. For the full year, we now expect operating earnings excluding reportable catastrophe losses to be up modestly from the $380 million recorded in 2016. Profitable growth in our fee-based, capital-light offerings; a lower corporate loss; and some onetime benefits will more than offset the decline in lender-placed and legacy businesses. In 2018 and beyond, we'll be focused on leveraging our expertise and leadership positions in the housing and lifestyle markets to drive profitable growth.
2 weeks ago, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire The Warranty Group, a premier provider of extended-service contracts, for $2.5 billion from TPG Capital. This transaction represents another important milestone in our transformation journey. The Warranty Group's focus aligns well with ours and will help enhance our position as a leading lifestyle provider with significant operating synergies and a more predictable and diversified earnings stream. In addition, the acquisition accelerates our ability to capitalize on trends within our expanding lifestyle business and deepens our footprint and product offerings in key international markets.
During the past few years, we've not only strengthened our business portfolio but have also continued to deepen our management bench. Earlier this week, we welcomed Carey Roberts to Assurant as our new Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Carey is a 20-year insurance industry veteran; and will succeed Bart Schwartz, who will be retiring after 10 years with the company. I want to thank Bart for his dedication and service and wish him all the best.
Let me now review some business highlights from the third quarter, beginning with Global Lifestyle.
We are pleased by continued sales momentum in our lifestyle businesses as we further leverage our deep capabilities globally. During the quarter, we launched a new mobile device protection program with KDDI, the second largest mobile carrier in Japan with more than 49 million subscribers. This relationship strengthens our presence in this critical postpaid mobile market. New relationships like this, along with the planned acquisition of The Warranty Group, will help advance our position as a leading provider in the global lifestyle market with an attractive product and client portfolio, diversified growth profile and deeper global footprint.
Now let's look at Global Housing. In our multi-family housing business, revenue growth was strong, reflecting continued expansion within our affinity partners and property management companies in the U.S. We also recently signed an agreement with a leading e-commerce client to provide our insurance offering for small parcel shipments in the U.S. and Europe. This builds on our acquisition of Shipsurance in early 2016, and we are excited to expand our book of business with this important client. Growth in multi-family housing partially offset declines in lender-placed and in mortgage solutions, where we continue to see soft market conditions in field services and the valuations business. We have implemented various expense-management efforts across Global Housing to help temper declines.
Now let's review our performance to-date against the key financial measures we use to track our progress: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of such events.
Through the first 9 months of this year, our net operating income was up modestly in comparison to the same period last year, as the increased contribution from Connected Living and a lower loss at Corporate more than offset the continued normalization of lender-placed. Operating earnings per share increased 15% to $5.64, driven by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE excluding AOCI was 10.7%, level with the full year 2016. As of the end of September, our holding company capital totaled $570 million, with $320 million available for deployment.
Over the last 7 quarters, we've returned over $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 90% of our stated commitment. We expect to return the remaining $160 million through buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to 2018, we'll be focused on delivering profitable growth and the successful integration of The Warranty Group. 
From a capital management perspective, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend, as we have every year since our IPO, subject as always to board approval. In addition, we expect share repurchases will continue, albeit at a more moderate pace than in recent years as we set aside the funds needed to complete our acquisition of Iké, an assistance company in Latin America where we currently have a 40% ownership stake.
Overall, we believe our attractive business portfolio, innovative offerings and strong client partnerships will deliver greater and more diversified earnings. This should result in strong cash flow generation and allow for greater flexibility in capital deployment over time.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our third quarter results in greater detail. Richard?"
4026111,540083833,1333415,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2017",2017-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Alan. And good morning.Let's start with a look at Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $110 million driven by $187 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Ma",1358,"Thank you, Alan. And good morning.
Let's start with a look at Global Housing. The segment reported a net operating loss of $110 million driven by $187 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria; as well as the Mexico City earthquake. This compares to $33 million of catastrophe losses in the third quarter of last year. The ongoing lender-placed normalization also drove the decline and was partially offset by $5 million of income from a real estate joint venture partnership.
Looking at our key metrics. The combined ratio for our Global Housing risk-based businesses increased to 155%, reflecting catastrophes in the quarter. Excluding the losses and reinstatement premiums, the combined ratio was 81%, roughly in line with the prior year period. Declining lender-placed premiums were offset by lower expenses to support the business. Pretax margin for our fee-based, capital-light businesses decreased to 9%. This represents a 70 basis point decline from the prior year period. This was mainly from $7 million of catastrophe losses and higher noncatastrophe losses within our multi-family housing business. Mortgage solutions results improved modestly due to prior expense actions but remained soft overall given the continued weak market demand for originations and field services. While we continue to manage our expense base, we expect the margin pressure to persist as we exit 2017.
Turning to revenue. Third quarter net earned premiums and fees in Global Housing decreased 8%. This was primarily due to a 31 basis point year-over-year decline in the placement rate; and additional reinsurance premiums, largely for reinstatements. Growth in multi-family housing and premiums for new lender-placed clients partially offset the decline. The placement rate in the quarter was impacted by macro trends in client mix, including a higher concentration of loans with lower-than-average placement rates. With these loans now fully onboarded, we expect the placement rate decline to moderate in the fourth quarter and into 2018.
Moving to our fee-based, capital-light businesses. Multi-family housing revenue increased 14% during the third quarter. This reflects growth in renters' policies sold through our affinity and PMC channels. In mortgage solutions, fee income was down 24% year-over-year and down 3% from second quarter 2017, primarily related to weaker market demand and lower client volume for origination and field services.
Consistent with our outlook for full year 2017, we anticipate continued declines in Global Housing net earned premiums and earnings, excluding catastrophe losses. This is due to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed and continued weak performance in mortgage solutions. While the Atlantic hurricane season officially ends later this month, we expect the losses from the California wildfires to be a reportable catastrophe event in the fourth quarter. We continue to monitor claims development and expect losses could be $6 million to $8 million pretax.
Now let's move to Global Lifestyle. This segment recorded $43 million of net operating income, an increase of $14 million from the prior period. This was driven by a onetime $10 million tax benefit, growth in our mobile business and additional joint venture real estate partnership income. This was partially offset by $5 million in losses, primarily in our vehicle protection business, from flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. Revenue for the segment overall decreased entirely due to a $139 million reduction in net earned premiums associated with the previously mentioned change in the client program structure. The change implemented late last year extended our relationship with the client and had no impact on economics. Excluding this change, revenues for Global Lifestyle were up $53 million or 7%, driven by growth in mobile globally, vehicle protection and our Canadian credit business. This was partially offset by the declines from legacy retail clients.
Fee income within Global Lifestyle specifically was up 11%, driven by growth in new mobile programs and subscribers. In the quarter, however, we saw lower-than-expected volumes of trade-in activity following the staggered introduction of new smartphone devices. Given the anticipated availability of these new devices, we expect trade-in volumes in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter, with a more meaningful increase in early 2018. The vehicle protection business generated 7% growth in revenue year-over-year, as strong sales growth from prior year periods begins to earn. Our strong returns and expanded profitability in this business over the last several years has been supported by a comprehensive product and service offering as well as broad distribution. Our alignment with key TPAs and OEMs in North America and other selected countries in Latin America have also contributed to our success.
Looking at the key performance metrics for this segment. The combined ratio for the risk-based businesses, which includes vehicle protection and credit insurance, rose by 130 basis points to 99%. This was primarily driven by vehicle protection losses from Harvey. Absent this, combined ratio was 96.6%, well within our targeted range of 96% to 98%. The pretax margin for our fee-based Connected Living business rose to 3.8%, up 1.2 percentage points from last year. Approximately 70 basis points was related to the change in the program structure referenced earlier. The balance was due to growth in mobile programs and subscribers, partially offset by lower service contract results and additional expenses to support new business.
Turning to our Global Lifestyle outlook for the full year 2017. While mobile trade-in volumes in the fourth quarter may be lower than originally anticipated, we continue to expect 2017 segment earnings to meaningfully increase year-over-year. We also believe that we will be well positioned to drive sustained growth in 2018.
Now let's review results in Global pre-need. Earnings decreased $2 million to $12 million, primarily reflecting real estate joint venture partnership income in the prior period. Otherwise, results were flat. While assets continued to grow, yields remained pressured in a low-interest rate environment. Total revenue for preneed increased by 3%, driven largely by growth with our U.S. and Canadian business, including our final need products. New face sales this quarter decreased by 8% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes. This was in key markets like Texas and Florida, the areas hit hardest by the hurricane activity. While disappointing, we do not expect lower sales will impact our ability to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Moving to Corporate. Net operating loss decreased by $4 million to $13 million. Lower expenses and a reduction in taxes drove the decline. We expect the lower taxes in third quarter to reverse in the fourth quarter. We also expect Corporate's fourth quarter results to include an increase in expenses driven by additional third-party consulting spend and technology and other expenses as we continue to align our operating model. As such, we now estimate our Corporate net operating loss for this year to be within the $55 million to $60 million range compared to $71 million in 2016.
Moving on to Corporate. We ended the quarter with approximately $320 million in deployable capital. Because of the significant level of catastrophes, we only received $4 million in dividends from Global Housing, Lifestyle and pre-need in the third quarter. We upstreamed $38 million from health and employee benefits or $124 million year-to-date. This is well ahead of our initial fee -- full year estimate of $100 million. We continue to expect dividends from operating segments to roughly approximate segment earnings for the full year.
During the third quarter, we returned $63 million to shareholders, with $34 million returned via share buybacks and the remaining $29 million through common stock dividends. Buybacks through September were lower due to cat activity and the pending announcement of The Warranty Group acquisition.
To summarize. We continued to make good progress in the third quarter, and we delivered solid results. We are developing a comprehensive integration plan for our acquisition of The Warranty Group to ensure we operate as one company day 1. We also are beginning to prepare our S-4 filing including pro forma financials, which we expect to be filed by year-end. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering on our commitments to our shareholders for the full year and on driving profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.
