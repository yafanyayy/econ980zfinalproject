Today, we'll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call as well as [ph] on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events & Presentations section of our QuintilesIMS Investor Relations website at ir.quintilesims.com.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on November 3, 2016, and subsequent SEC filings.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange, and therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currencies to improve comparability.
I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib."

This is our first call reporting earnings for the combined company. And on this call, we will provide results for 2016 as well as guidance for 2017. 
The fourth quarter was very active for the QuintilesIMS team. We delivered on our financial commitments through solid operational discipline; our integration teams continued to drive execution of their integration plans, implementing best practices and process efficiencies across the organization; changes were made to our management structure as we look to fully leverage the talent across both legacy organizations; and specifically, we began to leverage the legacy IMS operating infrastructure and implemented organizational and salesforce changes at the country level. 
We started the process of integrating data into our site identification and patient recruitment processes, and we are beginning to see great traction with clients. We also repurchased $1 billion of our stock during the quarter. And I'm pleased that our Board of Directors just approved an increase in our postmerger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with a $1.5 billion remaining authorization. 
Let's review the financial results. Year-over-year comparisons are obviously impacted by the merger. We are making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis, that is as if the merger took place January 1, 2015. Fourth quarter revenue was about $2 billion. On a combined company basis and adding back the merger-related deferred revenue adjustment we discussed last quarter, growth would have been 4.2% at constant foreign exchange rates.
The legacy IMS business grew 6.9%. The new Commercial Solutions segment also includes legacy Quintiles commercial businesses, which declined year-over-year. And so in aggregate, Commercial Solutions grew 4.9%. 
R&D Solutions growth was 6.6% and Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% during the quarter, and this is all at constant FX. Revenue growth on a reported basis was impacted by some headwinds from unfavorable currency movements during the current quarter. 
In aggregate, we lost about $10 million of revenue to our guidance of 3 months ago due to adverse effects, nearly all of which was in our Commercial Solutions segment. All in all, we performed in line with our revenue guidance at constant currency in all 3 segments. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, which was $34 million higher than our midpoint guidance 3 months ago. Adjusted EBITDA growth was 14.5%, again at constant currency in our combined company basis. Fourth quarter combined company adjusted EBITDA margin was about 27% when you exclude the deferred revenue adjustment. We have strong margin expansion of about 300 basis points, and this was primarily driven by operational improvements and good margin expansion in the commercial segment, mostly the legacy IMS commercial business, as well as operational improvements in the R&D segment, and to a lesser degree, from a favorable currency mix in the delivery costs of our CRO work. 
The Commercial Solutions segment continues to see success in the market. I'd like to give you some color and a few examples of a few recent wins.
A top 5 pharma client signed a global multiyear, multi-million dollar tech deal for our life science cloud-based master data management or MDM. The clients already uses a number of our SaaS-based apps and will benefit from our integrated suite. In this case, the win was driven by our proven track record and expertise in the MDM space, combined with our global deployment and support capabilities. 
Another win, this time with a specialty pharma company, we selected QuintilesIMS to be the single supplier supporting their entire commercial operations. This is a $16 million deal combined technology and services from our Commercial Solutions segment as well as sales rep deployment from our integrated engagement services segment. 
The R&D Solutions business saw good progress as well with a turnaround of our booking trend, which I'll remind you we now report on an as-contracted basis. We finished the year with about $9.5 billion in contracted backlog. And that is stated as at the end-of-year currency rates. And we have about $4.3 billion in LTM-contracted net new business. 
You will recall that our integration teams are working hard to drive a productionized data-enriched R&D offering, which we expect to take to clients in the second half of 2017. We have a large, full-time team working to integrate the legacy IMS data with the CRO business. But we're not waiting. We're already engaged with over 30 clients on opportunities to leverage this next generation of clinical development offering. In fact, we had already over $100 million worth of awards in the quarter for this next-gen clinical development. And we are working over $1 billion worth of opportunities where data-enabled site ID and patient recruitment can be leveraged. 
For example, in a recent such win, which was for an ophthalmology trial, we were able to use our data assets, predictive analytics capabilities and expertise with biosimilar development to identify the right size with both the appropriate patient density levels and the required investigator therapeutic expertise, in this case, intraocular injections. In the traditional approach, 3,000 potential sites would have normally been identified as having the relevant patients that would qualify for the trial. However, using our data and analytics, we were able to target and pinpoint the 261 most optimal sites from the get-go. The use of the IMS data saves considerable time and resources with the design of the trial, the identification of sites and the targeting of eligible patient populations, ultimately, help decline -- deliver the product to market faster.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."
137473239,418653028,1131236,"Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2017",2017-02-14,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. As Ari mentioned, Q4, our first quarter as a combined company, was a strong quarter for QuintilesIMS, and we hit the ground running. Let's review the details.

As Ari mentioned, Q4, our first quarter as a combined company, was a strong quarter for QuintilesIMS, and we hit the ground running. Let's review the details. 
On a reported basis, the year-over-year numbers are not meaningful as this is our first quarter as a combined company. And IMS results are not included in prior periods. I will not read them out, but they are in the tables and many of them will be in the 10-K for review. I would like to call to your attention the more meaningful comparisons in the center of the page. 
Fourth quarter revenue was just over $2 billion, an increase of 4.2% at constant currency and 3.5% reported on a combined company basis and adding back deferred revenue. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call. This noncash adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules, which at the time of the merger, requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 4.9% at constant currency and 4.2% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was dampened by a decline in the Quintiles legacy commercial business of about $12 million. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 6.9% at constant currency and 6.1% at actual foreign currency. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 6.6% at constant currency and 5.4% at actual FX rates. And Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% at constant FX and 6.7% reported.
Turning now to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, increasing 14.5% at constant FX and 16.7% of reported FX rates on a combined company basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins, when adjusting for deferred revenue, expanded about 300 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year on a combined company basis. As Ari mentioned, this strong margin expansion was primarily from operational improvements in the commercial and R&D segments as well as, to a lesser degree, from the favorable currency mix in our R&D Solutions costs.
Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter GAAP net loss was $178 million, and GAAP loss per share was $0.74. The loss was primarily due to a onetime deferred tax charge from changing our assertion regarding most of our 2016 and prior foreign earnings, whereby we will no longer permanently reinvest those earnings overseas. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, deferred taxes were reported on these earnings at the higher U.S. income tax rate. The total P&L charge, as a result of this change, was $252 million. 
It is important to note that we intend to assert that our foreign earnings after 2016 will be indefinitely reinvested overseas. Therefore, we do expect to return to normal tax levels in 2017 and subsequent years.
Adjusted net income was $266 million. You will recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was 34% for the fourth quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower and in the fourth quarter was only 4.8%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the fourth quarter using the adjusted book tax rate. 
Now let's turn to full year revenue. For the full year, once again, the reported numbers are not comparable as this is the first quarter we are reporting results as a combined company. I will not go into details on these numbers during the call. But as I mentioned previously, they're in the table. And many of them will be in the 10-K for review. 
Full year revenue increased 7.8% at constant currency and 7.4% reported on a combined basis and adjusting for deferred revenue. For our segments and on the same basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 9.1% at constant currency, 8.5% reported. The Commercial Solutions full year growth rate was also impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles commercial business. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 11.3% at constant currency and 10.5% at actual FX. R&D Solutions grew 10.6% at constant FX rates, 9.9% reported and Integrated Engagement Services declined 7.9% at constant currency, 5.8% at actual FX rates. 
Turning to R&D Solutions, net new business and backlog. You will recall that last quarter, we began reporting our net new business and backlog metrics on an as-contracted basis, meaning that we will not recognize the value of a client award until we have receipt of a written binding commitment or an executed contract. We believe this is a more conservative practice and precise approach compared to the traditional industry practice. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, R&D Solutions bookings were about $4.3 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of approximately $9.5 billion. This end-of-year backlog is stated at end-of-year exchange rates and the number, therefore, includes an adverse FX impact. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now contracted bookings were stronger this quarter than last quarter, and we are pleased with this development. I do want to remind you this is a long cycle business, and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow. This is why you should focus on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book to bill in a given quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $1.956 billion, an increase of 9.1% at constant FX and 12.6% reported on a combined company basis. 
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet.  At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion. And debt was $7.2 billion, resulting in net debt of $6 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 3.7x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 3.1x. Cash flow from operating activities was $447 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $86 million and free cash flow was $361 million for the fourth quarter. A quick update on share repurchase.
You will recall that on our last call, we announced the $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases is our preferred method of returning capital to shareholders, and we also see our shares as an attractive investment. As a result, we repurchased $1 billion of our stock, representing almost 13 million shares, which is about 5% of our shares outstanding. As Ari mentioned, our board has also approved an increase in our postmerger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with a remaining authorization of $1.5 billion.
Before we move to guidance, let's take a minute to discuss foreign currency. As you are aware and as depicted on the chart, following the end of the third quarter and the U.S. election results, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly, especially against the Japanese yen, the euro and the British pound. As a result, this impacts our full year 2017 guidance at actual FX rates, which assumes rates remain unchanged through the end of 2017. 
To help you best understand the impact of currency fluctuations on our revenue, I will provide you with a rule of thumb for hypothetical scenario where the value of the U.S. dollar changes 1% versus our entire basket of securities. Of course, we do business in over 60 currencies and not all will move in the same direction by the same amount, at the same time. Therefore, the purpose of providing this rule of thumb is not to predict exactly what will happen as currencies move, but simply to help you understand the potential impact of movements. 
Based on our current mix of currency, if the dollar changes 1% versus our basket of currencies, there would be about a $30 million impact on full year revenue. The euro would account for about $14 million of this full year revenue impact, the yen would account for approximately $6 million and all other currencies combined would account for approximately $10 million. 
Now we will attempt to mitigate the foreign currency impact on adjusted EBITDA through cost reductions and the potential to leverage favorable currency mix based upon where we perform R&D work. You should also note that our euro-denominated interest expense provides a natural hedge that reduces the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations on adjusted diluted EPS by about 1/3.
Now let's turn to guidance. Our revenue outlook for 2017, assuming FX rates held constant in 2017 versus 2016 would be $8.125 billion to $8.225 billion. The difference between where rates are today and where they were on average for 2016 results in a foreign currency headwind of approximately $125 million. Therefore, our full year 2017 revenue guidance is $8 billion to $8.1 billion, assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year. 
From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion. Research and development solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.655 billion and $3.69 billion. And integrated engagement services revenue is expected to be between $745 million and $760 million.
Similar to last quarter, this guidance again includes an estimate for deferred revenue, which is expected to reduce the Commercial Solutions segment revenue and QuintilesIMS revenue by about $7 million in the first quarter of 2017. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.40 and $4.55. For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year, adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16% and GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now remember, the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see that cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As discussed on our last call, we will also provide quarterly guidance going forward. As you know, for legacy Quintiles and legacy IMS, the first quarter is seasonally lower than other quarters so you should not expect the linear progression throughout the year. For the first quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.89 billion and $1.925 billion. From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $850 million and $865 million. Research & Development Solutions revenue is expected to be between $855 million and $870 million. And Integrated Engagement Services revenue is expected to be between $185 million and $190 million. This revenue guidance includes the expected $7 million deferred revenue adjustment I just mentioned.  For profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $450 million and $465 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.93 and $0.97. 
In summary, we had a strong quarter. We delivered solid operational and financial performance. Operational integration is moving forward as expected. We saw an uptick in our R&D booking trends. The early client success we are seeing for our next-gen clinical development is encouraging. We repurchased $1 billion of our stock under the existing $1.5 billion authorization, and our board improved -- approved an increase to this authorization by another $1 billion to a total of $2.5 billion. And we look forward to delivering another year of strong financial performance in 2017. 
With that, I would ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

We have a large full-time team with again, data scientists, [indiscernible] statisticians, [indiscernible] tech [ph] clinicians working on this. We're also leveraging our OneKey assets, which is over 15 million health care professionals around the world, a massive database which again traditionally and historically had been used by IMS to support commercial activities. And we are redirecting this significant data asset to be used in clinical trials and in site identification and the ability to convert some of those physicians into investigators for specific trials. So a lot of work is being done. And again, how we expect to see this happening in our commercial activities is we obviously want a higher win rate. That's what we're targeting. And we are trying to, as we mentioned earlier, unlock large accounts that have been previously not significant clients of the legacy Quintiles R&D business. We also, frankly, looking at the burn rate. I'm sure you've observed that the industry generally is looking -- is experiencing slower burn of their backlog. And that is due to the increased complexity of the trials and of the highly specialized nature of the drugs that are being developed and [indiscernible] patient populations and the difficulty to enroll those patients. So all of that leads to lower burn rate of the backlog, not so for us. We've thankfully not experienced that, and we believe it's because we're leveraging the data and the fact also that we now look at our backlog and our bookings on a contracted basis is much more precise. And therefore, we should see, for both reasons, the fact that we have a more precise backlog, more correct backlog, more accurate and the fact that we're leveraging our data should lead to a backlog conversion that's improving over time."

Well, historically, the R&D segment, the legacy Quintiles organization had a highly centralized account management and sales management activity. We have decided to leverage both the existing centralized account management and salesforce of Quintiles as well as the historically decentralized and close-to-the-customer approach that IMS has utilized. So we've reorganized our company to have more of a hybrid approach. Account management, obviously, for probably the top 50 clients, has to be one account management approach. And frankly, even if we did want to, our clients themselves have approached us. We have -- most of the large clients have approached us to -- we have now become one of the most significant providers to them and across a suite of offerings, from R&D to commercial. And we welcome those conversations. We have actually an account management team under Paul Spreen, who works on what we call, total cost of ownership and makes the rather compelling case to our clients that if they work with us, soup to nuts, it brings a lot of advantages. We have the scale, the level of innovation, the investments that enable them to get best-in-class offerings across the board, and certainly, at the compelling cost levels. So we're having those conversations. And for those obviously, there has to be a unified account management approach."

Let's look at least the 12 months. This is a long-term business -- long cycle business and we're in here for the long term. But certainly, what we've seen so far is very encouraging. And for smaller trials, we definitely know that we are winning because we have this data and because we'll be able to demonstrate a different approach to the client. In fact, in a couple of cases, we've sort of recovered from what we, at least, the organization has believed was a loss.

We're trying it to be more differentiated, equip our CSO salesforce with technology and so on. But boy, it's not an easy margin expansion story. And even if you do everything right, it'll be maybe 1 point or 2 better at margins. I don't see this as a big grower, topline, and I don't see this as a big contributor profit wise. Again, it requires no capital investments, but it's there. And I cited an example as my introductory remarks of a case where a smaller a specialty pharma company basically outsource their entire commercial activities with us, so including the salesforce. So here, and for the first time, we sold the full package. The full suite of data and services from the IMS legacy business and technology CRM, et cetera, plus the IES capabilities.

And as a result, you're seeing conversion that's much slower that maybe one of the explanations why the industry is experiencing a lower burn rate. The second one is, again, as I said before, the trials are more and more complex and it's more difficult to find the right patients and to enroll them. And therefore, a revenue burns at a slower rate. Now because we have converted to the contracted basis backlog measurement, we deliver 1/2 that first issue or less of it. And because we are using data to identify the optimal sites, we believe we will accelerate rather than delay backlog conversion. And therefore, we mitigate those trend. In fact, if you look at our burn rate, our burn rate essentially flat to better and our fourth quarter burn rate was actually better.

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on November 3, 2016, and subsequent SEC filings.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange, and therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currencies to improve comparability.

This is our first call reporting earnings for the combined company. And on this call, we will provide results for 2016 as well as guidance for 2017. 
The fourth quarter was very active for the QuintilesIMS team. We delivered on our financial commitments through solid operational discipline; our integration teams continued to drive execution of their integration plans, implementing best practices and process efficiencies across the organization; changes were made to our management structure as we look to fully leverage the talent across both legacy organizations; and specifically, we began to leverage the legacy IMS operating infrastructure and implemented organizational and sales force changes at the country level. 
We started the process of integrating data into our site identification and patient recruitment processes, and we are beginning to see great traction with clients. We also repurchased $1 billion of our stock during the quarter. And I'm pleased that our Board of Directors just approved an increase in our postmerger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with a $1.5 billion remaining authorization. 
Let's review the financial results. Year-over-year comparisons are obviously impacted by the merger. We are making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis, that is as if the merger took place January 1, 2015. Fourth quarter revenue was about $2 billion. On a combined company basis and adding back the merger-related deferred revenue adjustment we discussed last quarter, growth would have been 4.2% at constant foreign exchange rates.
The legacy IMS business grew 6.9%. The new Commercial Solutions segment also includes legacy Quintiles commercial businesses, which declined year-over-year. And so in aggregate, Commercial Solutions grew 4.9%. 
R&D Solutions growth was 6.6% and Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% during the quarter, and this is all at constant FX. Revenue growth on a reported basis was impacted by some headwinds from unfavorable currency movements during the current quarter. 
In aggregate, we lost about $10 million of revenue to our guidance of 3 months ago due to adverse effects, nearly all of which was in our Commercial Solutions segment. All in all, we performed in line with our revenue guidance at constant currency in all 3 segments. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, which was $34 million higher than our midpoint guidance 3 months ago. Adjusted EBITDA growth was 14.5%, again at constant currency in our combined company basis. Fourth quarter combined company adjusted EBITDA margin was about 27% when you exclude the deferred revenue adjustment. We have strong margin expansion of about 300 basis points, and this was primarily driven by operational improvements and good margin expansion in the commercial segment, mostly the legacy IMS commercial business, as well as operational improvements in the R&D segment, and to a lesser degree, from a favorable currency mix in the delivery costs of our CRO work. 
The Commercial Solutions segment continues to see success in the market. I'd like to give you some color and a few examples of a few recent wins.
A top 5 pharma client signed a global multiyear, multi-million dollar tech deal for our life science cloud-based master data management or MDM. The clients already uses a number of our SaaS-based apps and will benefit from our integrated suite. In this case, the win was driven by our proven track record and expertise in the MDM space, combined with our global deployment and support capabilities. 
Another win, this time with a specialty pharma company, we selected QuintilesIMS to be the single supplier supporting their entire commercial operations. This is a $16 million deal combined technology and services from our Commercial Solutions segment as well as sales rep deployment from our integrated engagement services segment. 
The R&D Solutions business saw good progress as well with a turnaround of our booking trend, which I'll remind you we now report on an as-contracted basis. We finished the year with about $9.5 billion in contracted backlog. And that is stated as at the end-of-year currency rates. And we have about $4.3 billion in LTM-contracted net new business. 
You will recall that our integration teams are working hard to drive a productionized data-enriched R&D offering, which we expect to take to clients in the second half of 2017. We have a large, full-time team working to integrate the legacy IMS data with the CRO business. But we're not waiting. We're already engaged with over 30 clients on opportunities to leverage this next generation of clinical development offering. In fact, we had already over $100 million worth of awards in the quarter for this next-gen clinical development. And we are working over $1 billion worth of opportunities where data-enabled site ID and patient recruitment can be leveraged. 
For example, in a recent such win, which was for an ophthalmology trial, we were able to use our data assets, predictive analytics capabilities and expertise with biosimilar development to identify the right size with both the appropriate patient density levels and the required investigator therapeutic expertise, in this case, intraocular injections. In the traditional approach, 3,000 potential sites would have normally been identified as having the relevant patients that would qualify for the trial. However, using our data and analytics, we were able to target and pinpoint the 261 most optimal sites from the get-go. The use of the IMS data saves considerable time and resources with the design of the trial, the identification of sites and the targeting of eligible patient populations, ultimately, help decline -- deliver the product to market faster.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."
137473239,418653028,1131426,"Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2017",2017-02-14,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone.

As Ari mentioned, Q4, our first quarter as a combined company, was a strong quarter for QuintilesIMS, and we hit the ground running. Let's review the details. 
On a reported basis, the year-over-year numbers are not meaningful as this is our first quarter as a combined company. And IMS results are not included in prior periods. I will not read them out, but they are in the tables and many of them will be in the 10-K for review. I would like to call to your attention the more meaningful comparisons in the center of the page. 
Fourth quarter revenue was just over $2 billion, an increase of 4.2% at constant currency and 3.5% reported on a combined company basis and adding back deferred revenue. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call. This noncash adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules, which at the time of the merger, requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 4.9% at constant currency and 4.2% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was dampened by a decline in the Quintiles legacy commercial business of about $12 million. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 6.9% at constant currency and 6.1% at actual foreign currency. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 6.6% at constant currency and 5.4% at actual FX rates. And Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% at constant FX and 6.7% reported.
Turning now to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, increasing 14.5% at constant FX and 16.7% of reported FX rates on a combined company basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins, when adjusting for deferred revenue, expanded about 300 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year on a combined company basis. As Ari mentioned, this strong margin expansion was primarily from operational improvements in the commercial and R&D segments as well as, to a lesser degree, from the favorable currency mix in our R&D Solutions costs.
Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter GAAP net loss was $178 million, and GAAP loss per share was $0.74. The loss was primarily due to a onetime deferred tax charge from changing our assertion regarding most of our 2016 and prior foreign earnings, whereby we will no longer permanently reinvest those earnings overseas. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, deferred taxes were reported on these earnings at the higher U.S. income tax rate. The total P&L charge, as a result of this change, was $252 million. 
It is important to note that we intend to assert that our foreign earnings after 2016 will be indefinitely reinvested overseas. Therefore, we do expect to return to normal tax levels in 2017 and subsequent years.
Adjusted net income was $266 million. You will recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was 34% for the fourth quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower and in the fourth quarter was only 4.8%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the fourth quarter using the adjusted book tax rate. 
Now let's turn to full year revenue. For the full year, once again, the reported numbers are not comparable as this is the first quarter we are reporting results as a combined company. I will not go into details on these numbers during the call. But as I mentioned previously, they're in the table. And many of them will be in the 10-K for review. 
Full year revenue increased 7.8% at constant currency and 7.4% reported on a combined basis and adjusting for deferred revenue. For our segments and on the same basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 9.1% at constant currency, 8.5% reported. The Commercial Solutions full year growth rate was also impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles commercial business. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 11.3% at constant currency and 10.5% at actual FX. R&D Solutions grew 10.6% at constant FX rates, 9.9% reported and Integrated Engagement Services declined 7.9% at constant currency, 5.8% at actual FX rates. 
Turning to R&D Solutions, net new business and backlog. You will recall that last quarter, we began reporting our net new business and backlog metrics on an as-contracted basis, meaning that we will not recognize the value of a client award until we have receipt of a written binding commitment or an executed contract. We believe this is a more conservative practice and precise approach compared to the traditional industry practice. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, R&D Solutions bookings were about $4.3 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of approximately $9.5 billion. This end-of-year backlog is stated at end-of-year exchange rates and the number, therefore, includes an adverse FX impact. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now contracted bookings were stronger this quarter than last quarter, and we are pleased with this development. I do want to remind you this is a long cycle business, and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow. This is why you should focus on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book to bill in a given quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $1.956 billion, an increase of 9.1% at constant FX and 12.6% reported on a combined company basis. 
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet.  At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion. And debt was $7.2 billion, resulting in net debt of $6 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 3.7x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 3.1x. Cash flow from operating activities was $447 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $86 million and free cash flow was $361 million for the fourth quarter. A quick update on share repurchase.
You will recall that on our last call, we announced the $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases is our preferred method of returning capital to shareholders, and we also see our shares as an attractive investment. As a result, we repurchased $1 billion of our stock, representing almost 13 million shares, which is about 5% of our shares outstanding. As Ari mentioned, our board has also approved an increase in our postmerger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with a remaining authorization of $1.5 billion.
Before we move to guidance, let's take a minute to discuss foreign currency. As you are aware and as depicted on the chart, following the end of the third quarter and the U.S. election results, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly, especially against the Japanese yen, the euro and the British pound. As a result, this impacts our full year 2017 guidance at actual FX rates, which assumes rates remain unchanged through the end of 2017. 
To help you best understand the impact of currency fluctuations on our revenue, I will provide you with a rule of thumb for hypothetical scenario where the value of the U.S. dollar changes 1% versus our entire basket of securities. Of course, we do business in over 60 currencies and not all will move in the same direction by the same amount, at the same time. Therefore, the purpose of providing this rule of thumb is not to predict exactly what will happen as currencies move, but simply to help you understand the potential impact of movements. 
Based on our current mix of currency, if the dollar changes 1% versus our basket of currencies, there would be about a $30 million impact on full year revenue. The euro would account for about $14 million of this full year revenue impact, the yen would account for approximately $6 million and all other currencies combined would account for approximately $10 million. 
Now we will attempt to mitigate the foreign currency impact on adjusted EBITDA through cost reductions and the potential to leverage favorable currency mix based upon where we perform R&D work. You should also note that our euro-denominated interest expense provides a natural hedge that reduces the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations on adjusted diluted EPS by about 1/3.
Now let's turn to guidance. Our revenue outlook for 2017, assuming FX rates held constant in 2017 versus 2016 would be $8.125 billion to $8.225 billion. The difference between where rates are today and where they were on average for 2016 results in a foreign currency headwind of approximately $125 million. Therefore, our full year 2017 revenue guidance is $8 billion to $8.1 billion, assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year. 
From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion. Research and development solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.655 billion and $3.69 billion. And integrated engagement services revenue is expected to be between $745 million and $760 million.
Similar to last quarter, this guidance again includes an estimate for deferred revenue, which is expected to reduce the Commercial Solutions segment revenue and QuintilesIMS revenue by about $7 million in the first quarter of 2017. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.40 and $4.55. For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year, adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16% and GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now remember, the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see that cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As discussed on our last call, we will also provide quarterly guidance going forward. As you know, for legacy Quintiles and legacy IMS, the first quarter is seasonally lower than other quarters so you should not expect the linear progression throughout the year. For the first quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.89 billion and $1.925 billion. From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $850 million and $865 million. Research & Development Solutions revenue is expected to be between $855 million and $870 million. And Integrated Engagement Services revenue is expected to be between $185 million and $190 million. This revenue guidance includes the expected $7 million deferred revenue adjustment I just mentioned.  For profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $450 million and $465 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.93 and $0.97. 
In summary, we had a strong quarter. We delivered solid operational and financial performance. Operational integration is moving forward as expected. We saw an uptick in our R&D booking trends. The early client success we are seeing for our next-gen clinical development is encouraging. We repurchased $1 billion of our stock under the existing $1.5 billion authorization, and our board improved -- approved an increase to this authorization by another $1 billion to a total of $2.5 billion. And we look forward to delivering another year of strong financial performance in 2017. 
With that, I would ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

We have a large full-time team with again, data scientists, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and clinicians working on this. We're also leveraging our OneKey assets, which is over 15 million health care professionals around the world, a massive database which again traditionally and historically had been used by IMS to support commercial activities. And we are redirecting this significant data asset to be used in clinical trials and in site identification and the ability to convert some of those physicians into investigators for specific trials. So a lot of work is being done. And again, how we expect to see this happening in our commercial activities is we obviously want a higher win rate. That's what we're targeting. And we are trying to, as we mentioned earlier, unlock large accounts that have been previously not significant clients of the legacy Quintiles R&D business. We also, frankly, looking at the burn rate. I'm sure you've observed that the industry generally is looking -- is experiencing slower burn of their backlog and that is due to the increased complexity of the trials and of the highly specialized nature of the drugs that are being developed and the narrower patient populations and the difficulty to enroll those patients. So all of that leads to lower burn rate of the backlog, not so for us. We've thankfully not experienced that, and we believe it's because we're leveraging the data and the fact also that we now look at our backlog and our bookings on a contracted basis is much more precise. And therefore, we should see, for both reasons, the fact that we have a more precise backlog, more correct backlog, more accurate and the fact that we're leveraging our data should lead to a backlog conversion that's improving over time."

We have -- most of the large clients have approached us to -- we have now become one of the most significant providers to them and across a suite of offerings, from R&D to commercial.

We're focusing intensely on our merger integration and on developing, what we believe, are compelling solutions to resolve some of the most critical issues in health care. We believe that transitioning to more data intensive, more process-focused type of approaches to clinical trial, more technology enablement is the right way to go, be less dependent on the human error and paper processing. And that's our general vision here for the merger. And we find very receptive years among our clients. Obviously, it's a long cycle business on the clinical trial side. You're going to a win rate, it's -- for smaller trials, we are able to see already better trend is hard to have enough numbers to call it a firm trend. And as I said before, this is a long cycle business. So not to get too excited about the good news in the quarter, not to be too depressed about not so good news in another quarter. Let's look at least the 12 months. This is a long-term business -- long cycle business and we're in here for the long term. But certainly, what we've seen so far is very encouraging. And for smaller trials, we definitely know that we are winning because we have this data and because we'll be able to demonstrate a different approach to the client. In fact, in a couple of cases, we've sort of recovered from what we, at least, the organization has believed was a loss. But we reintroduced a new approach, and we're able to save the day, so to speak. So we know it works. It's very compelling.

And then like, I think the case -- that was the case in 2015 where the business grew nicely and then every year, like 2016 where business was ingrained. For '17, we're not seeing any major ups or downs. We see more stability, hopefully, and it ebbs and flows with the news of pharma. And there are clients that decide that they want to internalize and some others decided they want to outsource. So it's hard to predict this business. It's not -- none of us like unpredictability. But look, it's a single-digit EBITDA business, hard to see. I'm in the margin expansion business. I don't know if I'm a carrier. So I look at this business and I keep -- I'm struggling with how do you actually grow positive in this business, and it's very hard to do that. We are going to put in place some actions to improve it. We have to -- trying to also data enable it, by the way. We're trying to be -- to make it more differentiated, equip our CSO sales force with technology and so on. But boy, it's not an easy margin expansion story. And even if you do everything right, it'll be maybe 1 point or 2 better at margins. I don't see this as a big grower, top line. And I don't see this as a big contributor profit-wise. Again, it requires no capital investments, it's there. And I cited an example in my introductory remarks of a case where a smaller -- a specialty pharma company basically outsourced their entire commercial activities with us, so including the sales force. So here and for the first time, we sold the full package. The full suite of data and services from the IMS legacy business and technology CRM, et cetera, plus the IAS capabilities. So I think, in some cases, and we have more and more demand for such kind of bundled services when a company can see this outsourcing, the entire commercial operation. Sometimes, even we are in data [ph] with larger pharma in specific geographies with Central Europe, Latin America aware. They really don't have the scale to make this a profitable business. So it can be helpful with the rest of our business."

Now because we have converted to the contracted basis backlog measurement, we believe we won't have that first issue or less of it. And because we are using data to identify the optimal sites, we believe we will accelerate rather than delay backlog conversion. And therefore, we mitigate those trends. In fact, if you look at our burn rate, our burn rate is essentially flat to better. And our fourth quarter burn rate was actually better. We do believe that it's the result of those 2 differences versus the rest of the industry. And we do expect the burn rate to accelerate over time."

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on November 3, 2016, and subsequent SEC filings.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange, and therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currency to improve comparability.

This is our first call reporting earnings for the combined company. And on this call, we will provide results for 2016 as well as guidance for 2017. 
The fourth quarter was very active for the QuintilesIMS team. We delivered on our financial commitments through solid operational discipline; our integration teams continued to drive execution of their integration plans, implementing best practices and process efficiencies across the organization; changes were made to our management structure as we look to fully leverage the talent across both legacy organizations; and specifically, we began to leverage the legacy IMS operating infrastructure and implemented organizational and sales force changes at the country level. 
We started the process of integrating data into our site identification and patient recruitment processes, and we are beginning to see great traction with clients. We also repurchased $1 billion of our stock during the quarter. And I'm pleased that our Board of Directors just approved an increase in our postmerger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with a $1.5 billion remaining authorization. 
Let's review the financial results. Year-over-year comparisons are obviously impacted by the merger. We are making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis, that is as if the merger took place January 1, 2015. Fourth quarter revenue was about $2 billion. On a combined company basis and adding back the merger-related deferred revenue adjustment we discussed last quarter, growth would have been 4.2% at constant foreign exchange rates.
The legacy IMS business grew 6.9%. The new Commercial Solutions segment also includes legacy Quintiles commercial businesses, which declined year-over-year. And so in aggregate, Commercial Solutions grew 4.9%. 
R&D Solutions growth was 6.6% and Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% during the quarter, and this is all at constant FX. Revenue growth on a reported basis was impacted by some headwind from unfavorable currency movements during the current quarter. 
In aggregate, we lost about $10 million of revenue to our guidance of 3 months ago due to adverse effects, nearly all of which was in our Commercial Solutions segment. All in all, we performed in line with our revenue guidance at constant currency in all 3 segments. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, which was $34 million higher than our midpoint guidance 3 months ago. Adjusted EBITDA growth was 14.5%, again at constant currency in our combined company basis. Fourth quarter combined company adjusted EBITDA margin was about 27% when you exclude the deferred revenue adjustment. We had strong margin expansion of about 300 basis points, and this was primarily driven by operational improvements and good margin expansion in the commercial segment, mostly the legacy IMS commercial business, as well as operational improvements in the R&D segment, and to a lesser degree, from a favorable currency mix in the delivery costs of our CRO work. 
The Commercial Solutions segment continues to see success in the market. I'd like to give you some color and a few examples of a few recent wins.
A top 5 pharma client signed a global multiyear, multi-million dollar tech deal for our life science cloud-based master data management or MDM app. The client already uses a number of our SaaS-based apps and will benefit from our integrated suite. In this case, the win was driven by our proven track record and expertise in the MDM space, combined with our global deployment and support capabilities. 
Another win, this time with a specialty pharma company, we selected QuintilesIMS to be the single supplier supporting their entire commercial operations. This is a $16 million deal combined technology and services from our Commercial Solutions segment as well as sales rep deployment from our integrated engagement services segment. 
The R&D Solutions business saw good progress as well with a turnaround of our booking trend, which I'll remind you we now report on an as-contracted basis. We finished the year with about $9.5 billion in contracted backlog. And that is stated as at the end-of-year currency rates. And we have about $4.3 billion in LTM-contracted net new business. 
You will recall that our integration teams are working hard to drive a productionized data-enriched R&D offering, which we expect to take to clients in the second half of 2017. We have a large, full-time team working to integrate the legacy IMS data with the CRO business. But we're not waiting. We're already engaged with over 30 clients on opportunities to leverage this next generation of clinical development offering. In fact, we had already over $100 million worth of awards in the quarter for this next-gen clinical development. And we are working over $1 billion worth of opportunities where data-enabled site ID and patient recruitment can be leveraged. 
For example, in a recent such win which was for an ophthalmology trial, we were able to use our data assets, predictive analytics capabilities and expertise with biosimilar development to identify the right sites with both the appropriate patient density levels and the required investigator therapeutic expertise, in this case, intraocular injections. In the traditional approach, 3,000 potential sites would have normally been identified as having the relevant patients that would qualify for the trial. However, using our data and analytics, we were able to target and pinpoint the 261 most optimal sites from the get-go. The use of the IMS data saves considerable time and resources with the design of the trial, the identification of sites and the targeting of eligible patient populations, ultimately, help decline -- deliver the product to market faster.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."
137473239,418653028,1131793,"Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2017",2017-02-14,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone.

As Ari mentioned, Q4, our first quarter as a combined company, was a strong quarter for QuintilesIMS, and we hit the ground running. Let's review the details. 
On a reported basis, the year-over-year numbers are not meaningful as this is our first quarter as a combined company. And IMS results are not included in prior periods. I will not read them out, but they are in the tables and many of them will be in the 10-K for review. I would like to call to your attention the more meaningful comparisons in the center of the page. 
Fourth quarter revenue was just over $2 billion, an increase of 4.2% at constant currency and 3.5% reported on a combined company basis and adding back deferred revenue. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call. This noncash adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules, which at the time of the merger, requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 4.9% at constant currency and 4.2% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was dampened by a decline in the Quintiles legacy commercial business of about $12 million. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 6.9% at constant currency and 6.1% at actual foreign currency. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 6.6% at constant currency and 5.4% at actual FX rates. And Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% at constant FX and 6.7% reported.
Turning now to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, increasing 14.5% at constant FX and 16.7% of reported FX rates on a combined company basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins, when adjusting for deferred revenue, expanded about 300 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year on a combined company basis. As Ari mentioned, this strong margin expansion was primarily from operational improvements in the commercial and R&D segments as well as, to a lesser degree, from the favorable currency mix in our R&D Solutions costs.
Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter GAAP net loss was $178 million, and GAAP loss per share was $0.74. The loss was primarily due to a onetime deferred tax charge from changing our assertion regarding most of our 2016 and prior foreign earnings, whereby we will no longer permanently reinvest those earnings overseas. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, deferred taxes were reported on these earnings at the higher U.S. income tax rate. The total P&L charge, as a result of this change, was $252 million. 
It is important to note that we intend to assert that our foreign earnings after 2016 will be indefinitely reinvested overseas. Therefore, we do expect to return to normal tax levels in 2017 and subsequent years.
Adjusted net income was $266 million. You will recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was 34% for the fourth quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower and in the fourth quarter was only 4.8%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the fourth quarter using the adjusted book tax rate. 
Now let's turn to full year revenue. For the full year, once again, the reported numbers are not comparable as this is the first quarter we are reporting results as a combined company. I will not go into detail on these numbers during the call, but as I mentioned previously, they're in the table and many of them will be in the 10-K for review. 
Full year revenue increased 7.8% at constant currency and 7.4% reported on a combined basis and adjusting for deferred revenue. For our segments and on the same basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 9.1% at constant currency, 8.5% reported. The Commercial Solutions full year growth rate was also impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles commercial business. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 11.3% at constant currency and 10.5% at actual FX. R&D Solutions grew 10.6% at constant FX rates, 9.9% reported and Integrated Engagement Services declined 7.9% at constant currency, 5.8% at actual FX rates. 
Turning to R&D Solutions, net new business and backlog. You will recall that last quarter, we began reporting our net new business and backlog metrics on an as-contracted basis, meaning that we will not recognize the value of a client award until we have receipt of a written binding commitment or an executed contract. We believe this is a more conservative practice and precise approach compared to the traditional industry practice. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, R&D Solutions bookings were about $4.3 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of approximately $9.5 billion. This end-of-year backlog is stated at end-of-year exchange rates and the number, therefore, includes an adverse FX impact. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now contracted bookings were stronger this quarter than last quarter, and we are pleased with this development. I do want to remind you this is a long cycle business, and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow. This is why you should focus on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book to bill in a given quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $1.956 billion, an increase of 9.1% at constant FX and 12.6% reported on a combined company basis. 
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion. And debt was $7.2 billion, resulting in net debt of $6 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 3.7x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 3.1x. Cash flow from operating activities was $447 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $86 million and free cash flow was $361 million for the fourth quarter. A quick update on share repurchase.
You will recall that on our last call, we announced the $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. Share repurchase is our preferred method of returning capital to shareholders, and we also see our shares as an attractive investment. As a result, we've repurchased $1 billion of our stock, representing almost 13 million shares, which is about 5% of our shares outstanding. As Ari mentioned, our board has also approved an increase in our postmerger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with a remaining authorization of $1.5 billion.
Before we move to guidance, let's take a minute to discuss foreign currency. As you are aware and as depicted on the chart, following the end of the third quarter and the U.S. election results, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly, especially against the Japanese yen, the euro and the British pound. As a result, this impacts our full year 2017 guidance at actual FX rates, which assumes rates remain unchanged through the end of 2017. 
To help you best understand the impact of currency fluctuations on our revenue, I will provide you with a rule of thumb for a hypothetical scenario where the value of the U.S. dollar changes 1% versus our entire basket of securities. Of course, we do business in over 60 currencies and not all will move in the same direction by the same amount, at the same time. Therefore, the purpose of providing this rule of thumb is not to predict exactly what will happen as currencies move, but simply to help you understand the potential impact of movements. 
Based on our current mix of currency, if the dollar changes 1% versus our basket of currencies, there would be about a $30 million impact on full year revenue. The euro would account for about $14 million of this full year revenue impact, the yen would account for approximately $6 million and all other currencies combined would account for approximately $10 million. 
Now we will attempt to mitigate the foreign currency impact on adjusted EBITDA through cost reductions and the potential to leverage favorable currency mix based upon where we perform R&D work. You should also note that our euro-denominated interest expense provides a natural hedge that reduces the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations on adjusted diluted EPS by about 1/3.
Now let's turn to guidance. Our revenue outlook for 2017, assuming FX rates held constant in 2017 versus 2016 would be $8.125 billion to $8.225 billion. The difference between where rates are today and where they were on average for 2016 results in a foreign currency headwind of approximately $125 million. Therefore, our full year 2017 revenue guidance is $8 billion to $8.1 billion, assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year. 
From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion. Research and development solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.655 billion and $3.69 billion. And integrated engagement services revenue is expected to be between $745 million and $760 million.
Similar to last quarter, this guidance again includes an estimate for deferred revenue, which is expected to reduce the Commercial Solutions segment revenue and QuintilesIMS revenue by about $7 million in the first quarter of 2017. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.40 and $4.55. For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year, adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16% and GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now remember, the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see the cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As discussed on our last call, we will also provide quarterly guidance going forward. As you know, for legacy Quintiles and legacy IMS, the first quarter is seasonally lower than other quarters so you should not expect the linear progression throughout the year. For the first quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.89 billion and $1.925 billion. From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $850 million and $865 million. Research & Development Solutions revenue is expected to be between $855 million and $870 million. And Integrated Engagement Services revenue is expected to be between $185 million and $190 million. This revenue guidance includes the expected $7 million deferred revenue adjustment I just mentioned. For profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $450 million and $465 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.93 and $0.97. 
In summary, we had a strong quarter. We delivered solid operational and financial performance. Operational integration is moving forward as expected. We saw an uptick in our R&D booking trends. The early client success we are seeing for our next-gen clinical development is encouraging. We repurchased $1 billion of our stock under the existing $1.5 billion authorization, and our board improved -- approved an increase to this authorization by another $1 billion to a total of $2.5 billion. And we look forward to delivering another year of strong financial performance in 2017. 
With that, I would ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

So there's a lot of work by our data scientists that is being done at the moment focusing on the top most significant 15 therapeutic categories. So that's going well. And we have a large full-time team with, again, data scientists, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and clinicians working on this. We're also leveraging our OneKey assets, which is over 15 million health care professionals around the world, a massive database which again traditionally and historically had been used by IMS to support commercial activities. And we are redirecting this significant data asset to be used in clinical trials and in site identification and the ability to convert some of those physicians into investigators for specific trials. So a lot of work is being done. And again, how we expect to see this happening in our commercial activities is we obviously want a higher win rate. That's what we're targeting. And we are trying to, as we mentioned earlier, unlock large accounts that have been previously not significant clients of the legacy Quintiles R&D business. We also, frankly, looking at the burn rate. I'm sure you've observed that the industry generally is looking -- is experiencing slower burn of their backlog and that is due to the increased complexity of the trials and of the highly specialized nature of the drugs that are being developed and the narrower patient populations and the difficulty to enroll those patients. So all of that leads to lower burn rate of the backlog, not so for us. We've thankfully not experienced that, and we believe it's because we're leveraging the data and the fact also that we now look at our backlog and our bookings on a contracted basis is much more precise.

We're focusing intensely on our merger integration and on developing what we believe are compelling solutions to resolve some of the most critical issues in health care. We believe that transitioning to more data intensive, more process-focused type of approaches to clinical trial, more technology enablement, is the right way to go, be less dependent on the human error and paper processing. And that's our general vision here for the merger. And we find very receptive years among our clients. Obviously, it's a long cycle business on the clinical trial side. You're going to a win rate, it's -- for smaller trials, we are able to see, already, better trend is hard to have enough numbers to call it a firm trend. And as I said before, this is a long cycle business. So not to get too excited about the good news in the quarter, nor to be too depressed about not so good news in another quarter. Let's look at least the 12 months. This is a long-term business -- long cycle business and we're in here for the long term. But certainly, what we've seen so far is very encouraging. And for smaller trials, we definitely know that we are winning because we have this data and because we'll be able to demonstrate a different approach to the client. In fact, in a couple of cases, we've sort of recovered from what we -- what, at least, the organization has believed was a loss. But we reintroduced a new approach, and we're able to save the day, so to speak. So we know it works. It's very compelling.

And then like, I think the case -- that was the case in 2015 where the business grew nicely and then you have a year like 2016 where business wasn't great. For '17, we're not seeing any major ups or downs. We see more stability, hopefully, and it ebbs and flows with the news of pharma. And there are clients that decide that they want to internalize and some others decided they want to outsource. So it's hard to predict this business. It's not -- none of us likes unpredictability. But look, it's a single-digit EBITDA business, hard to see. I'm in the margin expansion business, I've been all my career. So I look at this business and I keep -- I'm struggling with how do you actually grow margins in this business, and it's very hard to do that. We are going to put in place some actions to improve it. We have to -- trying to also data enable it, by the way. We're trying to be -- to make it more differentiated, equip our CSO sales force with technology and so on. But boy, it's not an easy margin expansion story. And even if you do everything right, it'll be maybe 1 point or 2 better of margins. I don't see this as a big grower, top line. And I don't see this as a big contributor profit-wise. Again, it requires no capital investments, it's there. And I cited an example in my introductory remarks of a case where a smaller specialty pharma company basically outsourced their entire commercial activities with us, so including the sales force. So here it's for the first time, we sold the full package. The full suite of data and services from the IMS legacy business and technology CRM, et cetera, plus the IAS capabilities. So I think, in some cases, and we have more and more demand for such kind of bundled services when a company considers outsourcing their entire commercial operation. Sometimes, even we are in data with larger pharma in specific geographies with Central Europe, Latin America, where they really don't have the scale to make this a profitable business. So it can be helpful with the rest of our business."

With respect to the $1.5 billion additional, a remaining authorization, we are looking at several scenarios now on how to execute that. And in the normal course of events, we can simply continue to repurchase in the market. We also have large sponsors still. We know many investors complained to us when we meet with them about the, what they call, the hangover. And so that, over time, obviously, that should disappear. And so we might take advantage of this repurchase to reduce that hangover as well. But again, we are committed certainly, by the end of the year, to do the balance of the $1.5 billion to another $500 million. And obviously, the earlier we can do -- we can execute this repurchase, the better."

But look, I think that -- 2 things: One, we changed how we look at our backlog in terms of our -- we focused on contracted. Again, we believe that the traditional approach in the industry was not conservative enough. And a lot of the awards there that may or may not have -- maybe should or should not be in the backlog. And as a result, you'll see a conversion that's much slower, that may be one of the explanations why the industry is experiencing a lower burn rate. The second one is, again, as I said before, the trials are more and more complex. And it's more difficult to find the right patients and to enroll them, and therefore, revenue burns at a slower rate. Now because we have converted to the contracted basis backlog measurement, we believe we won't have that first issue or less of it. And because we are using data to identify the optimal sites, we believe we will accelerate rather than delay backlog conversion. And therefore, we mitigate those trends. In fact, if you look at our burn rate, our burn rate is essentially flat to better. And our fourth quarter burn rate was actually better. We do believe that it's the result of those 2 differences versus the rest of the industry. And we do expect the burn rate to accelerate over time."

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements.

In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange, and therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currency to improve comparability.

This is our first call reporting earnings for the combined company. And on this call, we will provide results for 2016 as well as guidance for 2017. 
The fourth quarter was very active for the QuintilesIMS team. We delivered on our financial commitments through solid operational discipline; our integration teams continued to drive execution of their integration plans, implementing best practices and process efficiencies across the organization; changes were made to our management structure as we look to fully leverage the talent across both legacy organizations; and specifically, we began to leverage the legacy IMS operating infrastructure and implemented organizational and sales force changes at the country level. 
We started the process of integrating data into our site identification and patient recruitment processes, and we are beginning to see great traction with clients. We also repurchased $1 billion of our stock during the quarter. And I'm pleased that our Board of Directors just approved an increase in our postmerger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with a $1.5 billion remaining authorization. 
Let's review the financial results. Year-over-year comparisons are obviously impacted by the merger. We are making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis, that is as if the merger took place January 1, 2015. Fourth quarter revenue was about $2 billion. On a combined company basis and adding back the merger-related deferred revenue adjustment we discussed last quarter, growth would have been 4.2% at constant foreign exchange rates.
The legacy IMS business grew 6.9%. The new Commercial Solutions segment also includes legacy Quintiles commercial businesses, which declined year-over-year. And so in aggregate, Commercial Solutions grew 4.9%. 
R&D Solutions growth was 6.6% and Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% during the quarter, and this is all at constant FX. Revenue growth on a reported basis was impacted by some headwind from unfavorable currency movements during the current quarter. 
In aggregate, we lost about $10 million of revenue to our guidance of 3 months ago due to adverse effects, nearly all of which was in our Commercial Solutions segment. All in all, we performed in line with our revenue guidance at constant currency in all 3 segments. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, which was $34 million higher than our midpoint guidance 3 months ago. Adjusted EBITDA growth was 14.5%, again at constant currency in our combined company basis. Fourth quarter combined company adjusted EBITDA margin was about 27% when you exclude the deferred revenue adjustment. We had strong margin expansion of about 300 basis points, and this was primarily driven by operational improvements and good margin expansion in the commercial segment, mostly the legacy IMS commercial business, as well as operational improvements in the R&D segment, and to a lesser degree, from a favorable currency mix in the delivery costs of our CRO work. 
The Commercial Solutions segment continues to see success in the market. I'd like to give you some color and a few examples of a few recent wins.
A top 5 pharma client signed a global multiyear, multi-million dollar tech deal for our life science cloud-based master data management or MDM app. The client already uses a number of our SaaS-based apps and will benefit from our integrated suite. In this case, the win was driven by our proven track record and expertise in the MDM space, combined with our global deployment and support capabilities. 
Another win, this time with a specialty pharma company, we selected QuintilesIMS to be the single supplier supporting their entire commercial operations. This is a $16 million deal combined technology and services from our Commercial Solutions segment as well as sales rep deployment from our integrated engagement services segment. 
The R&D Solutions business saw good progress as well with a turnaround of our booking trend, which I'll remind you we now report on an as-contracted basis. We finished the year with about $9.5 billion in contracted backlog. And that is stated as at the end-of-year currency rates. And we have about $4.3 billion in LTM-contracted net new business. 
You will recall that our integration teams are working hard to drive a productionized data-enriched R&D offering, which we expect to take to clients in the second half of 2017. We have a large, full-time team working to integrate the legacy IMS data with the CRO business. But we're not waiting. We're already engaged with over 30 clients on opportunities to leverage this next generation of clinical development offering. In fact, we had already over $100 million worth of awards in the quarter for this next-gen clinical development. And we are working over $1 billion worth of opportunities where data-enabled site ID and patient recruitment can be leveraged. 
For example, in a recent such win which was for an ophthalmology trial, we were able to use our data assets, predictive analytics capabilities and expertise with biosimilar development to identify the right sites with both the appropriate patient density levels and the required investigator therapeutic expertise, in this case, intraocular injections. In the traditional approach, 3,000 potential sites would have normally been identified as having the relevant patients that would qualify for the trial. However, using our data and analytics, we were able to target and pinpoint the 261 most optimal sites from the get-go. The use of the IMS data saves considerable time and resources with the design of the trial, the identification of sites and the targeting of eligible patient populations, ultimately, help decline -- deliver the product to market faster.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."
137473239,418653028,1132070,"Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 14, 2017",2017-02-14,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone.

As Ari mentioned, Q4, our first quarter as a combined company, was a strong quarter for QuintilesIMS, and we hit the ground running. Let's review the details. 
On a reported basis, the year-over-year numbers are not meaningful as this is our first quarter as a combined company. And IMS results are not included in prior periods. I will not read them out, but they are in the tables and many of them will be in the 10-K for review. I would like to call to your attention the more meaningful comparisons in the center of the page. 
Fourth quarter revenue was just over $2 billion, an increase of 4.2% at constant currency and 3.5% reported on a combined company basis and adding back deferred revenue. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call. This noncash adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules, which at the time of the merger, requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the fourth quarter. 
Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 4.9% at constant currency and 4.2% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was dampened by a decline in the Quintiles legacy commercial business of about $12 million. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 6.9% at constant currency and 6.1% at actual foreign currency. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 6.6% at constant currency and 5.4% at actual FX rates. And Integrated Engagement Services declined 8.4% at constant FX and 6.7% reported.
Turning now to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $541 million, increasing 14.5% at constant FX and 16.7% of reported FX rates on a combined company basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins, when adjusting for deferred revenue, expanded about 300 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year on a combined company basis. As Ari mentioned, this strong margin expansion was primarily from operational improvements in the commercial and R&D segments as well as, to a lesser degree, from the favorable currency mix in our R&D Solutions costs.
Moving down the P&L. Fourth quarter GAAP net loss was $178 million, and GAAP loss per share was $0.74. The loss was primarily due to a onetime deferred tax charge from changing our assertion regarding most of our 2016 and prior foreign earnings, whereby we will no longer permanently reinvest those earnings overseas. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, deferred taxes were reported on these earnings at the higher U.S. income tax rate. The total P&L charge, as a result of this change, was $252 million. 
It is important to note that we intend to assert that our foreign earnings after 2016 will be indefinitely reinvested overseas. Therefore, we do expect to return to normal tax levels in 2017 and subsequent years.
Adjusted net income was $266 million. You will recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was 34% for the fourth quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower and in the fourth quarter was only 4.8%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the fourth quarter using the adjusted book tax rate. 
Now let's turn to full year revenue. For the full year, once again, the reported numbers are not comparable as this is the first quarter we are reporting results as a combined company. I will not go into detail on these numbers during the call, but as I mentioned previously, they're in the table and many of them will be in the 10-K for review. 
Full year revenue increased 7.8% at constant currency and 7.4% reported on a combined basis and adjusting for deferred revenue. For our segments and on the same basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 9.1% at constant currency, 8.5% reported. The Commercial Solutions full year growth rate was also impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles commercial business. Excluding this drag, legacy IMS Commercial Solutions grew 11.3% at constant currency and 10.5% at actual FX. R&D Solutions grew 10.6% at constant FX rates, 9.9% reported and Integrated Engagement Services declined 7.9% at constant currency, 5.8% at actual FX rates. 
Turning to R&D Solutions, net new business and backlog. You will recall that last quarter, we began reporting our net new business and backlog metrics on an as-contracted basis, meaning that we will not recognize the value of a client award until we have receipt of a written binding commitment or an executed contract. We believe this is a more conservative practice and precise approach compared to the traditional industry practice. 
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, R&D Solutions bookings were about $4.3 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of approximately $9.5 billion. This end-of-year backlog is stated at end-of-year exchange rates and the number, therefore, includes an adverse FX impact. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now contracted bookings were stronger this quarter than last quarter, and we are pleased with this development. I do want to remind you this is a long cycle business, and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow. This is why you should focus on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book to bill in a given quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $1.956 billion, an increase of 9.1% at constant FX and 12.6% reported on a combined company basis. 
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion. And debt was $7.2 billion, resulting in net debt of $6 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 3.7x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 3.1x. Cash flow from operating activities was $447 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $86 million and free cash flow was $361 million for the fourth quarter. A quick update on share repurchase.
You will recall that on our last call, we announced the $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. Share repurchase is our preferred method of returning capital to shareholders, and we also see our shares as an attractive investment. As a result, we've repurchased $1 billion of our stock, representing almost 13 million shares, which is about 5% of our shares outstanding. As Ari mentioned, our board has also approved an increase in our postmerger share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, leaving us with a remaining authorization of $1.5 billion.
Before we move to guidance, let's take a minute to discuss foreign currency. As you are aware and as depicted on the chart, following the end of the third quarter and the U.S. election results, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly, especially against the Japanese yen, the euro and the British pound. As a result, this impacts our full year 2017 guidance at actual FX rates, which assumes rates remain unchanged through the end of 2017. 
To help you best understand the impact of currency fluctuations on our revenue, I will provide you with a rule of thumb for a hypothetical scenario where the value of the U.S. dollar changes 1% versus our entire basket of securities. Of course, we do business in over 60 currencies and not all will move in the same direction by the same amount, at the same time. Therefore, the purpose of providing this rule of thumb is not to predict exactly what will happen as currencies move, but simply to help you understand the potential impact of movements. 
Based on our current mix of currency, if the dollar changes 1% versus our basket of currencies, there would be about a $30 million impact on full year revenue. The euro would account for about $14 million of this full year revenue impact, the yen would account for approximately $6 million and all other currencies combined would account for approximately $10 million. 
Now we will attempt to mitigate the foreign currency impact on adjusted EBITDA through cost reductions and the potential to leverage favorable currency mix based upon where we perform R&D work. You should also note that our euro-denominated interest expense provides a natural hedge that reduces the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations on adjusted diluted EPS by about 1/3.
Now let's turn to guidance. Our revenue outlook for 2017, assuming FX rates held constant in 2017 versus 2016 would be $8.125 billion to $8.225 billion. The difference between where rates are today and where they were on average for 2016 results in a foreign currency headwind of approximately $125 million. Therefore, our full year 2017 revenue guidance is $8 billion to $8.1 billion, assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year. 
From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion. Research and development solutions revenue is expected to be between $3.655 billion and $3.69 billion. And integrated engagement services revenue is expected to be between $745 million and $760 million.
Similar to last quarter, this guidance again includes an estimate for deferred revenue, which is expected to reduce the Commercial Solutions segment revenue and QuintilesIMS revenue by about $7 million in the first quarter of 2017. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.40 and $4.55. For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year, adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16% and GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now remember, the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see the cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As discussed on our last call, we will also provide quarterly guidance going forward. As you know, for legacy Quintiles and legacy IMS, the first quarter is seasonally lower than other quarters so you should not expect the linear progression throughout the year. For the first quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.89 billion and $1.925 billion. From a segment perspective, Commercial Solutions revenue is expected to be between $850 million and $865 million. Research & Development Solutions revenue is expected to be between $855 million and $870 million. And Integrated Engagement Services revenue is expected to be between $185 million and $190 million. This revenue guidance includes the expected $7 million deferred revenue adjustment I just mentioned. For profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $450 million and $465 million, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.93 and $0.97. 
In summary, we had a strong quarter. We delivered solid operational and financial performance. Operational integration is moving forward as expected. We saw an uptick in our R&D booking trends. The early client success we are seeing for our next-gen clinical development is encouraging. We repurchased $1 billion of our stock under the existing $1.5 billion authorization, and our board improved -- approved an increase to this authorization by another $1 billion to a total of $2.5 billion. And we look forward to delivering another year of strong financial performance in 2017. 
With that, I would ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

So there's a lot of work by our data scientists that is being done at the moment focusing on the top most significant 15 therapeutic categories. So that's going well. And we have a large full-time team with, again, data scientists, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and clinicians working on this. We're also leveraging our OneKey assets, which is over 15 million health care professionals around the world, a massive database which again traditionally and historically had been used by IMS to support commercial activities. And we are redirecting this significant data asset to be used in clinical trials and in site identification and the ability to convert some of those physicians into investigators for specific trials. So a lot of work is being done. And again, how we expect to see this happening in our commercial activities is we obviously want a higher win rate. That's what we're targeting. And we are trying to, as we mentioned earlier, unlock large accounts that have been previously not significant clients of the legacy Quintiles R&D business. We also, frankly, looking at the burn rate. I'm sure you've observed that the industry generally is looking -- is experiencing slower burn of their backlog and that is due to the increased complexity of the trials and of the highly specialized nature of the drugs that are being developed and the narrower patient populations and the difficulty to enroll those patients. So all of that leads to lower burn rate of the backlog, not so for us. We've thankfully not experienced that, and we believe it's because we're leveraging the data and the fact also that we now look at our backlog and our bookings on a contracted basis is much more precise. And therefore, we should see, for both reasons, the fact that we have a more precise backlog, more correct backlog, more accurate, and the fact that we're leveraging our data should lead to a backlog conversion that's improving over time."

We're focusing intensely on our merger integration and on developing what we believe are compelling solutions to resolve some of the most critical issues in health care. We believe that transitioning to more data intensive, more process-focused type of approaches to clinical trial, more technology enablement, is the right way to go, be less dependent on the human error and paper processing. And that's our general vision here for the merger. And we find very receptive years among our clients. Obviously, it's a long cycle business on the clinical trial side. You're going to a win rate, it's -- for smaller trials, we are able to see, already, better trend is hard to have enough numbers to call it a firm trend. And as I said before, this is a long cycle business. So not to get too excited about the good news in the quarter, nor to be too depressed about not so good news in another quarter. Let's look at least the 12 months. This is a long-term business -- long cycle business and we're in here for the long term. But certainly, what we've seen so far is very encouraging. And for smaller trials, we definitely know that we are winning because we have this data and because we'll be able to demonstrate a different approach to the client. In fact, in a couple of cases, we've sort of recovered from what we -- what, at least, the organization has believed was a loss. But we reintroduced a new approach, and we're able to save the day, so to speak. So we know it works. It's very compelling.

So a lot of restructuring driven by the merger, a lot of reorganization and project costs that are included there.

And then like, I think the case -- that was the case in 2015 where the business grew nicely and then you have a year like 2016 where business wasn't great. For '17, we're not seeing any major ups or downs. We see more stability, hopefully, and it ebbs and flows with the news of pharma. And there are clients that decide that they want to internalize and some others decided they want to outsource. So it's hard to predict this business. It's not -- none of us likes unpredictability. But look, it's a single-digit EBITDA business, hard to see. I'm in the margin expansion business, I've been all my career. So I look at this business and I keep -- I'm struggling with how do you actually grow margins in this business, and it's very hard to do that. We are going to put in place some actions to improve it. We have to -- trying to also data enable it, by the way. We're trying to be -- to make it more differentiated, equip our CSO sales force with technology and so on. But boy, it's not an easy margin expansion story. And even if you do everything right, it'll be maybe 1 point or 2 better of margins. I don't see this as a big grower, top line. And I don't see this as a big contributor profit-wise. Again, it requires no capital investments, it's there. And I cited an example in my introductory remarks of a case where a smaller specialty pharma company basically outsourced their entire commercial activities with us, so including the sales force. So here it's for the first time, we sold the full package. The full suite of data and services from the IMS legacy business and technology CRM, et cetera, plus the IAS capabilities. So I think, in some cases, and we have more and more demand for such kind of bundled services when a company considers outsourcing their entire commercial operation. Sometimes, even we are in data with larger pharma in specific geographies with Central Europe, Latin America, where they really don't have the scale to make this a profitable business. So it can be helpful with the rest of our business."

And so we might take advantage of this repurchase to reduce that hangover as well.

Again, we believe that the traditional approach in the industry was not conservative enough. And a lot of the awards there that may or may not have -- maybe should or should not be in the backlog. And as a result, you'll see a conversion that's much slower, that may be one of the explanations why the industry is experiencing a lower burn rate. The second one is, again, as I said before, the trials are more and more complex. And it's more difficult to find the right patients and to enroll them, and therefore, revenue burns at a slower rate. Now because we have converted to the contracted basis backlog measurement, we believe we won't have that first issue or less of it. And because we are using data to identify the optimal sites, we believe we will accelerate rather than delay backlog conversion. And therefore, we mitigate those trends. In fact, if you look at our burn rate, our burn rate is essentially flat to better. And our fourth quarter burn rate was actually better. We do believe that it's the result of those 2 differences versus the rest of the industry. And we do expect the burn rate to accelerate over time."

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on February 16, 2017 and subsequent SEC filings.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.

We are pleased Q1 results came in, in line or better than what we told you to expect. Let's have a quick review of the numbers. 
Consistent with last quarter, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger have taken place January 1, 2016. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion and grew 3.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions growth was 4.3% at constant currency and R&D Solutions revenue was negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed the facility in London last year. Excluding these early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been about 5.5%. Commercial Solutions grew 2.5%, 2.4% to be precise, at constant currency. Growth in Commercial Solutions was negatively impacted by the poor performance of the legacy Quintiles Encore business, which itself declined more than 50% year-over-year. Excluding Encore, the commercial business would have grown 4%. 
Integrated Engagement Services, as expected, was slightly down. Acquisitions contributed 1 point of revenue growth, and that was even evenly split between R&D and Commercial Solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, which is higher than our guidance range and about $10 million above the midpoint of the range. This beat was entirely driven by stronger operating performance. 
Let me provide some color on a few key wins in the quarter. Let's start with the real-world insight business. The real-world team won a $15 million deal for 2 neurology studies with the top 5 pharma client. Our global data, advanced analytics and deep therapeutic expertise in neurology set us apart from the competition. The client saw a huge benefit in using retrospective data to accelerate site identification and patient recruitment for these prospective studies in both the U.S. and Europe. 
Another top 5 pharma client signed a $12.5 million real world deal based on our unique capability to lean diagnostic data, prescription data and demographic data to support a Phase 4 interventional diabetes study. 
Turning to our R&D Solutions business. We saw continued improvements in our as-contracted bookings trend. At the end of the quarter, we have a contracted backlog of more than $9.6 billion. Now I've never done this, but I'm going to go off script, guys, over here. 
I read -- I was just reading before the call started a few of the initial notes that some of the analysts wrote. And I still see that people are still trying to calculate quarterly book-to-bill number even though we tried to tell you before that it is not a meaningful indicator of how we are doing. But because those calculations are all over the place, I just want to tell you that if you do the math and really, it is 3 elementary computations based on the numbers we reported, if you do the math, it is just below your magic number of 1.2 book-to-bill. Again, on a contracted basis for the quarter. 
We've said over and over, we're not going to do it, but I can't help myself. It is actually an improving booking trend that we have observed over the quarter. And again, I'm departing from script. If you were to do the same math on an awarded basis and we don't have the number because we don't post award anymore, we report contracts. On an award basis, that book-to-bill ratio for the quarter would have been materially higher than that ""magic number of 1.2."".
Now back to the script. I know people are screaming at me here, but I couldn't help myself. We are actually very encouraged by the early demand we are seeing for our next-gen clinical development offerings. Last quarter, I told you we had won over $100 million of business with next-gen since the merger closed. We now stand at more than $400 million of awards, not all of which has contracted, tied directly to the application of next-gen of clinical development within clinical trials. The 5 key strengthening, and our team is currently engaged in more than 80 next-gen projects. 
Recent examples of such wins include: For a large pharma client, we competed against 14 other CROs and we're selected for a preferred partnership based on our unique ability to improve study design, site ID and patient recruitment globally. The clients cite specifically our next-gen offering as a clear differentiator. We have another very significant when with a top 5 pharma client, European pharma client, who has awarded virtually no full-service clinical business to us over the past 6 years. This was a fixed-price award for more than $120 million. In lending this win, a key differentiator was our ability to quickly validate internal historic site performance data with real-world insights. The study has now kicked off. And from the get-go, we were able to demonstrate higher operational performance. The time from contract to first site selection visit was less than 30 days, an unusually rapid pace. And we are expecting to accelerate to client's planned timeline for last patient in by 3 months.
On the commercial side, I'd like to highlight a very important alliance we announced with salesforce.com. This deal will enable us to build solutions on a global technology platform that is best-in-class and that will help our clients take their products to market more efficiently and more effectively. It will eventually encompass the entire cycle, from driving patient recruitment to managing client, clinical trials to taking drugs to market more effectively with agile multichannel applications or build on a single platform. The initial focus of this alliance will be on multichannel stakeholder engagement. We will leverage salesforce's marketing cloud and force.com to enhance our existing capabilities in CRM and multichannel marketing. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail"
137473239,428195942,1187045,"Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was another strong quarter for QuintilesIMS. Let's review the details. I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First quarter revenu",1210,"Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was another strong quarter for QuintilesIMS. Let's review the details. 
I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion, an increase of 2.8% at constant currency and 1.6% reported on a combined company basis. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call. 
As a reminder, this noncash adjustment is a result of purchase accounting rules, which at the time of the merger requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the first quarter. 
Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, first quarter revenue grew 3.1% at constant currency and 2% reported. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3% at actual FX rates. As Ari mentioned, when adjusting for the early clinical development business where we closed the facility in London last year, R&D growth at constant currency was 5.5%. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 2.4% at constant currency and 1.3% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a significant decline in the legacy Quintiles Encore business. 
Excluding Encore, constant currency Commercial Solutions growth was 4%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue declined 0.2% at constant FX and 0.9% reported. 
Turning now to profit. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $467 million. As Ari mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA performance was better than the guidance we provided last quarter due to strong operating performance. 
GAAP net income was $74 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.31. Adjusted net income was $238 million. You will recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was about 29% in the first quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower and in the first quarter was approximately 10%. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.01 in the first quarter. The 1.3 billion of shares that we repurchased during the quarter had no impact to first quarter adjusted diluted EPS. The strong EPS performance was primarily a result of the operational performance I just mentioned along with slightly more than $0.01 benefit from tax. 
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. As you will recall from the previous 2 quarters, our new business and backlog metrics are now reported on an as-contracted LTM basis. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2017, R&D Solutions as contracted bookings were $4.08 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.66 billion. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now as Ari mentioned, contracted bookings have continued to improve, and we are very pleased with this trend. I do want to also remind you that this is a long cycle business, as Ari mentioned, and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow. This is why you should focus on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book-to-bill in a given quarter. 
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $862 million and debt was about $8.4 billion, resulting in net debt of about $7.5 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And net of cash, our leverage ratio was 3.8x. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $56 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million and free cash flow was negative $22 million. As is usual during the first quarter, our free cash flow was impacted by annual incentive payments to employees. Additionally, both operating and free cash flow were impacted by cash outflows in our loyalty program businesses. These Commercial Solutions businesses manage co-pay reimbursements on behalf of our pharma customers. Our customers pre-fund these reimbursements and we include this cash our balance sheet. We draw on this cash to pay pharmacies as consumers use the programs. The inflows and outflows should even out over time, but in any given quarter can cost meaningful fluctuations and deploy cash flow. 
You saw that we issued EUR 1.425 billion of senior notes due in 2025. We also refinanced our Term D debt and extended its maturity to 2024. During the quarter, we repurchased $750 million worth of shares from 2 of our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder. In addition, we repurchased $550 million of shares in the open market for total share repurchases of $1.3 billion. 
As I mentioned earlier, this did not have any impact to adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter. We now have $231 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Let's now turn to guidance. 
We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Now this guidance is exactly the same as last quarter. Nothing has changed. However, we did buy back $1.3 billion of our stock. We had originally planned on completing $500 million, so the additional $800 million was not in our original guidance. The additional $800 million of repurchases provides the benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS. 
Separately, we also took on additional debt that increases our interest expense and has a negative impact on full year adjusted diluted EPS. The net of these 2 items has a net benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS of $0.04. 
As a result, we feel comfortable raising our EPS guidance by a nickel. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.60. 
For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year and adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16%. Now remember, the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see the cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As always, we would like to tell you what we see for the second quarter of 2017. At this point, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.93 billion and $1.97 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $470 million and $490 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be $1.02 and $1.07.
In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered the strong operational and financial performance. Our next-gen clinical development offering continues to see success in the market. We had encouraging wins with our combined railroad insights offering. We had a steady performance in our Commercial Solutions business. We are enhancing our existing capabilities in CRM and multichannel marketing and announced an alliance with salesforce.com. We closed the bond offering for EUR 1.425 billion and extended our term loan B maturity until 2024. We repurchased a total of $1.3 billion of our stock, and we reaffirmed revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raised full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05. 
With that, I would like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A"

And not knowing the quarterly bookings, I'm sure there could be some noise in there. And yes, you did highlight that the backlog grew quite nicely sequentially in the quarter. So maybe could you just talk about what you saw on a gross wins perspective and maybe a cancels perspective in the quarter just so we can understand a little bit better what is driving the backlog growth?"

Again, we've tried to guide you away from this quarterly message because it really -- I mean, I could go on and on giving examples or that would show why you could derive the wrong conclusions from a number of a given quarter. The reasons to add",524,"Yes, yes. Again, we've tried to guide you away from this quarterly message because it really -- I mean, I could go on and on giving examples or that would show why you could derive the wrong conclusions from a number of a given quarter. The reasons to address the first part of your commentary and question, the reason why the LTM is lower at the end of March and then in December is because first Q 2016 dropped out of the LTM and happens to be that first Q '16 was a very high number on a contracted basis. And so therefore, when you take it out of the 12 months, it's lower than the LTM at the end of December. Now if you recall, that's going to really demonstrate why it's wrong to focus on the quarter and it's also wrong to focus on one, and it's better to do it the way we suggest we do it now. And I just told you the number on a contracted basis for the first quarter last year was very high. And yet, the reported quarterly book-to-bill number last year, when we are still a stand-alone company, was on a awarded basis and was 0.95, was under 1. Whereas the contracted number was materially over 1. And the reason why it was materially over 1 is because again, we couldn't managed the business based on quarterly awards. They could be contracting in the first quarter of '16 stuff that have been awarded the year before because nobody was focusing on it. What we're trying to do here is compress the timeline between award and contract, only count that which is contracted for, change operational [indiscernible] so we can compensate salesforce, et cetera, based on contracted work, not just it is awarded to you and smooth the level of cancellations and things we have to take out of the backlog because they were never meant to be in, in the first place. 
So again, I'm sorry for giving you the commentary, but that is the explanation with the LTM. With respect to the trend, our bookings are actually greater. It is a simple computation, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. You just do a subtraction of what the reported backlog is at the end of each quarter. You add that to the revenue reported in the quarter, that's an addition, because that's the revenue was converted from the beginning of period backlog. And you divide by the revenue. And if you do that, you will see that you -- we don't have the exact precise number because last quarter, we said it was about 9.5. It was slightly under that. But basically, went with a contracted book-to-bill for the quarter of just under 1 2. Now again, don't focus on it. It could have been 1 1 or 1 3. Let's not just -- we have an LTM of 1 16, which we think is very good. And the trend will continue to improve based on the pipeline that we see and the awards that we generate -- that we generated in the quarter."

But I mentioned, I particularly highlighted the largest such award because it kind of indicates to you what we're trying to do to change the model. This was with a top 5 European clients with whom, frankly, we haven't done very much. I think the biggest award of legal service was that in the $10 million range. Again, over the past 6 years, which we've looked at. We've done other works for these clients in other areas or specific work, data or stats or CSO work, but not full-service or clinical work. So this is the first time, and this is a very, very significant client with 2 more frustration on was very low to IMS Health. And that's -- so that's the, I think, clear indication of that there is something different. And the main reason we've been able to do that is that we've demonstrated a new approach, new capabilities, which actually, as I reported in my introductory comments, we already demonstrated. The product is already ongoing. It took 30 days from the signature of the contract to the first site, which is really very, very small period. And we've been able to demonstrate that to the client. Another element that's unique about it is that we were so confident and we have a good view of risk, and we were able and willing to go with the fixed price model. Again, that's something that's new and different and that's enabled by next-gen. So that's a powerful example that I mentioned, but it's large. But there are many others smaller size. This particular one is contracted for. And as I said, we are working on it already. But in aggregate, since the merger, we've been awarded over $400 million, which we know we -- which we know have been won directly because of next-gen. I would also point out that in a few instances, we actually were able to brought back and win stuff that have been awarded to somebody else and go back with a different approach using next-gen."

But it is expected to continue to provide headwind. And then, again, back to the awards discussion. The awards last year were weaker, as you know. And so that -- again, it takes at least the revenue from those awards to translate. So there's a little bit less. So usually, more color and why the second quarter is maybe not as strong as you might have expected. Why then is in the second half and towards the end of the year is stronger but that's because of the revenue synergies we talked about and the next-gen that we already know counterfeit for and now starting to produce revenue and some of the real world stuff that we are winning, all of that is expected to more than compensate for what we otherwise has not been or would have been more in line with the second quarter. And also, it's not just IES. I mean, I mentioned IES, but there's also with the legacy or Encore. The other legacy commercial business from what was the name of the -- IHS was the name of the division, the commercial of point out. They have an advisory business. They have that also not doing that great. So we kind of working ourselves through all of that, and that is basically why you see perhaps weaker. But we feel comfortable. Frankly, if we didn't see that, we'll have to change the guidance already. But we're not. We feel very strong because of the bookings, because at what's in the pipe and what we see coming.

Nobody decides, I won a lot of different companies, nobody decides I'm going to in-source or I'm going to outsource. That is not even of itself. The reason for outsourcing or in-sourcing are based on what is the lowest cost solution at the best quality and expect deliverable type criteria that I can get if I can perform the work internally at a lower cost more effectively and within better timeframes and so on, then I'll do it inside. If not, I'll outsource. So it's not a  outsourcing, in-sourcing. So this isn't what's driving what is true, is that pharma, and especially large pharma, are looking for solutions that enable them to perform the work at a lower cost and more effectively. That is the primary driver of those in-sourcing, outsourcing decisions. To the degree that they can do the work. Look, if all you're selling is bodies that are going to run around and visit sites and audit and fill checklists, yes, maybe it could be that it's cheaper in-house. I mean, it's not much of a benefit, right? Because why would you give any margin. If it's a cost plus business, I do agree. But that is not what our value proposition is. We are trying to transition the business model precisely to be data analytics, expertise and technology driven. That is exactly our strategy. We are repositioning the business, and we believe we are in leading position to do that. We have not seen that.

And so, again, there's no in-sourcing there. Historically, emerging biotech has been rather reluctant to partner with larger CROs because they require high touch solution and we perhaps were not as effective in providing that solution. As you know, Richard Stoke, who runs our R&D business, was before he joined Quintiles 3 years ago, was the CEO of Novella, which was a small CRO that's precisely worked with many emerging biotech clients. He's brought this approach to Quintiles and developing a specific set of offerings and capabilities that are targeted to small biotech. And we are making inroads and being more aggressive commercially and in terms of the offering with biotech. Again, EVP requires a different set of capabilities, more customization. That could mean for a company like Quintiles higher cost if we were not developing a separate solution. But we are now running this separately, as 2 separate offerings, obviously, leveraging the capabilities.

But essentially, the -- in many cases, the business, like in the technology services side or specific in real world evidence, we -- we've merged the businesses. So it's hard even now to look at what is the growth of the legacy IMS real-world business versus the growth of the Quintiles legacy real-world business. But based on what we see, to give you an example, it's sort of similar to what you have seen before, okay? Again, the information business traditionally is a flat business, very low single-digits. And the, what we used to call technology services business was low double digits. And essentially, we've seen the same thing minus the drag of the less performing, the lower performance inherited Quintiles businesses, namely, the advisory business, Encore and also, to a degree that, for example, I know specifically that the real-world business, which have IMS, have been growing in the midteens. It's still growing and it is still lower midteens. And I know because I specifically look at that and had specific review on it. And the reason for that is that the Quintiles legacy real-world business was going at the lower rate. So we're confident we're going to -- once we integrate and so on, we are going to continue to accelerate that growth. But it did reduce our growth rates in that what we used to call tech services business somewhat."

And we don't include that, obviously, the adjusted methods. The operational depreciation is very modest. It's about $50 million. So overall, a $50 million per quarter that is.

So we are margin -- we are counting on margin expansion year-over-year. Obviously, when you have a merger like this, things tend to happen, you get higher costs that are not necessarily adjustable that relates to achieving the synergies in the first year, and that's what's happening this year. We have costs associated. Sometimes, we have to keep 2 systems running at the same time. We could be 4 and shut that one down, et cetera. That kind of last. So there are some merger-related costs that we have to carry, especially on the first half of the year, and it cannot be added back to our non-GAAP results. And the other elements that this year especially, that again, we spoke a little bit earlier about our investments in the next-gen solution. And we are making a lot of investments there in data, technology, people to accelerate that development. And that perhaps is a little bit more, and we are accelerating that. On the Commercial Solutions side, we announced this deal with salesforce.com. And we're very excited about that. And that obviously requires estimate some investments to transition the applications to the new platform over time. That also is an investment we are making in the business for the long term. So despite all of that, I mean, if you get our margin, reported margin, this quarter was basically flattish. And the reason we are reporting that even though we are having all these extra cost and investments that I just talked about is because we continue tool underlying in the businesses, we continue to improve our competitiveness and cost position. Plus, we have the synergies that would be rolling in later on. Not yet, but certainly beginning in '18 in a significant way. So underlying the business, the cost structures are continuing. But we also have added costs that I just described, which are really investments in the business. So despite all of that, our margins are not -- are okay. They -- I think we should be much higher. I mean, on the R&D side, also, I mean, you have noted that there's a mix issue. The IES business has very low margins and continues to be a drag, obviously. And some quarter, it could be a little bit higher. So it has a negative impact on margin. So again, a lot of moving parts. But in aggregate, we tried -- we're going to be managing margins in a way that we seek expansion. We believe that there is significant operational improvement that can be made within the R&D business. And we're actually seeing some of that already and that kind of offset some of the investments we're making in next-gen and others for now."

Given the nature of the business, it's such a long cycle business. Burn rates can fluctuate because of another reason. If you win a large multiyear study, then by definition, the burn rate is going to go down. If you win more SSP work relative to the rest, then the burn rate is going to go down because depending on the length of the contract. If you have a very strong bookings quarter, again, you're going to cause the next quarter burn rate to go down. So that -- it's hard to tell. Really, ideally, you should take a look at specific projects and specific trials and see whether revenue associated with the trial is faster or lower than we would have been otherwise. So it's hard to compare. It's such a complex business without so many moving parts. Some of them actually can look good and in fact, that not necessarily indicate goodness or actually can look bad and doesn't necessarily indicate badness. So if you ask us -- if you ask me operationally, of course, we are focusing on accelerating revenue burn and we want to do this to systematic changes in the way we do business. Again, using more data, analytics and technology, less ""trial and error"" experience based site identification and patient targeting type of approach. And we believe that by doing that, we accelerate revenue burn for individual trials that are using next-gen. And I did mention some detail on recently one such project where, again, we are able to accelerate timelines quite dramatically. And obviously, the associated revenue will come in faster."

We are pleased Q1 results came in, in line or better than what we told you to expect. Let's have a quick review of the numbers. 
Consistent with last quarter, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger had taken place January 1, 2016. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion and grew 3.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions growth was 4.3% at constant currency, and R&D Solutions revenue was negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year. Excluding this early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been about 5.5%. 
Commercial Solutions grew 2.5%, 2.4% to be precise, at constant currency. Growth in Commercial Solutions was negatively impacted by the poor performance of the legacy Quintiles Encore business, which itself declined more than 50% year-over-year. Excluding Encore, the commercial business would have grown 4%. 
Integrated Engagement Services, as expected, was slightly down. Acquisitions contributed 1 point of revenue growth, and that was evenly split between R&D and Commercial Solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, which is higher than our guidance range and about $10 million above the midpoint of the range. This beat was entirely driven by stronger operating performance. 
Let me provide some color on a few key wins in the quarter. Let's start with the Real-World Insights business. The real-world team won a $15 million deal for 2 neurology studies with a top 5 pharma client. Our global data, advanced analytics and deep therapeutic expertise in neurology set us apart from the competition. The client saw a huge benefit in using retrospective data to accelerate site identification and patient recruitment for these prospective studies in both the U.S. and Europe. 
Another top 5 pharma client signed a $12.5 million real-world deal based on our unique capability to lean diagnostic data, prescription data and demographic data to support a Phase 4 interventional diabetes study. 
Turning to our R&D Solutions business. We saw continued improvements in our as-contracted bookings trend. At the end of the quarter, we have a contracted backlog of more than $9.6 billion. Now I've never done this, but I'm going to go off-script, guys, over here. I read -- I was just reading before the call started a few of the initial notes that some of the analysts wrote, and I still see that people are still trying to calculate quarterly book-to-bill numbers even though we tried to tell you before that it is not a meaningful indicator of how we are doing. But because those calculations are all over the place, I just want to tell you that if you do the math -- and really, it is 3 elementary computations based on the numbers we reported. If you do the math, it is just below your magic number of 1.2 book-to-bill. Again, on a contracted basis for the quarter. We've said over and over, we're not going to do it, but I can't help myself. It is actually an improving booking trend that we have observed over the quarter. And again, I'm departing from script. If you were to do the same math on an awarded basis -- and we don't have the numbers because we don't report awards anymore, we report contracts. On an award basis, that book-to-bill ratio for the quarter would have been materially higher than that ""magic number of 1.2.""
Now back to the script. I know people are screaming at me here, but I couldn't help myself. We are actually very encouraged by the early demand we are seeing for our next-gen clinical development offerings. Last quarter, I told you we had won over $100 million of business with next-gen since the merger closed. We now stand at more than $400 million of awards, not all of which has contracted, tied directly to the application of next-gen of clinical development within clinical trials. The fight keeps strengthening, and our team is currently engaged in more than 80 next-gen projects. 
Recent examples of such wins include: For a large pharma client, we competed against 14 other CROs, and we're selected for a preferred partnership based on our unique ability to improve study design, site ID and patient recruitment globally. The clients cited specifically our next-gen offering as a clear differentiator. We had another very significant when with a top 5 pharma client, European pharma client, who has awarded virtually no full-service clinical business to us over the past 6 years. This was a fixed-price award for more than $120 million. In landing this win, a key differentiator was our ability to quickly validate internal historic site performance data with real-world insights. The study has now kicked off. And from the get-go, we were able to demonstrate higher operational performance. The time from contract to first site selection visit was less than 30 days, an unusually rapid pace, and we are expecting to accelerate he client's planned time line for last patient in by 3 months.
On the commercial side, I'd like to highlight a very important alliance we announced with salesforce.com. This deal will enable us to build solutions on a global technology platform that is best-in-class and that will help our clients take their products to market more efficiently and more effectively. This will eventually encompass the entire cycle, from driving patient recruitment to managing client -- clinical trials to taking drugs to market more effectively with agile multichannel applications or built on a single platform. The initial focus of this alliance will be on multichannel stakeholder engagement. We will leverage salesforce's marketing cloud and force.com to enhance our existing capabilities in CRM and multichannel marketing. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail"

I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion, an increase of 2.8% at constant currency and 1.6% reported on a combined company basis. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call. As a reminder, this noncash adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules, which, at the time of the merger, requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the first quarter. 
Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, first quarter revenue grew 3.1% at constant currency and 2% reported. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3% at actual FX rates. As Ari mentioned, when adjusting for the early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year, R&D growth at constant currency was 5.5%. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 2.4% at constant currency and 1.3% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a significant decline in the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Excluding Encore, constant currency Commercial Solutions growth was 4%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue declined 0.2% at constant FX and 0.9% reported. 
Turning now to profit. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $467 million. As Ari mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA performance was better than the guidance we provided last quarter due to strong operating performance. 
GAAP net income was $74 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.31. Adjusted net income was $238 million. You will recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was about 29% in the first quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower and in the first quarter, was approximately 10%. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.01 in the first quarter. The 1.3 billion of shares that we repurchased during the quarter had no impact to first quarter adjusted diluted EPS. The strong EPS performance was primarily a result of the operational performance I just mentioned, along with slightly more than $0.01 benefit from tax. 
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. As you will recall from the previous 2 quarters, our new business and backlog metrics are now reported on an as-contracted LTM basis. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2017, R&D Solutions as-contracted bookings were $4.08 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.66 billion. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now as Ari mentioned, contracted bookings have continued to improve, and we are very pleased with this trend. I do want to also remind you that this is a long-cycle business, as Ari mentioned, and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow. This is why you should focus on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book-to-bill in a given quarter. 
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $862 million, and debt was about $8.4 billion, resulting in net debt of about $7.5 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And net of cash, our leverage ratio was 3.8x. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $56 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million, and free cash flow was negative $22 million. As is usual during the first quarter, our free cash flow was impacted by annual incentive payments to employees. Additionally, both operating and free cash flow were impacted by cash outflows in our loyalty program businesses. These Commercial Solutions businesses manage co-pay reimbursements on behalf of our pharma customers. Our customers pre-fund these reimbursements, and we include this cash on our balance sheet. We draw on this cash to pay pharmacies as consumers use the programs. The inflows and outflows should even out over time, but in any given quarter, can cause meaningful fluctuations in reported cash flow. 
You saw that we issued EUR 1.425 billion of senior notes due in 2025. We also refinanced our Term D debt and extended its maturity to 2024. During the quarter, we repurchased $750 million worth of shares from 2 of our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder. In addition, we repurchased $550 million of shares in the open market for total share repurchases of $1.3 billion. As I mentioned earlier, this did not have any impact to adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter. We now have $231 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Let's now turn to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Now this guidance is exactly the same as last quarter. Nothing has changed. However, we did buy back $1.3 billion of our stock. We had originally planned on completing $500 million, so the additional $800 million was not in our original guidance. The additional $800 million of repurchases provides a benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS. 
Separately, we also took on additional debt that increases our interest expense and has a negative impact on full year adjusted diluted EPS. The net of these 2 items has a net benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS of $0.04. As a result, we feel comfortable raising our EPS guidance by $0.05. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.60. 
For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year and adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16%. Now remember, the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see the cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As always, we would like to tell you what we see for the second quarter of 2017. At this point, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.93 billion and $1.97 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $470 million and $490 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.02 and $1.07.
In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered strong operational and financial performance. Our next-gen clinical development offering continues to see success in the market. We had encouraging wins with our combined Real-World Insights offering. We had steady performance in our Commercial Solutions business. We are enhancing our existing capabilities in CRM and multichannel marketing and announced an alliance with salesforce.com. We closed the bond offering for EUR 1.425 billion and extended our Term Loan B maturity until 2024. We repurchased a total of $1.3 billion of our stock, and we reaffirmed revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raised full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05. 
With that, I would like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

Again, we've tried to guide you away from this quarterly metric because it really -- I mean, I could go on and on giving you examples or -- that would show why you could derive the wrong conclusions from a number in a given quarter. The rea",528,"Yes, yes, yes. Again, we've tried to guide you away from this quarterly metric because it really -- I mean, I could go on and on giving you examples or -- that would show why you could derive the wrong conclusions from a number in a given quarter. The reason to address the first part of your commentary and question, the reason why the LTM is lower at the end of March than it was at the end of December is because first Q 2016 dropped out of the LTM, and it happens to be that first Q '16 was a very high number on a contracted basis. And so therefore, when you take it out of the 12 months, it's lower than the LTM at the end of December. Now if you recall, that's going to really demonstrate why it's wrong to focus on the quarter and it's also wrong to focus on [indiscernible], and it's better to do it the way we suggest we do it now. And I just told you, the number on a contracted basis for the first quarter last year was very high. And yet, the reported quarterly book-to-bill number last year, when Quintiles was still a stand-alone company, was on an awarded basis and was 0.95, was under 1, whereas the contracted number was materially over 1. And the reason why it was materially over 1 is because, again, because we manage the business based on quarterly awards. They could be contracting in the first quarter of '16 stuff that has been awarded the year before because nobody was focusing on it. What we're trying to do here is compress the time line between award and contract, only count that which is contracted for, change operationally internally so we can compensate salesforce, et cetera, based on contracted work, not just it is awarded to you and smooth the level of cancellations and things we have to take out of the backlog because they were never meant to be in, in the first place. So again, I'm sorry for giving you the commentary, but that is the explanation for the LTM. With respect to the trend, our bookings are actually greater. It is a simple computation, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. You just do a subtraction of what the reported backlog is at the end of each quarter. You add that to the revenue reported in the quarter, that's an addition, because that's -- the revenue was converted from the beginning of period backlog. And you divide by the revenue. And if you do that, you will see that you don't have the exact precise numbers because last quarter, we said it was about 9.5. It was slightly under that, but basically went with a contracted book-to-bill for the quarter of just under 1.2. Now again, don't focus on it. It could have been 1.1 or 1.3. Let's not just -- we have an LTM of 1.16, which we feel is very good, and the trend will continue to improve based on the pipeline that we see and the awards that we generate -- that we generated in the quarter."

Or again, nobody is new to Quintiles. We have business with everybody in the world. But I mentioned, I particularly highlighted the largest such award because it kind of indicates to you what we're trying to do to change the model. This was with a top 5 European client with whom, frankly, we hadn't done very much. I think the biggest award of a full clinical service was like in the $10 million range, again, over the past 6 years, which we've looked at. We've done other work for these clients in other areas or specific work, data or stats or CSO work, but not full-service core clinical work. So this is the first time, and this is a very, very significant client with whom our [indiscernible] core clinical was very low, to say the least. And that's -- so that's the, I think, clear indication that there is something different. And the main reason we've been able to do that is that we've demonstrated a new approach, new capabilities, which actually, as I reported in my introductory comments, we already demonstrated. The project is already ongoing. It took 30 days from the signature of the contract to the first site identification, which is really a very, very small period. And we've been able to demonstrate that to the client. Another element that's unique about it is that we were so confident and we have a good view of risk, and we were able and willing to go with a fixed-price model. Again, that's something that's new and different, and that's enabled by next-gen. So that's a powerful example that I mentioned because it's large, but there are many others, smaller size. This particular one is contracted for. And as I said, we are working on it already. But in aggregate, since the merger, we've been awarded over $400 million, which we know we -- which we know have been won directly because of next-gen. I would also point out that in a few instances, we actually were able to go back and win stuff that had been awarded to somebody else and go back with a different approach using next-gen."

And I mean, the business is -- we're not trying to do something about it, but it is expected to continue to provide headwind. And then again, back to the awards discussion. The awards last year were weaker, as you know. And so that -- again, it takes at least a year for revenue from those awards to translate, so there's a little bit less. So I could give you a little bit of more color on why the second quarter is maybe not as strong as you might have expected. Why then is the second half and towards the end of the year it was stronger, that's because the revenue synergies we talked about and the next-gen that we already now contracted for and is starting to produce revenue and some of the real-world stuff that we are winning, all of that is expected to more than compensate for what we otherwise have not been -- or would have been more in line with the second quarter.

IHS was the name of the division that commercial points out. They have an advisory business there that's also not doing that great. So we're kind of working ourselves through all of that, and that is basically why you see, perhaps, a little weaker. But we feel comfortable. Frankly, if we didn't see that, we would have changed the guidance already, but we're not. We feel very strongly because of the bookings because of what's in the pipe and what we see coming. So despite all of that and the FX and so on, we're comfortable maintaining -- very comfortable maintaining the guidance."

Nobody decides I'm going to in-source or I'm going to outsource. That is not an ending in and of itself. The reason for outsourcing or in-sourcing are based on what is the lowest-cost solution at the best quality and expect deliverable-type criteria that I can get. If I can perform the work internally at a lower cost, more effectively and within better time frames and so on, then I'll do it inside. If not, I'll outsource. So it's not an outsourcing, in-sourcing. So this isn't what's driving. What is true is that pharma, and especially large pharma, are looking for solutions that enable them to perform the work at a lower cost and more effectively. That is the primary driver of those in-sourcing, outsourcing decisions. To the degree that they can do the work, look, if all you're selling is bodies that are going to run around and visit sites and audit and fill checklists, yes, maybe it could be that it's cheaper in-house. I mean, it's not much of a benefit, right? Because why would you give any margin? If it's a cost-plus business, I do agree. But that is not what our value proposition is. We are trying to transition the business model precisely to be data analytics, expertise and technology-driven, and that is exactly our strategy. We're repositioning the business, and we believe we are in a unique position to do that. We have not seen that. I mean, some of the large pharma, specifically rumors to be stopping the sourcing and bringing in more work inside, are precisely some of the ones with whom we've won. I wish I could give the names."

Certainly, smaller pharma and midsize biotech, it's very hard to do it in-house. It's a nonstarter. And as you know, they represented, at this point in time, a growing part of the pipeline. And so again, there's no in-sourcing there. Historically, emerging biotech has been rather reluctant to partner with larger CROs because they require high touch solution, and we, perhaps, were not as effective in providing that solution. As you know, Richard Staub, who runs our R&D business, was -- before he joined Quintiles 3 years ago, was the CEO of Novella, which was a small CRO that's precisely worked with many emerging biotech clients. He's brought this approach to Quintiles and developing a specific set of offerings and capabilities that are targeted to small biotech. And we are making inroads and being more aggressive commercially and in terms of the offering with biotech. Again, EBP requires a different set of capabilities, more customization. That could mean, for a company like Quintiles, higher cost if we were not developing a separate solution. But we are now running this separately as 2 separate offerings, obviously, leveraging the capabilities. So we are able to offer more flexible and therefore, more attractive commercially value propositions for smaller biotech, and we're making significant inroads and frankly, displacing some of the smaller guys, who had been serving that market."

But I -- based on what we see, to give you an example, it's always similar to what you have seen before, okay? Again, the info business traditionally is a flat business, very low single digits. And the -- what we used to call technology services business was low double digits. And essentially, we've seen the same thing minus the drag of the less-performing -- the lower performance inherited Quintiles businesses, namely, the Advisory business, Encore and also -- to a degree, like for example, I know specifically that the real-world business, which is IMS, has been growing in the mid-teens. It's still growing in the teens, but lower mid-teens. If -- and I know because I specifically look at that and had a specific review on it. And the reason for that is that the Quintiles legacy real-world business was growing at a lower rate.

The operational depreciation is very modest. It's about $50 million. So overall -- $50 million per quarter that is.

Obviously, when you have a merger like this, things tend to happen. You get higher costs that are not necessarily adjustable that relate to achieving the synergies in the first year, and that's what's happening this year. We have costs associated. Sometimes, we have to keep 2 systems running at the same time. We could -- before we can shut that one down, et cetera. That kind of can last a year or so. There are some merger-related costs that we have to carry, especially in the first half of the year, and it cannot be added back to our non-GAAP results. And the other elements here that's -- this year especially, that -- again, we spoke a little bit earlier about our investments in the next-gen solution. And we are making a lot of investments there in data, technology, people to accelerate that development. And that, perhaps, is a little bit more, and we are accelerating that. On the Commercial Solutions side, we announced this deal with salesforce.com, and we're very excited about that. And that, obviously, requires us to make some investments to transition the applications to the new platform over time, and that also is an investment we're making in the business for the long term. So despite all of that, if you look at our margin -- reported margin, this quarter was basically flattish. And the reason we are reporting that even though we are having all these extra costs and investments that I just talked about is because we continue to underlying -- in the businesses, we continue to improve our competitiveness and cost position. Plus, we have the synergies that we'll be rolling in later on. Not yet, but certainly beginning in '18 in a significant way. So underlying the business, the cost structures are continuing. But we also have added costs that I just described, which are really investments in the business. So despite all of that, our margins are not -- are okay. They -- I think we should be much higher. I mean, on the R&D side -- also, I mean, you have -- you noted that there's a mix issue. The IES business has very low margins and continues to be a drag, obviously. In some quarters, it could be a little bit higher, so it has a negative impact on margin. So again, a lot of moving parts. But in aggregate, we try -- we're going to be managing markets in a way that we seek expansion. We believe that there is significant operational improvements that can be made within the R&D business. And we're actually seeing some of that already, and that kind of offsets some of the investments we're making in next-gen and others for now."

Given the nature of the business, it's such a long-cycle business. Burn rates can fluctuate because of a number of reasons. If you win a large multiyear study, then, by definition, the burn rate is going to go down. If you win more FSP work relative to the rest, then the burn rate is going to go down because depending on the length of the contract. If you have a very strong bookings quarter, again, it's going to cause the next quarter burn rate to go down. So that -- it's hard to tell. Really, ideally, you should take a look at specific projects and specific trials and see whether revenue associated with a trial is faster or lower than where we would have been otherwise. So it's hard to compare. It's such a complex business with so many moving parts. Some of them actually can look good. And in fact, it does not necessarily indicate goodness. Or it actually can look bad, and it doesn't necessarily indicate badness. So if you ask us -- if you ask me operationally, of course, we are focusing on accelerating revenue burn, and we want to do this through systematic changes in the way we do business. Again, using more data, analytics and technology, less ""trial and error,"" experience-based site identification and patient targeting type of approach. And we believe that by doing that, we will accelerate revenue burn for individual trials that are using next-gen. And I did mention some detail on recently one such project where, again, we are able to accelerate time lines quite dramatically. And obviously, the associated revenue will come in faster."

We are pleased Q1 results came in, in line or better than what we told you to expect. Let's have a quick review of the numbers. 
Consistent with last quarter, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger had taken place January 1, 2016. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion and grew 3.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions growth was 4.3% at constant currency, and R&D Solutions revenue was negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year. Excluding this early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been about 5.5%. 
Commercial Solutions grew 2.5%, 2.4% to be precise, at constant currency. Growth in Commercial Solutions was negatively impacted by the poor performance of the legacy Quintiles Encore business, which itself declined more than 50% year-over-year. Excluding Encore, the commercial business would have grown 4%. 
Integrated Engagement Services, as expected, was slightly down. Acquisitions contributed 1 point of revenue growth, and that was evenly split between R&D and Commercial Solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, which is higher than our guidance range and about $10 million above the midpoint of the range. This beat was entirely driven by stronger operating performance. 
Let me provide some color on a few key wins in the quarter. Let's start with the Real-World Insights business. The real-world team won a $15 million deal for 2 neurology studies with a top 5 pharma client. Our global data, advanced analytics and deep therapeutic expertise in neurology set us apart from the competition. The client saw a huge benefit in using retrospective data to accelerate site identification and patient recruitment for these prospective studies in both the U.S. and Europe. 
Another top 5 pharma client signed a $12.5 million real-world deal based on our unique capability to lean diagnostic data, prescription data and demographic data to support a Phase 4 interventional diabetes study. 
Turning to our R&D Solutions business. We saw continued improvements in our as-contracted bookings trend. At the end of the quarter, we have a contracted backlog of more than $9.6 billion. Now I've never done this, but I'm going to go off-script, guys, over here. I read -- I was just reading before the call started a few of the initial notes that some of the analysts wrote, and I still see that people are still trying to calculate quarterly book-to-bill numbers even though we tried to tell you before that it is not a meaningful indicator of how we are doing. But because those calculations are all over the place, I just want to tell you that if you do the math -- and really, it is 3 elementary computations based on the numbers we reported. If you do the math, it is just below your magic number of 1.2 book-to-bill. Again, on a contracted basis for the quarter. We've said over and over, we're not going to do it, but I can't help myself. It is actually an improving booking trend that we have observed over the quarter. And again, I'm departing from script. If you were to do the same math on an awarded basis -- and we don't have the numbers because we don't report awards anymore, we report contracts. On an award basis, that book-to-bill ratio for the quarter would have been materially higher than that ""magic number of 1.2.""
Now back to the script. I know people are screaming at me here, but I couldn't help myself. We are actually very encouraged by the early demand we are seeing for our next-gen clinical development offerings. Last quarter, I told you we had won over $100 million of business with next-gen since the merger closed. We now stand at more than $400 million of awards, not all of which has contracted, tied directly to the application of next-gen of clinical development within clinical trials. The fight keeps strengthening, and our team is currently engaged in more than 80 next-gen projects. 
Recent examples of such wins include: For a large pharma client, we competed against 14 other CROs, and were selected for a preferred partnership based on our unique ability to improve study design, site ID and patient recruitment globally. The clients cited specifically our next-gen offering as a clear differentiator. We had another very significant win with a top 5 pharma client, European pharma client, who has awarded virtually no full-service clinical business to us over the past 6 years. This was a fixed-price award for more than $120 million. In landing this win, a key differentiator was our ability to quickly validate internal historic site performance data with real-world insights. The study has now kicked off. And from the get-go, we were able to demonstrate higher operational performance. The time from contract to first site selection visit was less than 30 days, an unusually rapid pace, and we are expecting to accelerate the client's planned time line for last patient in by 3 months.
On the commercial side, I'd like to highlight a very important alliance we announced with salesforce.com. This deal will enable us to build solutions on a global technology platform that is best-in-class and that will help our clients take their products to market more efficiently and more effectively. This will eventually encompass the entire cycle, from driving patient recruitment to managing client -- clinical trials to taking drugs to market more effectively with agile multichannel applications all built on a single platform. The initial focus of this alliance will be on multichannel stakeholder engagement. We will leverage salesforce's marketing cloud and force.com to enhance our existing capabilities in CRM and multichannel marketing. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail"
137473239,428195942,1187597,"Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was another strong quarter for QuintilesIMS. Let's review the details. I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First quarter revenu",1207,"Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was another strong quarter for QuintilesIMS. Let's review the details. 
I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion, an increase of 2.8% at constant currency and 1.6% reported on a combined company basis. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call. As a reminder, this noncash adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules, which, at the time of the merger, requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the first quarter. 
Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, first quarter revenue grew 3.1% at constant currency and 2% reported. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3% at actual FX rates. As Ari mentioned, when adjusting for the early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year, R&D growth at constant currency was 5.5%. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 2.4% at constant currency and 1.3% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a significant decline in the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Excluding Encore, constant currency Commercial Solutions growth was 4%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue declined 0.2% at constant FX and 0.9% reported. 
Turning now to profit. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $467 million. As Ari mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA performance was better than the guidance we provided last quarter due to strong operating performance. 
GAAP net income was $74 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.31. Adjusted net income was $238 million. You will recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was about 29% in the first quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower and in the first quarter, was approximately 10%. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.01 in the first quarter. The 1.3 billion of shares that we repurchased during the quarter had no impact to first quarter adjusted diluted EPS. The strong EPS performance was primarily a result of the operational performance I just mentioned, along with slightly more than $0.01 benefit from tax. 
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. As you will recall from the previous 2 quarters, our new business and backlog metrics are now reported on an as-contracted LTM basis. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2017, R&D Solutions as-contracted bookings were $4.08 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.66 billion. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now as Ari mentioned, contracted bookings have continued to improve, and we are very pleased with this trend. I do want to also remind you that this is a long-cycle business, as Ari mentioned, and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow. This is why you should focus on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book-to-bill in a given quarter. 
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $862 million, and debt was about $8.4 billion, resulting in net debt of about $7.5 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And net of cash, our leverage ratio was 3.8x. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $56 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million, and free cash flow was negative $22 million. As is usual during the first quarter, our free cash flow was impacted by annual incentive payments to employees. Additionally, both operating and free cash flow were impacted by cash outflows in our loyalty program businesses. These Commercial Solutions businesses manage co-pay reimbursements on behalf of our pharma customers. Our customers pre-fund these reimbursements, and we include this cash on our balance sheet. We draw on this cash to pay pharmacies as consumers use the programs. The inflows and outflows should even out over time, but in any given quarter, can cause meaningful fluctuations in reported cash flow. 
You saw that we issued EUR 1.425 billion of senior notes due in 2025. We also refinanced our Term D debt and extended its maturity to 2024. During the quarter, we repurchased $750 million worth of shares from 2 of our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder. In addition, we repurchased $550 million of shares in the open market for total share repurchases of $1.3 billion. As I mentioned earlier, this did not have any impact to adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter. We now have $231 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Let's now turn to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Now this guidance is exactly the same as last quarter. Nothing has changed. However, we did buy back $1.3 billion of our stock. We had originally planned on completing $500 million, so the additional $800 million was not in our original guidance. The additional $800 million of repurchases provides a benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS. 
Separately, we also took on additional debt that increases our interest expense and has a negative impact on full year adjusted diluted EPS. The net of these 2 items has a net benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS of $0.04. As a result, we feel comfortable raising our EPS guidance by $0.05. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.60. 
For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year and adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16%. Now remember, the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see the cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As always, we would like to tell you what we see for the second quarter of 2017. At this point, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.93 billion and $1.97 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $470 million and $490 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.02 and $1.07.
In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered strong operational and financial performance. Our next-gen clinical development offering continues to see success in the market. We had encouraging wins with our combined Real-World Insights offering. We had steady performance in our Commercial Solutions business. We are enhancing our existing capabilities in CRM and multichannel marketing and announced an alliance with salesforce.com. We closed the bond offering for EUR 1.425 billion and extended our Term Loan B maturity until 2024. We repurchased a total of $1.3 billion of our stock, and we reaffirmed revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raised full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05. 
With that, I would like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

Again, we've tried to guide you away from this quarterly metric because it really -- I mean, I could go on and on giving you examples or -- that would show why you could derive the wrong conclusions from a number in a given quarter. The rea",528,"Yes, yes, yes. Again, we've tried to guide you away from this quarterly metric because it really -- I mean, I could go on and on giving you examples or -- that would show why you could derive the wrong conclusions from a number in a given quarter. The reason to address the first part of your commentary and question, the reason why the LTM is lower at the end of March than it was at the end of December is because first Q 2016 dropped out of the LTM, and it happens to be that first Q '16 was a very high number on a contracted basis. And so therefore, when you take it out of the 12 months, it's lower than the LTM at the end of December. Now if you recall, that's going to really demonstrate why it's wrong to focus on the quarter and it's also wrong to focus on awarded, and it's better to do it the way we suggest we do it now. And I just told you, the number on a contracted basis for the first quarter last year was very high. And yet, the reported quarterly book-to-bill number last year, when Quintiles was still a stand-alone company, was on an awarded basis and was 0.95, was under 1, whereas the contracted number was materially over 1. And the reason why it was materially over 1 is because, again, because we manage the business based on quarterly awards. They could be contracting in the first quarter of '16 stuff that has been awarded the year before because nobody was focusing on it. What we're trying to do here is compress the time line between award and contract, only count that which is contracted for, change operationally internally so we can compensate salesforce, et cetera, based on contracted work, not just it is awarded to you and smooth the level of cancellations and things we have to take out of the backlog because they were never meant to be in, in the first place. So again, I'm sorry for giving you the commentary, but that is the explanation for the LTM. With respect to the trend, our bookings are actually greater. It is a simple computation, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. You just do a subtraction of what the reported backlog is at the end of each quarter. You add that to the revenue reported in the quarter, that's an addition, because that's -- the revenue was converted from the beginning of period backlog. And you divide by the revenue. And if you do that, you will see that you don't have the exact precise numbers because last quarter, we said it was about 9.5. It was slightly under that, but basically went with a contracted book-to-bill for the quarter of just under 1.2. Now again, don't focus on it. It could have been 1.1 or 1.3. Let's not just -- we have an LTM of 1.16, which we feel is very good, and the trend will continue to improve based on the pipeline that we see and the awards that we generate -- that we generated in the quarter."

Or again, nobody is new to Quintiles. We have business with everybody in the world. But I mentioned, I particularly highlighted the largest such award because it kind of indicates to you what we're trying to do to change the model. This was with a top 5 European client with whom, frankly, we hadn't done very much. I think the biggest award of a full clinical service was like in the $10 million range, again, over the past 6 years, which we've looked at. We've done other work for these clients in other areas or specific work, data or stats or CSO work, but not full-service core clinical work. So this is the first time, and this is a very, very significant client with whom our [indiscernible] on core clinical was very low, to say the least. And that's -- so that's the, I think, clear indication that there is something different. And the main reason we've been able to do that is that we've demonstrated a new approach, new capabilities, which actually, as I reported in my introductory comments, we already demonstrated. The project is already ongoing. It took 30 days from the signature of the contract to the first site identification, which is really a very, very small period. And we've been able to demonstrate that to the client. Another element that's unique about it is that we were so confident and we have a good view of risk, and we were able and willing to go with a fixed-price model. Again, that's something that's new and different, and that's enabled by next-gen. So that's a powerful example that I mentioned because it's large, but there are many others, smaller size. This particular one is contracted for. And as I said, we are working on it already. But in aggregate, since the merger, we've been awarded over $400 million, which we know we -- which we know have been won directly because of next-gen. I would also point out that in a few instances, we actually were able to go back and win stuff that had been awarded to somebody else and go back with a different approach using next-gen."

And so when you take it out of any LTM, you are going to have a decline, by definition, okay, because it's going to bias the number. It's going to look like it's going down.

I think the main reasons, if you really want to focus on the second quarter, even though we're here to speak about the first quarter. The -- first, there is an FX impact, okay? Currency hasn't really changed much since we last provided guidance. It's basically no impact. I mean, we lost over a point of growth in the first quarter due to FX year-over-year, but not since we last gave guidance. So FX from the last year's second quarter has an impact. Secondly, there's the IES segment, which is very lumpy. Q2 last year for IES, I think it was disclosed, I'm just looking at my colleagues here, it was disclosed last year. There was a onetime benefit of -- if I recall, it was almost $10 million. It was onetime royalty payment that was in IES, I think."

Third, this Encore business, which, I would imagine, this Encore business, when it was purchased a couple of years ago, was like about $100 million of revenue. And I mean, the business is -- we're  trying to do something about it, but it is expected to continue to provide headwind. And then again, back to the awards discussion. The awards last year were weaker, as you know. And so that -- again, it takes at least a year for revenue from those awards to translate, so there's a little bit less. So I could give you a little bit of more color on why the second quarter is maybe not as strong as you might have expected. Why then is the second half and towards the end of the year it was stronger, that's because the revenue synergies we talked about and the next-gen that we already now contracted for and is starting to produce revenue and some of the real-world stuff that we are winning, all of that is expected to more than compensate for what would otherwise have not been -- or would have been more in line with the second quarter. And also, it's not just IES. I mean, I mentioned IES, but there's also the legacy -- or Encore. The other legacy commercial business from -- what was the name of it? IHS was the name of the division that commercial points out. They have an advisory business there that's also not doing that great. So we're kind of working ourselves through all of that, and that is basically why you see, perhaps, a little weaker. But we feel comfortable. Frankly, if we didn't see that, we would have changed the guidance already, but we're not. We feel very strongly because of the bookings because of what's in the pipe and what we see coming. So despite all of that and the FX and so on, we're comfortable maintaining -- very comfortable maintaining the guidance."

Nobody decides I'm going to in-source or I'm going to outsource. That is not an ending in and of itself. The reason for outsourcing or in-sourcing are based on what is the lowest-cost solution at the best quality and spec deliverable-type criteria that I can get. If I can perform the work internally at a lower cost, more effectively and within better time frames and so on, then I'll do it inside. If not, I'll outsource. So it's not an outsourcing, in-sourcing. So this isn't what's driving. What is true is that pharma, and especially large pharma, are looking for solutions that enable them to perform the work at a lower cost and more effectively. That is the primary driver of those in-sourcing, outsourcing decisions. To the degree that they can do the work, look, if all you're selling is bodies that are going to run around and visit sites and audit and fill checklists, yes, maybe it could be that it's cheaper in-house. I mean, it's not much of a benefit, right? Because why would you give any margin? If it's a cost-plus business, I do agree. But that is not what our value proposition is. We are trying to transition the business model precisely to be data analytics, expertise and technology-driven, and that is exactly our strategy. We're repositioning the business, and we believe we are in a unique position to do that. We have not seen that. I mean, some of the large pharma, specifically rumors to be stopping the out-sourcing and bringing more work inside, are precisely some of the ones with whom we've won. I wish I could give the names."

Certainly, smaller pharma and midsize biotech, it's very hard to do it in-house. It's a nonstarter. And as you know, they represented, at this point in time, a growing part of the pipeline. And so again, there's no in-sourcing there. Historically, emerging biotech has been rather reluctant to partner with larger CROs because they require high touch solution, and we, perhaps, were not as effective in providing that solution. As you know, Richard Staub, who runs our R&D business, was -- before he joined Quintiles 3 years ago, was the CEO of Novella, which was a small CRO that's precisely worked with many emerging biotech clients. He's brought this approach to Quintiles and developing a specific set of offerings and capabilities that are targeted to small biotech. And we are making inroads and being more aggressive commercially and in terms of the offering with biotech. Again, EBP requires a different set of capabilities, more customization. That could mean, for a company like Quintiles, higher cost if we were not developing a separate solution. But we are now running this separately as 2 separate offerings, obviously, leveraging the capabilities. So we are able to offer more flexible and therefore, more attractive commercially value propositions for smaller biotech, and we're making significant inroads and frankly, displacing some of the smaller guys, who had been serving that market."

And essentially, we've seen the same thing minus the drag of the less-performing -- the lower performance inherited Quintiles businesses, namely, the Advisory business, Encore and also -- to a degree, like for example, I know specifically that the real-world business, which is IMS, has been growing in the mid-teens. It's still growing in the teens, but lower mid-teens. If -- and I know because I specifically look at that and had a specific review on it.

Obviously, when you have a merger like this, things tend to happen. You get higher costs that are not necessarily adjustable that relate to achieving the synergies in the first year, and that's what's happening this year. We have costs associated. Sometimes, we have to keep 2 systems running at the same time. We could -- before we can shut that one down, et cetera. That kind of can last a year or so. There are some merger-related costs that we have to carry, especially in the first half of the year, and it cannot be added back to our non-GAAP results. And the other element here that's -- this year especially, that -- again, we spoke a little bit earlier about our investments in the next-gen solution. And we are making a lot of investments there in data, technology, people to accelerate that development. And that, perhaps, is a little bit more, and we are accelerating that. On the Commercial Solutions side, we announced this deal with salesforce.com, and we're very excited about that. And that, obviously, requires us to make some investments to transition the applications to the new platform over time, and that also is an investment we're making in the business for the long term. So despite all of that, if you look at our margin -- reported margin, this quarter was basically flattish. And the reason we are reporting that even though we are having all these extra costs and investments that I just talked about is because we continue to underlying -- in the businesses, we continue to improve our competitiveness and cost position. Plus, we have the synergies that we'll be rolling in later on. Not yet, but certainly beginning in '18 in a significant way. So underlying the business, the cost structures are continuing. But we also have added costs that I just described, which are really investments in the business. So despite all of that, our margins are not -- are okay. They -- I think we should be much higher. I mean, on the R&D side -- also, I mean, you have -- you noted that there's a mix issue. The IES business has very low margins and continues to be a drag, obviously. In some quarters, it could be a little bit higher, so it has a negative impact on margin. So again, a lot of moving parts. But in aggregate, we try -- we're going to be managing markets in a way that we seek expansion. We believe that there is significant operational improvements that can be made within the R&D business. And we're actually seeing some of that already, and that kind of offsets some of the investments we're making in next-gen and others for now."

Given the nature of the business, it's such a long-cycle business. Burn rates can fluctuate because of a number of reasons. If you win a large multiyear study, then, by definition, the burn rate is going to go down. If you win more FSP work relative to the rest, then the burn rate is going to go down because depending on the length of the contract. If you have a very strong bookings quarter, again, it's going to cause the next quarter burn rate to go down. So that -- it's hard to tell. Really, ideally, you should take a look at specific projects and specific trials and see whether revenue associated with a trial is faster or lower than where we would have been otherwise. So it's hard to compare. It's such a complex business with so many moving parts. Some of them actually can look good. And in fact, it does not necessarily indicate goodness. Or it actually can look bad, and it doesn't necessarily indicate badness. So if you ask us -- if you ask me operationally, of course, we are focusing on accelerating revenue burn, and we want to do this through systematic changes in the way we do business. Again, using more data, analytics and technology, less ""trial and error,"" experience-based site identification and patient targeting type of approach. And we believe that by doing that, we will accelerate revenue burn for individual trials that are using next-gen. And I did mention some detail on recently one such project where, again, we are able to accelerate time lines quite dramatically. And obviously, the associated revenue will come in faster."

We are pleased Q1 results came in, in line or better than what we told you to expect. Let's have a quick review of the numbers. 
Consistent with last quarter, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger had taken place January 1, 2016. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion and grew 3.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions growth was 4.3% at constant currency, and R&D Solutions revenue was negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year. Excluding this early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been about 5.5%. 
Commercial Solutions grew 2.5%, 2.4% to be precise, at constant currency. Growth in Commercial Solutions was negatively impacted by the poor performance of the legacy Quintiles Encore business, which itself declined more than 50% year-over-year. Excluding Encore, the commercial business would have grown 4%. 
Integrated Engagement Services, as expected, was slightly down. Acquisitions contributed 1 point of revenue growth, and that was evenly split between R&D and Commercial Solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, which is higher than our guidance range and about $10 million above the midpoint of the range. This beat was entirely driven by stronger operating performance. 
Let me provide some color on a few key wins in the quarter. Let's start with the Real-World Insights business. The real-world team won a $15 million deal for 2 neurology studies with a top 5 pharma client. Our global data, advanced analytics and deep therapeutic expertise in neurology set us apart from the competition. The client saw a huge benefit in using retrospective data to accelerate site identification and patient recruitment for these prospective studies in both the U.S. and Europe. 
Another top 5 pharma client signed a $12.5 million real-world deal based on our unique capability to lean diagnostic data, prescription data and demographic data to support a Phase 4 interventional diabetes study. 
Turning to our R&D Solutions business. We saw continued improvements in our as-contracted bookings trend. At the end of the quarter, we have a contracted backlog of more than $9.6 billion. Now I've never done this, but I'm going to go off-script, guys, over here. I read -- I was just reading before the call started a few of the initial notes that some of the analysts wrote, and I still see that people are still trying to calculate quarterly book-to-bill numbers even though we tried to tell you before that it is not a meaningful indicator of how we are doing. But because those calculations are all over the place, I just want to tell you that if you do the math -- and really, it is 3 elementary computations based on the numbers we reported. If you do the math, it is just below your magic number of 1.2 book-to-bill. Again, on a contracted basis for the quarter. We've said over and over, we're not going to do it, but I can't help myself. It is actually an improving booking trend that we have observed over the quarter. And again, I'm departing from script. If you were to do the same math on an awarded basis -- and we don't have the numbers because we don't report awards anymore, we report contracts. On an award basis, that book-to-bill ratio for the quarter would have been materially higher than that ""magic number of 1.2.""
Now back to the script. I know people are screaming at me here, but I couldn't help myself. We are actually very encouraged by the early demand we are seeing for our next-gen clinical development offerings. Last quarter, I told you we had won over $100 million of business with next-gen since the merger closed. We now stand at more than $400 million of awards, not all of which has contracted, tied directly to the application of next-gen of clinical development within clinical trials. The fight keeps strengthening, and our team is currently engaged in more than 80 next-gen projects. 
Recent examples of such wins include: For a large pharma client, we competed against 14 other CROs, and were selected for a preferred partnership based on our unique ability to improve study design, site ID and patient recruitment globally. The clients cited specifically our next-gen offering as a clear differentiator. We had another very significant win with a top 5 pharma client, European pharma client, who has awarded virtually no full-service clinical business to us over the past 6 years. This was a fixed-price award for more than $120 million. In landing this win, a key differentiator was our ability to quickly validate internal historic site performance data with real-world insights. The study has now kicked off. And from the get-go, we were able to demonstrate higher operational performance. The time from contract to first site selection visit was less than 30 days, an unusually rapid pace, and we are expecting to accelerate the client's planned time line for last patient in by 3 months.
On the commercial side, I'd like to highlight a very important alliance we announced with salesforce.com. This deal will enable us to build solutions on a global technology platform that is best-in-class and that will help our clients take their products to market more efficiently and more effectively. This will eventually encompass the entire cycle, from driving patient recruitment to managing client -- clinical trials to taking drugs to market more effectively with agile multichannel applications all built on a single platform. The initial focus of this alliance will be on multichannel stakeholder engagement. We will leverage salesforce's marketing cloud and force.com to enhance our existing capabilities in CRM and multichannel marketing. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail"
137473239,428195942,1191930,"Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was another strong quarter for QuintilesIMS. Let's review the details. I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First quarter revenu",1207,"Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was another strong quarter for QuintilesIMS. Let's review the details. 
I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First quarter revenue was just over $1.9 billion, an increase of 2.8% at constant currency and 1.6% reported on a combined company basis. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on our last call. As a reminder, this noncash adjustment is the result of purchase accounting rules, which, at the time of the merger, requires the elimination of IMS Health deferred revenue, which would have converted to revenue in the first quarter. 
Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, first quarter revenue grew 3.1% at constant currency and 2% reported. R&D Solutions service revenue grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3% at actual FX rates. As Ari mentioned, when adjusting for the early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year, R&D growth at constant currency was 5.5%. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue grew 2.4% at constant currency and 1.3% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a significant decline in the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Excluding Encore, constant currency Commercial Solutions growth was 4%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue declined 0.2% at constant FX and 0.9% reported. 
Turning now to profit. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $467 million. As Ari mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA performance was better than the guidance we provided last quarter due to strong operating performance. 
GAAP net income was $74 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.31. Adjusted net income was $238 million. You will recall that our adjusted net income is calculated using an adjusted book tax rate, which was about 29% in the first quarter. You should note that our cash tax rate is much lower and in the first quarter, was approximately 10%. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.01 in the first quarter. The 1.3 billion of shares that we repurchased during the quarter had no impact to first quarter adjusted diluted EPS. The strong EPS performance was primarily a result of the operational performance I just mentioned, along with slightly more than $0.01 benefit from tax. 
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. As you will recall from the previous 2 quarters, our new business and backlog metrics are now reported on an as-contracted LTM basis. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2017, R&D Solutions as-contracted bookings were $4.08 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.66 billion. We expect to convert approximately $2.9 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now as Ari mentioned, contracted bookings have continued to improve, and we are very pleased with this trend. I do want to also remind you that this is a long-cycle business, as Ari mentioned, and quarterly bookings can ebb and flow. This is why you should focus on overall backlog and LTM metrics rather than the book-to-bill in a given quarter. 
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $862 million, and debt was about $8.4 billion, resulting in net debt of about $7.5 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.3x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And net of cash, our leverage ratio was 3.8x. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $56 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million, and free cash flow was negative $22 million. As is usual during the first quarter, our free cash flow was impacted by annual incentive payments to employees. Additionally, both operating and free cash flow were impacted by cash outflows in our loyalty program businesses. These Commercial Solutions businesses manage co-pay reimbursements on behalf of our pharma customers. Our customers pre-fund these reimbursements, and we include this cash on our balance sheet. We draw on this cash to pay pharmacies as consumers use the programs. The inflows and outflows should even out over time, but in any given quarter, can cause meaningful fluctuations in reported cash flow. 
You saw that we issued EUR 1.425 billion of senior notes due in 2025. We also refinanced our Term D debt and extended its maturity to 2024. During the quarter, we repurchased $750 million worth of shares from 2 of our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder. In addition, we repurchased $550 million of shares in the open market for total share repurchases of $1.3 billion. As I mentioned earlier, this did not have any impact to adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter. We now have $231 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Let's now turn to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Now this guidance is exactly the same as last quarter. Nothing has changed. However, we did buy back $1.3 billion of our stock. We had originally planned on completing $500 million, so the additional $800 million was not in our original guidance. The additional $800 million of repurchases provides a benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS. 
Separately, we also took on additional debt that increases our interest expense and has a negative impact on full year adjusted diluted EPS. The net of these 2 items has a net benefit to full year adjusted diluted EPS of $0.04. As a result, we feel comfortable raising our EPS guidance by $0.05. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.45 and $4.60. 
For our tax rates, we expect adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year and adjusted cash tax rate to be approximately 16%. Now remember, the timing of tax payments can be lumpy, so you may see the cash tax rate vary by a few percentage points in any given quarter. As always, we would like to tell you what we see for the second quarter of 2017. At this point, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $1.93 billion and $1.97 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $470 million and $490 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.02 and $1.07.
In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered strong operational and financial performance. Our next-gen clinical development offering continues to see success in the market. We had encouraging wins with our combined Real-World Insights offering. We had steady performance in our Commercial Solutions business. We are enhancing our existing capabilities in CRM and multichannel marketing and announced an alliance with salesforce.com. We closed the bond offering for EUR 1.425 billion and extended our Term Loan B maturity until 2024. We repurchased a total of $1.3 billion of our stock, and we reaffirmed revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raised full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05. 
With that, I would like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

Again, we've tried to guide you away from this quarterly metric because it really -- I mean, I could go on and on giving you examples or -- that would show why you could derive the wrong conclusions from a number in a given quarter. The reason to address the first part of your commentary and question, the reason why the LTM is lower at the end of March than it was at the end of December is because first Q 2016 dropped out of the LTM, and it happens to be that first Q '16 was a very high number on a contracted basis. And so therefore, when you take it out of the 12 months, it's lower than the LTM at the end of December. Now if you recall, that's going to really demonstrate why it's wrong to focus on the quarter and it's also wrong to focus on awarded, and it's better to do it the way we suggest we do it now. And I just told you, the number on a contracted basis for the first quarter last year was very high. And yet, the reported quarterly book-to-bill number last year, when Quintiles was still a stand-alone company, was on an awarded basis and was 0.95, was under 1, whereas the contracted number was materially over 1. And the reason why it was materially over 1 is because, again, because we manage the business based on quarterly awards. They could be contracting in the first quarter of '16 stuff that has been awarded the year before because nobody was focusing on it. What we're trying to do here is compress the time line between award and contract, only count that which is contracted for, change operationally internally so we can compensate salesforce, et cetera, based on contracted work, not just it is awarded to you and smooth the level of cancellations and things we have to take out of the backlog because they were never meant to be in, in the first place. So again, I'm sorry for giving you the commentary, but that is the explanation for the LTM. With respect to the trend, our bookings are actually greater. It is a simple computation, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. You just do a subtraction of what the reported backlog is at the end of each quarter. You add that to the revenue reported in the quarter, that's an addition, because that's -- the revenue was converted from the beginning of period backlog. And you divide by the revenue. And if you do that, you will see that you don't have the exact precise numbers because last quarter, we said it was about 9.5. It was slightly under that, but basically went with a contracted book-to-bill for the quarter of just under 1.2. Now again, don't focus on it. It could have been 1.1 or 1.3. Let's not just -- we have an LTM of 1.16, which we feel is very good, and the trend will continue to improve based on the pipeline that we see and the awards that we generate -- that we generated in the quarter."

Or again, nobody is new to Quintiles. We have business with everybody in the world. But I mentioned, I particularly highlighted the largest such award because it kind of indicates to you what we're trying to do to change the model. This was with a top 5 European client with whom, frankly, we hadn't done very much. I think the biggest award of a full clinical service was like in the $10 million range, again, over the past 6 years, which we've looked at. We've done other work for these clients in other areas or specific work, data or stats or CSO work, but not full-service core clinical work. So this is the first time, and this is a very, very significant client with whom our [indiscernible] on core clinical was very low, to say the least. And that's -- so that's the, I think, clear indication that there is something different. And the main reason we've been able to do that is that we've demonstrated a new approach, new capabilities, which actually, as I reported in my introductory comments, we already demonstrated. The project is already ongoing. It took 30 days from the signature of the contract to the first site identification, which is really a very, very small period. And we've been able to demonstrate that to the client. Another element that's unique about it is that we were so confident and we have a good view of risk, and we were able and willing to go with a fixed-price model. Again, that's something that's new and different, and that's enabled by next-gen. So that's a powerful example that I mentioned because it's large, but there are many others, smaller size. This particular one is contracted for. And as I said, we are working on it already. But in aggregate, since the merger, we've been awarded over $400 million, which we know we -- which we know have been won directly because of next-gen. I would also point out that in a few instances, we actually were able to go back and win stuff that had been awarded to somebody else and go back with a different approach using next-gen."

Currency hasn't really changed much since we last provided guidance. It's basically no impact. I mean, we lost over a point of growth in the first quarter due to FX year-over-year, but not since we last gave guidance. So FX from the last year's second quarter has an impact. Secondly, there's the IES segment, which is very lumpy. Q2 last year for IES, I think it was disclosed, I'm just looking at my colleagues here, it was disclosed last year. There was a onetime benefit of -- if I recall, it was almost $10 million. It was onetime royalty payment that was in IES, I think."

And I mean, the business is -- we're  trying to do something about it, but it is expected to continue to provide headwind. And then again, back to the awards discussion. The awards last year were weaker, as you know. And so that -- again, it takes at least a year for revenue from those awards to translate, so there's a little bit less. So I could give you a little bit of more color on why the second quarter is maybe not as strong as you might have expected. Why then is the second half and towards the end of the year it was stronger, that's because the revenue synergies we talked about and the next-gen that we already now contracted for and is starting to produce revenue and some of the real-world stuff that we are winning, all of that is expected to more than compensate for what would otherwise have not been -- or would have been more in line with the second quarter. And also, it's not just IES. I mean, I mentioned IES, but there's also the legacy -- or Encore. The other legacy commercial business from -- what was the name of it? IHS was the name of the division that commercial points out. They have an advisory business there that's also not doing that great. So we're kind of working ourselves through all of that, and that is basically why you see, perhaps, a little weaker. But we feel comfortable. Frankly, if we didn't see that, we would have changed the guidance already, but we're not. We feel very strongly because of the bookings because of what's in the pipe and what we see coming.

Nobody decides I'm going to in-source or I'm going to outsource. That is not an ending in and of itself. The reason for outsourcing or in-sourcing are based on what is the lowest-cost solution at the best quality and spec deliverable-type criteria that I can get. If I can perform the work internally at a lower cost, more effectively and within better time frames and so on, then I'll do it inside. If not, I'll outsource. So it's not an outsourcing, in-sourcing. So this isn't what's driving. What is true is that pharma, and especially large pharma, are looking for solutions that enable them to perform the work at a lower cost and more effectively. That is the primary driver of those in-sourcing, outsourcing decisions. To the degree that they can do the work, look, if all you're selling is bodies that are going to run around and visit sites and audit and fill checklists, yes, maybe it could be that it's cheaper in-house. I mean, it's not much of a benefit, right? Because why would you give any margin? If it's a cost-plus business, I do agree. But that is not what our value proposition is. We are trying to transition the business model precisely to be data analytics, expertise and technology-driven, and that is exactly our strategy. We're repositioning the business, and we believe we are in a unique position to do that. We have not seen that. I mean, some of the large pharma, specifically rumors to be stopping the outsourcing and bringing more work inside, are precisely some of the ones with whom we've won.

And so again, there's no in-sourcing there. Historically, emerging biotech has been rather reluctant to partner with larger CROs because they require high touch solution, and we, perhaps, were not as effective in providing that solution. As you know, Richard Staub, who runs our R&D business, was -- before he joined Quintiles 3 years ago, was the CEO of Novella, which was a small CRO that's precisely worked with many emerging biotech clients. He's brought this approach to Quintiles and developing a specific set of offerings and capabilities that are targeted to small biotech. And we are making inroads and being more aggressive commercially and in terms of the offering with biotech. Again, EBP requires a different set of capabilities, more customization. That could mean, for a company like Quintiles, higher cost if we were not developing a separate solution. But we are now running this separately as 2 separate offerings, obviously, leveraging the capabilities. So we are able to offer more flexible and therefore, more attractive commercially value propositions for smaller biotech, and we're making significant inroads and frankly, displacing some of the smaller guys, who had been serving that market."

Frankly, we are spending a little bit more than we thought in ramping up the capabilities. We are hiring more people.

So it's hard even now to look at what is the growth of the legacy IMS real-world business versus the growth of the Quintiles legacy real-world business. But I -- based on what we see, to give you an example, it's very similar to what you have seen before, okay? Again, the info business traditionally is a flat business, very low single digits. And the -- what we used to call technology services business was low double digits. And essentially, we've seen the same thing minus the drag of the less-performing -- the lower performance inherited Quintiles businesses, namely, the Advisory business, Encore and also -- to a degree, like for example, I know specifically that the real-world business, which is IMS, has been growing in the mid-teens. It's still growing in the teens, but lower mid-teens. If -- and I know because I specifically look at that and had a specific review on it. And the reason for that is that the Quintiles legacy real-world business was growing at a lower rate. So we're confident we're going to -- once we integrate and so on, we are going to continue to accelerate that growth. But it did reduce our growth rates in that -- what we used to call tech services business somewhat."

But the important takeaway there is that the majority of that relates to purchase price amortization, and we don't include that, obviously, in the adjusted message. The operational depreciation is very modest. It's about $50 million. So overall -- $50 million per quarter that is.

Obviously, when you have a merger like this, things tend to happen. You get higher costs that are not necessarily adjustable that relate to achieving the synergies in the first year, and that's what's happening this year. We have costs associated. Sometimes, we have to keep 2 systems running at the same time. We could -- before we can shut that one down, et cetera. That kind of can last a year or so. There are some merger-related costs that we have to carry, especially in the first half of the year, and it cannot be added back to our non-GAAP results. And the other element here that's -- this year especially, that -- again, we spoke a little bit earlier about our investments in the next-gen solution. And we are making a lot of investments there in data, technology, people to accelerate that development. And that, perhaps, is a little bit more, and we are accelerating that. On the Commercial Solutions side, we announced this deal with salesforce.com, and we're very excited about that. And that, obviously, requires us to make some investments to transition the applications to the new platform over time, and that also is an investment we're making in the business for the long term. So despite all of that, if you look at our margin -- reported margin, this quarter was basically flattish. And the reason we are reporting that even though we are having all these extra costs and investments that I just talked about is because we continue to underlying -- in the businesses, we continue to improve our competitiveness and cost position. Plus, we have the synergies that we'll be rolling in later on. Not yet, but certainly beginning in '18 in a significant way. So underlying the business, the cost structures are continuing. But we also have added costs that I just described, which are really investments in the business. So despite all of that, our margins are not -- are okay. They -- I think we should be much higher. I mean, on the R&D side -- also, I mean, you have -- you noted that there's a mix issue. The IES business has very low margins and continues to be a drag, obviously. In some quarters, it could be a little bit higher, so it has a negative impact on margin. So again, a lot of moving parts. But in aggregate, we try -- we're going to be managing markets in a way that we seek expansion. We believe that there is significant operational improvements that can be made within the R&D business. And we're actually seeing some of that already, and that kind of offsets some of the investments we're making in next-gen and others for now."

Given the nature of the business, it's such a long-cycle business. Burn rates can fluctuate because of a number of reasons. If you win a large multiyear study, then, by definition, the burn rate is going to go down. If you win more FSP work relative to the rest, then the burn rate is going to go down because depending on the length of the contract. If you have a very strong bookings quarter, again, it's going to cause the next quarter burn rate to go down. So that -- it's hard to tell. Really, ideally, you should take a look at specific projects and specific trials and see whether revenue associated with a trial is faster or lower than where we would have been otherwise. So it's hard to compare. It's such a complex business with so many moving parts. Some of them actually can look good. And in fact, it does not necessarily indicate goodness. Or it actually can look bad, and it doesn't necessarily indicate badness. So if you ask us -- if you ask me operationally, of course, we are focusing on accelerating revenue burn, and we want to do this through systematic changes in the way we do business. Again, using more data, analytics and technology, less ""trial and error,"" experience-based site identification and patient targeting type of approach. And we believe that by doing that, we will accelerate revenue burn for individual trials that are using next-gen. And I did mention some detail on recently one such project where, again, we are able to accelerate time lines quite dramatically. And obviously, the associated revenue will come in faster."

Thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Q2 was another solid quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. Strong operational discipline and execution of our integration plans are driving results. L",1201,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Q2 was another solid quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. Strong operational discipline and execution of our integration plans are driving results. Let's review the quarter.
Consistent with the last couple of quarters, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger took place January 1, 2016. Second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance range of $1.97 billion. This revenue included $871 million for Commercial Solutions, $896 million for R&D Solutions and $204 million for Integrated Engagement Services. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the company was also close to the high end of our guidance range at $486 million. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points for the quarter. Let me provide some color behind the numbers. Let's start with our technology solutions business. 
Our tech business continues to gain traction in the market. Let me illustrate a few examples. During the quarter, we signed 2 significant deals with top 10 pharma clients for our social media technology platform for over $12 million. As a reminder, our social media technology mind and analyzes over 400,000 social media outlets to track patient sentiment. It specifically flags adverse events to help clients rapidly identify or remediate issues when they arise and satisfy regulatory reporting requirements. We do this to proprietary ontology in 52 languages; proprietary algorithms; 24/7 365 days of the year in a state of the art global monitoring center. 
We also had the significant wins with our master data management, or MDM platform, amounting to about $20 million with top 20 pharma clients. The clients will deploy our MDM solution globally, benefiting from QuintilesIMS' global implementation services, which are unmatched by our competitors.
Finally, in another illustration of progress in our technology business, we issued a press release on June 26 highlighting the launch of our new orchestrated customer engagement or OCE SaaS offering. The OCE offering will be released towards the end of the year. We are in fact accelerating investments in our salesforce.com partnership to re-platform our global CRM and MCM solutions. Stay tuned for new product releases, including in the clinical space.
Switching to our Real-World Insights business, where we also landed a few significant wins during the quarter. First, a $15 million railroad project with the top 10 pharma clients. This particular win in cardiovascular leverage a direct-to-patient, data-driven approach that enabled us to shorten timelines and accelerate patient recruitment for the project. 
The second multi-million dollar win I want to highlight in our real world business is with a top biotech company, where we displaced the existing preferred provider for a first-in-class, new to market product. Here, we applied a differentiated approach by linking primary site and investigators data from legacy Quintiles with existing secondary claims data from legacy IMS, the capability that is unmatched by our competitors.
Moving to our R&D business. We saw continued improvements and quarterly sequential increase in our as-contracted bookings. At the end of the quarter, we had a contracted backlog of just under $10 billion. To be precise, $9,990,000,000. Now I know there is a lot of discussion about market trends in the R&D space and in the CRO space, so let me tell you what we see in the market. 
On a macro level, the total number of molecules in clinical development continues to increase across all stages of the pipeline. The number of molecules in Phase 1, 2 and 3 are at the highest levels since at least 2001. FDA approvals in 2017 are tracking well ahead of 2016. As you all know, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb has signaled policy and regulatory shifts so that we believe will support life sciences innovation, potentially accelerating clinical development and reducing regulatory risk. 
On a micro level at QuintilesIMS and in addition to the underlying market forces, integration efforts are enabling us to rethink how operations are conducted, and we are laser-focused on modernizing the approach we take to many of the traditional CRO processes. We are in fact winning business with clients that the legacy Quintiles organization had done very little R&D work with in the past. And we have specifically secured wins with previously locked out accounts. 
Now you are familiar with our next-gen clinical development offering. It's been instrumental in supporting these wins. In fact, more than $600 million of awards since the merger have leveraged next-gen capabilities. We are also winning with emerging BioPharma clients, and I'd like to give a couple examples of next-gen EBP wins that in combination of a value of $50 million. 
The first example is a win in Asia, where the client selected us because of our ability to provide an end-to-end solution from evidence driven protocol design to precision site ID. The second example is a sole provider win in Europe, which was driven by our ability to leverage our real-world data, advanced analytics and domain expertise in combination to answer the client's strategic therapeutic questions in COPD and asthma.
I also want to provide a quick update on progress with the $120 million fixed-price award that we won with a top 5 pharma client last quarter and which we discussed in -- on the call. 
To date, we greatly exceeded all of the legacy Quintiles historical timeline benchmarks across all geographies. In fact, the client awarded us 2 additional multi-million dollar full service contracts in other therapeutic areas during the quarter, demonstrating their confidence in our solutions. As a reminder, legacy Quintiles had done virtually no full-service clinical work with these clients over the previous 6-year period.
Now the traction we see in the marketplace for our next-gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in next-gen operationalization and resourcing plans. Once again, we see that in each of our business, the basis for our differentiation continues to be our integrated approach to reach data, new technologies, advanced analytics and significant domain expertise. Of course, we are striving to be best-in-class with each of these capabilities. But what truly sets us apart is the way we integrate these capabilities across the portfolio to bring highly differentiated solutions within each of the clinical and commercial markets we operate in. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to announce that we are holding an analyst and investor conference in New York City later this year. Please hold the date of November 8. We are planning a morning event, probably running from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and this will be shortly after our third quarter earnings call. The focus will not be on the numbers, but on the launch of strategy and progress of the business. 
The day will highlight some of our technology capabilities and will be more comprehensive than the demos some of you have already seen. More importantly, this will give you all an opportunity to meet a broader cross-section of managements. We're looking forward to this event and hope you can all attend. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."
137473239,531486991,1264655,"Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another solid quarter for Quintiles IMS. Let's review the details. As in previous quarters, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the p",1418,"Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another solid quarter for Quintiles IMS. Let's review the details. 
As in previous quarters, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. Second quarter revenue was $1.97 billion, which was the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on the last couple of calls. This quarter, it negatively impacted revenue by $2 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis, second quarter revenue grew 1.2% at constant currency and 0.1% for the quarter. 
On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue of $871 million grew just under 2% at constant currency and 0.6% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles Encore business and headwinds from the legacy Quintiles advisory consulting business. Excluding Encore, growth in Commercial Solutions was about 2.5% at constant currency. We sold the Encore business after the close of the second quarter and recorded an impairment charge in Q2 to reflect the sales price.
This business is not part of our strategic vision. And as a result of the sale, we will have some tax benefits. 
R&D Solutions service revenue of $896 million grew 1.7% at constant currency and 0.4% at actual FX rates. Growth was impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016 as well as weaker bookings and higher cancellations in the third quarter of 2016. 
When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth at constant currency was about 3%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $204 million declined 2.1% at constant currency and 3.7% at actual FX rates. Revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by a one-time $9 million royalty acceleration in 2016.
Turning now to profit. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $486 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7% expanded 100 basis points. GAAP net income was $75 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.34. Adjusted net income a was $242 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the quarter. Now let's turn to the results for the first half.
Again, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. First half revenue was just under $3.9 billion. Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, first half revenue grew 2.2% at constant currency and 1% reported. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue of $1.72 billion grew 2.1% at constant currency and 0.9% reported. 
Excluding Encore, Commercial Solutions growth was about 3% at constant currency. R&D Solutions service revenue of $1.76 billion grew 2.9% at constant currency and 1.7% at actual FX rates. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth was 4% at constant currency.
Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $400 million declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported. Turning to R&D Solutions, net new business and backlog. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, R&D Solutions as-contracted bookings were $4.03 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.99 billion. We expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
As you know, we began reporting our bookings on an as-contracted basis rather than an as-awarded basis. This approach began with the third quarter of 2016, which was the last quarter of Quintiles standalone reporting. As we now have 4 quarters on the as-contracted approach, we feel that it is appropriate to provide some additional color on the bookings. 
As you can see from the chart, our bookings trend has improved steadily each quarter since we closed the merger. For the last 12 months since we started reporting as contracted, the book-to-bill is 1.14. Looking at the last 9 months since we closed the merger and began reporting on a combined basis, the book-to-bill is 1.21. Looking at the last 6 months since the beginning of 2017, the year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.24. And looking at this quarter, we had a book to bill of 1.30.
Now if you were to back calculate the book-to-bill in the quarter by taking the difference in backlog and backing out revenue, you would get a book-to-bill on a quarter of 1.37. This includes a small positive benefit from the revaluation of the entire ending backlog at spot FX rates at the end of the quarter. We feel that using for bookings the same average rate used for revenue over the quarter is a better indication of actual activity in the quarter, allows for more consistent comparisons across periods and in this case, is more conservative. Turning now to profit for the first half of the year.
First half adjusted EBITDA was $953 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.6% expanded 50 basis points. GAAP net income was $149 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65 for the first 6 months of 2017. Adjusted net income was $480 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.10 in the first half of the year.
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $902 million and that was about $9 billion, resulting in net debt of about $8.1 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.1x. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $245 million in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $100 million and free cash flow was $145 million.
During the second quarter, the Board approved an increase in our postmerger share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion to $3.5 billion. We repurchased $300 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder at the end of May. And towards the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $78 million worth of our shares in the open market for a total of $378 million repurchases during the quarter.
At the end of the second quarter, we had $853 million remaining of our share repurchase authorization. Let's now turn to guidance.
We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05. You will recall that we also increased the 2017 EPS guidance range by $0.05 last quarter. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion; and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.65, up from $4.45 to $4.60. The basis for our adjusted diluted EPS raise is a change in our adjusted book tax rate expectation. To date, our adjusted book tax rate has been approximately 29%, and we anticipate it will remain at this level for the rest of the year.
This incremental 1% benefit below the line will increase our adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.05 for the year. 
For our cash tax rate, we now expect approximately 15% for the year, down from our previous guidance of approximately 16%. For the third quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2 billion and $2.03 billion, reflecting the general strength of the business. Adjusted EBITDA to be between $500 million and $515 million, reflecting continued operational improvements, offset by accelerated investments in next-gen capability development, as Ari mentioned, as well as accelerated investments in salesforce.com, CRM and MCM re-platforming efforts in anticipation of the upcoming product launch later this year. And adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.10 and $1.15. 
In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered on our financial commitments. We are investing in all areas of the business for future growth. We are making progress with the salesforce.com alliance, and we remain excited at our product releases for both clinical and commercial technology. We have a strong R&D Solutions pipeline. Next-gen continues to gain traction with new wins in the quarter. And we continue to deploy our capital effectively and has bought back 2.7 billion worth of our shares at an average price of $78.81 since we closed the merger.
With that, I would like to ask Alex to please open the lines to Q&A."

We continuously look for and have a rich pipeline of small tuck-in capability acquisitions. These are, for the most part, and I want to say exclusively this year, technology acquisitions, both in the commercial space and the clinical space. This quarter, there were a few handful of small acquisition, all of which closed at the end of the quarter and has 0 impact in the quarter. As we've told you before, we may pay a healthy premium because again, we're buying a technology capability. It's a decision to continue to develop our assets through acquisitions instead of internal Product Development spend. Initially, this acquisition have very little revenue contribution and the acquisition spend can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. But that's what we signaled before. It's not rich. And we expect to answer your question in terms of contribution to revenue, that acquisitions will contribute year in, year out, 1 point, 1.5 point to our growth, and this won't be different."

So the -- look, the guidance we gave is a based on our forecast both for -- every time we did so for the quarter and for the year. Our guidance and revenue and EBITDA have a range and that chain has not changed. As always, there are puts and takes aspects of the business that are doing better than we thought and others that are perhaps weaker-than-anticipated. We also got rid of the Encore business earlier this month or last month. And so you won't be in our numbers. And I wish of that piece of revenue is out. [indiscernible] a little bit assuming FX rates we may have a little bit of tailwind from FX, which may offset that loss of revenue. And bear in mind on the FX rate is rather a headwind on EBITDA rather than a tailwind that it maybe on revenue simply because we do a lot of work overseas. And at the EPS line, we are hedged largely because we've got also euro-denominated currencies. And the FX movements are very complicated because of the number of the country synergy we do business and the large number of currencies that are fluctuating constantly. So with respect to your specific questions in terms of the ramp, look, there are some merger-related costs that we've had throughout the first 2 quarters and we believe will continue in the third quarter. I've said before, there are redundant costs that we continue to carry that we cannot adjust out of the P&L of our adjusted EBITDA numbers. Now those are going to continue in the third quarter, and a portion of those are going to be -- were going to be able to removed in the fourth quarter. So that's one aspects. Secondly, there are -- when we plan for the year, we had anticipate a progression of our investments in both the R&D side and the technology side. We are actually accelerating some of these investments and our resourcing plan. And so the third quarter carry some of that in a sense some of the investments that had been planned in Q4 will take place in Q3. That's another reason why you might see a bigger ramp than you might have otherwise anticipated. We also announced the salesforce.com initiative alliance, which again we had not anticipated earlier in the year. And that is causing us to invest more in people and software development and so on. And again, all of that is also accelerating because we now believe we'd be able to launch the products towards the end of the year. So all of that affects, if you will, the ramp on EBITDA in the fourth quarter. But nothing unusual. Each of those is a relatively small number in isolation and it's a few relation of that, that perhaps did that -- gives you a sense that it's a bigger ramp in the fourth quarter. Yes, Eric."

So again, in terms of numbers, specifically, we continue to ramp up the salesforce recruitment dedicated to R&D. We've increased that salesforce that's dedicated and specialized by about 50% to date. And we have also trained 1,000 IMS salespeople in -- at the early stages of business development and sales for R&D as well. Thanks for your question."

What we wanted to do and we said this up front is to try to production nice ""The process."" To accelerate our response time and minimize the degree of customization. Again, there will always be an element of customization. We are well on our way by the end of the year to ""Having production nice,"" means having loaded in the data and standardize the data minding and algorithms required to accelerate site identification, optimal site identification for a given product or design for a dozen main therapy. The issue is how fast can you go across all specific decision therapies. So we think that this is going to cover probably 80% to 90% of what the RFPs in which we believe next-gen will be relevant and useful, which as we said before, it's at least half of the portfolio of the pipeline. So that's where we are today and this is exactly where we wanted to be. The biggest hurdle is to recruit the type of people that we need. Today, we have 110, I think, the last time we saw a people of what we call the AOC be advanced analytics center of excellence. And that's the full-time dedicated team, the AC OE, I'm sorry, I don't remember. But advanced analytics center of excellence, which we have created reporting to [indiscernible] and led by Natalia Barco, who some of you have met. We have this team of over 100 people full-time working on the operationalization of how we respond to RFPs, where we think next-gen has relevance. Bear in mind, we are also trying to use next-gen in the existing set of trials that we are working on and it's really the same team. So at this time, the main constrained to even going faster than we have thought is simply the ability to recruit to the type of people we won. I mean, we are really having data scientists, statisticians, software development. People is just not so easy to recruit globally, but we're making good progress."

We aim for nothing short of disrupting the way clinical trials are conducted. So historically, this is an industry that's paid for in efficiency. And it is the biggest probably health care is inefficiency over inefficiency. People are paid for time. And without nothing in it, specific profession is the longer it takes, it's like lawyers, the longer it takes, the more time you take and the more money you make, the more costs you have because essentially, your cost-plus type of business model, from an economic standpoint, the more cost you have, the more waste you have, the more rework you have, more change orders you have, the more revenue you generate. And so there is a kind of inherent conflict in the industry where no one wants to shoot themselves in the foot, so to speak, and then that's their business model. Well, we want to change that. We believe that more visibility, more predictability, more data enabled and technology enabled processes, you can actually share risk with clients in a better way with more visibility, an educated risk. And we are willing to do it in our early for us into this business model change show that clients are A, much more receptive, and B, see the results in trials of that are very complex, like the one I discussed before. Again, this is not just a hurdle to overcome because the whole industry is based on the different types of business model. Clients are accustomed to their business differently. And even our own people are accustomed to doing business differently. So it's all our culture overall that we need, and we believe strongly this vision and we want to move forward. It's too early to show you metrics because we'll have enough of those. And as you know, it's a long cycle business. So even if you win a trial today, it's going to take time. Now this particular story is very large, very complex. It's essentially locked out account. There are many people competing in the same therapy. It's an oncology therapy. So side application is even more difficult, and we're beating all timeline historically. And we're specifically tracking. Now one trial is not enough to make it a science, but we feel very confident. And hopefully, over time, we've developed enough our database to support the thesis. And I can tell you clients are extremely receptive to our vision."

Sandy, you're correct. When we bought Cegedim, and by the way, acquired or developed internally a number of technology platforms, we intended fully to try and regain some of the market share losses of the historical legacy Cegedim organization. Just for a reminder, we are #2 in the specifically defined, narrowly defined CRM market. Cegedim had been #1 historically going back 5 to 10 years. And they were in the market through the on-premise have the no obviously type of platform. And we have introduced the mobile intelligence, which was the SaaS-based platform. However, all the time as you recall, we -- because we have a wide suite of applications, we saw the need for a new type of offering that would integrate marketing insights with sales data across several platforms and make those interoperable. Now in so doing because we had developed applications on a lot of different platforms and we had internally developed platforms and acquired platforms, in order to integrate all of these applications, the cost to do so and the speed to market were very high. We decided to re-platform everything on horizontal existing of the shelf industry platforms. We considered several options, and we ended up building an alliance with SLBC with which we are extremely pleased in terms of how it's playing out. And that alliance, by the way, thanks to the clinical space as well. We believe this will enable us even better to recapture market share, specifically in the CRM business, with our upcoming OCE SaaS application. Again, when a doctor reads a marketing e-mail from a pharma company, the sales rep that visit this doctor doesn't know to date that the doctor read the e-mail because of the marketing system and the sales system are not interoperable. With that platform, we find when the doctor read the e-mail, whether there was a specific ration. We find the rep that has that doctor in that territory and if the doctor within the next 7 days, we can immediately notify that rep. Again, it's a much more targeted precision sales performance that we are looking for. And it's really the next generation of commercial application that we believe that this will enable us to recapture market share on the tech space."

Thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Q2 was another solid quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. Strong operational discipline and execution of our integration plans are driving results. Let's review the quarter.
Consistent with the last couple of quarters, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger took place January 1, 2016. Second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance range of $1.97 billion. This revenue included $871 million for Commercial Solutions, $896 million for R&D Solutions and $204 million for Integrated Engagement Services. Adjusted EBITDA for the company was also close to the high end of our guidance range at $486 million. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points for the quarter.
Let me provide some color behind the numbers. Let's start with our technology solutions business. Our tech business continues to gain traction in the market. Let me illustrate with a few examples.
During the quarter, we signed 2 significant deals with top 10 pharma clients for our social media technology platform for over $12 million. As a reminder, our social media technology mines and analyzes over 400,000 social media outlets to track patient sentiment. It specifically flags adverse events to help clients rapidly identify or remediate issues when they arise and satisfy regulatory reporting requirements. We do this to proprietary ontology in 52 languages, proprietary algorithms, 24/7, 365 days of the year in a state-of-the-art global monitoring center.
We also had the significant wins with our master data management or MDM platform amounting to about $20 million with top 20 pharma clients. The clients will deploy our MDM solution globally, benefiting from QuintilesIMS' global implementation services, which are unmatched by our competitors.
Finally, in another illustration of progress in our technology business, we issued a press release on June 26 highlighting the launch of our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement or OCE SaaS offering. The OCE offering will be released towards the end of the year. We are in fact accelerating investments in our salesforce.com partnership to replatform our global CRM and MCM solutions. Stay tuned for new product releases, including in the clinical space.
Switching to our Real-World Insights business, where we also landed a few significant wins during the quarter. First, a $15 million Real-World project with a top 10 pharma client. This particular win in cardiovascular leverage a direct-to-patient, data-driven approach that enables us to shorten time lines and accelerate patient recruitment for the project.
The second multi-million dollar win I want to highlight in our Real-World business is with a top biotech company, where we displaced the existing preferred provider for a first-in-class, new-to-market product. Here, we applied a differentiated approach by linking primary site and investigators' data from legacy Quintiles with existing secondary claims data from legacy IMS, a capability that is unmatched by our competitors.
Moving to our R&D business. We saw continued improvements and another quarterly sequential increase in our as-contracted bookings. At the end of the quarter, we had a contracted backlog of just under $10 billion. To be precise, $9,990,000,000. Now I know there is a lot of discussion about market trends in the R&D space and in the CRO space, so let me tell you what we see in the market.
On a macro level, the total number of molecules in clinical development continues to increase across all stages of the pipeline. The number of molecules in Phase I, II and III are at the highest levels since at least 2001. FDA approvals in 2017 are tracking well ahead of 2016. As you all know, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb has signaled policy and regulatory shifts that we believe will support life sciences innovation, potentially accelerating clinical development and reducing regulatory risk.
On a micro level at QuintilesIMS and in addition to these underlying market forces, integration efforts are enabling us to rethink how operations are conducted, and we are laser-focused on modernizing the approach we take to many of the traditional CRO processes. We are in fact winning business with clients that the legacy Quintiles organization had done very little R&D work with in the past. And we have specifically secured wins with previously locked-out accounts.
Now you are familiar with our next-gen clinical development offering. It's been instrumental in supporting these wins. In fact, more than $600 million of awards since the merger have leveraged next-gen capabilities. We are also winning with emerging biopharma clients, and I'd like to give a couple examples of next-gen EBP wins that, in combination, have a value of $50 million.
The first example is a win in Asia, where the client selected us because of our ability to provide an end-to-end solution, from evidence driven protocol design to precision site ID. The second example is a sole provider win in Europe, which was driven by our ability to leverage our real-world data, advanced analytics and domain expertise, in combination to answer the client's strategic therapeutic questions in COPD and asthma.
I also want to provide a quick update on progress with the $120 million fixed-price award that we won with a top 5 pharma client last quarter and which we discussed on the call.
To date, we greatly exceeded all of the legacy Quintiles historical time line benchmarks across all geographies. In fact, the client awarded us 2 additional multimillion dollar full service contracts in other therapeutic areas during the quarter, demonstrating their confidence in our solutions. As a reminder, legacy Quintiles had done virtually no full-service clinical work with these clients over the previous 6-year period.
Now the traction we see in the marketplace for our next-gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in next-gen operationalization and resourcing plans. Once again, we see that in each of our business, the basis for our differentiation continues to be our integrated approach to rich data, new technologies, advanced analytics and significant domain expertise.
Of course, we are striving to be best-in-class in each of these capabilities. But what truly sets us apart is the way we integrate these capabilities across the portfolio to bring highly differentiated solutions within each of the clinical and commercial markets we operate in.
Before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to announce that we are holding an analyst and investor conference in New York City later this year. Please hold the date of November 8. We're planning a morning event, probably running from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and this will be shortly after our third quarter earnings call. The focus will not be on the numbers, but on the launch of strategy and progress of the business.
The day will highlight some of our technology capabilities and will be more comprehensive than the demos some of you have already seen. More importantly, this will give you all an opportunity to meet a broader cross-section of management. We're looking forward to this event and hope you can all attend.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."

Q2 was another solid quarter for Quintiles IMS. Let's review the details.
As in previous quarters, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. Second quarter revenue was $1.97 billion, which was the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on the last couple of calls. This quarter, it negatively impacted revenue by $2 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis, second quarter revenue grew 1.2% at constant currency and 0.1% for the quarter.
On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue of $871 million grew just under 2% at constant currency and 0.6% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles Encore business and headwinds from the legacy Quintiles advisory consulting business. Excluding Encore, growth in Commercial Solutions was about 2.5% at constant currency. We sold the Encore business after the close of the second quarter and recorded an impairment charge in Q2 to reflect the sales price. This business is not part of our strategic vision. And as a result of the sale, we will have some tax benefits.
R&D Solutions service revenue of $896 million grew 1.7% at constant currency and 0.4% at actual FX rates. Growth was impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016 as well as weaker bookings and higher cancellations in the third quarter of 2016. When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth at constant currency was about 3%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $204 million declined 2.1% at constant currency and 3.7% at actual FX rates. Revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by a onetime $9 million royalty acceleration in 2016.
Turning now to profit. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $486 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7% expanded 100 basis points. GAAP net income was $75 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.34. Adjusted net income was $242 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the quarter.
Now let's turn to the results for the first half. Again, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page.
First half revenue was just under $3.9 billion. Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, first half revenue grew 2.2% at constant currency and 1% reported. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue of $1.72 billion grew 2.1% at constant currency and 0.9% reported. Excluding Encore, Commercial Solutions growth was about 3% at constant currency.
R&D Solutions service revenue of $1.76 billion grew 2.9% at constant currency and 1.7% at actual FX rates. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth was 4% at constant currency. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $400 million declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported.
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, R&D Solutions' as-contracted bookings were $4.03 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.99 billion. We expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months.
As you know, we began reporting our bookings on an as-contracted basis rather than an as-awarded basis. This approach began with the third quarter of 2016, which was the last quarter of Quintiles' standalone reporting. As we now have 4 quarters on the as-contracted approach, we feel that it is appropriate to provide some additional color on the bookings.
As you can see from the chart, our bookings trend has improved steadily each quarter since we closed the merger. For the last 12 months since we started reporting as contracted, the book-to-bill is 1.14. Looking at the last 9 months since we closed the merger and began reporting on a combined basis, the book-to-bill is 1.21. Looking at the last 6 months since the beginning of 2017, the year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.24. And looking at this quarter, we had a book-to-bill of 1.30.
Now if you were to back calculate the book-to-bill in the quarter by taking this difference in backlog and backing out revenue, you would get book-to-bill on the quarter of 1.37. This includes a small positive benefit from the revaluation of the entire ending backlog at spot FX rates at the end of the quarter. We feel that using for bookings the same average rate used for revenue over the quarter is a better indication of actual activity in the quarter, allows for more consistent comparisons across periods and in this case, is more conservative.
Turning now to profit for the first half of the year. First half adjusted EBITDA was $953 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.6% expanded 50 basis points. GAAP net income was $149 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65 for the first 6 months of 2017. Adjusted net income was $480 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.10 in the first half of the year.
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $902 million and debt was about $9 billion, resulting in net debt of about $8.1 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.1x. Cash flow from operating activities was $245 million in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $100 million and free cash flow was $145 million.
During the second quarter, the board approved an increase in our post-merger share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion to $3.5 billion. We repurchased $300 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder at the end of May. And towards the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $78 million worth of our shares in the open market for a total of $378 million repurchases during the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we had $853 million remaining of our share repurchase authorization.
Let's now turn to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05. You will recall that we also increased the 2017 EPS guidance range by $0.05 last quarter. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion; and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.65, up from $4.45 to $4.60.
The basis for our adjusted diluted EPS raise is a change in our adjusted book tax rate expectation. To date, our adjusted book tax rate has been approximately 29%, and we anticipate it will remain at this level for the rest of the year. This incremental 1% benefit below the line will increase our adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.05 for the year.
For our cash tax rate, we now expect approximately 15% for the year, down from our previous guidance of approximately 16%. For the third quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2 billion and $2.03 billion, reflecting the general strength of the business; adjusted EBITDA to be between $500 million and $515 million, reflecting continued operational improvements, offset by accelerated investments in next-gen capability development, as Ari mentioned, as well as accelerated investments in salesforce.com, CRM and MCM replatforming efforts in anticipation of the upcoming product launch later this year; and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.10 and $1.15.
In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered on our financial commitments. We are investing in all areas of the business for future growth. We are making progress with the salesforce.com alliance and we remain excited at our product releases for both clinical and commercial technology. We have a strong R&D Solutions pipeline. Next gen continues to gain traction with new wins in the quarter, and we continue to deploy our capital effectively and have bought back $2.7 billion worth of our shares at an average price of $78.81 since we closed the merger.
With that, I would like to ask Alex to please open the lines for Q&A."

This quarter, there were a few handful of small acquisitions, all of which closed at the end of the quarter and has 0 impact in the quarter. As we've told you before, we may pay a healthy premium because again, we're buying technology capabilities. It's a decision to continue to develop our assets through acquisitions instead of internal product development spend. Initially, this acquisition have very little revenue contribution and the acquisition spend can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. But that's what we signaled before. It's not rich. And we expect, to answer your question in terms of contribution to revenue, that acquisitions will contribute year in, year out, 1 point, 1.5 points to our growth, and this year won't be different."

So the -- look, the guidance we gave is a based on our forecast both for -- every time we did so for the quarter and for the year. Our guidance on revenue and EBITDA has a range and have changed -- that has not changed. As always, there are puts and takes aspects of the business that are doing better than we thought and others that are perhaps weaker than we had anticipated. We also got rid of the Encore business earlier this month or last month, and so you won't be in our numbers. I wish that piece of the revenue is out. [indiscernible] we have a little bit -- assuming the FX rates remains where they are, we may have a little bit of tailwind from FX, which we offset that loss of revenue. And bear in mind on -- the FX rate is rather a headwind on EBITDA rather than a tailwind that it may be on revenue simply because we do a lot of work overseas. And at the EPS line, we are hedged largely because we've got also euro-denominated currencies. And the FX movements are very complicated because of the number of the countries in which we do business and the large number of currencies that are fluctuating constantly. So with respect to your specific questions in terms of the ramp, look, there are some merger-related costs that we've had throughout the first 2 quarters and we believe will continue in the third quarter. I've said before, there are redundant costs that we continue to carry, that we cannot adjust out of the P&L, of our adjusted EBITDA numbers. And those are going to continue in the third quarter, and a portion of those are going to be -- we're going to be able to remove in the fourth quarter. So that's one aspect. Secondly, there are -- when we plan for the year, we had anticipated a progression of our investments in both the R&D side and the technology side. We are actually accelerating some of these investments and our resourcing plans. And so the third quarter carry some of that. In a sense, it -- some of the investments that had been planned in Q4 will take place in Q3. That's another reason why you might see a bigger ramp than you might have otherwise anticipated. We also announced the salesforce.com initiative alliance, which, again, we have not anticipated earlier in the year. And that is causing us to invest more in people and software development and so on. And again, all of that is also accelerating because we now believe we'd be able to launch the products towards the end of the year. So all of that affects, if you will, the ramp on EBITDA in the fourth quarter, but nothing unusual. Each of those is a relatively small number in isolation and it's the accumulation of that, that perhaps did that -- gives you the sense that it's a bigger ramp in the fourth quarter."

It's the end of the year, and pharma has budgets that -- marketing and commercial budgets that they look to spend. And the fourth quarter typically has been the strongest. A lot of purchases of what we call ad hoc data packages, most of that comes at the end of the year. So if you look historically, the IMS legacy business is weaker in the third quarter. I think Q2, we had seasonality, with seasonality of Q3 as being the weakest historically and Q4 the strongest.

And it's not easy to ramp up to where we want to be, but we have increased that number materially by probably about 50% at this point. And secondly, we have also trained -- as you know, we've said before, we've reorganized our go-to-market strategy globally and we have regionalized the go-to market approaches, North America, Europe and Asia. And we have combined our accounts managements across clinical and commercial markets. We're having the process trained 1,000 legacy IMS salespeople on R&D business developments. So they are helping us opening doors, create the meetings that otherwise would simply not have been open to the legacy Quintiles organization before. We -- they are able to engage in conversations, learn about RFPs earlier in the process and involve them, the domain experts from the R&D organizations, at the right time.

Look, when we say -- what we really wanted to do, there's always an element of customization, right? Every study is unique. What we wanted to do and we said this upfront is to try to ""productionize"" the process, to accelerate our response time and minimize the degree of customization. Again, there will always be an element of customization. We are well on our way, by the end of the year, to having ""productionized,"" which means having loaded in the data and standardize the data mining and algorithms required to accelerate site identification, optimal site identification for a given product or design for a dozen main therapies. The issue is how fast can you go across all specific decision therapies. So we think that this is going to cover probably 80% to 90% of the RFPs in which we believe next gen will be relevant and useful, which, as we said before, is at least half of the portfolio or the pipeline. So that's where we are today and this is exactly where we wanted to be. The biggest hurdle is to recruit the type of people that we need. Today, we have 110, I think, by the last time I saw, of people in what we call the AOC -- the advanced Analytics Center of Excellence. And that's the full-time dedicated team -- the ACOE, I'm sorry, I don't remember what it stands for, but advanced Analytics Center of Excellence, in which we have created, reporting to Cynthia Verst and led by Natalia Balko, who some of you have met. We have this team of over 100 people full-time working on the operationalization of how we respond to RFPs, where we think next gen has relevance. Bear in mind, we are also trying to use next gen in the existing set of trials that we are working on and it's really the same team. So at this time, the main constraint to even going faster than we have thought is simply the ability to recruit to the type of people we want. I mean, we're really having data scientists, statisticians, software development. People is just not so easy to recruit globally, but we're making good progress."

We aim for nothing short of disrupting the way clinical trials are conducted. So historically, this is an industry that's paid for inefficiency. And it is one -- the biggest probably health care is inefficiency over inefficiency. People are paid for time. And without knocking on every specific profession is -- the longer it takes -- it's like lawyers. The longer it takes, the more time you take and the more money you make, the more costs you have because essentially, your cost plus type of business model, from an economic standpoint, the more cost you have, the more waste you have, the more rework you have, the more change orders you have, the more revenue you generate. And so there is a kind of an inherent conflict in the industry where no one wants to shoot themselves in the foot, so to speak, and damage their business model. Well, we want to change that. We believe that with more visibility, more predictability, more data-enabled and technology-enabled processes, you can actually share risk with clients in a better way with more visibility, an educated risk, and we are willing to do it. And our early forays into this business model change show that clients are a, much more receptive; and b, see the results in trials that are very complex like the one I discussed before. Again, this is not just a hurdle to overcome because the whole industry is based on the different types of business model. Clients are accustomed doing business differently, and even our own people are accustomed to doing business differently. So it's sort of a cultural overhaul that we need, and we believe strongly in this vision and we want to move forward. It's too early to show you metrics because we don't have enough of those. And as you know, it's a long-cycle business. So even if we win a trial today, it's going to take time. Now this particular trial is very large, very complex. It's with a previously essentially locked out account. There are many people competing in the same therapy. It's an oncology therapy, and so site identification is even more difficult and we're beating all time lines historically that we're specifically tracking. Now one trial is not enough to make it a science, but we feel very confident. And hopefully, over time, we've developed enough of our database to support the thesis. And I can tell you, clients are extremely receptive to our vision."

Just trying to think about the product road map. I remember, I don't know, 1.5 years, maybe 2 years ago, you guys were talking about, after the Cedegim acquisition, that the new Internet platform and you have gotten a little traction with some smaller biotechs, I think on the CRM side, and we're really targeting the potential renewal cycle that was going to be coming up in '18. As you now have the sales force partnership, does that change things? I'm just trying to think about where the product strategy and cycle is in terms of that upcoming replacement cycle and what you really see the opportunities for you guys over in '18 and '19 on the technology side of IMS?"

Sandy, the -- you're correct. When we bought Cegedim and by the way, acquired or developed internally a number of technology platforms, we intended fully to try and regain some of the market share losses of the historical legacy Cegedim organization. Just for a reminder, we are #2 in the specifically defined, narrowly defined CRM market. Cegedim had been #1 historically, going back 5 to 10 years. And they were in the market through the on-premise heavy, now obsolete, type of platform. And we have introduced Mobile Intelligence, which was the SaaS-based platform. However, all the time, as you recall, we -- because we have a wide suite of applications, we saw the need for a new type of offering that would integrate marketing insights with sales data across several platforms and make those interoperable. Now in so doing, because we had developed applications on a lot of different platforms and we had internally developed platforms and acquired platforms, in order to integrate all of these applications, the cost to do so and the speed to market were very high. We decided to replatform everything on horizontal existing off-the-shelf industry platforms. We considered several options and we ended up building an alliance with [ SLDC ] with which we are extremely pleased in terms of how it's playing out. And that alliance, by the way, thanks to the clinical space as well. We believe this will enable us even better to recapture market share, specifically in the CRM business with our upcoming OCE SaaS application. Again, when a doctor reads a marketing e-mail from a pharma company, the sales rep that visited this doctor doesn't know to date that the doctor read the e-mail because the marketing system and the sales system are not interoperable. So with our platform, we find when the doctor read the e-mail, whether there was a specific reaction. We find the rep that has that doctor in that territory and if the doctor is in that rep's [ call-on ] within the next 7 days, we can immediately notify that rep. Again, it's a much more targeted precision sales performance that we are looking for. And it's really the next generation of commercial application that we believe that this will enable us to recapture market share on the tech space."

Thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Q2 was another solid quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. Strong operational discipline and execution of our integration plans are driving results. Let's review the quarter.
Consistent with the last couple of quarters, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger took place January 1, 2016. Second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance range of $1.97 billion. This revenue included $871 million for Commercial Solutions, $896 million for R&D Solutions and $204 million for Integrated Engagement Services. Adjusted EBITDA for the company was also close to the high end of our guidance range at $486 million. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points for the quarter.
Let me provide some color behind the numbers. Let's start with our technology solutions business. Our tech business continues to gain traction in the market. Let me illustrate with a few examples.
During the quarter, we signed 2 significant deals with top 10 pharma clients for our social media technology platform for over $12 million. As a reminder, our social media technology mines and analyzes over 400,000 social media outlets to track patient sentiment. It specifically flags adverse events to help clients rapidly identify or remediate issues when they arise and satisfy regulatory reporting requirements. We do this to proprietary ontology in 52 languages, proprietary algorithms, 24/7, 365 days of the year in a state-of-the-art global monitoring center.
We also had the significant wins with our master data management or MDM platform amounting to about $20 million with top 20 pharma clients. The clients will deploy our MDM solution globally, benefiting from QuintilesIMS' global implementation services, which are unmatched by our competitors.
Finally, in another illustration of progress in our technology business, we issued a press release on June 26 highlighting the launch of our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement or OCE SaaS offering. The OCE offering will be released towards the end of the year. We are in fact accelerating investments in our salesforce.com partnership to replatform our global CRM and MCM solutions. Stay tuned for new product releases, including in the clinical space.
Switching to our Real-World Insights business, where we also landed a few significant wins during the quarter. First, a $15 million Real-World project with a top 10 pharma client. This particular win in cardiovascular leverage a direct-to-patient, data-driven approach that enables us to shorten time lines and accelerate patient recruitment for the project.
The second multi-million dollar win I want to highlight in our Real-World business is with a top biotech company, where we displaced the existing preferred provider for a first-in-class, new-to-market product. Here, we applied a differentiated approach by linking primary site and investigators' data from legacy Quintiles with existing secondary claims data from legacy IMS, a capability that is unmatched by our competitors.
Moving to our R&D business. We saw continued improvements and another quarterly sequential increase in our as-contracted bookings. At the end of the quarter, we had a contracted backlog of just under $10 billion. To be precise, $9,990,000,000. Now I know there is a lot of discussion about market trends in the R&D space and in the CRO space, so let me tell you what we see in the market.
On a macro level, the total number of molecules in clinical development continues to increase across all stages of the pipeline. The number of molecules in Phase I, II and III are at the highest levels since at least 2001. FDA approvals in 2017 are tracking well ahead of 2016. As you all know, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb has signaled policy and regulatory shifts that we believe will support life sciences innovation, potentially accelerating clinical development and reducing regulatory risk.
On a micro level at QuintilesIMS and in addition to these underlying market forces, integration efforts are enabling us to rethink how operations are conducted, and we are laser-focused on modernizing the approach we take to many of the traditional CRO processes. We are in fact winning business with clients that the legacy Quintiles organization had done very little R&D work with in the past. And we have specifically secured wins with previously locked-out accounts.
Now you are familiar with our next-gen clinical development offering. It's been instrumental in supporting these wins. In fact, more than $600 million of awards since the merger have leveraged next-gen capabilities. We are also winning with emerging biopharma clients, and I'd like to give a couple examples of next-gen EBP wins that, in combination, have a value of $50 million.
The first example is a win in Asia, where the client selected us because of our ability to provide an end-to-end solution, from evidence driven protocol design to precision site ID. The second example is a sole provider win in Europe, which was driven by our ability to leverage our real-world data, advanced analytics and domain expertise, in combination to answer the client's strategic therapeutic questions in COPD and asthma.
I also want to provide a quick update on progress with the $120 million fixed-price award that we won with a top 5 pharma client last quarter and which we discussed on the call.
To date, we greatly exceeded all of the legacy Quintiles historical time line benchmarks across all geographies. In fact, the client awarded us 2 additional multimillion dollar full service contracts in other therapeutic areas during the quarter, demonstrating their confidence in our solutions. As a reminder, legacy Quintiles had done virtually no full-service clinical work with these clients over the previous 6-year period.
Now the traction we see in the marketplace for our next-gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in next-gen operationalization and resourcing plans. Once again, we see that in each of our business, the basis for our differentiation continues to be our integrated approach to rich data, new technologies, advanced analytics and significant domain expertise.
Of course, we are striving to be best-in-class in each of these capabilities. But what truly sets us apart is the way we integrate these capabilities across the portfolio to bring highly differentiated solutions within each of the clinical and commercial markets we operate in.
Before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to announce that we are holding an analyst and investor conference in New York City later this year. Please hold the date of November 8. We're planning a morning event, probably running from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and this will be shortly after our third quarter earnings call. The focus will not be on the numbers, but on the launch of strategy and progress of the business.
The day will highlight some of our technology capabilities and will be more comprehensive than the demos some of you have already seen. More importantly, this will give you all an opportunity to meet a broader cross-section of management. We're looking forward to this event and hope you can all attend.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."

Q2 was another solid quarter for Quintiles IMS. Let's review the details.
As in previous quarters, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. Second quarter revenue was $1.97 billion, which was the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on the last couple of calls. This quarter, it negatively impacted revenue by $2 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis, second quarter revenue grew 1.2% at constant currency and 0.1% for the quarter.
On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue of $871 million grew just under 2% at constant currency and 0.6% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles Encore business and headwinds from the legacy Quintiles advisory consulting business. Excluding Encore, growth in Commercial Solutions was about 2.5% at constant currency. We sold the Encore business after the close of the second quarter and recorded an impairment charge in Q2 to reflect the sales price. This business is not part of our strategic vision. And as a result of the sale, we will have some tax benefits.
R&D Solutions service revenue of $896 million grew 1.7% at constant currency and 0.4% at actual FX rates. Growth was impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016 as well as weaker bookings and higher cancellations in the third quarter of 2016. When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth at constant currency was about 3%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $204 million declined 2.1% at constant currency and 3.7% at actual FX rates. Revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by a onetime $9 million royalty acceleration in 2016.
Turning now to profit. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $486 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7% expanded 100 basis points. GAAP net income was $75 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.34. Adjusted net income was $242 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the quarter.
Now let's turn to the results for the first half. Again, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page.
First half revenue was just under $3.9 billion. Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, first half revenue grew 2.2% at constant currency and 1% reported. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue of $1.72 billion grew 2.1% at constant currency and 0.9% reported. Excluding Encore, Commercial Solutions growth was about 3% at constant currency.
R&D Solutions service revenue of $1.76 billion grew 2.9% at constant currency and 1.7% at actual FX rates. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth was 4% at constant currency. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $400 million declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported.
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, R&D Solutions' as-contracted bookings were $4.03 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.99 billion. We expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months.
As you know, we began reporting our bookings on an as-contracted basis rather than an as-awarded basis. This approach began with the third quarter of 2016, which was the last quarter of Quintiles' standalone reporting. As we now have 4 quarters on the as-contracted approach, we feel that it is appropriate to provide some additional color on the bookings.
As you can see from the chart, our bookings trend has improved steadily each quarter since we closed the merger. For the last 12 months since we started reporting as contracted, the book-to-bill is 1.14. Looking at the last 9 months since we closed the merger and began reporting on a combined basis, the book-to-bill is 1.21. Looking at the last 6 months since the beginning of 2017, the year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.24. And looking at this quarter, we had a book-to-bill of 1.30.
Now if you were to back calculate the book-to-bill in the quarter by taking this difference in backlog and backing out revenue, you would get book-to-bill on the quarter of 1.37. This includes a small positive benefit from the revaluation of the entire ending backlog at spot FX rates at the end of the quarter. We feel that using for bookings the same average rate used for revenue over the quarter is a better indication of actual activity in the quarter, allows for more consistent comparisons across periods, and in this case, is more conservative.
Turning now to profit for the first half of the year. First half adjusted EBITDA was $953 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.6% expanded 50 basis points. GAAP net income was $149 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65 for the first 6 months of 2017. Adjusted net income was $480 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.10 in the first half of the year.
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $902 million and debt was about $9 billion, resulting in net debt of about $8.1 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.1x. Cash flow from operating activities was $245 million in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $100 million and free cash flow was $145 million.
During the second quarter, the board approved an increase in our post-merger share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion to $3.5 billion. We repurchased $300 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder at the end of May. And towards the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $78 million worth of our shares in the open market for a total of $378 million repurchases during the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we had $853 million remaining of our share repurchase authorization.
Let's now turn to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05. You will recall that we also increased the 2017 EPS guidance range by $0.05 last quarter. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion; and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.65, up from $4.45 to $4.60.
The basis for our adjusted diluted EPS raise is a change in our adjusted book tax rate expectation. To date, our adjusted book tax rate has been approximately 29%, and we anticipate it will remain at this level for the rest of the year. This incremental 1% benefit below the line will increase our adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.05 for the year.
For our cash tax rate, we now expect approximately 15% for the year, down from our previous guidance of approximately 16%. For the third quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2 billion and $2.03 billion, reflecting the general strength of the business; adjusted EBITDA to be between $500 million and $515 million, reflecting continued operational improvements, offset by accelerated investments in next-gen capability development, as Ari mentioned, as well as accelerated investments in salesforce.com, CRM and MCM replatforming efforts in anticipation of the upcoming product launch later this year; and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.10 and $1.15.
In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered on our financial commitments. We are investing in all areas of the business for future growth. We are making progress with the salesforce.com alliance and we remain excited about our product releases for both clinical and commercial technology. We have a strong R&D Solutions pipeline. Next gen continues to gain traction with new wins in the quarter, and we continue to deploy our capital effectively and have bought back $2.7 billion worth of our shares at an average price of $78.81 since we closed the merger.
With that, I would like to ask Alex to please open the lines for Q&A."

We continuously look for and have a rich pipeline of small tuck-in capability acquisitions. These are, for the most part, and I want to say exclusively this year, technology acquisitions, both in the commercial space and the clinical space. This quarter, there were a few handful of small acquisitions, all of which closed at the end of the quarter and had 0 impact in the quarter. As we've told you before, we may pay a healthy premium because again, we're buying technology capabilities. It's a decision to continue to develop our assets through acquisitions instead of internal product development spend. Initially, this acquisitions have very little revenue contribution and the acquisition spend can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. But that's what we signaled before. It's not rich. And we expect, to answer your question in terms of contribution to revenue, that acquisitions will contribute year in, year out, 1 point, 1.5 points to our growth, and this year won't be different."

The combined company should run at about 4% of revenue in general. And early on, it could be a little bit higher in the early years as we integrate the 2 businesses. Year-to-date, we're about 4.5%, and I think first quarter, second quarter is strictly timing."

So the -- look, the guidance we gave is based on our forecast both for -- every time we did so for the quarter and for the year. Our guidance on revenue and EBITDA has a range and have changed -- that has not changed. As always, there are puts and takes aspects of the business that are doing better than we thought and others that are perhaps weaker than we had anticipated. We also got rid of the Encore business earlier this month or last month, and so you won't be in our numbers. I wish that piece of the revenue is out. Flip side, we have a little bit -- assuming the FX rates remains where they are, we may have a little bit of tailwind from FX, which will offset that loss of revenue. And bear in mind, the FX rate is rather a headwind on EBITDA rather than a tailwind than it may be on revenue simply because we do a lot of work overseas. And at the EPS line, we are hedged largely because we've got also euro-denominated currencies. And the FX movements are very complicated because of the number of countries in which we do business and the large number of currencies that are fluctuating constantly. So with respect to your specific questions in terms of the ramp, look, there are some merger-related costs that we've had throughout the first 2 quarters and we believe will continue in the third quarter. I've said before, there are redundant costs that we continue to carry, that we cannot adjust out of the P&L, of our adjusted EBITDA numbers. And those are going to continue in the third quarter, and a portion of those are going to be -- we're going to be able to remove in the fourth quarter. So that's one aspect. Secondly, there are -- when we planned for the year, we had anticipated a progression of our investments in both the R&D side and the technology side. We are actually accelerating some of these investments and our resourcing plans. And so the third quarter carry some of that. In a sense, it -- some of the investments that had been planned in Q4 will take place in Q3. That's another reason why you might see a bigger ramp than you might have otherwise anticipated. We also announced the salesforce.com initiative alliance, which, again, we have not anticipated earlier in the year. And that is causing us to invest more in people and software development and so on. And again, all of that is also accelerating because we now believe we'd be able to launch the products towards the end of the year. So all of that affects, if you will, the ramp on EBITDA in the fourth quarter, but nothing unusual. Each of those is a relatively small number in isolation and it's the accumulation of that, that perhaps did that -- gives you the sense that it's a bigger ramp in the fourth quarter."

It's the end of the year, and pharma has budgets that -- marketing and commercial budgets that they look to spend. And the fourth quarter typically has been the strongest. A lot of purchases of what we call ad hoc data packages, most of that comes at the end of the year. So if you look historically, the IMS legacy business is weaker in the third quarter. I think Q2, we had seasonality -- seasonality of Q3 has been the weakest historically and Q4 the strongest. So that will explain also perhaps the perception of a bigger ramp in the fourth quarter."

And secondly, we have also trained -- as you know, we've said before, we've reorganized our go-to-market strategy globally and we have regionalized the go-to market approaches, North America, Europe and Asia. And we have combined our accounts managements across clinical and commercial markets. We're having the process trained 1,000 legacy IMS salespeople on R&D business developments. So they are helping us opening doors, create the meetings that otherwise would simply not have been open to the legacy Quintiles organization before. We -- they are able to engage in conversations, learn about RFPs earlier in the process and involve them, the domain experts from the R&D organizations, at the right time. So again, in terms of numbers specifically, we continue to ramp up the salesforce recruitment dedicated to R&D. We've increased that salesforce that's dedicated and specialized by about 50% to date.

Look, when we say -- what we really wanted to do, there's always an element of customization, right? Every study is unique. What we wanted to do, and we said this upfront, is to try to ""productionize"" the process, to accelerate our response time and minimize the degree of customization. Again, there will always be an element of customization. We are well on our way, by the end of the year to having ""productionized,"" which means having loaded in the data and standardize the data mining and algorithms required to accelerate site identification, optimal site identification for a given product or design for a dozen main therapies. The issue is how fast can you go across all specific decision therapies. So we think that this is going to cover probably 80% to 90% of the RFPs in which we believe next gen will be relevant and useful, which, as we said before, is at least half of the portfolio or the pipeline. So that's where we are today and this is exactly where we wanted to be. The biggest hurdle is to recruit the type of people that we need. Today, we have 110, I think, by the last time I saw, of people in what we call the AOCE -- the advanced Analytics Center of Excellence. And that's the full-time dedicated team -- the ACOE, I'm sorry, I don't remember what it stands for, but advanced Analytics Center of Excellence, in which we have created, reporting to Cynthia Verst and led by Natalia Balko, who some of you have met. We have this team of over 100 people full-time working on the operationalization of how we respond to RFPs, where we think next gen has relevance. Bear in mind, we are also trying to use next gen in the existing set of trials that we are working on and it's really the same team. So at this time, the main constraint to even going faster than we have thought is simply the ability to recruit to the type of people we want. I mean, we're really having data scientists, statisticians, software development. People is just not so easy to recruit globally, but we're making good progress."

We aim for nothing short of disrupting the way clinical trials are conducted. Historically, this is an industry that's paid for inefficiency. And it is one -- the biggest probably health care is inefficiency over inefficiency. People are paid for time. And without knocking on any specific profession is -- the longer it takes -- it's like lawyers. The longer it takes, the more time you take and the more money you make, the more costs you have because essentially your cost plus type of business model, from an economic standpoint, the more cost you have, the more waste you have, the more rework you have, the more change orders you have, the more revenue you generate. And so there is a kind of an inherent conflict in the industry where no one wants to shoot themselves in the foot, so to speak, and damage their business model. Well, we want to change that. We believe that with more visibility, more predictability, more data-enabled and technology-enabled processes, you can actually share risk with clients in a better way with more visibility, an educated risk, and we are willing to do it. And our early forays into this business model change show that clients are a, much more receptive; and b, see the results in trials that are very complex like the one I discussed before. Again, this is not just a hurdle to overcome because the whole industry is based on the different types of business model. Clients are accustomed doing business differently, and even our own people are accustomed to doing business differently. So it's sort of a cultural overhaul that we need, and we believe strongly in this vision and we want to move forward. It's too early to show you metrics because we don't have enough of those. And as you know, it's a long-cycle business. So even if we win a trial today, it's going to take time. Now this particular trial is very large, very complex. It's with a previously essentially locked-out account. There are many people competing in the same therapy. It's an oncology therapy, and so site identification is even more difficult and we're beating all time lines historically, and we're specifically tracking. Now one trial is not enough to make it a science, but we feel very confident. And hopefully, over time, we've developed enough of our database to support the thesis. And I can tell you, clients are extremely receptive to our vision."

Sandy, you're correct. When we bought Cegedim and by the way, acquired or developed internally a number of technology platforms, we intended fully to try and regain some of the market share losses of the historical legacy Cegedim organization. Just for a reminder, we are #2 in the specifically defined, narrowly defined CRM market. Cegedim had been #1 historically, going back 5 to 10 years. And they were in the market through the on-premise heavy, now obsolete, type of platform. And we have introduced Mobile Intelligence, which was the SaaS-based platform. However, all the time, as you recall, we -- because we have a wide suite of applications, we saw the need for a new type of offering that would integrate marketing insights with sales data across several platforms and make those interoperable. Now in so doing, because we had developed applications on a lot of different platforms and we had internally developed platforms and acquired platforms, in order to integrate all of these applications, the cost to do so and the speed to market were very high. We decided to replatform everything on horizontal existing off-the-shelf industry platforms. We considered several options and we ended up building an alliance with [ SLDC ] with which we are extremely pleased in terms of how it's playing out. And that alliance, by the way, extends to the clinical space as well. We believe this will enable us even better to recapture market share, specifically in the CRM business with our upcoming OCE SaaS application. Again, when a doctor reads a marketing e-mail from a pharma company, the sales rep that visited this doctor doesn't know to date that the doctor read the e-mail because the marketing system and the sales system are not interoperable. So with our platform, we find when the doctor read the e-mail, whether there was a specific reaction. We find the rep that has that doctor in that territory and if the doctor is in that rep's call-on within the next 7 days, we can immediately notify that rep. Again, it's a much more targeted precision sales performance that we are looking for. And it's really the next generation of commercial application and we believe that this will enable us to recapture market share on the tech space."

Today, we'll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call today to view on our webcast. This presentation will be available following the call on the Events & Presentations section of our QuintilesIMS Investor Relations website at ir.quintilesims.com.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call could include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 16, 2017, and subsequent SEC filings.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would also like to point out that as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations.
I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib."

Thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Q2 was another solid quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. Strong operational discipline and execution of our integration plans are driving results. Let's review the quarter.
Consistent with the last couple of quarters, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger took place January 1, 2016. Second quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance range of $1.97 billion. This revenue included $871 million for Commercial Solutions, $896 million for R&D Solutions and $204 million for Integrated Engagement Services. Adjusted EBITDA for the company was also close to the high end of our guidance range at $486 million. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points for the quarter.
Let me provide some color behind the numbers. Let's start with our technology solutions business. Our tech business continues to gain traction in the market. Let me illustrate with a few examples.
During the quarter, we signed 2 significant deals with top 10 pharma clients for our social media technology platform for over $12 million. As a reminder, our social media technology mines and analyzes over 400,000 social media outlets to track patient sentiment. It specifically flags adverse events to help clients rapidly identify or remediate issues when they arise and satisfy regulatory reporting requirements. We do this to proprietary ontology in 52 languages, proprietary algorithms, 24/7, 365 days of the year in a state-of-the-art global monitoring center.
We also had the significant wins with our master data management or MDM platform amounting to about $20 million with top 20 pharma clients. The clients will deploy our MDM solution globally, benefiting from QuintilesIMS' global implementation services, which are unmatched by our competitors.
Finally, in another illustration of progress in our technology business, we issued a press release on June 26 highlighting the launch of our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement or OCE SaaS offering. The OCE offering will be released towards the end of the year. We are in fact accelerating investments in our salesforce.com partnership to replatform our global CRM and MCM solutions. Stay tuned for new product releases, including in the clinical space.
Switching to our Real-World Insights business, where we also landed a few significant wins during the quarter. First, a $15 million Real-World project with a top 10 pharma client. This particular win in cardiovascular leverage a direct-to-patient, data-driven approach that enables us to shorten time lines and accelerate patient recruitment for the project.
The second multi-million dollar win I want to highlight in our Real-World business is with a top biotech company, where we displaced the existing preferred provider for a first-in-class, new-to-market product. Here, we applied a differentiated approach by linking primary site and investigators' data from legacy Quintiles with existing secondary claims data from legacy IMS, a capability that is unmatched by our competitors.
Moving to our R&D business. We saw continued improvements and another quarterly sequential increase in our as-contracted bookings. At the end of the quarter, we had a contracted backlog of just under $10 billion. To be precise, $9,990,000,000. Now I know there is a lot of discussion about market trends in the R&D space and in the CRO space, so let me tell you what we see in the market.
On a macro level, the total number of molecules in clinical development continues to increase across all stages of the pipeline. The number of molecules in Phase I, II and III are at the highest levels since at least 2001. FDA approvals in 2017 are tracking well ahead of 2016. As you all know, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb has signaled policy and regulatory shifts that we believe will support life sciences innovation, potentially accelerating clinical development and reducing regulatory risk.
On a micro level at QuintilesIMS and in addition to these underlying market forces, integration efforts are enabling us to rethink how operations are conducted, and we are laser-focused on modernizing the approach we take to many of the traditional CRO processes. We are in fact winning business with clients that the legacy Quintiles organization had done very little R&D work with in the past. And we have specifically secured wins with previously locked-out accounts.
Now you are familiar with our next-gen clinical development offering. It's been instrumental in supporting these wins. In fact, more than $600 million of awards since the merger have leveraged next-gen capabilities. We are also winning with emerging biopharma clients, and I'd like to give a couple examples of next-gen EBP wins that, in combination, have a value of $50 million.
The first example is a win in Asia, where the client selected us because of our ability to provide an end-to-end solution, from evidence driven protocol design to precision site ID. The second example is a sole provider win in Europe, which was driven by our ability to leverage our real-world data, advanced analytics and domain expertise, in combination to answer the client's strategic therapeutic questions in COPD and asthma.
I also want to provide a quick update on progress with the $120 million fixed-price award that we won with a top 5 pharma client last quarter and which we discussed on the call.
To date, we greatly exceeded all of the legacy Quintiles historical time line benchmarks across all geographies. In fact, the client awarded us 2 additional multimillion dollar full service contracts in other therapeutic areas during the quarter, demonstrating their confidence in our solutions. As a reminder, legacy Quintiles had done virtually no full-service clinical work with these clients over the previous 6-year period.
Now the traction we see in the marketplace for our next-gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in next-gen operationalization and resourcing plans. Once again, we see that in each of our business, the basis for our differentiation continues to be our integrated approach to rich data, new technologies, advanced analytics and significant domain expertise.
Of course, we are striving to be best-in-class in each of these capabilities. But what truly sets us apart is the way we integrate these capabilities across the portfolio to bring highly differentiated solutions within each of the clinical and commercial markets we operate in.
Before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to announce that we are holding an analyst and investor conference in New York City later this year. Please hold the date of November 8. We're planning a morning event, probably running from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and this will be shortly after our third quarter earnings call. The focus will not be on the numbers, but on the launch of strategy and progress of the business.
The day will highlight some of our technology capabilities and will be more comprehensive than the demos some of you have already seen. More importantly, this will give you all an opportunity to meet a broader cross-section of management. We're looking forward to this event and hope you can all attend.
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."
137473239,531486991,1268849,"Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","IQVIA Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ari, and good morning, everyone.

Q2 was another solid quarter for Quintiles IMS. Let's review the details.
As in previous quarters, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. Second quarter revenue was $1.97 billion, which was the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on the last couple of calls. This quarter, it negatively impacted revenue by $2 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis, second quarter revenue grew 1.2% at constant currency and 0.1% for the quarter.
On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue of $871 million grew just under 2% at constant currency and 0.6% reported. The Commercial Solutions growth rate was again impacted by a decline in the legacy Quintiles Encore business and headwinds from the legacy Quintiles advisory consulting business. Excluding Encore, growth in Commercial Solutions was about 2.5% at constant currency. We sold the Encore business after the close of the second quarter and recorded an impairment charge in Q2 to reflect the sales price. This business is not part of our strategic vision. And as a result of the sale, we will have some tax benefits.
R&D Solutions service revenue of $896 million grew 1.7% at constant currency and 0.4% at actual FX rates. Growth was impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016 as well as weaker bookings and higher cancellations in the third quarter of 2016. When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth at constant currency was about 3%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $204 million declined 2.1% at constant currency and 3.7% at actual FX rates. Revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by a onetime $9 million royalty acceleration in 2016.
Turning now to profit. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $486 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7% expanded 100 basis points. GAAP net income was $75 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.34. Adjusted net income was $242 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 in the quarter.
Now let's turn to the results for the first half. Again, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page.
First half revenue was just under $3.9 billion. Adjusting for deferred revenue and on a combined company basis, first half revenue grew 2.2% at constant currency and 1% reported. On a combined company basis, Commercial Solutions revenue of $1.72 billion grew 2.1% at constant currency and 0.9% reported. Excluding Encore, Commercial Solutions growth was about 3% at constant currency.
R&D Solutions service revenue of $1.76 billion grew 2.9% at constant currency and 1.7% at actual FX rates. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth was 4% at constant currency. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $400 million declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported.
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, R&D Solutions' as-contracted bookings were $4.03 billion, resulting in an ending contracted backlog of $9.99 billion. We expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months.
As you know, we began reporting our bookings on an as-contracted basis rather than an as-awarded basis. This approach began with the third quarter of 2016, which was the last quarter of Quintiles' standalone reporting. As we now have 4 quarters on the as-contracted approach, we feel that it is appropriate to provide some additional color on the bookings.
As you can see from the chart, our bookings trend has improved steadily each quarter since we closed the merger. For the last 12 months since we started reporting as contracted, the book-to-bill is 1.14. Looking at the last 9 months since we closed the merger and began reporting on a combined basis, the book-to-bill is 1.21. Looking at the last 6 months since the beginning of 2017, the year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.24. And looking at this quarter, we had a book-to-bill of 1.30.
Now if you were to back calculate the book-to-bill in the quarter by taking this difference in backlog and backing out revenue, you would get book-to-bill on the quarter of 1.37. This includes a small positive benefit from the revaluation of the entire ending backlog at spot FX rates at the end of the quarter. We feel that using for bookings the same average rate used for revenue over the quarter is a better indication of actual activity in the quarter, allows for more consistent comparisons across periods, and in this case, is more conservative.
Turning now to profit for the first half of the year. First half adjusted EBITDA was $953 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.6% expanded 50 basis points. GAAP net income was $149 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.65 for the first 6 months of 2017. Adjusted net income was $480 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.10 in the first half of the year.
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $902 million and debt was about $9 billion, resulting in net debt of about $8.1 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.5x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.1x. Cash flow from operating activities was $245 million in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $100 million and free cash flow was $145 million.
During the second quarter, the board approved an increase in our post-merger share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion to $3.5 billion. We repurchased $300 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors and the legacy Quintiles founder at the end of May. And towards the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $78 million worth of our shares in the open market for a total of $378 million repurchases during the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we had $853 million remaining of our share repurchase authorization.
Let's now turn to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.05. You will recall that we also increased the 2017 EPS guidance range by $0.05 last quarter. Assuming currency rates remain at current levels for the rest of the year, we expect total revenue of $8 billion to $8.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion; and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $4.50 and $4.65, up from $4.45 to $4.60.
The basis for our adjusted diluted EPS raise is a change in our adjusted book tax rate expectation. To date, our adjusted book tax rate has been approximately 29%, and we anticipate it will remain at this level for the rest of the year. This incremental 1% benefit below the line will increase our adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.05 for the year.
For our cash tax rate, we now expect approximately 15% for the year, down from our previous guidance of approximately 16%. For the third quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2 billion and $2.03 billion, reflecting the general strength of the business; adjusted EBITDA to be between $500 million and $515 million, reflecting continued operational improvements, offset by accelerated investments in next-gen capability development, as Ari mentioned, as well as accelerated investments in salesforce.com, CRM and MCM replatforming efforts in anticipation of the upcoming product launch later this year; and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.10 and $1.15.
In summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered on our financial commitments. We are investing in all areas of the business for future growth. We are making progress with the salesforce.com alliance and we remain excited about our product releases for both clinical and commercial technology. We have a strong R&D Solutions pipeline. Next gen continues to gain traction with new wins in the quarter, and we continue to deploy our capital effectively and have bought back $2.7 billion worth of our shares at an average price of $78.81 since we closed the merger.
With that, I would like to ask Alex to please open the lines for Q&A."

We continuously look for and have a rich pipeline of small tuck-in capability acquisitions. These are, for the most part, and I want to say exclusively this year, technology acquisitions, both in the commercial space and the clinical space. This quarter, there were a few handful of small acquisitions, all of which closed at the end of the quarter and had 0 impact in the quarter. As we've told you before, we may pay a healthy premium because again, we're buying technology capabilities. It's a decision to continue to develop our assets through acquisitions instead of internal product development spend. Initially, this acquisitions have very little revenue contribution and the acquisition spend can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. But that's what we signaled before. It's not rich. And we expect, to answer your question in terms of contribution to revenue, that acquisitions will contribute year in, year out, 1 point, 1.5 points to our growth, and this year won't be different."

As always, there are puts and takes aspects of the business that are doing better than we thought and others that are perhaps weaker than we had anticipated. We also got rid of the Encore business earlier this month or last month, and so you won't be in our numbers. I wish that piece of the revenue is out. Flip side, we have a little bit -- assuming the FX rates remains where they are, we may have a little bit of tailwind from FX, which will offset that loss of revenue. And bear in mind, the FX rate is rather a headwind on EBITDA rather than a tailwind than it may be on revenue simply because we do a lot of work overseas. And at the EPS line, we are hedged largely because we've got also euro-denominated currencies. And the FX movements are very complicated because of the number of countries in which we do business and the large number of currencies that are fluctuating constantly. 
So with respect to your specific questions in terms of the ramp, look, there are some merger-related costs that we've had throughout the first 2 quarters and we believe will continue in the third quarter. I've said before, there are redundant costs that we continue to carry, that we cannot adjust out of the P&L, of our adjusted EBITDA numbers. And those are going to continue in the third quarter, and a portion of those are going to be -- we're going to be able to remove in the fourth quarter. So that's one aspect. Secondly, there are -- when we planned for the year, we had anticipated a progression of our investments in both the R&D side and the technology side. We are actually accelerating some of these investments and our resourcing plans. And so the third quarter carry some of that. In a sense, it -- some of the investments that had been planned in Q4 will take place in Q3. That's another reason why you might see a bigger ramp than you might have otherwise anticipated. We also announced the salesforce.com initiative alliance, which, again, we have not anticipated earlier in the year. And that is causing us to invest more in people and software development and so on. And again, all of that is also accelerating because we now believe we'd be able to launch the products towards the end of the year. So all of that affects, if you will, the ramp on EBITDA in the fourth quarter, but nothing unusual. Each of those is a relatively small number in isolation and it's the accumulation of that, that perhaps did that -- gives you the sense that it's a bigger ramp in the fourth quarter."

Well, again, for those of you less familiar with the IMS, the IMS Commercial business traditionally -- Q4, traditionally, has a seasonality element to it. It's the end of the year, and pharma has budgets that -- marketing and commercial budgets that they look to spend. And the fourth quarter typically has been the strongest. A lot of purchases of what we call ad hoc data packages, most of that comes at the end of the year. So if you look historically, the IMS legacy business is weaker in the third quarter. I think Q2, we had seasonality -- seasonality of Q3 has been the weakest historically and Q4 the strongest. So that will explain also perhaps the perception of a bigger ramp in the fourth quarter."

We have said before that -- and I'm assuming you're asking primarily on the R&D side, which is where we felt that we're -- we had Commercial -- perhaps it's been not as forceful and aggressive as we could have been historically.

And it's not easy to ramp up to where we want to be, but we have increased that number materially by probably about 50% at this point. And secondly, we have also trained -- as you know, we've said before, we've reorganized our go-to-market strategy globally and we have regionalized the go-to market approaches, North America, Europe and Asia. And we have combined our accounts managements across clinical and commercial markets. We're having the process trained 1,000 legacy IMS salespeople on R&D business developments. So they are helping us opening doors, create the meetings that otherwise would simply not have been open to the legacy Quintiles organization before. We -- they are able to engage in conversations, learn about RFPs earlier in the process and involve them, the domain experts from the R&D organizations, at the right time. So again, in terms of numbers specifically, we continue to ramp up the salesforce recruitment dedicated to R&D. We've increased that salesforce that's dedicated and specialized by about 50% to date. And we have also trained 1,000 IMS salespeople in -- at the earlier stages of business development and sales for R&D as well. Thanks for your question."

Look, when we say -- what we really wanted to do, there's always an element of customization, right? Every study is unique. What we wanted to do, and we said this upfront, is to try to ""productionize"" the process, to accelerate our response time and minimize the degree of customization. Again, there will always be an element of customization. We are well on our way, by the end of the year to having ""productionized,"" which means having loaded in the data and standardize the data mining and algorithms required to accelerate site identification, optimal site identification for a given product or design for a dozen main therapies. The issue is how fast can you go across all specific decision therapies. So we think that this is going to cover probably 80% to 90% of the RFPs in which we believe next gen will be relevant and useful, which, as we said before, is at least half of the portfolio or the pipeline. So that's where we are today and this is exactly where we wanted to be. The biggest hurdle is to recruit the type of people that we need. Today, we have 110, I think, by the last time I saw, of people in what we call the AOCE -- the advanced Analytics Center of Excellence. And that's the full-time dedicated team -- the ACOE, I'm sorry, I don't remember what it stands for, but advanced Analytics Center of Excellence, in which we have created, reporting to Cynthia Verst and led by Natalia Balko, who some of you have met. We have this team of over 100 people full-time working on the operationalization of how we respond to RFPs, where we think next gen has relevance. Bear in mind, we are also trying to use next gen in the existing set of trials that we are working on and it's really the same team. So at this time, the main constraint to even going faster than we have thought is simply the ability to recruit to the type of people we want. I mean, we're really having data scientists, statisticians, software development. People is just not so easy to recruit globally, but we're making good progress."

We aim for nothing short of disrupting the way clinical trials are conducted. Historically, this is an industry that's paid for inefficiency. And it is one -- the biggest probably health care is inefficiency over inefficiency. People are paid for time. And without knocking on any specific profession is -- the longer it takes -- it's like lawyers. The longer it takes, the more time you take and the more money you make, the more costs you have because essentially your cost plus type of business model, from an economic standpoint, the more cost you have, the more waste you have, the more rework you have, the more change orders you have, the more revenue you generate. And so there is a kind of an inherent conflict in the industry where no one wants to shoot themselves in the foot, so to speak, and damage their business model. Well, we want to change that. We believe that with more visibility, more predictability, more data-enabled and technology-enabled processes, you can actually share risk with clients in a better way with more visibility, an educated risk, and we are willing to do it. And our early forays into this business model change show that clients are a, much more receptive; and b, see the results in trials that are very complex like the one I discussed before. Again, this is not just a hurdle to overcome because the whole industry is based on the different types of business model. Clients are accustomed doing business differently, and even our own people are accustomed to doing business differently. So it's sort of a cultural overhaul that we need, and we believe strongly in this vision and we want to move forward. It's too early to show you metrics because we don't have enough of those. And as you know, it's a long-cycle business. So even if we win a trial today, it's going to take time. Now this particular trial is very large, very complex. It's with a previously essentially locked-out account. There are many people competing in the same therapy. It's an oncology therapy, and so site identification is even more difficult and we're beating all time lines historically, and we're specifically tracking. Now one trial is not enough to make it a science, but we feel very confident. And hopefully, over time, we've developed enough of our database to support the thesis. And I can tell you, clients are extremely receptive to our vision."

Sandy, you're correct. When we bought Cegedim and by the way, acquired or developed internally a number of technology platforms, we intended fully to try and regain some of the market share losses of the historical legacy Cegedim organization. Just for a reminder, we are #2 in the specifically defined, narrowly defined CRM market. Cegedim had been #1 historically, going back 5 to 10 years. And they were in the market through the on-premise heavy, now obsolete, type of platform. And we have introduced Mobile Intelligence, which was the SaaS-based platform. However, all the time, as you recall, we -- because we have a wide suite of applications, we saw the need for a new type of offering that would integrate marketing insights with sales data across several platforms and make those interoperable. Now in so doing, because we had developed applications on a lot of different platforms and we had internally developed platforms and acquired platforms, in order to integrate all of these applications, the cost to do so and the speed to market were very high. We decided to replatform everything on horizontal existing off-the-shelf industry platforms. We considered several options and we ended up building an alliance with [ SLDC ] with which we are extremely pleased in terms of how it's playing out. And that alliance, by the way, extends to the clinical space as well. We believe this will enable us even better to recapture market share, specifically in the CRM business with our upcoming OCE SaaS application. Again, when a doctor reads a marketing e-mail from a pharma company, the sales rep that visited this doctor doesn't know to date that the doctor read the e-mail because the marketing system and the sales system are not interoperable. So with our platform, we find when the doctor read the e-mail, whether there was a specific reaction. We find the rep that has that doctor in that territory and if the doctor is in that rep's call-on within the next 7 days, we can immediately notify that rep. Again, it's a much more targeted precision sales performance that we are looking for. And it's really the next generation of commercial application and we believe that this will enable us to recapture market share on the tech space."

Thank you for joining our Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to report the Q3 was a strong quarter for the QuintilesIMS team.

I'm pleased to report the Q3 was a strong quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. The results were in line with or better than what we had anticipated. As most of you previously noted, our plan for the year had a steeper ramp and was more back-end loaded. Because the quarter was stronger than we had anticipated, we'll have a smoother glide path to our full year targets. 
Let's review the call. Consistent with the last 3 quarters, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger took place January 1, '16. Third quarter revenue was $2,019,000,000, and it grew 4.8%. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5 points to revenue growth. 
R&D Solutions growth was 7.3%. R&D Solutions revenue was again negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been nearly 8%.
Commercial Solutions grew 4%. Growth in Commercial Solutions was negatively impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Adjusting for Encore, the commercial business would have grown 5.5%. 
Integrated and engagement services revenue was slightly down versus the prior year. Combined company adjusted EBITDA was $512 million.
We had a number of key wins in the quarter. Let me provide some examples. First, in our technology solutions business, you will recall that we have been accelerating investments in replatforming our global CRM and MCM capabilities. We told you we are aiming to release our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE, SaaS offering towards the end of the year. This is still on track, and in fact, during the third quarter, we had our first OCE win, a 7-year deal with a leading European pharma client to deploy OCE in over 30 countries. As a reminder, OCE is revolutionary compared to other offerings in the market. This is not just a CRM tool. We built a collaborative tool that utilizes Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to integrate various functions within our clients' commercial operations. It is highly differentiated to the current point solutions that exist in the market.
Next, in our Real-World Insights business, where our team won a multimillion dollar deal for a first-of-a-kind study with a leading U.S. biotech. Our differentiated approach will utilize secondary data and advanced analytics to gain regulatory approval for labor extension. This analytics-enabled approach leverages our E316 tech platform. It will position our clients' product for renewed indication at a much faster pace. By the way, this is a trend that we expect accelerate. Regulatory actions, such as 21st Century Cures Act, will only increase demand for real-world insights. 
Finally, in our R&D business. We were encouraged by another solid quarter of contracted bookings. In fact, third quarter net new business growth was over 40% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Of course, as you will recall, Q3 '16 was the last stand-alone quarter for legacy Quintiles before the merger. And bookings, you will call, for that quarter, were pretty abysmal, the result of which is the revenue headwind we are now facing in R&D Solutions, which you have all noticed. However, the strong performance in the 4 quarters since then has resulted in an uptick of our LTM book-to-bill ratio, which was 1.22 for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. Next-gen is a big part of this. Continues to gain traction in the market. We now have approximately $900 million of postmerger next-gen awards. Importantly, we are winning R&D business with clients we have done little or no work with in the past. Examples of these accounts that we unlocked this quarter due to next-gen include: a top 10 global pharma, who we have done virtually no full-service clinical work with in almost a decade. We won 3 trials with them during the quarter, 2 of which were in oncology. A top 20 global pharma, who predominately in-sources all of their R&D work. They chose next-gen due to our compelling value proposition and differentiated capabilities. This is in the area of Nash, terrible disease that causes liver inflammation and sclerosis. A top biopharma, who has done nothing with us in the core clinical space for the last 12 years, selected QuintilesIMS for their neurology trial. Our next-gen offering was still compelling, we were able to displace the incumbent CRO for this study, and the client also picked us to be a preferred provider.
Now, as I mentioned last quarter, the traction we see in the marketplace for our next-gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in next-gen operationalization and resourcing plans. This, of course, creates short-term headwinds for our margins, but as you can see [indiscernible], we were able to more than overcome this with our cost savings and productivity initiatives. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to remind you that we are holding our Analyst and Investor Conference in New York City on November 8. We're looking forward to this event. We plan to utilize this location to show deeper dives in our 3 main businesses, with case studies and tech demos. You also will have an opportunity to get acquainted with a broader cross-section of our leadership team. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."

Third quarter revenue grew 4.8% reported and 4.3% at constant currency. R&D Solutions service revenue of $938 million grew 7.3% at actual FX rates and 6.9% at constant currency. Growth was again impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016. When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth was 7.8%. 
Commercial Solutions revenue of $887 million grew 4% reported and 2.9% at constant currency. As Ari mentioned, the Commercial Solutions growth rate was impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Adjusting for Encore, growth in Commercial Solutions was 5.6%. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $194 million declined 2.3% at actual FX rates and 1.1% at constant currency.
Turning now to profit. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $512 million. GAAP net income was $84 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38. Adjusted net income was $260 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.19 in the third quarter. 
Now let's take a look at year-to-date results. Again, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. 
Year-to-date revenue was $5.899 billion. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on the last couple of calls. For the first 9 months of 2017, it negatively impacted revenue by $8 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis, year-to-date revenue grew 2.9% at constant currency and 2.3% reported.
On a combined company basis, R&D Solutions service revenue of $2.7 billion grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3.6% at actual FX rates. Again, growth was impacted by a decline in the early clinical development business. 
Commercial Solutions revenue of $2.611 billion grew 2.5% at constant currency and 2.1% reported. Year-to-date Commercial Solutions growth was also impacted by the sale of Encore. Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $596 million declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported. 
Year-to-date revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by a onetime $9 million royalty acceleration in the second quarter of 2016. 
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2017, R&D Solutions as contracted bookings were $4.37 billion. We had a solid performance in the quarter. Our contracted backlog was $10.32 billion at the end of Q3, and we expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
We have had good backlog progression over the last 4 quarters, but take a quick look. As you know, we already have the largest backlog in the industry. as a reminder, when the merger closed last year, we reviewed our backlog policy and decided to implement a more conservative approach. We now require a written finding commitment or signed contract to record new business in our backlog. We are happy to be back above $10 billion once again, now using our more conservative approach to bookings. 
Turning now to profit for the first 9 months of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2017 was $1.465 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8% expanded 30 basis points. 
GAAP net income was $233 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.04 for the first 9 months of 2017. Adjusted net income was $739 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.28 in the first 9 months of 2017.
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion, and our debt was $9.8 billion, resulting in net debt of about $8.7 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.9x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.3x. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $436 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $89 million, and free cash flow was $347 million. You saw that during the quarter, we issued EUR 500 million worth of senior euro notes due 2025 at a rate of 2 7/8 percent. We used the proceeds mostly to retire existing 4 1/8 percent euro notes that were due 2023. We also refinanced our Term Loan B debt, raising an incremental $750 million, which was primarily used to pay down the revolver. We repurchased $380 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors during September. And toward the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $177 million worth of our shares in the open-market for a total of $557 million of repurchases during Q3. 
Let's now turn to guidance. As you know, we were always expecting a strong fourth quarter. The overperformance in Q3 allows a smoother trajectory for the fourth quarter and better visibility to the full year numbers.
For the fourth quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.12 billion and $2.16 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $560 million and $585 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.28 and $1.37. We are updating our full year adjusted book tax rate guidance, which is now expected to be approximately 28%. Our previous guidance was approximately 29%. 
So in summary, we delivered a strong quarter, driven by solid operational execution. Next-gen continued to gain traction, and we had nice wins with previously locked-out accounts. Our technology solutions business security their first global multi-year OCE deal. We have repurchased $3.3 billion of our shares at an average price of $81 since the merger. And of course, as a nice capstone to our first year as a merged company, we were honored to be included in the S&P 500.
I look forward to seeing many of you at our November 8 Analyst and Investor Conference. And with that, I would now like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

As always, there are studies that are being pulled based on developments in the market, pricing and otherwise and competing the trials. But as, really, for the past year or 2, emerging biopharma, we see, has increasing funding. With respect to -- and also, I would just add a comment that some large pharma in the context of, perhaps, more rational evaluation of their portfolios and of the cost structure at the same time are in-sourcing parts of their development. Now next-gen largely unaffected by this because it's new and different. In fact, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we want a preferred provider status with a large pharma that essentially previously had never -- did not outsource any CRO work. And that's largely on the back of the next-gen capabilities. In fact, we can have clients asking us to provide the next-gen capability, if you will, in combination with their resources. And we are evaluating some of those type of hybrid joint partnership models with some of our clients. With respect to revenue accelerating, it's a little bit more than a 1-year cycle, unfortunately. Generally, the nice bookings we have this quarter, and again, it was a very strong bookings quarter. I've seen some of your notes, not you particularly, but some of your colleagues' notes, and again, the math is not quite correct. The bookings are actually very strong this quarter. It's one of the best bookings quarter -- book-to-bills we've had in a long time. And so the acceleration of revenue, we still have to go through the cycle. We had, as you know, bad bookings last year. And so we've got to cycle through that. And probably, towards the end of '18, we will see the benefits of restocking the benefits of the higher bookings this quarter and the previous one. Thank you."

So yes, the -- since the guidance for the third quarter was lower than what the came in at, then fourth quarter implied that you would have derived, by subtraction, given our guidance for the year, we would have been a little higher.

You could have a quarter it's more than 2. But in general, 1 to 2 points is what we anticipate. It's generally has been historically on the commercial side. Now, this past quarter has been mostly on the benefit. It mostly has been on the R&D side. And as I said, about 0.5 point or actually less than 0.5 point of the growth on the commercial side came from acquisitions. The rest was in R&D."

We're just buying because we are building out a strategy behind it. It is most the technology based companies that give us unique capabilities so that we can move to next centuries clinical trial processes and improve or continue to improve our suite of applications, number one. And number two, when there is a whole in our offerings, like in the case of the TKL acquisition, on the clinical side, we bought a small CRO, and we, of course, are always looking at that. There aren't that many such opportunities, but we're looking at that. With respect to larger acquisitions, of course, we have an obligation to look at them, and we have and we continue to look when they come up. But in every single case, we've moved away, while we might have wanted to do the acquisition, we moved away because we felt there was a large disconnect between the evaluation expectation and what we were prepared to pay. So we'll continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation. As you know, we have a great problem, which is we generate a lot of cash flow. We are very effective repatriating the overseas cash in a tax-efficient manner. And we may generate, from time to time, cash from a divestiture. So the combination of our operating cash flow, our tax-efficient repatriations. Plus, we have communicated to you before that the type of net leverage that we have today, which is anywhere between 4 and 4.5, appropriate capital structure for a business of our type and our cash flow profile and risk characteristics, but given the current rate environment, again, our average cost of debt after tax is just over 2%. So it will be really uneconomic for us to pay down debt with our extra cash. So absent incremental CapEx internally, or absent acquisitions beyond the 1% to 2%, you're going to see us continue to actively do share repurchase, which we feel is an efficient way to return cash to our shareholders, and we believe the stock is very underpriced and it's of great value."

The -- what we believe today is that next-gen capabilities are applicable to 50% to 60% of the trials. And one of the reasons that we've upped that number since the merger is because what's in the pipeline of the molecules is more and more a complex stuff, a specialty oncology, very tight area [indiscernible] or otherwise, where the patient population is very scarce. And again, this is all about accelerating patient, site identification and patient enrollment. And again, I invite you to attend our investor conference in a couple of weeks. We plan to demo and go through a number of the case studies. So you'll see the value. Now I should add that the reason why we don't think it's applicable to 100%, it's not because it's not doable. it simply because it has no value for the balance of the pipeline, that is you don't need to deploy those tools until there is a pretty well-known therapy area. Everyone knows where the sites of the patients are and based on empirical data, and it's not that complicated. That's not the issue in those trials. But I think -- we think that we can have -- can generate great value in 50% to 60% of the portfolio. I would finally say that we also are applying next-gen tools to existing ongoing trials where recruitment is falling behind, including in studies where we were brought in to replace an existing CRO that was underperforming. So that actually has been -- it's been great, but it's been a little bit of a distraction in terms of delaying and in terms of resources and so on. So we've been actually recruiting faster and more than we had anticipated in terms of the ramp on next-gen."

And I think, obviously, as you said, we previously told you that we tried to get you off this quarterly book-to-bill going forward. We made an exception, by the way, last quarter because we feel it's appropriate once in a while to kind of clarify the numbers, and we thought we'd given you enough points that, that enables you then to understand what it is in any given quarter. And also because it was 4 quarters under the new method since the merger, and we thought it was appropriate to do so. Now you're right. FX can also skew the number. And I have to tell you, it's not simple math when you look at the FX implications simply because every quarter is a different set of FX numbers. And then we also revalue the backlog at the end of the quarter where, in fact, the revenue is the average FX every single day during the quarter. So the numbers are hard to interpret per se in a quarter. And the trend is more important. Now if you do simple math on the reported numbers, okay? That is, you do -- you take the end of the quarter backlog, minus last year backlog, and adjust for revenue, then the math gives you a 1.35 book-to-bill in the quarter. That does include FX. And I'll tell you what it is, but that, in a sense, reflects what is in the numbers. That is, if you assume that FX are not going to change at all going forward, and that's what you have in the backlog in terms of understanding the future of the business, that's about 1 35 for the quarter. Now if you want to look at comparisons across quarters, we believe that you should look at the different numbers we gave you in the past. And if you do that, and you look at the numbers this quarter in terms of progression, you're probably going to calculate 1 25. Now neither -- so -- but the real number, to your question, isn't between that 1 25 and 1 35, closer to the 1 25, as you suggested for the quarter, if we take out all FX from every single number. So that enables you to compare quarters in a clean manner as best as we can tell, okay? Somewhere between the 1 25 and the 1 35."

And you will recall that we aggregated some of the commercial businesses legacy Quintiles into the legacy IMS commercial businesses. But since then, 2 things have happened. First, there was a small clinical trials technology business at IMS. It was about $20 million of revenue in total. And we moved that since then from commercial to R&D. Secondly, there was also a small legacy IMS CSO business, contracted sales business in Eastern Europe, which was a $5 million or so of revenue. And we moved that to IES. And finally, as you know, we sold the Encore business, which removed 25 -- actually, more than $25 million of revenue from the second half. So our commercial business versus what it was when we merged the company and told you what commercial looked like, that commercial business last $60 million of revenue between the transfer of businesses out and the sale of the Encore business. But as starters, and in terms of the growth in commercial, actually, even absent these adjustments, you will see that we continue to see robust growth. The core  IMS business historically has been growing at [ about ] 6% annually, and that was inclusive of 1 to 2 points of acquisitions. And it's exactly been performing the same since the beginning of the merger. So no changes there at all. And as I told you this quarter, actually, the acquisition contribution is relatively minor. So good organic growth, which is usually in the 4%-type range, historically has been maintained more or less since the merger. So that wasn't exactly your question, but I just wanted to provide more color on commercial revenue. And I think there's one more question, maybe the last question?"

Now our cases where we don't want it to be fixed price, there are cases, as I said before, where we are hybrid, that is we sell technology capability and upfront work separately, and that's a fixed-price. And then we sell other services, data or otherwise that are not fixed-price. Again, we are experimenting with this new model, but we're seeing a lot of traction and a lot of interest. It often is a clincher of the deal at the end, right, because we're willing to take more risk."

Remember we have the Salesforce.com replatforming, so on the commercial side, we also have investments. And then we have also Salesforce recruitment to try to accelerate our business development activities in R&D. And the combination of all of that are the investments that we've made. We're also carrying additional costs as a result of the merger. We've been carrying additional costs through what they're, but these are costs that we can't adjust out. These are -- we have to maintain redundant people, redundant facilities for a while, redundant IT systems and software licenses. All of that needs to be maintained as we transition to 1 or the other or renew one. So that creates a pocket of costs, and we cannot adjust that out because it's not a onetime kind of a merger-specific outside cost. It's just redundant parallel costs. When we take it out, then it goes away, and it's being taken out over time. So these are all the headwinds. But despite all of that, as I pointed out before, year-to-date, we have margin expansion. As I said before, I'd like to say we are in the business of growing revenue and expanding margins, not one or the other. There might have been some quarters where we don't have margin expansion and Michael is certainly to have margin expansion and I anticipate that 2018 will not be an exception to that, despite all the investments that I just mentioned."

I'm pleased to report that Q3 was a strong quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. The results were in line with or better than what we had anticipated. 
As most of you previously noted, our plan for the year had a steeper ramp and was more back-end loaded. Because the quarter was stronger than we had anticipated, we'll have a smoother glide path to our full year targets. 
Let's review the quarter. 
Consistent with the last 3 quarters, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger took place January 1,'16. 
Third quarter revenue was $2,019,000,000, and it grew 4.8%. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5 points to revenue growth. 
R&D Solutions growth was 7.3%. R&D Solutions revenue was again negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been nearly 8%.
Commercial Solutions grew 4%. Growth in Commercial Solutions was negatively impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Adjusting for Encore, the commercial business would have grown 5.5%. 
Integrated Engagement Services revenue was slightly down versus the prior year. 
Combined company adjusted EBITDA was $512 million.
We had a number of key wins in the quarter. Let me provide some examples. 
First, in our technology solutions business. You will recall that we have been accelerating investments in re-platforming our global CRM and MCM capabilities. We told you we are aiming to release our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE, SaaS offering towards the end of the year. This is still on track, and in fact, during the third quarter, we had our first OCE win, a 7-year deal with a leading European pharma client to deploy OCE in over 30 countries. As a reminder, OCE is revolutionary compared to other offerings in the market. This is not just a CRM tool, we have built a collaborative tool that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to integrate various functions within our clients' commercial operations. It is highly differentiated to the current point solutions that exist in the market.
Next, in our Real-World Insights business, where our team won a multimillion dollar deal for a first-of-a-kind study with a leading U.S. biotech. Our differentiated approach will utilize secondary data and advanced analytics to gain regulatory approval for a label extension. This analytics-enabled approach leverages our E360 tech platform. We will position our clients' products for a new indication at a much faster pace. By the way, this is a trend that we expect to accelerate as regulatory actions, such as the 21st Century Cures Act, will only increase demand for Real-World Insights. 
Finally, in our R&D business. We were encouraged by another solid quarter of contracted bookings. In fact, third quarter net new business growth was over 40% compared to the third quarter of 2016. 
Of course, as you will recall, Q3 '16 was the last stand-alone quarter for legacy Quintiles before the merger. And bookings, you will recall, for that quarter were pretty abysmal, the result of which is the revenue headwind we are now facing in R&D Solutions, which you have all noted. However, the strong performance in the 4 quarters since then has resulted in an uptick of our LTM book-to-bill ratio, which was 1.22 for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. Next gen is a big part of this. It continues to gain traction in the market. We now have approximately $900 million of post-merger next-gen awards. Importantly, we are winning R&D business with clients we have done little or no work with in the past. Examples of these accounts that we unlocked this quarter due to next gen include: a top 10 global pharma, who we have done virtually no full-service clinical work with in almost a decade. We won 3 trials with them during the quarter, 2 of which were in oncology. A top 20 global pharma, who predominately insources all of their R&D work. They chose next gen due to our compelling value proposition and differentiated capabilities. This is in the area of NASH, a terrible disease that causes liver inflammation and cirrhosis. A top biopharma who has done nothing with us in the core clinical space for the last 12 years selected QuintilesIMS for their neurology trial. Our next-gen offering was so compelling we were able to displace the incumbent CRO for this study, and the client also picked us to be a preferred provider.
Now as I mentioned last quarter, the traction we see in the marketplace for our next-gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in next-gen operationalization and resourcing plans. This, of course, creates short-term headwinds for our margins, but as you can see in our numbers, we were able to more than overcome this with our cost savings and productivity initiatives. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to remind you that we are holding our Analyst and Investor Conference in New York City on November 8. We're looking forward to this event. We plan to utilize this occasion to show deeper dives in our 3 main businesses with case studies and tech demos. You also will have an opportunity to get acquainted with a broader cross-section of our leadership team. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."

As in previous quarters, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. 
Combined company third quarter revenue was $2.019 billion, which was at the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. Third quarter revenue grew 4.8% reported and 4.3% at constant currency. 
R&D Solutions service revenue of $938 million grew 7.3% at actual FX rates and 6.9% at constant currency. Growth was again impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016. When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth was 7.8%. 
Commercial Solutions revenue of $887 million grew 4% reported and 2.9% at constant currency. As Ari mentioned, the Commercial Solutions growth rate was impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Adjusting for Encore, growth in Commercial Solutions was 5.6%. 
Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $194 million declined 2.3% at actual FX rates and 1.1% at constant currency.
Turning now to profit. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $512 million. GAAP net income was $84 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38. Adjusted net income was $260 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.19 in the third quarter. 
Now let's take a look at year-to-date results. Again, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. 
Year-to-date revenue was $5.899 billion. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on the last couple of calls. For the first 9 months of 2017, it negatively impacted revenue by $8 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis, year-to-date revenue grew 2.9% at constant currency and 2.3% reported.
On a combined company basis, R&D Solutions service revenue of $2.7 billion grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3.6% at actual FX rates. Again, growth was impacted by a decline in the early clinical development business. 
Commercial Solutions revenue of $2.611 billion grew 2.5% at constant currency and 2.1% reported. Year-to-date Commercial Solutions growth was also impacted by the sale of Encore. 
Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $596 million declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported. Year-to-date revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by a onetime $9 million royalty acceleration in the second quarter of 2016. 
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. 
For the 12 months ended September 30, 2017, R&D Solutions as-contracted bookings were $4.37 billion. We had a solid performance in the quarter. Our contracted backlog was $10.32 billion at the end of Q3, and we expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
We have had good backlog progression over the last 4 quarters. Let's take a quick look. 
As you know, we already have the largest backlog in the industry. As a reminder, when the merger closed last year, we reviewed our backlog policy and decided to implement a more conservative approach. We now require a written, binding commitment or signed contract to record new business in our backlog. We are happy to be back above $10 billion once again now using our more conservative approach to bookings. 
Turning now to profit for the first 9 months of 2017. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2017 was $1.465 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8% expanded 30 basis points. 
GAAP net income was $233 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.04 for the first 9 months of 2017. 
Adjusted net income was $739 million. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.28 in the first 9 months of 2017.
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. 
At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion, and our debt was $9.8 billion, resulting in net debt of about $8.7 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.9x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.3x. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $436 million in the third quarter, capital expenditures were $89 million and free cash flow was $347 million. You saw that during the quarter, we issued EUR 500 million worth of senior euro notes due 2025 at a rate of 2 7/8%. We used the proceeds mostly to retire existing 4 1/8% euro notes that were due 2023. We also refinanced our term loan B debt, raising an incremental $750 million, which was primarily used to pay down the revolver. 
We repurchased $380 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors during September. And toward the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $177 million worth of our shares in the open market for a total of $557 million of repurchases during Q3. 
Let's now turn to guidance. 
As you know, we were always expecting a strong fourth quarter. The overperformance in Q3 allows a smoother trajectory for the fourth quarter and better visibility to the full year numbers.
For the fourth quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.12 billion and $2.16 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $560 million and $585 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.28 and $1.37. We're updating our full year adjusted book tax rate guidance, which is now expected to be approximately 28%. Our previous guidance was approximately 29%. 
So in summary, we delivered a strong quarter, driven by solid operational execution. Next gen continued to gain traction, and we had nice wins with previously locked-out accounts. Our technology solutions business secured their first global multiyear OCE deal. We have repurchased $3.3 billion of our shares at an average price of $81 since the merger. And of course, as a nice capstone to our first year as a merged company, we were honored to be included in the S&P 500.
I look forward to seeing many of you at our November 8 Analyst and Investor Conference. 
And with that, I would now like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

As always, there are studies that are being pulled based on developments in the market, pricing and otherwise and competing trials. But as in -- really for the past year or 2, emerging biopharma, we see, has increasing funding. With respect to -- and also, I would just add a comment that some large pharma in the context of perhaps more rational evaluation of their portfolios and of their cost structure at the same time are insourcing parts of their development. Now next gen largely unaffected by this because it's new and different. In fact, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we won a preferred provider status with a large pharma that essentially previously had no -- did not outsource any CRO work. And that's largely on the back of the next-gen capabilities. In fact, we can have clients asking us to provide the next-gen capability, if you will, in combination with their resources, and we are evaluating some of those type of hybrid joint partnership models with some of our clients. With respect to revenue accelerating, it's a little bit more than a 1-year cycle, unfortunately. Generally, I don't think that -- nice bookings we have this quarter, and again, it was a very strong bookings quarter. I've seen some of your notes, not you particularly, but some of your colleagues' notes, and with -- again, the math is not quite correct. The bookings are actually very strong this quarter. It's one of the best bookings quarter -- book-to-bills we've had in a long time. And so -- but the acceleration of revenue, we still have to go through the cycle. We had, as you know, bad bookings last year, and so we've got to cycle through that. And probably, towards the end of '18, we will see the benefits of -- we're starting the benefits of the higher bookings this quarter and the previous one. Thank you."

So these tools are based on a common platform, and you will hear some more. You might recall it's a much tinier business, but we did acquire a small company called Wingspan, which is a regulated comp and management tool and very highly complementary with [ Drug Den ], which is more in the area of study startup and payment processing. I am really looking forward to the investor conference in a couple of weeks because we plan to demo some of these tools and share more detail about that initiative. So I hope that you can attend. Also, if I may just add this. We are actually accelerating investments there. And we are -- that wasn't your question; I just anticipate. We are going a little faster than anticipated on our synergy ramp and on our productivity initiatives. And because of that, we feel we can afford the accelerated investments. So net-net, as you probably will note, we still are, -- year-over-year, even though the compares are hard to do because we weren't a merged company last year, but we have even a little bit of margin expansion. Year-to-date, I think it's around 30 basis points of margin expansion. And fourth quarter, we will see maybe a little bit also or margin expansion, maybe not as much again because we are investing largely in next gen and in the clinical technology suite that you just referred to. Thank you."

When you peel the onion, though, you'll see the true difference. I mentioned in my remarks that we are starting to see a lot of interest prompted by regulatory actions in the 21st Century Cures Act, which increased the demand for Real-World Insights. This is about trying to find new indications for existing drugs and utilizing secondary data and analytics that, frankly, we believe, we are uniquely positioned to provide. We see a lot of demand. So actually, the business in the quarter grew double digits, the Real-World business. It's consistent with long-term historical growth rates that we've seen for Real-World, certainly on the IMS legacy business. And even the late-phase study business at Quintiles grew double digits in the quarter. So our outlook for the business remains very strong, and we continue to see synergy on how we go to market. So very positive outlook there."

We're just buying because we are -- we have a strategy behind it. It's all mostly technology-based companies that give us unique capabilities so that we can move to next century's clinical trial processes and improve -- or continue to improve our suite of commercial applications, number one; and number two, when there is a hole in our offerings, like in the case of the TKL acquisition on the clinical side, we bought a small CRO. And we are, of course, always looking at that. There aren't that many such opportunities, but we're looking at that. With respect to larger acquisitions, of course we have an obligation to look at them, and we have and we'll continue to look when they come up. But in every single case, we've moved away -- while we might have wanted to do the acquisition, we moved away because we felt there was a very large disconnect between the valuation expectation and what we were prepared to pay. So we will continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation. As you know, we have a great problem, which is we generate a lot of cash flow. We are very effective repatriating the overseas cash in a tax-efficient manner, and we may generate from time to time cash from a divestiture. So the combination of our operating cash flow, our tax-efficient repatriations. Plus we have communicated to you before that the type of net leverage that we have today, which is anywhere between 4 and 4.5, we feel, is the appropriate capital structure for a business of our type and our cash flow profile and risk characteristics. Given the current rate environment, again our average cost of debt after tax is just over 2%. So it will be really uneconomic to -- for us to pay down debt with our extra cash. So absent incremental CapEx internally or absent acquisitions beyond the 1% to 2%, you're going to see us continue to actively do share repurchase, which we feel is an efficient way to return cash to our shareholders, and we believe the stock is very underpriced and is a great value."

The -- what, we believe today is that next-gen capabilities are applicable to 50% to 60% of the trials. And one of the reasons that we've upped that number since the merger is because what's in the pipeline of the molecules is more and more a complex stuff, a specialty oncology. They have been very tight areas, CG or otherwise, where the patient population is very scarce. And again, this is all about accelerating patient -- site identification and patient enrollment. And again, I invite you to attend our investor conference in a couple of weeks. We plan to demo and go through a number of the case studies so you'll see the value. Now I should add that the reason why we don't think it's applicable to 100% is not because it's not doable, it's simply because it has no value for the balance of the pipeline. That is, you don't need to deploy those tools. It's a really -- it's a pretty well-known therapy area. Everyone knows where the sites and the patients are and based on empirical data and it's not that complicated. That's not the issue in those trials. But I think -- we think that the -- that we can have -- we can generate great value in 50% to 60% of the portfolio. I will finally say that we also are applying next-gen tools to existing ongoing trials where recruitment is falling behind, including in studies where we were brought in to replace an existing CRO that was underperforming. So that actually has been -- it's been great, but it's been a little bit of a distraction in terms of delaying and in terms of resources and so on. So we've been actually recruiting faster and more than we had anticipated in terms of the ramp on next gen."

And I think, well, obviously, as you said, we've previously told you that we'll try to get you off this quarterly book-to-bill going forward. We made an exception, by the way, last quarter because we feel it's appropriate once in a while to kind of clarify the numbers, and we thought we had given you enough points that, that enables you then to understand what it is in any given quarter, and also because it was 4 quarters under the new method since the merger and we thought it was appropriate to do so. Now you're right, FX can also skew the number. And it's -- I have to tell you it's not simple math when you look at the FX implications simply because every quarter is a different set of FX numbers. And then we also revalue the backlog at the end of the quarter where, in fact, the revenue is the average FX every single day during the quarter. So the numbers are hard to interpret per se in a quarter, and the trend is more important. Now if you do simple math on the reported numbers, okay, that is, you do the -- you take the end-of-the-quarter backlog minus last year backlog and adjust for revenue, and then the math gives you a 1.35 book-to-bill in the quarter. And that does include FX. And I'll tell you what it is, but the -- that, in a sense, reflects what is in the numbers. That is, if you assume that FX are not going to change at all going forward, then that's what you have in the backlog in terms of understanding the future of the business. That's about 1.35 for the quarter. Now if you want to look at comparisons across quarters, we believe that you should look at the different numbers we gave you in the past. And if you do that and you look at the numbers this quarter in terms of progression, you're probably going to calculate 1.25. Now the -- neither -- so -- but the real number, to answer your question, isn't between that 1.25 and 1.35, closer to the 1.25, as you suggested for the quarter on a -- and if we take out all FX from every single number. So that enables you to compare quarters in a clean manner as best as we can tell, okay. So somewhere between the 1.25 and the 1.35."

But you asked about commercial revenue, if I understand correctly. And I just want to point out that in terms of the commercial side of the house versus the development side, again in the spirit of just clarifying perhaps misunderstandings, when we put the company together, we, as best as we could, gave you the contours of each of the businesses. And you will recall that we aggregated some of the commercial businesses of legacy Quintiles into the legacy IMS commercial businesses. But since then, a few things have happened. First, there was a small clinical trials technology business at IMS. It was about $20 million of revenue in total. And we moved that since then from commercial to R&D. Secondly, there was also a small legacy IMS CSO business, contracted sales business, in Eastern Europe, which was a $5 million or so of revenue, and we moved that to IES. And finally, as you know, we sold the Encore business, which removed $25 million -- actually more than $25 million of revenue from the second half. So our commercial business, versus what it was when we merged the company and told you what commercial looked like, that commercial business lost $50 million of revenue between the transfer of businesses out and the sale of the Encore business. So that's just as starters. And in terms of the growth in commercial, actually even absent these adjustments, you will see that we continue to see robust growth. The core IMS business historically has been growing at about 6% annually, and that was inclusive of 1 to 2 points of acquisitions. And it's exactly been performing the same since the beginning of the merger. So no changes there at all. And as I told you, this quarter, actually the acquisition contribution is relatively minor. So good organic growth, which is usually in the 4%-type range historically, has been maintained more or less since the merger. So that was exactly your question, but I just wanted to provide more color on commercial revenue. And I think there's one more question, maybe the last question?"

So of the new stuff, about 20% of pipeline, and when we look at -- that doesn't mean that we win every time, but that's what our -- over time, as I said, we hope to apply next gen to 50% to 60% of the pipe, and I'm assuming that, again, about 1/3 of that would be fixed price. There are cases where we don't want it to be fixed price. There are cases, as I said before, where we are hybrid, that is we sell a technology capability and upfront work separately, and that's a fixed price. And then we sell other services, data or otherwise, that are not fixed price. Again, we are experimenting with these new models, but we're seeing a lot of traction and a lot of interest. It often is a clincher of the deal at the end, right, because we're willing to take more risk."

You'll remember we have the salesforce.com re-platforming. So on the commercial side, we also have investments. And then we have also sales force recruitment to try to accelerate our business development activities on R&D. And the combination of all of that are the investments that we've made. We're also carrying additional costs as a result of the merger. We've been carrying additional costs throughout the year, but these are costs that we cannot adjust out. These are -- in cases where we have to maintain redundant people or redundant facilities for a while, redundant IT systems and software licenses, all of that needs to be maintained as we transition to one or the other or  a new one. And so that creates some pockets of costs, and we cannot adjust that out because it's not a onetime kind of a merger-specific outside cost. It's just redundant, parallel costs. When we take it out, then it goes away, and it's being taken out over time. So these are all the headwinds. But despite all of that, as I pointed out before, year-to-date, we have margin expansion. We said -- as I said before, I'd like to say we are in the business of growing revenue and expanding margins, not one or the other. There might be some quarters where we don't have margin expansion, and my goal is certainly to have margin expansion, and I anticipate that 2018 will not be an exception to that despite all the investments that I just mentioned."

Thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Q3 was a strong quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. The results were in line with or better than what we had anticipated",923,"Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings call. 
I'm pleased to report that Q3 was a strong quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. The results were in line with or better than what we had anticipated. 
As most of you previously noted, our plan for the year had a steeper ramp and was more back-end loaded. Because the quarter was stronger than we had anticipated, we'll have a smoother glide path to our full year targets. 
Let's review the quarter. 
Consistent with the last 3 quarters, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger took place January 1,'16. 
Third quarter revenue was $2,019,000,000, and it grew 4.8%. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5 points to revenue growth. 
R&D Solutions growth was 7.3%. R&D Solutions revenue was again negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been nearly 8%.
Commercial Solutions grew 4%. Growth in Commercial Solutions was negatively impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Adjusting for Encore, the commercial business would have grown 5.5%. 
Integrated Engagement Services revenue was slightly down versus the prior year. 
Combined company adjusted EBITDA was $512 million.
We had a number of key wins in the quarter. Let me provide some examples. 
First, in our technology solutions business. You will recall that we have been accelerating investments in re-platforming our global CRM and MCM capabilities. We told you we are aiming to release our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE, SaaS offering towards the end of the year. This is still on track, and in fact, during the third quarter, we had our first OCE win, a 7-year deal with a leading European pharma client to deploy OCE in over 30 countries. 
As a reminder, OCE is revolutionary compared to other offerings in the market. This is not just a CRM tool, we have built a collaborative tool that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to integrate various functions within our clients' commercial operations. It is highly differentiated to the current point solutions that exist in the market.
Next, in our Real-World Insights business, where our team won a multimillion dollar deal for a first-of-a-kind study with a leading U.S. biotech. Our differentiated approach will utilize secondary data and advanced analytics to gain regulatory approval for a label extension. This analytics-enabled approach leverages our E360 tech platform. We will position our clients' products for a new indication at a much faster pace. By the way, this is a trend that we expect to accelerate as regulatory actions, such as the 21st Century Cures Act, will only increase demand for Real-World Insights. 
Finally, in our R&D business. We were encouraged by another solid quarter of contracted bookings. In fact, third quarter net new business growth was over 40% compared to the third quarter of 2016. 
Of course, as you will recall, Q3 '16 was the last stand-alone quarter for legacy Quintiles before the merger. And bookings, you will recall, for that quarter were pretty abysmal, the result of which is the revenue headwind we are now facing in R&D Solutions, which you have all noted. However, the strong performance in the 4 quarters since then has resulted in an uptick of our LTM book-to-bill ratio, which was 1.22 for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. 
Next gen is a big part of this. It continues to gain traction in the market. We now have approximately $900 million of post-merger next-gen awards. Importantly, we are winning R&D business with clients we have done little or no work with in the past. Examples of these accounts that we unlocked this quarter due to next gen include: a top 10 global pharma, who we have done virtually no full-service clinical work with in almost a decade. We won 3 trials with them during the quarter, 2 of which were in oncology. 
A top 20 global pharma, who predominately insources all of their R&D work. They chose next gen due to our compelling value proposition and differentiated capabilities. This is in the area of NASH, a terrible disease that causes liver inflammation and cirrhosis. A top biopharma who has done nothing with us in the core clinical space for the last 12 years selected QuintilesIMS for their neurology trial. Our next-gen offering was so compelling we were able to displace the incumbent CRO for this study, and the client also picked us to be a preferred provider.
Now as I mentioned last quarter, the traction we see in the marketplace for our next-gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in next-gen operationalization and resourcing plans. This, of course, creates short-term headwinds for our margins, but as you can see in our numbers, we were able to more than overcome this with our cost savings and productivity initiatives. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to remind you that we are holding our Analyst and Investor Conference in New York City on November 8. We're looking forward to this event. We plan to utilize this occasion to show deeper dives in our 3 main businesses with case studies and tech demos. You also will have an opportunity to get acquainted with a broader cross-section of our leadership team. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."

As in previous quarters, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. 
Combined company third quarter revenue was $2.019 billion, which was at the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. Third quarter revenue grew 4.8% reported and 4.3% at constant currency. 
R&D Solutions service revenue of $938 million grew 7.3% at actual FX rates and 6.9% at constant currency. Growth was again impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016. When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth was 7.8%. 
Commercial Solutions revenue of $887 million grew 4% reported and 2.9% at constant currency. As Ari mentioned, the Commercial Solutions growth rate was impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Adjusting for Encore, growth in Commercial Solutions was 5.6%. 
Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $194 million declined 2.3% at actual FX rates and 1.1% at constant currency.
Turning now to profit. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $512 million. GAAP net income was $84 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38. Adjusted net income was $260 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.19 in the third quarter. 
Now let's take a look at year-to-date results. Again, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. 
Year-to-date revenue was $5.899 billion. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on the last couple of calls. For the first 9 months of 2017, it negatively impacted revenue by $8 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis, year-to-date revenue grew 2.9% at constant currency and 2.3% reported.
On a combined company basis, R&D Solutions service revenue of $2.7 billion grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3.6% at actual FX rates. Again, growth was impacted by a decline in the early clinical development business. 
Commercial Solutions revenue of $2.611 billion grew 2.5% at constant currency and 2.1% reported. Year-to-date Commercial Solutions growth was also impacted by the sale of Encore. 
Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $596 million declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported. Year-to-date revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by a onetime $9 million royalty acceleration in the second quarter of 2016. 
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. 
For the 12 months ended September 30, 2017, R&D Solutions as-contracted bookings were $4.37 billion. We had a solid performance in the quarter. Our contracted backlog was $10.32 billion at the end of Q3, and we expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
We have had good backlog progression over the last 4 quarters. Let's take a quick look. 
As you know, we already have the largest backlog in the industry. As a reminder, when the merger closed last year, we reviewed our backlog policy and decided to implement a more conservative approach. We now require a written, binding commitment or signed contract to record new business in our backlog. We are happy to be back above $10 billion once again, now using our more conservative approach to bookings. 
Turning now to profit for the first 9 months of 2017. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2017 was $1.465 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8% expanded 30 basis points. 
GAAP net income was $233 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.04 for the first 9 months of 2017. 
Adjusted net income was $739 million. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.28 in the first 9 months of 2017.
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. 
At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion, and our debt was $9.8 billion, resulting in net debt of about $8.7 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.9x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.3x. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $436 million in the third quarter, capital expenditures were $89 million and free cash flow was $347 million. You saw that during the quarter, we issued EUR 500 million worth of senior euro notes due 2025 at a rate of 2 7/8%. We used the proceeds mostly to retire existing 4 1/8% euro notes that were due 2023. We also refinanced our term loan B debt, raising an incremental $750 million, which was primarily used to pay down the revolver. 
We repurchased $380 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors during September. And toward the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $177 million worth of our shares in the open market for a total of $557 million of repurchases during Q3. 
Let's now turn to guidance. 
As you know, we were always expecting a strong fourth quarter. The overperformance in Q3 allows a smoother trajectory for the fourth quarter and better visibility to the full year numbers.
For the fourth quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.12 billion and $2.16 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $560 million and $585 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.28 and $1.37. We're updating our full year adjusted book tax rate guidance, which is now expected to be approximately 28%. Our previous guidance was approximately 29%. 
So in summary, we delivered a strong quarter, driven by solid operational execution. Next gen continued to gain traction, and we had nice wins with previously locked-out accounts. Our technology solutions business secured their first global multiyear OCE deal. We have repurchased $3.3 billion of our shares at an average price of $81 since the merger. And of course, as a nice capstone to our first year as a merged company, we were honored to be included in the S&P 500.
I look forward to seeing many of you at our November 8 Analyst and Investor Conference. 
And with that, I would now like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

As always, there are studies that are being pulled based on developments in the market, pricing and otherwise and competing trials. But as in -- really for the past year or 2, emerging biopharma, we see, has increasing funding. With respect to -- and also, I would just add a comment that some large pharma in the context of perhaps more rational evaluation of their portfolios and of their cost structure at the same time are insourcing parts of their development.
Now next gen largely unaffected by this because it's new and different. In fact, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we won a preferred provider status with a large pharma that essentially previously had no -- did not outsource any CRO work. And that's largely on the back of the next-gen capabilities. In fact, we even have clients asking us to provide the next-gen capability, if you will, in combination with their resources, and we are evaluating some of those type of hybrid joint partnership models with some of our clients. 
With respect to revenue accelerating, it's a little bit more than a 1-year cycle, unfortunately. Generally, the nice bookings we have this quarter, and again, it was a very strong bookings quarter. I've seen some of your notes, not you particularly, but some of your colleagues' notes, and with -- again, the math is not quite correct. The bookings are actually very strong this quarter. It's one of the best bookings quarter -- book-to-bills we've had in a long time. And so -- the acceleration of revenue, we still have to go through the cycle. We had, as you know, bad bookings last year, and so we've got to cycle through that. And probably, towards the end of '18, we will see the benefits of -- we're starting the benefits of the higher bookings this quarter and the previous one. Thank you."

We actually came in higher than our guidance on every metric, revenue, EBITDA and EPS, for this quarter. The implied -- because we came higher, the implied -- we never gave guidance for the fourth quarter, but we had a guidance for the year. 
So yes, the -- since the guidance for third quarter was lower than where we came in at, then fourth quarter implied that you would have derived by subtraction, given our guidance for the year, we would have been a little higher. But because Q3 came higher, then Q3 ends up being a little bit perhaps lower than you would have expected. At the end -- for the year, I think we had a broad range.

We are now at $8.2 billion to $8.6 billion. But since then, we took out $25 million of revenue from the Encore business.

We also bought, though it was in -- sometime in the middle of the quarter, and it's not huge revenues but, nevertheless, it did contribute a little bit, a company called DrugDev, which is included in our R&D Solutions business.
And it's an attractive technology platform that has, we think, highly differentiated and very attractive tools for study startup, payments and clinical trial optimization. We did this acquisition in the midst of the third quarter and there's a little bit of revenue. It's very low revenue. We paid a lot of money for it.

We are going a little faster than anticipated on our synergy ramp and on our productivity initiatives. And because of that, we feel we can afford the accelerated investments. 
So net-net, as you probably will note, we still are, -- year-over-year, even though the compares are hard to do because we weren't a merged company last year, but we have even a little bit of margin expansion.

I mentioned in my remarks that we are starting to see a lot of interest prompted by regulatory actions in the 21st Century Cures Act, which increased the demand for Real-World Insights. This is about trying to find new indications for existing drugs and utilizing secondary data and analytics that, frankly, we believe, we are uniquely positioned to provide. 
We see a lot of demand. So actually, the business in the quarter grew double digits, the Real-World business. It's consistent with long-term historical growth rates that we've seen for Real-World, certainly on the IMS legacy business. And even the late-phase study business at Quintiles grew double digits in the quarter. So our outlook for the business remains very strong, and we continue to see synergy on how we go to market.

We're just buying because we are -- we have a strategy behind it. It's all mostly technology-based companies that give us unique capabilities so that we can move to next century's clinical trial processes and improve -- or continue to improve our suite of commercial applications, number one; and number two, when there is a hole in our offerings, like in the case of the TKL acquisition on the clinical side, we bought a small CRO. And we are, of course, always looking at that. There aren't that many such opportunities, but we're looking at that. 
With respect to larger acquisitions, of course we have an obligation to look at them, and we have and we'll continue to look when they come up. But in every single case, we've moved away -- while we might have wanted to do the acquisition, we moved away because we felt there was a very large disconnect between the valuation expectation and what we were prepared to pay. So we will continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation. As you know, we have a great problem, which is we generate a lot of cash flow. We are very effective repatriating the overseas cash in a tax-efficient manner, and we may generate from time to time cash from a divestiture. So the combination of our operating cash flow, our tax-efficient repatriations. 
Plus we have communicated to you before that the type of net leverage that we have today, which is anywhere between 4 and 4.5, we feel, is the appropriate capital structure for a business of our type and our cash flow profile and risk characteristics. Given the current rate environment, again our average cost of debt after tax is just over 2%. So it will be really uneconomic to -- for us to pay down debt with our extra cash. So absent incremental CapEx internally or absent acquisitions beyond the 1% to 2%, you're going to see us continue to actively do share repurchase, which we feel is an efficient way to return cash to our shareholders, and we believe the stock is very underpriced and is a great value."

The -- what, we believe today is that next-gen capabilities are applicable to 50% to 60% of the trials. And one of the reasons that we've upped that number since the merger is because what's in the pipeline of the molecules is more and more a complex stuff, a specialty oncology. They have these very tight areas, CG or otherwise, where the patient population is very scarce. And again, this is all about accelerating patient -- site identification and patient enrollment. 
And again, I invite you to attend our investor conference in a couple of weeks. We plan to demo and go through a number of the case studies so you'll see the value. Now I should add that the reason why we don't think it's applicable to 100% is not because it's not doable, it's simply because it has no value for the balance of the pipeline. That is, you don't need to deploy those tools. It's a really -- it's a pretty well-known therapy area. Everyone knows where the sites and the patients are and based on empirical data and it's not that complicated. That's not the issue in those trials. 
But I think -- we think that the -- that we can have -- we can generate great value in 50% to 60% of the portfolio. I will finally say that we also are applying next-gen tools to existing ongoing trials where recruitment is falling behind, including in studies where we were brought in to replace an existing CRO that was underperforming. So that actually has been -- it's been great, but it's been a little bit of a distraction in terms of delaying and in terms of resources and so on. So we've been actually recruiting faster and more than we had anticipated in terms of the ramp on next gen."

And I think, well, obviously, as you said, we've previously told you that we'll try to get you off this quarterly book-to-bill going forward. We made an exception, by the way, last quarter because we feel it's appropriate once in a while to kind of clarify the numbers, and we thought we had given you enough points that, that enables you then to understand what it is in any given quarter, and also because it was 4 quarters under the new method since the merger and we thought it was appropriate to do so. 
Now you're right, FX can also skew the number. And it's -- I have to tell you it's not simple math when you look at the FX implications simply because every quarter is a different set of FX numbers. And then we also revalue the backlog at the end of the quarter where, in fact, the revenue is the average FX every single day during the quarter. So the numbers are hard to interpret per se in a quarter, and the trend is more important. Now if you do simple math on the reported numbers, okay, that is, you do the -- you take the end-of-the-quarter backlog minus last year backlog and adjust for revenue, and then the math gives you a 1.35 book-to-bill in the quarter. 
And that does include FX. And I'll tell you what it is, but the -- that, in a sense, reflects what is in the numbers. That is, if you assume that FX are not going to change at all going forward, then that's what you have in the backlog in terms of understanding the future of the business. That's that 1.35 for the quarter. Now if you want to look at comparisons across quarters, we believe that you should look at the different numbers we gave you in the past. And if you do that and you look at the numbers this quarter in terms of progression, you're probably going to calculate 1.25. Now the -- neither -- so -- but the real number, to answer your question, is in between that 1.25 and 1.35, closer to the 1.25, as you suggested for the quarter on a -- and if we take out all FX from every single number. So that enables you to compare quarters in a clean manner as best as we can tell, okay. So somewhere between the 1.25 and the 1.35."

Secondly, there was also a small legacy IMS CSO business, contracted sales business, in Eastern Europe, which was a $5 million or so of revenue, and we moved that to IES. And finally, as you know, we sold the Encore business, which removed $25 million -- actually more than $25 million of revenue from the second half. So our commercial business, versus what it was when we merged the company and told you what commercial looked like, that commercial business lost $50 million of revenue between the transfer of businesses out and the sale of the Encore business. So that's just as starters. 
And in terms of the growth in commercial, actually even absent these adjustments, you will see that we continue to see robust growth. The core IMS business historically has been growing at about 6% annually, and that was inclusive of 1 to 2 points of acquisitions. And it's exactly been performing the same since the beginning of the merger. So no changes there at all. 
And as I told you, this quarter, actually the acquisition contribution is relatively minor. So good organic growth, which is usually in the 4%-type range historically, has been maintained more or less since the merger. So that -- I don't know was that exactly your question, but I just wanted to provide more color on commercial revenue. And I think there's one more question, maybe the last question?"

Yet, I anticipate this is going to grow, though. We're not going to disclose exactly how much of our new business is fixed price every time. Now we have previously said that we are applying so far next gen to about 20% of the -- of what we look at. And of that, a portion of this is fixed price, okay. Maybe call it 1/3, okay, to give you a rough estimate. 
So of the new stuff, about 20% of pipeline, and when we look at -- that doesn't mean that we win every time, but that's what our -- over time, as I said, we hope to apply next gen to 50% to 60% of the pipe, and I'm assuming that, again, about 1/3 of that would be fixed price. There are cases where we don't want it to be fixed price. There are cases, as I said before, where we are hybrid, that is we sell a technology capability and upfront work separately, and that's a fixed price. And then we sell other services, data or otherwise, that are not fixed price. Again, we are experimenting with these new models, but we're seeing a lot of traction and a lot of interest. It often is a clincher of the deal at the end, right, because we're willing to take more risk."

You'll remember we have the salesforce.com re-platforming. So on the commercial side, we also have investments. And then we have also sales force recruitment to try to accelerate our business development activities on R&D. And the combination of all of that are the investments that we've made.
We're also carrying additional costs as a result of the merger. We've been carrying additional costs throughout the year, but these are costs that we cannot adjust out. These are -- in cases where we have to maintain redundant people or redundant facilities for a while, redundant IT systems and software licenses, all of that needs to be maintained as we transition to one or the other or  a new one. 
And so that creates a bucket of costs, and we cannot adjust that out because it's not a onetime kind of a merger-specific outside cost. It's just redundant, parallel costs. When we take it out, then it goes away, and it's being taken out over time. So these are all the headwinds. But despite all of that, as I pointed out before, year-to-date, we have margin expansion. You said -- as I said before, I'd like to say we are in the business of growing revenue and expanding margins, not one or the other. There might be some quarters where we don't have margin expansion, and my goal is certainly to have margin expansion, and I anticipate that 2018 will not be an exception to that despite all the investments that I just mentioned."

I'm pleased to report that Q3 was a strong quarter for the QuintilesIMS team. The results were in line with or better than what we had anticipated. 
As most of you previously noted, our plan for the year had a steeper ramp and was more back-end loaded. Because the quarter was stronger than we had anticipated, we'll have a smoother glide path to our full year targets. 
Let's review the quarter. 
Consistent with the last 3 quarters, we're making comparisons more meaningful by discussing results on a combined company basis as if the merger took place January 1,'16. 
Third quarter revenue was $2,019,000,000, and it grew 4.8%. Acquisitions contributed about 1.5 points to revenue growth. 
R&D Solutions growth was 7.3%. R&D Solutions revenue was again negatively impacted by our early clinical development business, where we closed a facility in London last year. Excluding the early clinical development business, revenue growth would have been nearly 8%.
Commercial Solutions grew 4%. Growth in Commercial Solutions was negatively impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Adjusting for Encore, the commercial business would have grown 5.5%. 
Integrated Engagement Services revenue was slightly down versus the prior year. 
Combined company adjusted EBITDA was $512 million.
We had a number of key wins in the quarter. Let me provide some examples. 
First, in our technology solutions business. You will recall that we have been accelerating investments in re-platforming our global CRM and MCM capabilities. We told you we are aiming to release our new Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE, SaaS offering towards the end of the year. This is still on track, and in fact, during the third quarter, we had our first OCE win, a 7-year deal with a leading European pharma client to deploy OCE in over 30 countries. 
As a reminder, OCE is revolutionary compared to other offerings in the market. This is not just a CRM tool, we have built a collaborative tool that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to integrate various functions within our clients' commercial operations. It is highly differentiated to the current point solutions that exist in the market.
Next, in our Real-World Insights business, where our team won a multimillion dollar deal for a first-of-a-kind study with a leading U.S. biotech. Our differentiated approach will utilize secondary data and advanced analytics to gain regulatory approval for a label extension. This analytics-enabled approach leverages our E360 tech platform. We will position our clients' products for a new indication at a much faster pace. By the way, this is a trend that we expect to accelerate as regulatory actions, such as the 21st Century Cures Act, will only increase demand for Real-World Insights. 
Finally, in our R&D business. We were encouraged by another solid quarter of contracted bookings. In fact, third quarter net new business growth was over 40% compared to the third quarter of 2016. 
Of course, as you will recall, Q3 '16 was the last stand-alone quarter for legacy Quintiles before the merger. And bookings, you will recall, for that quarter were pretty abysmal, the result of which is the revenue headwind we are now facing in R&D Solutions, which you have all noted. However, the strong performance in the 4 quarters since then has resulted in an uptick of our LTM book-to-bill ratio, which was 1.22 for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. 
Next gen is a big part of this. It continues to gain traction in the market. We now have approximately $900 million of post-merger next-gen awards. Importantly, we are winning R&D business with clients we have done little or no work with in the past. Examples of these accounts that we unlocked this quarter due to next gen include: a top 10 global pharma, who we have done virtually no full-service clinical work with in almost a decade. We won 3 trials with them during the quarter, 2 of which were in oncology. 
A top 20 global pharma, who predominately insources all of their R&D work. They chose next gen due to our compelling value proposition and differentiated capabilities. This is in the area of NASH, a terrible disease that causes liver inflammation and cirrhosis. A top biopharma who has done nothing with us in the core clinical space for the last 12 years selected QuintilesIMS for their neurology trial. Our next-gen offering was so compelling we were able to displace the incumbent CRO for this study, and the client also picked us to be a preferred provider.
Now as I mentioned last quarter, the traction we see in the marketplace for our next-gen solution has led us to accelerate investments in next-gen operationalization and resourcing plans. This, of course, creates short-term headwinds for our margins, but as you can see in our numbers, we were able to more than overcome this with our cost savings and productivity initiatives. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to remind you that we are holding our Analyst and Investor Conference in New York City on November 8. We're looking forward to this event. We plan to utilize this occasion to show deeper dives in our 3 main businesses with case studies and tech demos. You also will have an opportunity to get acquainted with a broader cross-section of our leadership team. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail."

As in previous quarters, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. 
Combined company third quarter revenue was $2.019 billion, which was at the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. Third quarter revenue grew 4.8% reported and 4.3% at constant currency. 
R&D Solutions service revenue of $938 million grew 7.3% at actual FX rates and 6.9% at constant currency. Growth was again impacted by a decline in our early clinical development business due to the closing of a facility in Europe during 2016. When adjusting for the early clinical development business, R&D growth was 7.8%. 
Commercial Solutions revenue of $887 million grew 4% reported and 2.9% at constant currency. As Ari mentioned, the Commercial Solutions growth rate was impacted by the sale of the legacy Quintiles Encore business. Adjusting for Encore, growth in Commercial Solutions was 5.6%. 
Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $194 million declined 2.3% at actual FX rates and 1.1% at constant currency.
Turning now to profit. 
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $512 million. GAAP net income was $84 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38. Adjusted net income was $260 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.19 in the third quarter. 
Now let's take a look at year-to-date results. Again, I would like to call your attention to the more meaningful combined company comparisons in the center of the page. 
Year-to-date revenue was $5.899 billion. You will recall the deferred revenue adjustment we highlighted on the last couple of calls. For the first 9 months of 2017, it negatively impacted revenue by $8 million. When adjusting for this and on a combined company basis, year-to-date revenue grew 2.9% at constant currency and 2.3% reported.
On a combined company basis, R&D Solutions service revenue of $2.7 billion grew 4.3% at constant currency and 3.6% at actual FX rates. Again, growth was impacted by a decline in the early clinical development business. 
Commercial Solutions revenue of $2.611 billion grew 2.5% at constant currency and 2.1% reported. Year-to-date Commercial Solutions growth was also impacted by the sale of Encore. 
Integrated Engagement Services revenue of $596 million declined 1.2% at constant FX and 2.3% reported. Year-to-date revenue growth in the IES segment was impacted by a onetime $9 million royalty acceleration in the second quarter of 2016. 
Turning to R&D Solutions net new business and backlog. 
For the 12 months ended September 30, 2017, R&D Solutions as-contracted bookings were $4.37 billion. We had a solid performance in the quarter. Our contracted backlog was $10.32 billion at the end of Q3, and we expect to convert approximately $3 billion of this backlog into revenue over the next 12 months. 
We have had good backlog progression over the last 4 quarters. Let's take a quick look. 
As you know, we already have the largest backlog in the industry. As a reminder, when the merger closed last year, we reviewed our backlog policy and decided to implement a more conservative approach. We now require a written, binding commitment or signed contract to record new business in our backlog. We are happy to be back above $10 billion once again, now using our more conservative approach to bookings. 
Turning now to profit for the first 9 months of 2017. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2017 was $1.465 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8% expanded 30 basis points. 
GAAP net income was $233 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.04 for the first 9 months of 2017. 
Adjusted net income was $739 million. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.28 in the first 9 months of 2017.
Let's spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. 
At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion, and our debt was $9.8 billion, resulting in net debt of about $8.7 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.9x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Net of cash, our leverage ratio was 4.3x. 
Cash flow from operating activities was $436 million in the third quarter, capital expenditures were $89 million and free cash flow was $347 million. You saw that during the quarter, we issued EUR 500 million worth of senior euro notes due 2025 at a rate of 2 7/8%. We used the proceeds mostly to retire existing 4 1/8% euro notes that were due 2023. We also refinanced our term loan B debt, raising an incremental $750 million, which was primarily used to pay down the revolver. 
We repurchased $380 million worth of our shares from our private equity sponsors during September. And toward the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional $177 million worth of our shares in the open market for a total of $557 million of repurchases during Q3. 
Let's now turn to guidance. 
As you know, we were always expecting a strong fourth quarter. The overperformance in Q3 allows a smoother trajectory for the fourth quarter and better visibility to the full year numbers.
For the fourth quarter of 2017, assuming today's FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.12 billion and $2.16 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $560 million and $585 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.28 and $1.37. We're updating our full year adjusted book tax rate guidance, which is now expected to be approximately 28%. Our previous guidance was approximately 29%. 
So in summary, we delivered a strong quarter, driven by solid operational execution. Next gen continued to gain traction, and we had nice wins with previously locked-out accounts. Our technology solutions business secured their first global multiyear OCE deal. We have repurchased $3.3 billion of our shares at an average price of $81 since the merger. And of course, as a nice capstone to our first year as a merged company, we were honored to be included in the S&P 500.
I look forward to seeing many of you at our November 8 Analyst and Investor Conference. 
And with that, I would now like to ask the operator to please open the lines for Q&A."

As always, there are studies that are being pulled based on developments in the market, pricing and otherwise and competing trials. But as in -- really for the past year or 2, emerging biopharma, we see, has increasing funding. With respect to -- and also, I would just add a comment that some large pharma in the context of perhaps more rational evaluation of their portfolios and of their cost structure at the same time are insourcing parts of their development.
Now next gen largely unaffected by this because it's new and different. In fact, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we won a preferred provider status with a large pharma that essentially previously had no -- did not outsource any CRO work. And that's largely on the back of the next-gen capabilities. In fact, we even have clients asking us to provide the next-gen capability, if you will, in combination with their resources, and we are evaluating some of those type of hybrid joint partnership models with some of our clients. 
With respect to revenue accelerating, it's a little bit more than a 1-year cycle, unfortunately. Generally, the nice bookings we have this quarter, and again, it was a very strong bookings quarter. I've seen some of your notes, not you particularly, but some of your colleagues' notes, and with -- again, the math is not quite correct. The bookings are actually very strong this quarter. It's one of the best bookings quarter -- book-to-bills we've had in a long time. And so -- the acceleration of revenue, we still have to go through the cycle. We had, as you know, bad bookings last year, and so we've got to cycle through that. And probably, towards the end of '18, we will see the benefits of -- we're starting the benefits of the higher bookings this quarter and the previous one. Thank you."

So as you go back to the guidance we gave, which we have not -- we had not changed the entire year, right, which was $8 billion to $8.1 billion for the full year revenue. We are now at $8.2 billion to $8.6 billion. But since then, we took out $25 million of revenue from the Encore business.

And it's an attractive technology platform that has, we think, highly differentiated and very attractive tools for study startup, payments and clinical trial optimization. We did this acquisition in the midst of the third quarter and there's a little bit of revenue. It's very low revenue. We paid a lot of money for it.

So net-net, as you probably will note, we still are, -- year-over-year, even though the compares are hard to do because we weren't a merged company last year, but we have even a little bit of margin expansion. Year-to-date, I think it's around 30 basis points of margin expansion.

When you peel the onion, though, you'll see the true difference. I mentioned in my remarks that we are starting to see a lot of interest prompted by regulatory actions in the 21st Century Cures Act, which increased the demand for Real-World Insights. This is about trying to find new indications for existing drugs and utilizing secondary data and analytics that, frankly, we believe, we are uniquely positioned to provide. 
We see a lot of demand. So actually, the business in the quarter grew double digits, the Real-World business. It's consistent with long-term historical growth rates that we've seen for Real-World, certainly on the IMS legacy business. And even the late-phase study business at Quintiles grew double digits in the quarter. So our outlook for the business remains very strong, and we continue to see synergy on how we go to market.

It's all mostly technology-based companies that give us unique capabilities so that we can move to next century's clinical trial processes and improve -- or continue to improve our suite of commercial applications, number one; and number two, when there is a hole in our offerings, like in the case of the TKL acquisition on the clinical side, we bought a small CRO. And we are, of course, always looking at that. There aren't that many such opportunities, but we're looking at that. 
With respect to larger acquisitions, of course we have an obligation to look at them, and we have and we'll continue to look when they come up. But in every single case, we've moved away -- while we might have wanted to do the acquisition, we moved away because we felt there was a very large disconnect between the valuation expectation and what we were prepared to pay. So we will continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation. As you know, we have a great problem, which is we generate a lot of cash flow. We are very effective repatriating the overseas cash in a tax-efficient manner, and we may generate from time to time cash from a divestiture. So the combination of our operating cash flow, our tax-efficient repatriations. 
Plus we have communicated to you before that the type of net leverage that we have today, which is anywhere between 4 and 4.5, we feel, is the appropriate capital structure for a business of our type and our cash flow profile and risk characteristics. Given the current rate environment, again our average cost of debt after tax is just over 2%. So it will be really uneconomic to -- for us to pay down debt with our extra cash. So absent incremental CapEx internally or absent acquisitions beyond the 1% to 2%, you're going to see us continue to actively do share repurchase, which we feel is an efficient way to return cash to our shareholders, and we believe the stock is very underpriced and is a great value."

The -- what, we believe today is that next-gen capabilities are applicable to 50% to 60% of the trials. And one of the reasons that we've upped that number since the merger is because what's in the pipeline of the molecules is more and more a complex stuff, a specialty oncology. They have these very tight areas, CG or otherwise, where the patient population is very scarce. And again, this is all about accelerating patient -- site identification and patient enrollment. 
And again, I invite you to attend our investor conference in a couple of weeks. We plan to demo and go through a number of the case studies so you'll see the value. Now I should add that the reason why we don't think it's applicable to 100% is not because it's not doable, it's simply because it has no value for the balance of the pipeline. That is, you don't need to deploy those tools. It's a really -- it's a pretty well-known therapy area. Everyone knows where the sites and the patients are and based on empirical data and it's not that complicated. That's not the issue in those trials. 
But I think -- we think that the -- that we can have -- we can generate great value in 50% to 60% of the portfolio. I will finally say that we also are applying next-gen tools to existing ongoing trials where recruitment is falling behind, including in studies where we were brought in to replace an existing CRO that was underperforming. So that actually has been -- it's been great, but it's been a little bit of a distraction in terms of delaying and in terms of resources and so on.

And I think, well, obviously, as you said, we've previously told you that we'll try to get you off this quarterly book-to-bill going forward. We made an exception, by the way, last quarter because we feel it's appropriate once in a while to kind of clarify the numbers, and we thought we had given you enough points that, that enables you then to understand what it is in any given quarter, and also because it was 4 quarters under the new method since the merger and we thought it was appropriate to do so. 
Now you're right, FX can also skew the number. And it's -- I have to tell you it's not simple math when you look at the FX implications simply because every quarter is a different set of FX numbers. And then we also revalue the backlog at the end of the quarter where, in fact, the revenue is the average FX every single day during the quarter. So the numbers are hard to interpret per se in a quarter, and the trend is more important. Now if you do simple math on the reported numbers, okay, that is, you do the -- you take the end-of-the-quarter backlog minus last year backlog and adjust for revenue, and then the math gives you a 1.35 book-to-bill in the quarter. 
And that does include FX. And I'll tell you what it is, but the -- that, in a sense, reflects what is in the numbers. That is, if you assume that FX are not going to change at all going forward, then that's what you have in the backlog in terms of understanding the future of the business. That's that 1.35 for the quarter. Now if you want to look at comparisons across quarters, we believe that you should look at the different numbers we gave you in the past. And if you do that and you look at the numbers this quarter in terms of progression, you're probably going to calculate 1.25. Now the -- neither -- so -- but the real number, to answer your question, is in between that 1.25 and 1.35, closer to the 1.25, as you suggested for the quarter on a -- and if we take out all FX from every single number. So that enables you to compare quarters in a clean manner as best as we can tell, okay. So somewhere between the 1.25 and the 1.35."

But you asked about commercial revenue, if I understand correctly. And I just want to point out that in terms of the commercial side of the house versus the R&D, the development side, again in the spirit of just clarifying perhaps misunderstandings, when we put the company together, we, as best as we could, gave you the contours of each of the businesses. 
And you will recall that we aggregated some of the commercial businesses of legacy Quintiles into the legacy IMS commercial businesses. But since then, a few things have happened. First, there was a small clinical trials technology business at IMS. It was about $20 million of revenue in total. And we moved that since then from commercial to R&D. 
Secondly, there was also a small legacy IMS CSO business, contracted sales business, in Eastern Europe, which was a $5 million or so of revenue, and we moved that to IES. And finally, as you know, we sold the Encore business, which removed $25 million -- actually more than $25 million of revenue from the second half. So our commercial business, versus what it was when we merged the company and told you what commercial looked like, that commercial business lost $50 million of revenue between the transfer of businesses out and the sale of the Encore business. So that's just as starters. 
And in terms of the growth in commercial, actually even absent these adjustments, you will see that we continue to see robust growth. The core IMS business historically has been growing at about 6% annually, and that was inclusive of 1 to 2 points of acquisitions. And it's exactly been performing the same since the beginning of the merger. So no changes there at all. 
And as I told you, this quarter, actually the acquisition contribution is relatively minor. So good organic growth, which is usually in the 4%-type range historically, has been maintained more or less since the merger. So that -- I don't know was that exactly your question, but I just wanted to provide more color on commercial revenue. And I think there's one more question, maybe the last question?"

Yet, I anticipate this is going to grow, though. We're not going to disclose exactly how much of our new business is fixed price every time. Now we have previously said that we are applying so far next gen to about 20% of the -- of what we look at. And of that, a portion of this is fixed price, okay. Maybe call it 1/3, okay, to give you a rough estimate. 
So of the new stuff, about 20% of pipeline, and when we look at -- that doesn't mean that we win every time, but that's what our -- over time, as I said, we hope to apply next gen to 50% to 60% of the pipe, and I'm assuming that, again, about 1/3 of that would be fixed price. There are cases where we don't want it to be fixed price. There are cases, as I said before, where we are hybrid, that is we sell a technology capability and upfront work separately, and that's a fixed price. And then we sell other services, data or otherwise, that are not fixed price. Again, we are experimenting with these new models, but we're seeing a lot of traction and a lot of interest. It often is a clincher of the deal at the end, right, because we're willing to take more risk."

You'll remember we have the salesforce.com re-platforming. So on the commercial side, we also have investments. And then we have also sales force recruitment to try to accelerate our business development activities on R&D. And the combination of all of that are the investments that we've made.
We're also carrying additional costs as a result of the merger. We've been carrying additional costs throughout the year, but these are costs that we cannot adjust out. These are -- in cases where we have to maintain redundant people or redundant facilities for a while, redundant IT systems and software licenses, all of that needs to be maintained as we transition to one or the other or  a new one. 
And so that creates a bucket of costs, and we cannot adjust that out because it's not a onetime kind of a merger-specific outside cost. It's just redundant, parallel costs. When we take it out, then it goes away, and it's being taken out over time. So these are all the headwinds. But despite all of that, as I pointed out before, year-to-date, we have margin expansion. You said -- as I said before, I'd like to say we are in the business of growing revenue and expanding margins, not one or the other. There might be some quarters where we don't have margin expansion, and my goal is certainly to have margin expansion, and I anticipate that 2018 will not be an exception to that despite all the investments that I just mentioned."
