We had an outstanding fourth quarter, capping off a very successful year in 2016. And for the year, our revenues increased 4% to $29.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10%",1971,"Thanks, Jessica, and thanks, everybody, for listening in this morning. 
We had an outstanding fourth quarter, capping off a very successful year in 2016. And for the year, our revenues increased 4% to $29.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10% to $7.6 billion with record results at each of our divisions. 
Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $5.86 per share. That's our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Now looking at the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 11% to $7.9 billion with increases at each of our divisions and adjusted operating income increased 25% to $1.8 billion. 
We generated a record $4.4 billion in free cash flow, and we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends over the course of the year. 
What's driving these results is the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's enabled us to provide superior long-term returns to our shareholders. 
Our strategy starts, as you all know, with investing in and creating the world's most compelling video content. We then ensure that it can be accessed and enjoyed by consumers wherever, whenever and on whatever device they want all around the world. And increasingly, that means working with both our distribution partners and on our own to ensure great experiences that connect consumers with our content and our brands. You can see the success of this strategy across each of our businesses last year. Let me share a few highlights. We'll start at the networks. 
In 2016, Turner made terrific progress on its goal of transforming its leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids' brands, investing in each of its businesses to make them ever more powerful and engaging for audiences. 
For the year, among adults 18 to 49 in prime time, we held 3 of the top 5 slots among ad-supported cable networks with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim. And in fact, TBS was the #1 entertainment network in prime for the fourth consecutive year, showcasing a great mix of fresh originals, sports and acquired content. 
Early last year, we began introducing a lineup of bold, new comedies that includes Angie Tribeca, The Detour and Wrecked. We've also had a breakout success in Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, which, during the summer, began outpacing The Daily Show and continued to do so in the fourth quarter. We also added 2 new comedies in People of Earth and Search Party, which debuted to strong critical reviews. All of the freshman shows have been renewed. And if you haven't seen them, we've made the entire seasons available on demand to binge view as are all the latest Turner original series, all on demand. 
Now if 2016 was TBS's year, we expect 2017 to belong to TNT. It's just underway in its refresh process, but it's already off to an encouraging start with newcomers Animal Kingdom produced by Warner Bros. and Good Behavior, both of which have also been renewed. 
And this year, we're rolling out a slate that includes exciting, new series like The Alienist, Will and Claus, adding compelling franchise movies, which include those from the DC Universe and the entire Star Wars library and recent Marvel movies and you can see why we're very confident in TNT's future as the home for great drama. 
Another part of Turner's success, a critical part and, well, basically a vital part, is our success in sports. And our rights to the NCAA tournament, the NBA and Major League Baseball. Last year, we had the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game for the first time ever, and we generated record revenues across our March Madness properties. This is such a strong relationship for us that we, along with CBS, renewed our deal with the NCAA through 2032. Our NBA package also continues to deliver tremendous results, and that was highlighted by Game 7 of last year's -- last season's Western Conference Finals. It became the most watched telecast ever in the history of TNT. We also launched our ELEAGUE gaming network in partnership with WME | IMG, and that's off to a promising start and it's already bringing new, younger viewers to TBS. Speaking of younger viewers, I have to mention Adult Swim again and its leading position with millennial audiences. In 2016, it was the #1 network among 18- to 34-year-olds for the 12th year in a row. 
Now what a year for CNN, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time. Let's just say that again, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 at prime time and the #1 digital news destination in 2016. CNN capped off its most watched year ever with a record-setting election night, ranked #1 in prime that evening across all cable and broadcast networks. 
With the historic U.S. Presidential election behind us and the new administration in place, we have every confidence that CNN will continue to reinforce its reputation as not only the source the world turns to for trusted news coverage but also as the destination for compelling original series and documentaries. 
And international, Turner launched a dozen new networks while holding its position as the #1 portfolio of pay TV networks across Latin America. 
Whether it's content, advertising or distribution, Turner is making important progress evolving its business in ways that recognize changing media habits and that put the consumer first. 
Last year, Turner continued to build on the successful 2015 launches of short-form news site, Great Big Story, and digital studio, Super Deluxe. And in November, Turner Classic Movies launched FilmStruck, a new over-the-top service for lovers of art house movies. 
And in distribution, Turner has demonstrated the value of its portfolio by being an anchor tenant on each of the new virtual MVPD services that have launched as well as on Hulu's upcoming new service. 
Now let's move to the gold standard in premium video, Home Box Office. HBO had another great year while making investments for an even stronger original programming lineup. 
Once again, 2016 brought more Primetime Emmy Awards to HBO than any other network, and that's for the 15th straight year. Game of Thrones' sixth season hit record viewership of 26 million people per episode. That's about a 50 rating on HBO, actually more than that on the subbase. And we also had the biggest launch of a new series in HBO history with Westworld. It's produced by Warner Bros. and it surpassed even the Game of Thrones' first season. I want to pause on that and say that even with the explosion of new outlets and choices in this golden age of video, HBO remains singular in its ability to attract artists who push the boundaries of what's creatively possible. And that's the case whether it's on an epic scale with a show like Westworld or on a human scale with a show like Girls, which begins its sixth and final season this weekend. You'll also see that in our upcoming limited series, Big Little Lies, with a stellar cast including Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, which follows last year's acclaimed series, The Night Of. 
In 2016 at HBO, we also premiered the well-received freshman seasons of Insecure, Divorce, Vice Principals and High Maintenance. And those ran alongside returning comedy powerhouses Veep, Silicon Valley and Ballers. 
Of course, HBO offers much more than its original programming. It's got the best lineup of recent Hollywood films -- hit films available anywhere. And they account for a significant amount of HBO's viewership. 
When you add in great documentaries, sports and late-night powerhouses like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver or Real Time with Bill Maher, both of which experienced record viewership last year, as well as our new nightly series, VICE News Tonight, you can see why HBO stands out from the pack and why we're very confident about the growth opportunities ahead. 
HBO has also been blazing the trail and connecting with consumers through its streaming product, which added distribution on Microsoft's Xbox, on Samsung smart TVs, Sony's PlayStation and Amazon Prime Channels in 2016. 
In total, HBO recently surpassed 2 million domestic over-the-top subscribers. So we're really pleased with the progress. 
And HBO is just as focused on reaching consumers abroad with over-the-top launches in Spain, Brazil and Argentina in 2016. 
Finally, let's turn to Warner Bros., the global entertainment leader. Warner has had another record year with strong results in television and film and a growing consumer products business that ties into its focus on franchise properties. 
In movies, we reached nearly $5 billion in global box office. That's the second best year in our history. And it was driven across a range of hits led by our franchise releases: Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. But the depth and diversity of our slate was also on display with strong performances from movies like Central Intelligence, Lights Out, The Conjuring 2 and Sully.  We are just as excited about 2017 with a lineup that starts with the LEGO Batman Movie, which opens, by the way, this weekend, and we also have the highly anticipated next installments in our DC slate with Wonder Woman in June and Justice League in November. 
In television at Warner's, we were the #1 supplier to broadcast networks again. This is now for the eighth year in a row with at least 4 shows on each network this season. And that includes the #1 overall series on television, The Big Bang Theory, and the #1 non-scripted series on television, The Voice, as well as newcomers like Lethal Weapon and Riverdale. 
We've mentioned before that our DC franchise has been one of our most important priorities at Warner's, and you can see the results not just at the box office but also in the 10 DC-based shows we have on TV; in the $4.5 billion consumers spent on DC merchandise last year, contributing to our record performance in consumer products; and finally in our hit video game franchises, including Injustice 2, which will release this coming May. 
Similar to Turner and HBO, Warner Bros. also continues to make strides in developing direct-to-consumer capabilities to serve its fans in today's evolving environment. We created the Warner Bros. Digital Networks division and we closed deals to buy Machinima, giving us a platform to connect to coveted and hard-to-reach young gamers, and DramaFever, which gives us the capability to launch and operate new over-the-top broadband VOD services. 
Across our company, we had a very active and successful year and we’re inspired by the future of media that we're helping to shape. As we've said many times before, connecting more directly with consumers as our businesses evolve, both within and outside the existing ecosystem, is one of our most important strategic priorities, and we're making a lot of progress. 
We believe our deal to be acquired by AT&T, which we announced on October 22, will further enhance our ability to innovate and thrive. A special meeting of shareholders to vote on the transaction will be held a week from today. The regulatory review process is underway, and we remain confident that the deal will be approved later this year. Once that happens, we're very excited about the potential of combining AT&T's great strength in mobile and video distribution and its fantastic customer relationships with the world's greatest storytelling and the value we can create together by accelerating the evolution of our company and our industries for the benefit of consumers. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to lead the industry both creatively and financially not just for 2017 but for many years to come. 
Thanks again for listening. And with that, let me turn it over to Howard."

Starting with consolidated results. We finished 2016 with a great fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11%, adjusted operating income was up a very strong 25% with growth across all divisions and adjusted EPS grew 18%. 
We also had strong results for the full year with revenue up 4%, adjusted operating income up 10% and each of our divisions posted record profits, leading to our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Margins expanded over 100 basis points for the year even as we increased our investment in content and marketing across the company to over $15 billion. And we continue to remain focused on tightly managing overhead costs and operating efficiently to help fund these investments. 
Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $5.86 for the year, which included a $0.29 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change that we recognized in the third quarter. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a robust 17% to $5.57, led by our strong operating performance as well as a lower share count. 
In 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion of our stock prior to discontinuing share repurchases in October as a result of the pending merger with AT&T. And combined with our dividend, we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders during the year. 
So we delivered strong financial results in 2016 while continuing to make investments across our businesses to sustain attractive growth over the long term. And we expect to carry that momentum into 2017. 
Looking ahead, in order to better reflect our operating performance and given the volatility in certain below-the-line items that impact our adjusted EPS, we are providing 2017 guidance for adjusted operating income, which we expect will grow in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. I'll provide more context on the key drivers across our businesses throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segments. I'll start at Turner, where we closed out a record year with another quarter of strong profit growth as we continue to benefit from our domestic affiliate renewals. 
Subscription revenues increased 14% in the fourth quarter and were up 12% for the year, including a 150 basis point FX headwind. Domestic Subscription revenues grew 15% in the quarter, and we finished 2016 up over 14%, on the higher end of what we expected coming into the year. So we're really pleased with the outcome of our affiliate renewals, and we remain confident in our outlook for solid, double-digit domestic Subscription revenue growth in 2017. 
International Subscription revenue was up in the high single digits in the quarter, and that included a 300 basis points drag from FX. 
Advertising revenue was down 2% in the fourth quarter. That was a bit below our expectations because of a slowdown in certain international regions. As a result, international Advertising declined mid-single digits, excluding about a 350 basis point drag from FX. However, we still believe secular trends internationally remain strong. 
Domestically, we faced a 300 basis point headwind from the comparison to last year's record Major League Baseball postseason performance. Even so, Advertising was flat in the quarter. That capped off a strong year for domestic Advertising, which increased mid-single digits. The growth was led by the record performance at our news business as it benefited from the presidential election coverage, as well as healthy demand for our premium sports properties. 
Looking at the first quarter, we expect total Advertising revenue to be flat to up low single digits. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing up double digits versus the upfront at our domestic entertainment networks, and we expect our sports and news businesses to be the key drivers and international trends to improve. 
Moving on. Turner's strong revenue trends resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. And we achieved that while continuing to make significant investments at programming, marketing and new digital initiatives. 
Programming expenses were flat in the fourth quarter and up low single digits, excluding programming charges from both periods. For the full year, programming was up 5% primarily related to higher sports costs and CNN's election coverage. 
Marketing costs increased around 20% both for the quarter and the year as we invested in the rebrands at TNT and TBS, including support for our new original series. 
Overall, Turner delivered great financial results in 2016 and has a lot of operating momentum. And with the strength of our brands and the investments we're making across the business, we believe we're very well positioned to continue delivering attractive growth for the long term. 
Turning now to HBO, where our investments in high-quality programming contributed to double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter and have positioned HBO to capitalize on the big global opportunity for subscription services. 
Domestic Subscription revenue was up in the mid-single digits for the quarter and the year.  Similar to recent quarters, we continue to see subscriber headwinds at our traditional affiliates, especially those involved in M&A integration. As a result, despite very strong growth in digital subscribers, total domestic subs across HBO and Cinemax were essentially flat for the year. 
Looking forward, we believe HBO has a big untapped subscriber opportunity in the U.S., and capitalizing on that is our most important long-term growth driver. So on the deals we've recently signed, we're emphasizing subscriber growth. That means as our partners grow HBO subs, it will benefit our Subscription revenue growth. And while it takes time to implement new deals, we're very encouraged with the initial progress on the deals we've closed. However, finishing this affiliate cycle has taken longer than anticipated and we're still in the midst of renewing some deals. So we do not expect sequential improvement in Subscription revenue growth in the first quarter. But we do anticipate that sub-revenue trends will improve as the year progresses, especially in the second half of 2017, as we complete affiliate negotiations and continue to expand our digital distribution. We've seen a nice pickup in OTT sub growth recently, and our goal is to add more digital partners later this year. Along with a return to subscriber growth in our traditional business, that should contribute to a solid increase in total subs for the year. And taking all these factors into account, we anticipate high single-digit growth in Subscription revenue for the year. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues were up 7% for the quarter mainly due to higher home video revenue. For the year, content and other revenues grew 2%, primarily reflecting healthy growth in international licensing as demand for HBO's original content remains robust. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits for the year, excluding FX, and that's a result of strong trends in the Nordics and LatAm. 
Adjusted operating income was up 10% for the quarter and 3% for the year. 
Programming expenses declined 2% in the fourth quarter given the comparison to last year's programming charges. Excluding the charges from both periods and the benefit from reduced amortization this year, programming costs were up double digits in the quarter and the year. That's a result of our continued investments in original programming, including new series like Westworld, Divorce, The Night Of and Insecure. 
So we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016, and we have a lot of momentum on the content side. With global demand for HBO's distinctive premium content only growing and Subscription revenue trends improving, we're confident HBO can deliver healthy growth for years to come. 
Now looking at Warner Bros., where our theatrical business continues to perform exceptionally well, thanks to our franchise-led film slate. And that resulted in significant profit growth, including record adjusted operating income for both the quarter and the year. 
Coming into the year, we plan for theatrical to be the primary driver at Warner's, and that's exactly what played out. Our 2 DC movies and first Fantastic Beasts installment led a very strong, diverse slate that drove high single-digit growth in theatrical revenues in 2016. And we more than doubled theatrical profits, making this our most profitable film slate in close to a decade. 
The success of the film slate is also contributing to healthy growth in our consumer products business, where revenue increased close to 40% last year. So we're already benefiting from the new strategy we put in place and think we have a big opportunity to keep growing our consumer products business over the next few years. 
In TV, we had difficult comparisons on the licensing side, but total revenues were up in the quarter and for the year mainly due to double-digit growth in initial telecast revenue. That's a result of increased production, reflecting Warner's continued expansion at the cable, premium and SVOD production. Additionally, we continued to benefit from strong international licensing demand for Warner's TV content. 
As we discussed, we also had difficult comparisons in games after record results in 2015 and no franchise console releases last year. So as expected, revenues declined significantly. Looking to 2017, we have a strong lineup anchored by 2 franchise console releases and several mobile games. So we're set up for a great year in games. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down double digits for the year primarily due to fewer releases and a softer home video release schedule. But revenue did grow starting in the second half of 2016 as our franchise titles started to move into the home entertainment window. We also remain encouraged by EST, which was up double digits for the year. And digital now represents about half of our home entertainment profits. So we're encouraged as we head into 2017 when we expect to grow both home entertainment revenue and profits. 
Overall, Warner Bros. had another terrific year, thanks to great execution of it strategy focused on monetizing key global franchises across all its businesses. And with a tremendous multiyear film slate, healthy trends in the TV business and upcoming franchise games releases, Warner is positioned to deliver strong growth in its adjusted operating income in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning to the next slide. We also had a great year for free cash flow, which increased 22% to a record $4.4 billion. So we converted 94% of our earnings into cash, continuing our strong track record of conversion. We benefited from strong growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes related to the tax accounting change I mentioned earlier. 
Looking to 2017, while we certainly have difficult comparisons, especially on cash taxes, we expect strong conversion and another year of healthy free cash flow. 
Moving on to our balance sheet. We ended 2016 with $22.8 billion of net debt. That's up from 2015 mainly due to our share repurchases and dividends. It also reflects about $1 billion in debt redemption premiums and costs associated with our tender offers in December. We spent about $800 million on M&A for the year largely related to the investment at Hulu we made in August. So we ended the year right around our leverage target of 2.75x. And with share repurchases discontinued, we continue to expect our net leverage ratio to decline as we progress through 2017. 
So on the whole, we had a great year in 2016, and we believe we're set up for a strong 2017. And I'll touch on some of the key items for the year ahead. 
Starting at Turner. We anticipate solid double-digit domestic Subscription revenue growth as we continue to benefit from our affiliate renewals. At the same time, as we planned for, we expect programming costs to grow in the double digits primarily due to the new NBA deal, which will account for approximately $400 million of incremental costs in the first half of 2017. And similar to the past few years, Turner remains focused on constraining overhead costs to help fund these investments in great content and new growth opportunities. So that should add up to another year of healthy revenue trends and solid profit growth at Turner. 
At HBO, as I mentioned, we expect Subscription revenue growth to be in the high single digits in 2017. That growth should step up through the year as we complete additional affiliate deals, continue to make progress implementing our new deals and expand digital distribution. The improvement in Subscription revenue trends should translate to attractive adjusted operating income growth in 2017. 
At Warner's, we're also poised for healthy growth in adjusted operating income led by our theatrical and video game businesses. Our franchise slate continues in 2017 with 2 more DC films as well as the LEGO Batman Movie. And we expect other businesses like home entertainment, consumer products and TV licensing will benefit from a strong film slate and recent theatrical success. 
I already mentioned our strong game slate this year. We also continued to see healthy demand in our TV business and expect another year of solid results as we further expand production. 
So we're positioned to deliver attractive financial results at all of our businesses. And that's reflected in our expectation for 2017 adjusted operating income growth to be in the high single digits. 
Given the NBA deal costs in the first half, the timing of improvement in HBO's sub-revenue trends and the cadence of the film and game slate at Warner Bros., at this point we anticipate that growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Overall, we're very pleased about how we're executing across the company and the progress we're making on key initiatives. And we expect to deliver healthy growth in 2017 even as we continue to make important investments in high-quality video content and new business models that should position us for sustained attractive growth trends well into the future. 
With that, let me turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

You have new entrants coming in all the time, Amazon, Hulu, et cetera. Given the range of all of these things, I think it's safe to say that what they're going to help do is invigorate consumer interest everywhere in watching networks on demand, watching them on the go in mobile devices and a whole range of offerings, which is what, I think, we'd all like to see. And what that's doing is fueling production -- increases in production spending across the network industry. So terrific. And of course, Warner's, as the biggest supplier to all networks, is part of that. I think it's too early to say, if you're asking for timing, what the relative size of the virtual MVPD sub growth is, let's say, in '17 versus what the continued slope of the at-home ecosystem sub count turns out to be.

So that's important when you think about the guidance we've given for Subscription revenues. But certainly, there's an opportunity for that between DirecTV, now Sling and Sony. Each of them have really started to gain traction very recently, proving that there is consumer demand for smaller video packages with top networks at lower prices. I think if you aggregate the number of subscribers for the 3, we're approaching 2 million now in the United States. And if new OTT offerings can combine attractive pricing and packaging with great on-demand comment -- content, excuse me, better interfaces and easier navigation, we think that we can attract new subs into the ecosystem. And importantly, we think a lot of these subs are not cannibalizing existing subscribers.

Thank you for your question. The deals that we completed already, I think, are very indicative of why we're so encouraged and why we're looking optimistically and confidently to sub revenue acceleration in the second half of the year. Look, the blended penetration on the 2 deals that we completed is less than 50% of what the acquired company's penetration is. And we built incentives into those deals to drive that blended penetration up not only to where the acquired companies are, which are in the high 30s, low-40s, but beyond that. So as we look forward with those partners, the nature of the packaging, the nature of the marketing makes us very comfortable that we're going to see that sub acceleration, number one. Number two, in the deals -- couple deals that we have remaining, I think they, too, are going to see the opportunity before them to grow penetration beyond where they are now. And in some of our higher-performing affiliates, I think there's an opportunity to go even further. So we like the deals that we've completed. We'll finish the rest of our deals in the coming months. And I would say about our OTT business, it's very, very dynamic. It's actually 3x of the number that we reported at the end of '15. And I think that shows not only the robust demand for HBO but the opportunity we have out there not only in the traditional ecosystem but outside of it. So we're looking very confidently to this year. These deals take time. The integration takes time. In one of our major deals, they're just beginning to put us in to the packaging that we've codified into the deal at the end of this month. And so that's really what the lag is, but it will kick in, in the second half of the year."

So we continue to feel really good about our premium sports properties. But just to amplify one more thing, you can't forget about the importance of matchups and competitive games. And when we look at the season, whether it's Cleveland versus Golden State or Oklahoma versus the Clippers or the Lakers versus Portland, those games all performed extremely well with us growing year-over-year.

We think we're going to continue that in '17, and we look at what we have in '18 and '19, and we feel very good about it. We also feel that we could still grow in television. And while the growth won't occur primarily in broadcast, where we've been #1 for a long time, we do feel that there are opportunities in premium, in pay and in cable. And I feel really good about the fact that we did Westworld with HBO and Richard this year and Animal Kingdom with John. And we had some really big hits for Netflix with Fuller House and Gilmore Girls as well. So that is a business that we think that we can grow and continue to grow. Games, again, a business, while it's lumpy, we feel like we can create more sustainable pipeline as we get more to scale there. On the console side, we have 2 big console games this year, and it's our goal to be able to put out a more consistent path with those games but also grow mobile, which doesn't have that lumpiness. So if you look at those 3 big drivers in the content side, that creates opportunities for consumer products. And geography-wise, we think that there's a big opportunity in China. We continue to develop a SVOD service that's doing very well with our partner, Tencent, and we also believe that our partnership to create local language content as well as export content into China is going to create a big growth opportunity for the company in the coming years. So we think that we feel good about '17 and, more importantly, we feel about the growth trajectory going forward."

So we've been aggressively working with exhibitors to talk about models that will grow the market versus cannibalize the market, and we think that we're making a lot of progress on that end. Because ultimately, it's not really about the business model per se, but it's really about giving consumers what they want because if we don't give it to them, they're going to go to the pirated version.

As Jeff said, it's the most watched year ever in the history of CNN. It's closer to FOX News than it's been in 8 years and had the greatest advantage over MSNBC since 2009. And the strategy this year, we fully expect that linear ratings for the entire year are not going to be able to stay at last year's record levels, so we could have some difficult advertising comps. But CNN still has great momentum, thanks to its strategy, which is multipronged. It's going in on -- it's going all in on covering big stories. It's adding originals. There'll be more hours of originals this year than in the past, which brings younger viewers to the network and usually garners big audiences. And it's investing in digital, which we expect is going to keep growing. It's been growing in ad revenue double digits. Digital now represents 25% of all of CNN's overall ad revenue. And last year, it had its best year ever, overtaking Yahoo! News. So I think CNN is positioned for another record year of profit growth in 2017. We're highly confident that we're going to be able to achieve that, and that's going to be led by a healthy increase in affiliate revenues and absolutely lower election-related expenses."

And then also, I just wanted to ask if you could comment just on the behavior that you've seen in terms of churn.

On churn, particularly over the last few months, we've seen the lowest churn in -- really since the beginning of introducing HBO NOW and our OTT product. That, I think, is a result of 2 things. Number one, as our subscriber base ages, there's, of course, less churn. Number two, I think it speaks to the quality of the content and the range of the content. I think it's important to remember when you look at the usage on digital platforms and on demand you see the usage going across a wide range of categories. It's not just Westworld and Game of Thrones and The Night Of, it's comedies, it's late night, it's documentaries, it's sports programming. It's important to punctuate that the usage of HBO programming is across a wide range of genres, and we're in the business, of course, of curating great content. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen on churn. Your question about investment, yes, we are going to take those margins and we are going to invest a lot of it in what we do for a living, which is trying to make the best content and curate the best content across a lot of different genres of our programming.

I was curious, do you look at the TV network business as, ultimately, continuing to be a regional business or developing into a global network business? And the reason I ask is there's an argument that TV networks are going global and direct-to-consumer and that those economics will be superior and more sustainable. And Netflix and Amazon are there. FOX is headed there quickly. You've got CNN globally, but many of your other networks are regional. So I was curious, how do you see the marketplace evolving and what it might mean, if anything, for Time Warner in that regard?"

And as you see the development of that -- I know you were referencing some brands that started in the tech world, -- we -- if you think of something like either CNN or HBO and then you can expand that out to other networks. Things like CNN and HBO are global brands. They've got global distribution now. What we've been doing over the years is we've essentially tried to capitalize on these SVOD and linear network opportunities going global in terms of territory and going digital in terms of VOD across platforms. So not just TV but mobile devices. You're -- the bulk of people in India or Brazil are watching differently on different device setups than, say, those in Western Europe or the United States. So we've been pursuing essentially that strategy of distribution for our networks that optimizes the reach of whatever distribution is in place. If you look at -- so there's a combination. HBO is an easy way to describe it because it started VOD and it started more global distribution, as did CNN. So we've got places where HBO is over-the-top direct as a network. We just launched a few in Western Europe, Spain. We are launching in Latin America. We have things in Eastern Europe like that. We also have HBO in Western Europe licensed into other SVOD like Sky and other sorts of platforms if they have superior reach and can therefore get our programming, which is usually branded as HBO neighborhood programming. And it then creates a choice as time goes on of whether we decide to move to direct network full schedule or whether we continue to license to optimize the value of the network name and the programming associated with it. You've got examples of Turner doing that at FilmStruck. You've got examples of Warner's doing it in China with -- what are we, the second largest SVOD service in China?"

Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $5.86 per share. That's our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Now looking at the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 11% to $7.9 billion with increases in each of our divisions and adjusted operating income increased 25% to $1.8 billion. 
We generated a record $4.4 billion in free cash flow, and we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends over the course of the year. 
What's driving these results is the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's enabled us to provide superior long-term returns to our shareholders. 
Our strategy starts, as you'll know, with investing in creating the world's most compelling video content. We then ensure that it can be accessed and enjoyed by consumers wherever, whenever and on whatever device they want it all around the world. And increasingly, that means working with both our distribution partners and on our own to ensure great experiences that connect consumers with our content and our brands. You can see the success of this strategy across each of our businesses last year. 
Let me share a few highlights to start off on [ph] that one. In 2016, Turner made terrific progress on its goal of transforming its leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids brands, investing in each of its businesses to make them ever more powerful and engaging for audiences. 
For the year, among adults 18 to 49 in prime time, we held 3 of the top 5 slots among ad-supported cable networks with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim. And in fact, TBS was the #1 entertainment network in prime for the fourth consecutive year, showcasing a great mix of fresh originals, sports and acquired content. 
Early last year, we began introducing a lineup of bold, new comedies that includes Angie Tribeca, The Detour and Wrecked. We've also had a breakout success in Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, which, during the summer, began outpacing The Daily Show and continued to do so in the fourth quarter. We also added 2 new comedies in People of Earth and Search Party, which debuted to strong critical reviews. All of the freshman shows have been renewed. And if you haven't seen them, we've made the entire seasons available on demand to binge view, as all the latest Turner original series, all on demand. 
Now if 2016 was TBS's year, we expect 2017 to belong to TNT. It's just on the [ph] way in its refresh process, but it's already off to an encouraging start with newcomers Animal Kingdom produced by Warner Bros. and Good Behavior, both of which have also been renewed. 
And this year, we're rolling out a slate that includes exciting, new series like The Alienist, Real and Klos, adding compelling franchise movies, which include those from the DC Universe and the entire Star Wars library and recent Marvel movies and you can see why we're very confident in TNT's future as the home for great [indiscernible]. 
Another part of Turner's success, a critical part and, well, basically a vital part, is our success in sports. And our rights to the NCAA tournament, the NBA and Major League Baseball. Last year, we had the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game for the first time ever, and we generated record revenues across our March Madness properties. This is such a strong relationship for us that we, along with CBS, renewed our deal with the NCAA through 2032. Our NBA package also continues to deliver tremendous results, and that was highlighted by Game 7 of last year's -- last season's Western Conference Finals, which became the most watched telecast ever in the history of TNT. We also launched our ELEAGUE gaming network in partnership with WME | IMG, and that's off to a promising start and it's already bringing new, younger viewers to TBS. 
Speaking of younger viewers, I have to mention Adult Swim again and its leading position with millennial audiences. In 2016, it was the #1 network among 18- to 34-year-olds for the 12th year in a row. 
Now what a year for CNN, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time. Let's just say that again, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 at prime time and the #1 digital news destination in 2016. CNN capped off its most watched year ever with a record-setting election night to rank #1 in prime at evening across all cable and broadcast networks. 
With the historic U.S. Presidential election behind us and the new administration in place, we have every confidence that CNN will continue to reinforce its reputation as not only the source of the world [indiscernible] for trusted news coverage but also as the destination for compelling original series and documentaries. 
And international, Turner launched a dozen new networks while holding its position as the #1 portfolio of pay TV networks across Latin America. 
Whether it's content, advertising or distribution, Turner is making important progress evolving its business in ways that recognize changing media habits and [indiscernible] to consumer first. 
Last year, Turner continued to build on the successful 2015 launches of short-form news site, Great Big Story, and digital studio, Super Deluxe. And in November, Turner Classic Movies launched FilmStruck, a new over-the-top service for lovers of art house movies. 
And in distribution, Turner has demonstrated the value of its portfolio by being an anchor tenant on each of the new virtual MVPD services that have launched as well as on Hulu's upcoming new service. 
Now let's move to the gold standard in premium video, Home Box Office. HBO had another great year while making investments for an even stronger original programming lineup. 
Once again, 2016 brought more Primetime Emmy Awards to HBO than any other network, and that's for the 15th straight year. Game of Thrones' sixth season hit record viewership of 26 million people per episode. That's about a 50 rating on HBO, actually more than that on the subbase. And we also had the biggest launch of a new series in HBO history with Westworld. It's produced by Warner Bros. and it's surpassed even the Game of Thrones' first season. I want to pause on that and say that even with the explosion of new outlets and choices in this golden age of video, HBO remains singular in its ability to attract [indiscernible]  who push the boundaries of what's creatively possible. And that's the case whether it's on an epic scale of a show like Westworld or on a human scale with a show like Girls, which begins its sixth and final season this weekend. You'll also see that in our upcoming limited series, Big Little Lies, with a stellar cast including Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, which follows last year's acclaimed series, The Night Of. 
In 2016 at HBO, we also premiered the well-received fresh from seasons of Insecure, Divorce, Vice Principals and High Maintenance. And those ran alongside returning comedy powerhouses Veep, Silicon Valley and Ballers. 
Of course, HBO offers much more than its original programming. It's got the best lineup of recent Hollywood films, hit bounds available anywhere. And they account for a significant amount of HBO's viewership. 
When you add in great documentaries, sports and late-night powerhouses like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver or Real Time with Bill Maher, both of which experienced record viewership last year, as well as our new nightly series, VICE News Tonight, you can see why HBO stands out from the pack and why we're very confident about the growth opportunities ahead. 
HBO has also been blazing the trail and connecting with consumers through its streaming product, which added distribution on Microsoft's Xbox, on Samsung's smart TVs, Sony's PlayStation and Amazon Prime Channels in 2016. 
In total, HBO recently surpassed 2 million domestic over-the-top subscribers. So we're really pleased with the progress. 
And HBO is just as focused on reaching consumers abroad with over-the-top launches in Spain, Brazil and Argentina in 2016. 
Finally, let's turn to Warner Bros., the global entertainment leader. Warner has had another record year with strong results in television and film and a growing consumer products business that ties into its focus on franchise properties. 
In movies, we reached nearly $5 billion in global box office. That's the second best year in our history. And it was driven across a range of hits led by our franchise releases: Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. But the depth and diversity of our slate was also on display with strong performances from movies like Central Intelligence, Lights Out, The Conjuring 2 and Sully.  We are just as excited about 2017 with a lineup that starts with the LEGO Batman Movie, which opened, by the way, this weekend, and we also have the highly anticipated next installments in our DC slate with Wonder Woman in June and Justice League in November. 
In television at Warner's, we were the #1 supplier to broadcast networks again. This is now for the eighth year in a row with at least 4 shows on each network this season. And that includes the #1 overall series on television, The Big Bang Theory, and the #1 non-scripted series on television, The Voice, as well as newcomers like Lethal Weapon and Riverdale. 
We've mentioned before that our DC franchise has been one of our most important priorities at Warner's, and you can see the results not just at the box office but also in the 10 DC-based shows we have on TV; in the 4.5 billion consumer spend on DC merchandise last year, contributing to our record performance in consumer products; and finally in our hit video game franchises, including Injustice 2, which were released this coming May. 
Similar to Turner and HBO, Warner Bros. also continues to make strides in developing direct-to-consumer capabilities to serve its fans in today's evolving environment. We created the Warner Bros. digital network division, and we closed deals to buy [indiscernible], giving us a platform to connect to coveted and hard to reach young gamers and DramaFever, which gives us the capability to launch and operate new over-the-top broadband VOD services. 
Across our company, we had a very active and successful year and we're  inspired by the future of media that we're to shape. As we've said many times before, connecting more directly with consumers as our businesses evolve, both within and outside the existing ecosystem is one of our most important strategic priorities, and we're making a lot of progress. 
We believe our deal to be acquired by AT&T, which we announced on October 22, will further enhance our ability to innovate and thrive. The special meeting of shareholders to vote on the transaction will be held a week from today. The regulatory review process is underway, and we remain confident that the deal will be approved later this year. Once that happens, we're very excited about the potential of combining AT&T's great strength in mobile and video distribution, and its fantastic customer relationships with the world's greatest storytelling. And the value we can create together by accelerating the evolution of our company and our industries for the benefit of consumers. 
In the meantime, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to lead the industry both creatively and financially, not just for 2017, but for many years to come. 
Thanks, again, for listening. And with that, let me turn it over to Howard."

We also had strong results for the full year, with revenue up 4%, adjusted operating income up 10% at each of our division posted record profits, leading to our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Margins expanded over 100 basis points for the year even as we increased our investment in content and marketing across the company to over $15 billion, and we continue to remain focused on tightening and managing overhead cost and operating efficiently to help fund these investments. 
Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $5.86 for the year, which included a $0.29 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change that we recognized in the third quarter. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a robust 17% to $5.57 led by our strong operating performance as well as a lower share count. 
In 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion of our stock prior to discontinuing share repurchases in October as a result of the pending merger with AT&T. And combined with our dividend, we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders during the year. So we delivered strong financial results in 2016 while continuing to make investments across our businesses to sustain attractive growth over the long term. And we expect to carry that momentum into 2017. 
Looking ahead, in order to better reflect our operating performance and given the volatility in certain below-the-line items that impact our adjusted EPS, we are providing 2017 guidance for adjusted operating income, which we expect will grow in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. I'll provide more context on the key drivers across our businesses throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segments. I'll start at Turner, where we closed out a record year with another quarter of strong profit growth as we continue to benefit from our domestic affiliate renewals. 
Subscription revenues increased 14% in the fourth quarter and was up 12% to the year, including 150 basis point FX headwind. Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% in the quarter, and we finished 2016 up over 14%, on the higher end of what we expected coming into the year. So we're really pleased with the upcome of our affiliate renewals, and we remain confident in our outlook for solid, double-digit domestic subscription revenue growth in 2017. 
International subscription revenue was up in the high single digits in the quarter, and that included a 300 basis points drag from FX. Advertising revenue was down 2% in the fourth quarter, that was a bit below our expectations because of a slowdown in certain international regions. As a result, international advertising declined mid-single digits excluding about a 350 basis points drag from FX. However, we still believe secular trends internationally remains strong. 
Domestically, we face a 300 basis point headwind from the comparison to last year's record Major League Baseball post season a performance. Even so, advertising was flat in the quarter. That capped off a strong year for domestic advertising, which increased mid-single digits. The growth was led by the record performance at our news business as it benefited from the presidential election coverage as well as healthy demand for our premium sports properties. 
Looking at the first quarter. We expect total advertising revenue to be flat to up low single digits. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing up double digits versus the upfront at our domestic entertainment networks, and we expect our sports and news businesses to be the key drivers and international trends to improve. 
Moving on. Turner's strong revenue trends resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. And we achieved that while continuing to make significant investments at programming, marketing and new digital initiatives. 
Programming expenses were flat in the fourth quarter and up low single digits excluding programming charges from both periods. For the full year, programming was up 5%, primarily related to higher sports costs and CNN's election coverage. 
Marketing cost increased around 20% both for the quarter and the year as we invested in the rebrands at TNT and TBS including support for our new original series. 
Overall, Turner delivered great financial results in 2016 and has a lot of operating momentum. And with the strength of our brands in the investments we're making across the business, we believe we are very well positioned to continue delivering attractive growth for the long term. 
Turning now to HBO, where our investments and high-quality programming contributed to double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter and have positioned HBO to capitalize on the big global opportunity for subscription services. Domestic subscription revenue was up in the mid-single digits for the quarter and the year. 
Similar to recent quarters, we continue to see subscriber headwinds at our traditional affiliates, especially those involved in M&A integration. As a result, despite very strong growth in digital subscribers, total domestic subs across HBO and Cinemax were essentially flat for the year. 
Looking forward, we believe HBO has a big untapped subscriber opportunity in the U.S. and capitalizing on that is our most important long-term growth driver. So the deals we recently signed, we're emphasizing subscriber growth. That means as our partners grow HBO subs, it will benefit our subscription revenue growth. And while it takes time to implement new deals, we're very encouraged with the initial progress on the deals we've closed. However, finishing this affiliate cycles has taken longer than anticipated, and we're still in the midst of removing some deals. So we do not expect sequential improvement in subscription revenue growth in the first quarter. But we do anticipate that sub-revenue trends will improve as the year progresses, especially in the second half of 2017 as we complete a period of negotiations and continue to expand our digital distribution. We've seen a nice pickup in OTT sub-growth recently, and our goal is to add more digital partners later this year. Along with the return to subscriber growth in our traditional business, that should contribute to a solid increase in total subs for the year. And taking all these factors into account, we anticipate high single digit growth in subscription revenue for the year. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues were up 7% for the quarter, mainly due to higher home video revenue. For the year, content and other revenues grew 2%, primarily reflecting healthy growth in international licensing as demand for HBO's original content remains robust. 
Across HBO's international networks including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits for the year, excluding FX, and that's a result of strong trends in the Nordics and LatAm. 
Adjusted operating income was up 10% for the quarter and 3% for the year. Programming expenses declined 2% in the fourth quarter given the comparison to last year's programming charges. 
Excluding the charges from both periods and the benefit from reduced amortization this year, programming costs were up double digits in the quarter and the year. That's a result of our continued investments in original programming, including new series like Westworld, Divorce, The Night Of and Insecure. 
So we continue to make progress in our strategic initiatives in 2016, and we have a lot of momentum on the content side. With global demand for HBO's distinctive premium content only growing and subscription revenue trends improving, we're confident HBO can deliver healthy growth for years to come. 
Now looking at Warner Bros., where our theatrical business continues to perform exceptionally well, thanks to our franchise-led film slate. And that resulted in significant profit growth including record adjusted operating income for both the quarter and the year. 
Coming into the year, we plan for theatrical to be the primary driver at Warner's, and that's exactly what played out. Our 2 DC movies and first Fantastic Beasts installment had a very strong diverse slate that drove high single digit growth in theatrical revenues in 2016, and we more than doubled theatrical profits, making this our most profitable film slate in close to a decade. 
The success of the film slate is also contributing to healthy growth in our consumer products business, where revenue increased close to 40% last year. we're already benefiting from the new strategy we put in place and think we have a big opportunity to keep growing our consumer products business over the next few years. 
In TV, we had difficult comparisons on the licensing side, but total revenues were up in the quarter and for the year, mainly due to double-digit growth and initial telecast revenue. That's a result of increased production reflecting Warner's continued expansion as the cable, premium and SVOD production. 
Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong international licensing demand for Warner's TV content. 
As we discussed, we also had difficult comparisons in gaming after record results in 2015 and no franchise console releases last year. So as expected, revenues declined significantly. 
Looking to 2017, we have a strong lineup anchored by 2 franchise consoler releases and several mobile games, so we are set up for a great year in games. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down double digits for the year primarily due to fewer releases and a softer home video release schedule. But revenue did grow starting in the second half of 2016 as our franchise title starts to move into the home entertainment window. 
We also remain encouraged by EST, which was up double digits for the year, and digital now represents about half of our home entertainment profit. 
So we're encouraged as we head into 2017, where we expect to grow both home entertainment revenue and profit. 
Overall, Warner Bros. had another terrific year, thanks to great execution of it strategy focused on monetizing key global franchises across all its businesses. And with a tremendous multi-year film slate, healthy trends -- trends in the TV business and upcoming franchise games releases, Warner is positioned to deliver strong growth in its operating income in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning to the next slide, we also had a great year for free cash flow, which increased 22% to a record $4.4 billion. So we converted 94% of our earnings into cash, continuing our strong track record of conversion. We benefited from a strong growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes related to the tax accounting change I mentioned earlier. 
Looking to 2017, while we certainly have difficult comparisons especially in our cash taxes, we expect strong conversion and another year of healthy free cash flow. 
Moving on to our balance sheet. We ended 2016 with $22.8 billion of net debt. That's up from 2015 mainly due to our share repurchases in dividends. It also reflects about $1 billion in debt reduction premiums and costs associated with our tender offers in December. We spent about $800 million on M&A for the year, largely related to the investment in Hulu we made in August. So we ended the year right around our leverage target of 2.75x, and with share repurchase discontinued, we continue to expect our net leverage ratio to decline as we progress through 2017. 
So on the whole, we had a great year in 2016, and we believe we're set up for strong 2017, and I'll touch on some of the key items for the year ahead. 
Starting at Turner. We anticipate solid double-digit domestic subscriber subscription revenue growth as we continue to benefit from our affiliate renewal. 
At the same time, as we plan for, we expect programming cost to grow in the double digits, primarily due to the new NBA deal, which will account for approximately $400 million of incremental cost in the first half of 2017. 
And similar to the past few years, Turner remains focused on constraining overhead costs to help fund these investments in great content and new growth opportunities. So that should add us to another year of healthy revenue trend and solid profit growth at Turner. 
At HBO, as I mentioned, we expect subscription revenue growth to be in the high single digits in 2017. That growth should step up through the year as we complete additional affiliate deals, continue to make progress, implementing our new deals and expand digital distribution. The improvement in subscription revenue trends should translate to attractive adjusted operating income growth in 2017. 
At Warner's, we're also poised for healthy growth in adjusted operating income, led by our theatrical and video game businesses. Our franchise slate continues in 2017, with 2 more DC films as well as the LEGO Batman movie, and we expect other businesses like home entertainment, consumer products and TV licensing will benefit from a strong film slate and recent theatrical success. 
I already mentioned our strong gaming slate this year, we also continued to see healthy demand in our TV business and expect another year of solid results as we further expand production. we're positioned to deliver attractive financial results at all of our businesses, and that's reflected in our expectation for 2017 adjusted operating income growth to be in the high single digits. 
Given the NBA deal cost in the first half, the timing of improvement in HBO sub-revenue trends and the cadence of the film and game slate at Warner Bros., at this point, we anticipate that growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Overall, we're very pleased about how we executing across the company and the progress we're making on key initiatives, and we expect to deliver healthy growth in 2017 even as we continue to make important investments in high-quality video content and a new business models that should position us for sustained attractive growth trends well into the future. 
With that, let me turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

Of course, there's a lot of them that have different price points as we all know.

So all that is very healthy development as we've been predicting yet new entrants coming in all the time, Amazon, Hulu, et cetera. Given the range of all of these things, I think it's safe to say that what's going to have to is invigorate consumer interest everywhere in watching networks on demand, watching them on the go, in mobile devices and the whole range of offerings, which is what we all like to see. And what that's doing is fueling production, increases in production spending across the network industry. So terrific and of course, Warner's has the biggest a supplier to all networks is part of that.

I think if you aggregate the number of subscribers for the 3, we're approaching 2 million now in the United States.

So that's a great opportunity for Turner to take share since we're in all the major virtual MVPDs that have launched to date, and we expect to be in those [indiscernible] with wide consumer appeal."

Thank you for your question. The deals that we've completed already, I think, are very indicative of why we're so encouraged and why we're looking optimistically and confidently to sub-revenue acceleration in the second half of the year. Look, the blended penetration on the 2 deals that we completed is less than 50% of what the acquired companies penetration is. And we've built incentives into those deals to drive that blended penetration up not only to where the acquired companies are, which are in the high 30s, low-40s, but beyond that. So as we look forward with those partners, the nature of the packaging, the nature of the marketing mix is very comfortable that we're going to see that sub-acceleration, number one. Number two, in a couple deals that we have remaining, I think, they, too, are going to see the opportunity before them integral penetration given where they are now in some of our higher-performing affiliates, I think there's an opportunity to go even further. So we like the deals that we've completed. We'll finish the rest of our deals in the coming months. And I would say about our OTT business, it's very, very dynamic. It's actually 3x of the number that we reported at the end of '15. And actually I think that shows that only the robust demand for HBO, but the opportunity we have out there, but also the traditional ecosystem, but outside of it. So we're looking very confident later this year. These deals takes time, and integration takes time and one of our major deals, they're just beginning to put us into the packaging that we've codified into the deal at the end of this month. And so that's really what the lag is, but it will kick in, in the second half of the year."

So we continue to feel really good about our premium sports properties. But just to amplify one more thing, you can't forget about the importance of match ups and competitive games. And when we look at the season, whether it's Cleveland versus Golden State or Oklahoma versus the Clippers or the Lakers versus Portland, those games outperformed extremely well with us growing year-over-year.

And while the growth will occur primarily in broadcast where we've been #1 for a long time, we do feel there are opportunities in premium, in pay, in cable. And I feel really good about the fact that we did Westworld with HBO later this year, and Animal Kingdom with John, and we had some really big hits for Netflix with Floor House and Gilmore Girls as well. So that is a business that we think we can grow and continue to grow. Games, again, a business while it's lumpy, we feel we can create more sustainable pipeline as we get more to scale there on the console side. We have 2 big console games this year in its our goal to be able to put out a more consistent path of those games but also grow mobile which doesn't have that lumpiness. So if you look at those 3 big drivers in the content side, that creates opportunities for consumer products. And geography-wise, we think there's a big opportunity in China, we continue to develop a SVOD service that's doing very well with our partner Tencent, and we also believe that our partnership to create local language content as well as export content into China is going to create the big growth opportunity for the company in the coming years.

So we've been aggressively working with exhibitors to talk about models that will grow the market versus cannibalize the market, and we think that we're making a lot of progress on that end because ultimately, it's not really about business model per se, but it's really about giving consumers what they want because if we don't give it to them, they're going to go to the pirated version. So it's very high on our list and I think that it has the potential to change some of the economics, some of the films dramas that we're having problems with right now on the theatrical side, which is really important for a company like ours that creates a really broad slate every year."

As Jeff said, it's the most-watched year ever in the history of CNN closer to FOX news and it has been 8 years and has the greatest advantage over MS NBC since 2009. And the strategy this year, we fully expect that linear ratings for the entire year are not going to be able to stay at last year's record levels, so we could have some difficult advertising comps. But CNN still has great momentum, thanks to its strategy, which is multipronged.   It's going in on -- it's going all the way in our covering big stories. It's adding originals. There'll be more hours of originals this year than in the past which brings younger viewers to the networking and usually garners big audiences, and it's investing in digital, which we expect is going to keep growing. It's been growing, add revenue double digits digital now represents 25% of all CNN's overall ad revenue. And last year had its best year overtaking Yahoo! news. So I think CNN is positioned for another record year of profit growth in 2017. We're highly confident that we're going to be able to achieve that and that's going to be led by a healthy increase in affiliate revenues and absolutely lower election-related expenses."

And as you see the development of that, I know you are referencing some brands that started in the tech world. If you think of something like either CNN or HBO, and then you are going to expand that half to other networks, both things like CNN or HBO are global brands that got global distribution now. What we've been doing over the years is we've essentially try to capitalize on these SVOD and linear network opportunities going global in terms of territory. And going digital in terms of VOD across platforms and not just TV, but mobile devices. The bulk of people in India or Brazil are watching differently in different device setups than say those in Western Europe or the United States. So we've been pursuing essentially that strategy of distribution for our networks that optimizes the reach of whatever distribution is in place. If you look at -- is orders of combination, HBO is an easy way to describe it because it started VOD, and it started more global distribution as did CNN. So we've got places where HBO is over the top direct as a network. We just launched a few in Western Europe, Spain, we are launching in Latin America, we have things in Eastern Europe like that. We also have HBO in Western Europe licensed into other SVOD like Sky and other sorts of platforms if they have superior reach and can therefore, get our programming, which is usually branded as HBO neighborhood programming. and if then creates a choice as time goes on of whether we decide to move to direct network full schedule or whether we continue to license to optimize value of that network name and the programming associated with it.

We had an outstanding fourth quarter, capping off a very successful year in 2016. And for the year, our revenues increased 4% to $29.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10%",1975,"Thanks, Jessica, and thanks, everybody, for listening in this morning. 
We had an outstanding fourth quarter, capping off a very successful year in 2016. And for the year, our revenues increased 4% to $29.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10% to $7.6 billion with record results in each of our divisions. 
Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $5.86 per share. That's our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Now looking at the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 11% to $7.9 billion with increases in each of our divisions and adjusted operating income increased 25% to $1.8 billion. 
We generated a record $4.4 billion in free cash flow, and we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends over the course of the year. 
What's driving these results is the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's enabled us to provide superior long-term returns to our shareholders. 
Our strategy starts, as you'll know, with investing in creating the world's most compelling video content. We then ensure that it can be accessed and enjoyed by consumers wherever, whenever and on whatever device they want it all around the world. And increasingly, that means working with both our distribution partners and on our own to ensure great experiences that connect consumers with our content and our brands. You can see the success of this strategy across each of our businesses last year. Let me share a few highlights to start at the networks. 
In 2016, Turner made terrific progress on its goal of transforming its leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids brands, investing in each of its businesses to make them ever more powerful and engaging for audiences. 
For the year, among adults 18 to 49 in prime time, we held 3 of the top 5 slots among ad-supported cable networks with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim. And in fact, TBS was the #1 entertainment network in prime for the fourth consecutive year, showcasing a great mix of fresh originals, sports and acquired content. 
Early last year, we began introducing a lineup of bold, new comedies that includes Angie Tribeca, The Detour and Wrecked. We've also had a breakout success in Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, which, during the summer, began outpacing The Daily Show and continued to do so in the fourth quarter. We also added 2 new comedies in People of Earth and Search Party, which debuted to strong critical reviews. All of the freshman shows have been renewed. And if you haven't seen them, we've made the entire seasons available on demand to binge view, as all the latest Turner original series, all on demand. 
Now if 2016 was TBS's year, we expect 2017 to belong to TNT. It's just on under way in its refresh process, but it's already off to an encouraging start with newcomers Animal Kingdom produced by Warner Bros. and Good Behavior, both of which have also been renewed. 
And this year, we're rolling out a slate that includes exciting, new series like The Alienist, Will [ph] and Klaus [ph], adding compelling franchise movies, which include those from the DC Universe and the entire Star Wars library and recent Marvel movies and you can see why we're very confident in TNT's future as the home for great [indiscernible]. 
Another part of Turner's success, a critical part and, well, basically a vital part, is our success in sports. And our rights to the NCAA tournament, the NBA and Major League Baseball. Last year, we had the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game for the first time ever, and we generated record revenues across our March Madness properties. This is such a strong relationship for us that we, along with CBS, renewed our deal with the NCAA through 2032. Our NBA package also continues to deliver tremendous results, and that was highlighted by Game 7 of last year's -- last season's Western Conference Finals, which became the most watched telecast ever in the history of TNT. We also launched our ELEAGUE gaming network in partnership with WME | IMG, and that's off to a promising start and it's already bringing new, younger viewers to TBS. 
Speaking of younger viewers, I have to mention Adult Swim again and its leading position with millennial audiences. In 2016, it was the #1 network among 18- to 34-year-olds for the 12th year in a row. 
Now what a year for CNN, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time. Let's just say that again, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 at prime time and the #1 digital news destination in 2016. CNN capped off its most watched year ever with a record-setting election night to rank #1 in prime at evening across all cable and broadcast networks. 
With the historic U.S. Presidential election behind us and the new administration in place, we have every confidence that CNN will continue to reinforce its reputation as not only the source of the world x2 for trusted news coverage but also as the destination for compelling original series and documentaries. 
And international, Turner launched a dozen new networks while holding its position as the #1 portfolio of pay TV networks across Latin America. 
Whether it's content, advertising or distribution, Turner is making important progress evolving its business in ways that recognize changing media habits and that put the consumer first. 
Last year, Turner continued to build on the successful 2015 launches of short-form news site, Great Big Story, and digital studio, Super Deluxe. And in November, Turner Classic Movies launched FilmStruck, a new over-the-top service for lovers of art house movies. 
And in distribution, Turner has demonstrated the value of its portfolio by being an anchor tenant on each of the new virtual MVPD services that have launched as well as on Hulu's upcoming new service. 
Now let's move to the gold standard in premium video, Home Box Office. HBO had another great year while making investments for an even stronger original programming lineup. 
Once again, 2016 brought more Primetime Emmy Awards to HBO than any other network, and that's for the 15th straight year. Game of Thrones' sixth season hit record viewership of 26 million people per episode. That's about a 50 rating on HBO, actually more than that on the subbase. And we also had the biggest launch of a new series in HBO history with Westworld. It's produced by Warner Bros. and it's surpassed even the Game of Thrones' first season. I want to pause on that and say that even with the explosion of new outlets and choices in this golden age of video, HBO remains singular in its ability to attract artists  who push the boundaries of what's creatively possible. And that's the case whether it's on an epic scale of a show like Westworld or on a human scale with a show like Girls, which begins its sixth and final season this weekend. You'll also see that in our upcoming limited series, Big Little Lies, with a stellar cast including Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, which follows last year's acclaimed series, The Night Of. 
In 2016 at HBO, we also premiered the well-received fresh from seasons of Insecure, Divorce, Vice Principals and High Maintenance. And those ran alongside returning comedy powerhouses Veep, Silicon Valley and Ballers. 
Of course, HBO offers much more than its original programming. It's got the best lineup of recent Hollywood films, hit bounds available anywhere. And they account for a significant amount of HBO's viewership. 
When you add in great documentaries, sports and late-night powerhouses like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver or Real Time with Bill Maher, both of which experienced record viewership last year, as well as our new nightly series, VICE News Tonight, you can see why HBO stands out from the pack and why we're very confident about the growth opportunities ahead. 
HBO has also been blazing the trail and connecting with consumers through its streaming product, which added distribution on Microsoft's Xbox, on Samsung's smart TVs, Sony's PlayStation and Amazon Prime Channels in 2016. 
In total, HBO recently surpassed 2 million domestic over-the-top subscribers. So we're really pleased with the progress. 
And HBO is just as focused on reaching consumers abroad with over-the-top launches in Spain, Brazil and Argentina in 2016. 
Finally, let's turn to Warner Bros., the global entertainment leader. Warner has had another record year with strong results in television and film and a growing consumer products business that ties into its focus on franchise properties. 
In movies, we reached nearly $5 billion in global box office. That's the second best year in our history. And it was driven across a range of hits led by our franchise releases: Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. But the depth and diversity of our slate was also on display with strong performances from movies like Central Intelligence, Lights Out, The Conjuring 2 and Sully.  We are just as excited about 2017 with a lineup that starts with the LEGO Batman Movie, which opened, by the way, this weekend, and we also have the highly anticipated next installments in our DC slate with Wonder Woman in June and Justice League in November. 
In television at Warner's, we were the #1 supplier to broadcast networks again. This is now for the eighth year in a row with at least 4 shows on each network this season. And that includes the #1 overall series on television, The Big Bang Theory, and the #1 non-scripted series on television, The Voice, as well as newcomers like Lethal Weapon and Riverdale. 
We've mentioned before that our DC franchise has been one of our most important priorities at Warner's, and you can see the results not just at the box office but also in the 10 DC-based shows we have on TV; in the 4.5 billion consumer spend on DC merchandise last year, contributing to our record performance in consumer products; and finally in our hit video game franchises, including Injustice 2, which will release this coming May. 
Similar to Turner and HBO, Warner Bros. also continues to make strides in developing direct-to-consumer capabilities to serve its fans in today's evolving environment. We created the Warner Bros. Digital Networks division and we closed deals to buy Machinima, giving us a platform to connect to coveted and hard-to-reach young gamers,  and DramaFever, which gives us the capability to launch and operate new over-the-top broadband VOD services. 
Across our company, we had a very active and successful year, and we're  inspired by the future of media that we're helping to shape. As we've said many times before, connecting more directly with consumers as our businesses evolve, both within and outside the existing ecosystem, is one of our most important strategic priorities, and we're making a lot of progress. 
We believe our deal to be acquired by AT&T, which we announced on October 22, will further enhance our ability to innovate and thrive. A special meeting of shareholders to vote on the transaction will be held a week from today. The regulatory review process is under way, and we remain confident that the deal will be approved later this year. Once that happens, we're very excited about the potential of combining AT&T's great strength in mobile and video distribution and its fantastic customer relationships with the world's greatest storytelling and the value we can create together by accelerating the evolution of our company and our industries for the benefit of consumers. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to lead the industry both creatively and financially not just for 2017 but for many years to come. 
Thanks again for listening. And with that, let me turn it over to Howard."

Starting with consolidated results. We finished 2016 with a great fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11%, adjusted operating income was up a very strong 25% with growth across all divisions and adjusted EPS grew 18%. 
We also had strong results for the full year with revenue up 4%, adjusted operating income up 10% and each of our divisions posted record profits, leading to our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Margins expanded over 100 basis points for the year even as we increased our investment in content and marketing across the company to over $15 billion. And we continue to remain focused on tightly managing overhead costs and operating efficiently to help fund these investments. 
Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $5.86 for the year, which included a $0.29 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change that we recognized in the third quarter. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a robust 17% to $5.57, led by our strong operating performance as well as a lower share count. 
In 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion of our stock prior to discontinuing share repurchases in October as a result of the pending merger with AT&T. And combined with our dividend, we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders during the year. 
So we delivered strong financial results in 2016 while continuing to make investments across our businesses to sustain attractive growth over the long term. And we expect to carry that momentum into 2017. 
Looking ahead, in order to better reflect our operating performance and given the volatility in certain below-the-line items that impact our adjusted EPS, we are providing 2017 guidance for adjusted operating income, which we expect will grow in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. I'll provide more context on the key drivers across our businesses throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segments. I'll start at Turner, where we closed out a record year with another quarter of strong profit growth as we continue to benefit from our domestic affiliate renewals. 
Subscription revenues increased 14% in the fourth quarter and were up 12% for the year, including a 150 basis point FX headwind. Domestic Subscription revenues grew 15% in the quarter, and we finished 2016 up over 14%, on the higher end of what we expected coming into the year. So we're really pleased with the outcome of our affiliate renewals, and we remain confident in our outlook for solid, double-digit domestic Subscription revenue growth in 2017. 
International Subscription revenue was up in the high single digits in the quarter, and that included a 300 basis points drag from FX. 
Advertising revenue was down 2% in the fourth quarter. That was a bit below our expectations because of a slowdown in certain international regions. As a result, international Advertising declined mid-single digits, excluding about a 350 basis point drag from FX. However, we still believe secular trends internationally remained strong. 
Domestically, we faced a 300 basis point headwind from the comparison to last year's record Major League Baseball postseason performance. Even so, Advertising was flat in the quarter. That capped off a strong year for domestic Advertising, which increased mid-single digits. The growth was led by the record performance at our news business as it benefited from the presidential election coverage, as well as healthy demand for our premium sports properties. 
Looking at the first quarter, we expect total Advertising revenue to be flat to up low single digits. The scatter market remained healthy with pricing up double digits versus the upfront at our domestic entertainment networks, and we expect our sports and news businesses to be the key drivers and international trends to improve. 
Moving on. Turner's strong revenue trends resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. And we achieved that while continuing to make significant investments at programming, marketing and new digital initiatives. 
Programming expenses were flat in the fourth quarter and up low single digits, excluding programming charges from both periods. For the full year, programming was up 5% primarily related to higher sports costs and CNN's election coverage. 
Marketing costs increased around 20% both for the quarter and the year as we invested in the rebrands at TNT and TBS, including support for our new original series. 
Overall, Turner delivered great financial results in 2016 and has a lot of operating momentum. And with the strength of our brands and the investments we're making across the business, we believe we're very well positioned to continue delivering attractive growth for the long term. 
Turning now to HBO, where our investments and high-quality programming contributed to double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter and have positioned HBO to capitalize on the big global opportunity for subscription services. 
Domestic Subscription revenue was up in the mid-single digits for the quarter and the year.  Similar to recent quarters, we continue to see subscriber headwinds at our traditional affiliates, especially those involved in M&A integration. As a result, despite very strong growth in digital subscribers, total domestic subs across HBO and Cinemax were essentially flat for the year. 
Looking forward, we believe HBO has a big untapped subscriber opportunity in the U.S., and capitalizing on that is our most important long-term growth driver. So on the deals we've recently signed, we're emphasizing subscriber growth. That means as our partners grow HBO subs, it will benefit our Subscription revenue growth. And while it takes time to implement new deals, we're very encouraged with the initial progress on the deals we've closed. However, finishing this affiliate cycle has taken longer than anticipated and we're still in the midst to remove  some deals. So we do not expect sequential improvement in Subscription revenue growth in the first quarter. But we do anticipate that sub-revenue trends will improve as the year progresses, especially in the second half of 2017, as we complete affiliate negotiations and continue to expand our digital distribution. We've seen a nice pickup in OTT sub growth recently, and our goal is to add more digital partners later this year. Along with a return to subscriber growth in our traditional business, that should contribute to a solid increase in total subs for the year. And taking all these factors into account, we anticipate high single-digit growth in Subscription revenue for the year. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues were up 7% for the quarter mainly due to higher home video revenue. For the year, content and other revenues grew 2%, primarily reflecting healthy growth in international licensing as demand for HBO's original content remains robust. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits for the year, excluding FX, and that's a result of strong trends in the Nordics and LatAm. 
Adjusted operating income was up 10% for the quarter and 3% for the year. 
Programming expenses declined 2% in the fourth quarter given the comparison to last year's programming charges. Excluding the charges from both periods and the benefit from reduced amortization this year, programming costs were up double digits in the quarter and the year. That's a result of our continued investments in original programming, including new series like Westworld, Divorce, The Night Of and Insecure. 
So we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016, and we have a lot of momentum on the content side. With global demand for HBO's distinctive premium content only growing and Subscription revenue trends improving, we're confident HBO can deliver healthy growth for years to come. 
Now looking at Warner Bros., where our theatrical business continues to perform exceptionally well, thanks to our franchise-led film slate. And that resulted in significant profit growth, including record adjusted operating income for both the quarter and the year. 
Coming into the year, we plan for theatrical to be the primary driver at Warner's, and that's exactly what's played out. Our 2 DC movies and first Fantastic Beasts installment led a very strong, diverse slate that drove high single-digit growth in theatrical revenues in 2016. And we more than doubled theatrical profits, making this our most profitable film slate in close to a decade. 
The success of the film slate is also contributing to healthy growth in our consumer products business, where revenue increased close to 40% last year. So we're already benefiting from the new strategy we put in place and think we have a big opportunity to keep growing our consumer products business over the next few years. 
In TV, we had difficult comparisons on the licensing side, but total revenues were up in the quarter and for the year mainly due to double-digit growth in initial telecast revenue. That's a result of increased production, reflecting Warner's continued expansion at the cable, premium and SVOD production. Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong international licensing demand for Warner's TV content. 
As we discussed, we also had difficult comparisons in games after record results in 2015 and no franchise console releases last year. So as expected, revenues declined significantly. Looking to 2017, we have a strong lineup anchored by 2 franchise console releases and several mobile game slates. So we're set up for a great year in games. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down double digits for the year primarily due to fewer releases and a softer home video release schedule. But revenue did grow starting in the second half of 2016 as our franchise titles started to move into the home entertainment window. We also remain encouraged by EST, which was up double digits for the year. And digital now represents about half of our home entertainment profits. So we're encouraged as we head into 2017 when we expect to grow both home entertainment revenue and profits. 
Overall, Warner Bros. had another terrific year, thanks to great execution of it strategy focused on monetizing key global franchises across all its businesses. And with a tremendous multiyear film slate, healthy trends in the TV business and upcoming franchise games releases, Warner is positioned to deliver strong growth in its adjusted operating income in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning to the next slide. We also had a great year for free cash flow, which increased 22% to a record $4.4 billion. So we converted 94% of our earnings into cash, continuing our strong track record of conversion. We benefited from strong growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes related to the tax accounting change I mentioned earlier. 
Looking to 2017, while we certainly have difficult comparisons, especially in our cash taxes, we expect strong conversion and another year of healthy free cash flow. 
Moving on to our balance sheet. We ended 2016 with $22.8 billion of net debt. That's up from 2015 mainly due to our share repurchases and dividends. It also reflects about $1 billion in debt redemption premiums and costs associated with our tender offers in December. We spent about $800 million on M&A for the year largely related to the investment in Hulu we made in August. So we ended the year right around our leverage target of 2.75x. And with share repurchase discontinued, we continue to expect our net leverage ratio to decline as we progress through 2017. 
So on the whole, we had a great year in 2016, and we believe we're set up for a strong 2017. And I'll touch on some of the key items for the year ahead. 
Starting at Turner. We anticipate solid double-digit domestic Subscription revenue growth as we continue to benefit from our affiliate renewals. At the same time, as we planned for, we expect programming costs to grow in the double digits primarily due to the new NBA deal, which will account for approximately $400 million of incremental costs in the first half of 2017. And similar to the past few years, Turner remains focused on constraining overhead costs to help fund these investments in great content and new growth opportunities. So that should add up to another year of healthy revenue trends and solid profit growth at Turner. 
At HBO, as I mentioned, we expect Subscription revenue growth to be in the high single digits in 2017. That growth should step up through the year as we complete additional affiliate deals, continue to make progress implementing our new deals and expand digital distribution. The improvement in Subscription revenue trends should translate to attractive adjusted operating income growth in 2017. 
At Warner's, we're also poised for healthy growth in adjusted operating income led by our theatrical and video game businesses. Our franchise slate continues in 2017 with 2 more DC films as well as the LEGO Batman Movie. And we expect other businesses like home entertainment, consumer products and TV licensing will benefit from a strong film slate and recent theatrical success. 
I already mentioned our strong game slate this year. We also continued to see healthy demand in our TV business and expect another year of solid results as we further expand production. 
So we're positioned to deliver attractive financial results at all of our businesses. And that's reflected in our expectation for 2017 adjusted operating income growth to be in the high single digits. 
Given the NBA deal costs in the first half, the timing of improvement in HBO's sub-revenue trends and the cadence of the film and game slate at Warner Bros., at this point we anticipate that growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Overall, we're very pleased about how we're executing across the company and the progress we're making on key initiatives. And we expect to deliver healthy growth in 2017 even as we continue to make important investments in high-quality video content and new business models that should position us for sustained attractive growth trends well into the future. 
With that, let me turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

Given the range of all of these things, I think it's safe to say that what they're going to help do is invigorate consumer interest everywhere in watching networks on demand, watching them on the go in mobile devices and a whole range of offerings, which is what, I think, we'd all like to see. And what that's doing is fueling production -- increases in production spending across the network industry. So terrific. And of course, Warner's, as the biggest supplier to all networks, is part of that.

So that's important when you think about the guidance we've given for Subscription revenues. But certainly, there's an opportunity for that between DirecTV, now Sling and Sony. Each of them have really started to gain traction very recently, proving that there is consumer demand for smaller video packages with top networks at lower prices. I think if you aggregate the number of subscribers for the 3, we're approaching 2 million now in the United States. And if new OTT offerings can combine attractive pricing and packaging with great on-demand comment -- content, excuse me, better interfaces and easier navigation, we think that we can attract new subs into the ecosystem. And importantly, we think a lot of these subs are not cannibalizing existing subscribers. So that's a great opportunity for Turner to take share since we're in all the major virtual MVPDs that have launched to date, and we expect to be in those packages with wide consumer appeal."

Thank you for your question. The deals that we completed already, I think, are very indicative of why we're so encouraged and why we're looking optimistically and confidently to sub revenue acceleration in the second half of the year. Look, the blended penetration on the 2 deals that we completed is less than 50% of what the acquired company's penetration is. And we built incentives into those deals to drive that blended penetration up not only to where the acquired company's are, which are in the high 30s, low-40s, but beyond that. So as we look forward with those partners, the nature of the packaging, the nature of the marketing makes us very comfortable that we're going to see that sub acceleration, number one. Number two, in the deals -- couple deals that we have remaining, I think they, too, are going to see the opportunity before them to grow penetration beyond where they are now. And in some of our higher-performing affiliates, I think there's an opportunity to go even further. So we like the deals that we've completed. We'll finish the rest of our deals in the coming months. And I would say about our OTT business, it's very, very dynamic. It's actually 3x of the number that we reported at the end of '15. And I think that shows not only the robust demand for HBO but the opportunity we have out there not only in the traditional ecosystem but outside of it. So we're looking very confidently to this year. These deals take time. The integration takes time. In one of our major deals, they're just beginning to put us in to the packaging that we've codified into the deal at the end of this month. And so that's really what the lag is, but it will kick in, in the second half of the year."

So I think that indicates that the declines that were occurring back in the summer and the early fall are not really necessarily indicative of a secular trend, and we're seeing very strong advertiser demand for both the NBA and the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship. So we continue to feel really good about our premium sports properties. But just to amplify one more thing, you can't forget about the importance of matchups and competitive games. And when we look at the season, whether it's Cleveland versus Golden State or Oklahoma versus the Clippers or the Lakers versus Portland, those games all performed extremely well with us growing year-over-year. So I think we're going to continue to hope for competitive games, but we love the advertiser demand, and we are optimistic that we're going to be able to continue to grow our ratings in these -- for these properties."

I think we're going to continue that in '17 when we look at what we have in '18 and '19, and we feel very good about it. We also feel that we could still grow in television. And while the growth will occur primarily in broadcast, where we've been #1 for a long time, we do feel that there are opportunities in premium, in pay and in cable. And I feel really good about the fact that we did Westworld with HBO and Richard this year and Animal Kingdom with John. And we had some really big hits for Netflix with Fuller House and Gilmore Girls as well. So that is a business that we think that we can grow and continue to grow. Games, again, a business while it's lumpy, we feel like we can create more sustainable pipeline as we get more to scale there. On the console side, we have 2 big console games this year, and it's our goal to be able to put out a more consistent path with those games but also grow mobile, which doesn't have that lumpiness. So if you look at those 3 big drivers in the content side, that creates opportunities for consumer products. And geography-wise, we think that there's a big opportunity in China. We continue to develop a SVOD service that's doing very well with our partner, Tencent, and we also believe that our partnership to create local language content as well as export content into China is going to create a big growth opportunity for the company in the coming years. So we think that we feel good about '17 and, more importantly, we feel -- about the growth trajectory going forward."

So we've been aggressively working with exhibitors to talk about models that will grow the market versus cannibalize the market, and we think that we're making a lot of progress on that end because ultimately, it's not really about the business model per se, but it's really about giving consumers what they want because if we don't give it to them, they're going to go to the pirated version. So this is very high on our list, and I think that it has the potential to change some of the economics of some of the films, dramas that we're having problems with right now on the theatrical side, which is really important for a company like ours that creates a real broad slate every year."

And the strategy this year, we fully expect that linear ratings for the entire year are not going to be able to stay at last year's record levels, so we could have some difficult advertising comps. But CNN still has great momentum, thanks to its strategy, which is multipronged. It's going in on -- it's going all in on covering big stories. It's adding originals. There'll be more hours of originals this year than in the past, which brings younger viewers to the network and usually garners big audiences. And it's investing in digital, which we expect is going to keep growing. It's been growing and add revenue double digits. Digital now represents 25% of all of CNN's overall ad revenue. And last year, it had its best year ever, overtaking Yahoo! News. So I think CNN is positioned for another record year of profit growth in 2017. We're highly confident that we're going to be able to achieve that, and that's going to be led by a healthy increase in affiliate revenues and absolutely lower election-related expenses."

Are you thinking of reinvesting it and to expand in the content slate, marketing and drive more sub growth? Or will we see some of that flow to the bottom line and expand margins? And then also, I just wanted to ask if you could comment just on the behavior that you've seen in terms of churn.

On churn, particularly over the last few months, we've seen the lowest churn in -- really since the beginning of introducing HBO NOW in our OTT product. That, I think, is a result of 2 things. Number one, as our subscriber base ages, there's, of course, less churn. Number two, I think it speaks to the quality of the content and the range of the content. I think it's important to remember when you look at the usage on digital platforms and on demand you see the usage going across a wide range of categories. It's not just Westworld and Game of Thrones and The Night Of, it's comedies, it's late night, it's documentaries, it's sports program. It's important to punctuate that the usage of HBO programming is across a wide range of [indiscernible], and we're in the business, of course, of curating great content. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen on churn. Your question about investment, yes, we are going to take those margins and we are going to invest a lot of it in what we do for a living, which is trying to make the best content and curate the best content across a lot of different genres of our programming. And the exciting thing is the amount of talent that continues to come to the door with new projects literally on a weekly basis gives us no shortage and in fact gives us better originals [ph] to choose from. And we're very excited about the announcements that you'll see in the coming weeks for 2018, and the investment that we're going to make robustly in programming speaks to, I think, the best of the brand."

And for Jeff, there's been a lot of discussion on over-the-top and direct-to-consumer on this call and others in media. I was curious, do you look at the TV network business as ultimately continuing to be original business or developing into a global network business? And the reason I asked is there's an argument that TV networks are going global and direct-to-consumer and those economics will be superior and more sustainable. And Netflix and Amazon are there. FOX is headed there quickly. You've got CNN globally, but many of your other networks are regional. So I was curious, how do you see the marketplace evolving, what it might mean, if anything, for Time Warner in that regard."

And as you see the development of that -- I know you were referencing some brands that started in the tech world, -- we -- if you think of something like either CNN or HBO and then you're going to expand that out to other networks, both -- things like CNN and HBO are global brands that got global distribution now. What we've been doing over the years is we've essentially tried to capitalize on these SVOD and linear network opportunities going global in terms of territory and going digital in terms of VOD across platforms. So not just TV but mobile devices. You're -- the bulk of people in India or Brazil are watching differently on different device setups than, say, those in Western Europe or the United States. So we've been pursuing essentially that strategy of distribution for our networks that optimizes the reach of whatever distribution is in place. If you look at -- so there's a combination. HBO is an easy way to describe it because it started VOD and it started more global distribution, as did CNN. So we've got places where HBO is over-the-top direct as a network. We just launched a few in Western Europe, Spain. We are launching in Latin America. We have things in Eastern Europe like that. We also have HBO in Western Europe licensed into other SVOD like Sky and other sorts of platforms if they have superior reach and can therefore get our programming, which is usually branded as HBO neighborhood programming. And it then creates a choice as time goes on of whether we decide to move to direct network full schedule or whether we continue to license to optimize the value of the network name and the programming associated with it. You've got examples of Turner doing that at FilmStruck. You've got examples of Warner's doing it in China with -- what are we? The second largest SVOD service in China?"

Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $5.86 per share. That's our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Now looking at the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 11% to $7.9 billion with increases at each of our divisions and adjusted operating income increased 25% to $1.8 billion. 
We generated a record $4.4 billion in free cash flow, and we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends over the course of the year. 
What's driving these results is the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's enabled us to provide superior long-term returns to our shareholders. 
Our strategy starts, as you all know, with investing in and creating the world's most compelling video content. We then ensure that it can be accessed and enjoyed by consumers wherever, whenever and on whatever device they want all around the world. And increasingly, that means working with both our distribution partners and on our own to ensure great experiences that connect consumers with our content and our brands. You can see the success of this strategy across each of our businesses last year. Let me share a few highlights. We'll start at the networks. 
In 2016, Turner made terrific progress on its goal of transforming its leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids' brands, investing in each of its businesses to make them ever more powerful and engaging for audiences. 
For the year, among adults 18 to 49 in prime time, we held 3 of the top 5 slots among ad-supported cable networks with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim. And in fact, TBS was the #1 entertainment network in prime for the fourth consecutive year, showcasing a great mix of fresh originals, sports and acquired content. 
Early last year, we began introducing a lineup of bold, new comedies that includes Angie Tribeca, The Detour and Wrecked. We've also had a breakout success in Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, which, during the summer, began outpacing The Daily Show and continued to do so in the fourth quarter. We also added 2 new comedies in People of Earth and Search Party, which debuted to strong critical reviews. All of the freshman shows have been renewed. And if you haven't seen them, we've made the entire seasons available on demand to binge view as are all the latest Turner original series, all on demand. 
Now if 2016 was TBS's year, we expect 2017 to belong to TNT. It's just underway in its refresh process, but it's already off to an encouraging start with newcomers Animal Kingdom produced by Warner Bros. and Good Behavior, both of which have also been renewed. 
And this year, we're rolling out a slate that includes exciting, new series like The Alienist, Will and Claus, adding compelling franchise movies, which include those from the DC Universe and the entire Star Wars library and recent Marvel movies and you can see why we're very confident in TNT's future as the home for great drama. 
Another part of Turner's success, a critical part and, well, basically a vital part, is our success in sports. And our rights to the NCAA tournament, the NBA and Major League Baseball. Last year, we had the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game for the first time ever, and we generated record revenues across our March Madness properties. This is such a strong relationship for us that we, along with CBS, renewed our deal with the NCAA through 2032. Our NBA package also continues to deliver tremendous results, and that was highlighted by Game 7 of last year's -- last season's Western Conference Finals. It became the most watched telecast ever in the history of TNT. We also launched our ELEAGUE gaming network in partnership with WME | IMG, and that's off to a promising start and it's already bringing new, younger viewers to TBS. Speaking of younger viewers, I have to mention Adult Swim again and its leading position with millennial audiences. In 2016, it was the #1 network among 18- to 34-year-olds for the 12th year in a row. 
Now what a year for CNN, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time. Let's just say that again, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 at prime time and the #1 digital news destination in 2016. CNN capped off its most watched year ever with a record-setting election night, ranked #1 in prime that evening across all cable and broadcast networks. 
With the historic U.S. Presidential election behind us and the new administration in place, we have every confidence that CNN will continue to reinforce its reputation as not only the source the world turns to for trusted news coverage but also as the destination for compelling original series and documentaries. 
And international, Turner launched a dozen new networks while holding its position as the #1 portfolio of pay TV networks across Latin America. 
Whether it's content, advertising or distribution, Turner is making important progress evolving its business in ways that recognize changing media habits and that put the consumer first. 
Last year, Turner continued to build on the successful 2015 launches of short-form news site, Great Big Story, and digital studio, Super Deluxe. And in November, Turner Classic Movies launched FilmStruck, a new over-the-top service for lovers of art house movies. 
And in distribution, Turner has demonstrated the value of its portfolio by being an anchor tenant on each of the new virtual MVPD services that have launched as well as on Hulu's upcoming new service. 
Now let's move to the gold standard in premium video, Home Box Office. HBO had another great year while making investments for an even stronger original programming lineup. 
Once again, 2016 brought more Primetime Emmy Awards to HBO than any other network, and that's for the 15th straight year. Game of Thrones' sixth season hit record viewership of 26 million people per episode. That's about a 50 rating on HBO, actually more than that on the subbase. And we also had the biggest launch of a new series in HBO history with Westworld. It's produced by Warner Bros. and it surpassed even the Game of Thrones' first season. I want to pause on that and say that even with the explosion of new outlets and choices in this golden age of video, HBO remains singular in its ability to attract artists who push the boundaries of what's creatively possible. And that's the case whether it's on an epic scale with a show like Westworld or on a human scale with a show like Girls, which begins its sixth and final season this weekend. You'll also see that in our upcoming limited series, Big Little Lies, with a stellar cast including Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, which follows last year's acclaimed series, The Night Of. 
In 2016 at HBO, we also premiered the well-received freshman seasons of Insecure, Divorce, Vice Principals and High Maintenance. And those ran alongside returning comedy powerhouses Veep, Silicon Valley and Ballers. 
Of course, HBO offers much more than its original programming. It's got the best lineup of recent Hollywood films -- hit films available anywhere. And they account for a significant amount of HBO's viewership. 
When you add in great documentaries, sports and late-night powerhouses like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver or Real Time with Bill Maher, both of which experienced record viewership last year, as well as our new nightly series, VICE News Tonight, you can see why HBO stands out from the pack and why we're very confident about the growth opportunities ahead. 
HBO has also been blazing the trail and connecting with consumers through its streaming product, which added distribution on Microsoft's Xbox, on Samsung smart TVs, Sony's PlayStation and Amazon Prime Channels in 2016. 
In total, HBO recently surpassed 2 million domestic over-the-top subscribers. So we're really pleased with the progress. 
And HBO is just as focused on reaching consumers abroad with over-the-top launches in Spain, Brazil and Argentina in 2016. 
Finally, let's turn to Warner Bros., the global entertainment leader. Warner has had another record year with strong results in television and film and a growing consumer products business that ties into its focus on franchise properties. 
In movies, we reached nearly $5 billion in global box office. That's the second best year in our history. And it was driven across a range of hits led by our franchise releases: Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. But the depth and diversity of our slate was also on display with strong performances from movies like Central Intelligence, Lights Out, The Conjuring 2 and Sully.  We are just as excited about 2017 with a lineup that starts with the LEGO Batman Movie, which opens, by the way, this weekend, and we also have the highly anticipated next installments in our DC slate with Wonder Woman in June and Justice League in November. 
In television at Warner's, we were the #1 supplier to broadcast networks again. This is now for the eighth year in a row with at least 4 shows on each network this season. And that includes the #1 overall series on television, The Big Bang Theory, and the #1 non-scripted series on television, The Voice, as well as newcomers like Lethal Weapon and Riverdale. 
We've mentioned before that our DC franchise has been one of our most important priorities at Warner's, and you can see the results not just at the box office but also in the 10 DC-based shows we have on TV; in the $4.5 billion consumers spent on DC merchandise last year, contributing to our record performance in consumer products; and finally in our hit video game franchises, including Injustice 2, which will release this coming May. 
Similar to Turner and HBO, Warner Bros. also continues to make strides in developing direct-to-consumer capabilities to serve its fans in today's evolving environment. We created the Warner Bros. Digital Networks division and we closed deals to buy Machinima, giving us a platform to connect to coveted and hard-to-reach young gamers, and DramaFever, which gives us the capability to launch and operate new over-the-top broadband VOD services. 
Across our company, we had a very active and successful year and we’re inspired by the future of media that we're helping to shape. As we've said many times before, connecting more directly with consumers as our businesses evolve, both within and outside the existing ecosystem, is one of our most important strategic priorities, and we're making a lot of progress. 
We believe our deal to be acquired by AT&T, which we announced on October 22, will further enhance our ability to innovate and thrive. A special meeting of shareholders to vote on the transaction will be held a week from today. The regulatory review process is underway, and we remain confident that the deal will be approved later this year. Once that happens, we're very excited about the potential of combining AT&T's great strength in mobile and video distribution and its fantastic customer relationships with the world's greatest storytelling and the value we can create together by accelerating the evolution of our company and our industries for the benefit of consumers. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to lead the industry both creatively and financially not just for 2017 but for many years to come. 
Thanks again for listening. And with that, let me turn it over to Howard."

Starting with consolidated results. We finished 2016 with a great fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11%, adjusted operating income was up a very strong 25% with growth across all divisions and adjusted EPS grew 18%. 
We also had strong results for the full year with revenue up 4%, adjusted operating income up 10% and each of our divisions posted record profits, leading to our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Margins expanded over 100 basis points for the year even as we increased our investment in content and marketing across the company to over $15 billion. And we continue to remain focused on tightly managing overhead costs and operating efficiently to help fund these investments. 
Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $5.86 for the year, which included a $0.29 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change that we recognized in the third quarter. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a robust 17% to $5.57, led by our strong operating performance as well as a lower share count. 
In 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion of our stock prior to discontinuing share repurchases in October as a result of the pending merger with AT&T. And combined with our dividend, we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders during the year. 
So we delivered strong financial results in 2016 while continuing to make investments across our businesses to sustain attractive growth over the long term. And we expect to carry that momentum into 2017. 
Looking ahead, in order to better reflect our operating performance and given the volatility in certain below-the-line items that impact our adjusted EPS, we are providing 2017 guidance for adjusted operating income, which we expect will grow in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. I'll provide more context on the key drivers across our businesses throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segments. I'll start at Turner, where we closed out a record year with another quarter of strong profit growth as we continue to benefit from our domestic affiliate renewals. 
Subscription revenues increased 14% in the fourth quarter and were up 12% for the year, including a 150 basis point FX headwind. Domestic Subscription revenues grew 15% in the quarter, and we finished 2016 up over 14%, on the higher end of what we expected coming into the year. So we're really pleased with the outcome of our affiliate renewals, and we remain confident in our outlook for solid, double-digit domestic Subscription revenue growth in 2017. 
International Subscription revenue was up in the high single digits in the quarter, and that included a 300 basis points drag from FX. 
Advertising revenue was down 2% in the fourth quarter. That was a bit below our expectations because of a slowdown in certain international regions. As a result, international Advertising declined mid-single digits, excluding about a 350 basis point drag from FX. However, we still believe secular trends internationally remain strong. 
Domestically, we faced a 300 basis point headwind from the comparison to last year's record Major League Baseball postseason performance. Even so, Advertising was flat in the quarter. That capped off a strong year for domestic Advertising, which increased mid-single digits. The growth was led by the record performance at our news business as it benefited from the presidential election coverage, as well as healthy demand for our premium sports properties. 
Looking at the first quarter, we expect total Advertising revenue to be flat to up low single digits. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing up double digits versus the upfront at our domestic entertainment networks, and we expect our sports and news businesses to be the key drivers and international trends to improve. 
Moving on. Turner's strong revenue trends resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. And we achieved that while continuing to make significant investments at programming, marketing and new digital initiatives. 
Programming expenses were flat in the fourth quarter and up low single digits, excluding programming charges from both periods. For the full year, programming was up 5% primarily related to higher sports costs and CNN's election coverage. 
Marketing costs increased around 20% both for the quarter and the year as we invested in the rebrands at TNT and TBS, including support for our new original series. 
Overall, Turner delivered great financial results in 2016 and has a lot of operating momentum. And with the strength of our brands and the investments we're making across the business, we believe we're very well positioned to continue delivering attractive growth for the long term. 
Turning now to HBO, where our investments in high-quality programming contributed to double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter and have positioned HBO to capitalize on the big global opportunity for subscription services. 
Domestic Subscription revenue was up in the mid-single digits for the quarter and the year.  Similar to recent quarters, we continue to see subscriber headwinds at our traditional affiliates, especially those involved in M&A integration. As a result, despite very strong growth in digital subscribers, total domestic subs across HBO and Cinemax were essentially flat for the year. 
Looking forward, we believe HBO has a big untapped subscriber opportunity in the U.S., and capitalizing on that is our most important long-term growth driver. So on the deals we've recently signed, we're emphasizing subscriber growth. That means as our partners grow HBO subs, it will benefit our Subscription revenue growth. And while it takes time to implement new deals, we're very encouraged with the initial progress on the deals we've closed. However, finishing this affiliate cycle has taken longer than anticipated and we're still in the midst of renewing some deals. So we do not expect sequential improvement in Subscription revenue growth in the first quarter. But we do anticipate that sub-revenue trends will improve as the year progresses, especially in the second half of 2017, as we complete affiliate negotiations and continue to expand our digital distribution. We've seen a nice pickup in OTT sub growth recently, and our goal is to add more digital partners later this year. Along with a return to subscriber growth in our traditional business, that should contribute to a solid increase in total subs for the year. And taking all these factors into account, we anticipate high single-digit growth in Subscription revenue for the year. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues were up 7% for the quarter mainly due to higher home video revenue. For the year, content and other revenues grew 2%, primarily reflecting healthy growth in international licensing as demand for HBO's original content remains robust. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits for the year, excluding FX, and that's a result of strong trends in the Nordics and LatAm. 
Adjusted operating income was up 10% for the quarter and 3% for the year. 
Programming expenses declined 2% in the fourth quarter given the comparison to last year's programming charges. Excluding the charges from both periods and the benefit from reduced amortization this year, programming costs were up double digits in the quarter and the year. That's a result of our continued investments in original programming, including new series like Westworld, Divorce, The Night Of and Insecure. 
So we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016, and we have a lot of momentum on the content side. With global demand for HBO's distinctive premium content only growing and Subscription revenue trends improving, we're confident HBO can deliver healthy growth for years to come. 
Now looking at Warner Bros., where our theatrical business continues to perform exceptionally well, thanks to our franchise-led film slate. And that resulted in significant profit growth, including record adjusted operating income for both the quarter and the year. 
Coming into the year, we plan for theatrical to be the primary driver at Warner's, and that's exactly what played out. Our 2 DC movies and first Fantastic Beasts installment led a very strong, diverse slate that drove high single-digit growth in theatrical revenues in 2016. And we more than doubled theatrical profits, making this our most profitable film slate in close to a decade. 
The success of the film slate is also contributing to healthy growth in our consumer products business, where revenue increased close to 40% last year. So we're already benefiting from the new strategy we put in place and think we have a big opportunity to keep growing our consumer products business over the next few years. 
In TV, we had difficult comparisons on the licensing side, but total revenues were up in the quarter and for the year mainly due to double-digit growth in initial telecast revenue. That's a result of increased production, reflecting Warner's continued expansion at the cable, premium and SVOD production. Additionally, we continued to benefit from strong international licensing demand for Warner's TV content. 
As we discussed, we also had difficult comparisons in games after record results in 2015 and no franchise console releases last year. So as expected, revenues declined significantly. Looking to 2017, we have a strong lineup anchored by 2 franchise console releases and several mobile games. So we're set up for a great year in games. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down double digits for the year primarily due to fewer releases and a softer home video release schedule. But revenue did grow starting in the second half of 2016 as our franchise titles started to move into the home entertainment window. We also remain encouraged by EST, which was up double digits for the year. And digital now represents about half of our home entertainment profits. So we're encouraged as we head into 2017 when we expect to grow both home entertainment revenue and profits. 
Overall, Warner Bros. had another terrific year, thanks to great execution of it strategy focused on monetizing key global franchises across all its businesses. And with a tremendous multiyear film slate, healthy trends in the TV business and upcoming franchise games releases, Warner is positioned to deliver strong growth in its adjusted operating income in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning to the next slide. We also had a great year for free cash flow, which increased 22% to a record $4.4 billion. So we converted 94% of our earnings into cash, continuing our strong track record of conversion. We benefited from strong growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes related to the tax accounting change I mentioned earlier. 
Looking to 2017, while we certainly have difficult comparisons, especially on cash taxes, we expect strong conversion and another year of healthy free cash flow. 
Moving on to our balance sheet. We ended 2016 with $22.8 billion of net debt. That's up from 2015 mainly due to our share repurchases and dividends. It also reflects about $1 billion in debt redemption premiums and costs associated with our tender offers in December. We spent about $800 million on M&A for the year largely related to the investment at Hulu we made in August. So we ended the year right around our leverage target of 2.75x. And with share repurchases discontinued, we continue to expect our net leverage ratio to decline as we progress through 2017. 
So on the whole, we had a great year in 2016, and we believe we're set up for a strong 2017. And I'll touch on some of the key items for the year ahead. 
Starting at Turner. We anticipate solid double-digit domestic Subscription revenue growth as we continue to benefit from our affiliate renewals. At the same time, as we planned for, we expect programming costs to grow in the double digits primarily due to the new NBA deal, which will account for approximately $400 million of incremental costs in the first half of 2017. And similar to the past few years, Turner remains focused on constraining overhead costs to help fund these investments in great content and new growth opportunities. So that should add up to another year of healthy revenue trends and solid profit growth at Turner. 
At HBO, as I mentioned, we expect Subscription revenue growth to be in the high single digits in 2017. That growth should step up through the year as we complete additional affiliate deals, continue to make progress implementing our new deals and expand digital distribution. The improvement in Subscription revenue trends should translate to attractive adjusted operating income growth in 2017. 
At Warner's, we're also poised for healthy growth in adjusted operating income led by our theatrical and video game businesses. Our franchise slate continues in 2017 with 2 more DC films as well as the LEGO Batman Movie. And we expect other businesses like home entertainment, consumer products and TV licensing will benefit from a strong film slate and recent theatrical success. 
I already mentioned our strong game slate this year. We also continued to see healthy demand in our TV business and expect another year of solid results as we further expand production. 
So we're positioned to deliver attractive financial results at all of our businesses. And that's reflected in our expectation for 2017 adjusted operating income growth to be in the high single digits. 
Given the NBA deal costs in the first half, the timing of improvement in HBO's sub-revenue trends and the cadence of the film and game slate at Warner Bros., at this point we anticipate that growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Overall, we're very pleased about how we're executing across the company and the progress we're making on key initiatives. And we expect to deliver healthy growth in 2017 even as we continue to make important investments in high-quality video content and new business models that should position us for sustained attractive growth trends well into the future. 
With that, let me turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

Look, there's a lot of them. They have different price points, as we all know. There is also a fair degree of variation in the reach of some of these virtual MVPDs in terms of their sub-bases and platforms. So all that is a very healthy development, as we've been predicting. You have new entrants coming in all the time, Amazon, Hulu, et cetera. Given the range of all of these things, I think it's safe to say that what they're going to help do is invigorate consumer interest everywhere in watching networks on demand, watching them on the go in mobile devices and a whole range of offerings, which is what, I think, we'd all like to see. And what that's doing is fueling production -- increases in production spending across the network industry. So terrific. And of course, Warner's, as the biggest supplier to all networks, is part of that. I think it's too early to say, if you're asking for timing, what the relative size of the virtual MVPD sub growth is, let's say, in '17 versus what the continued slope of the at-home ecosystem sub count turns out to be. So I don't have a specific answer for that. And John, let me turn it to you. Put the pressure on you, if you have one."

So that's important when you think about the guidance we've given for Subscription revenues. But certainly, there's an opportunity for that between DirecTV, now Sling and Sony. Each of them have really started to gain traction very recently, proving that there is consumer demand for smaller video packages with top networks at lower prices. I think if you aggregate the number of subscribers for the 3, we're approaching 2 million now in the United States. And if new OTT offerings can combine attractive pricing and packaging with great on-demand comment -- content, excuse me, better interfaces and easier navigation, we think that we can attract new subs into the ecosystem. And importantly, we think a lot of these subs are not cannibalizing existing subscribers. So that's a great opportunity for Turner to take share since we're in all the major virtual MVPDs that have launched to date, and we expect to be in those packages with wide consumer appeal."

The deals that we completed already, I think, are very indicative of why we're so encouraged and why we're looking optimistically and confidently to sub revenue acceleration in the second half of the year.",313,"Mike, it's Richard. Thank you for your question. The deals that we completed already, I think, are very indicative of why we're so encouraged and why we're looking optimistically and confidently to sub revenue acceleration in the second half of the year. Look, the blended penetration on the 2 deals that we completed is less than 50% of what the acquired company's penetration is. And we built incentives into those deals to drive that blended penetration up not only to where the acquired companies are, which are in the high 30s, low-40s, but beyond that. So as we look forward with those partners, the nature of the packaging, the nature of the marketing makes us very comfortable that we're going to see that sub acceleration, number one. Number two, in the deals -- couple deals that we have remaining, I think they, too, are going to see the opportunity before them to grow penetration beyond where they are now. And in some of our higher-performing affiliates, I think there's an opportunity to go even further. So we like the deals that we've completed. We'll finish the rest of our deals in the coming months. And I would say about our OTT business, it's very, very dynamic. It's actually 3x of the number that we reported at the end of '15. And I think that shows not only the robust demand for HBO but the opportunity we have out there not only in the traditional ecosystem but outside of it. So we're looking very confidently to this year. These deals take time. The integration takes time. In one of our major deals, they're just beginning to put us in to the packaging that we've codified into the deal at the end of this month. And so that's really what the lag is, but it will kick in, in the second half of the year."

So we continue to feel really good about our premium sports properties. But just to amplify one more thing, you can't forget about the importance of matchups and competitive games. And when we look at the season, whether it's Cleveland versus Golden State or Oklahoma versus the Clippers or the Lakers versus Portland, those games all performed extremely well with us growing year-over-year.

We think we're going to continue that in '17, and we look at what we have in '18 and '19, and we feel very good about it. We also feel that we could still grow in television. And while the growth won't occur primarily in broadcast, where we've been #1 for a long time, we do feel that there are opportunities in premium, in pay and in cable. And I feel really good about the fact that we did Westworld with HBO and Richard this year and Animal Kingdom with John. And we had some really big hits for Netflix with Fuller House and Gilmore Girls as well. So that is a business that we think that we can grow and continue to grow. Games, again, a business, while it's lumpy, we feel like we can create more sustainable pipeline as we get more to scale there. On the console side, we have 2 big console games this year, and it's our goal to be able to put out a more consistent path with those games but also grow mobile, which doesn't have that lumpiness. So if you look at those 3 big drivers in the content side, that creates opportunities for consumer products. And geography-wise, we think that there's a big opportunity in China. We continue to develop a SVOD service that's doing very well with our partner, Tencent, and we also believe that our partnership to create local language content as well as export content into China is going to create a big growth opportunity for the company in the coming years.

And the bifurcation that we're seeing kind of on the theatrical side where a disproportionate share of the revenue is going to the bigger movies. These big franchise movies are taking a bigger and bigger share. But the big television shows like Westworld that break out are more valuable than ever because there's more -- original content being out there, but there's less things as a result because there's more competition for things that really break out. And so when you have those and you have AAA talent who typically garner that kind of attention, I think it is more valuable and there is a little bit more leverage on that side."

As Jeff said, it's the most watched year ever in the history of CNN. It's closer to FOX News than it's been in 8 years and had the greatest advantage over MSNBC since 2009. And the strategy this year, we fully expect that linear ratings for the entire year are not going to be able to stay at last year's record levels, so we could have some difficult advertising comps. But CNN still has great momentum, thanks to its strategy, which is multipronged. It's going in on -- it's going all in on covering big stories. It's adding originals. There'll be more hours of originals this year than in the past, which brings younger viewers to the network and usually garners big audiences. And it's investing in digital, which we expect is going to keep growing. It's been growing in ad revenue double digits. Digital now represents 25% of all of CNN's overall ad revenue. And last year, it had its best year ever, overtaking Yahoo! News. So I think CNN is positioned for another record year of profit growth in 2017. We're highly confident that we're going to be able to achieve that, and that's going to be led by a healthy increase in affiliate revenues and absolutely lower election-related expenses."

I think it's important to remember when you look at the usage on digital platforms and on demand you see the usage going across a wide range of categories. It's not just Westworld and Game of Thrones and The Night Of, it's comedies, it's late night, it's documentaries, it's sports programming. It's important to punctuate that the usage of HBO programming is across a wide range of genres, and we're in the business, of course, of curating great content. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen on churn. Your question about investment, yes, we are going to take those margins and we are going to invest a lot of it in what we do for a living, which is trying to make the best content and curate the best content across a lot of different genres of our programming.

I was curious, do you look at the TV network business as, ultimately, continuing to be a regional business or developing into a global network business? And the reason I ask is there's an argument that TV networks are going global and direct-to-consumer and that those economics will be superior and more sustainable. And Netflix and Amazon are there.

And as you see the development of that -- I know you were referencing some brands that started in the tech world, -- we -- if you think of something like either CNN or HBO and then you can expand that out to other networks. Things like CNN and HBO are global brands. They've got global distribution now. What we've been doing over the years is we've essentially tried to capitalize on these SVOD and linear network opportunities going global in terms of territory and going digital in terms of VOD across platforms. So not just TV but mobile devices. You're -- the bulk of people in India or Brazil are watching differently on different device setups than, say, those in Western Europe or the United States. So we've been pursuing essentially that strategy of distribution for our networks that optimizes the reach of whatever distribution is in place. If you look at -- so there's a combination. HBO is an easy way to describe it because it started VOD and it started more global distribution, as did CNN. So we've got places where HBO is over-the-top direct as a network. We just launched a few in Western Europe, Spain. We are launching in Latin America. We have things in Eastern Europe like that. We also have HBO in Western Europe licensed into other SVOD like Sky and other sorts of platforms if they have superior reach and can therefore get our programming, which is usually branded as HBO neighborhood programming. And it then creates a choice as time goes on of whether we decide to move to direct network full schedule or whether we continue to license to optimize the value of the network name and the programming associated with it. You've got examples of Turner doing that at FilmStruck. You've got examples of Warner's doing it in China with -- what are we, the second largest SVOD service in China?"

We had an outstanding fourth quarter, capping off a very successful year in 2016. And for the year, our revenues increased 4% to $29.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10%",1972,"Thanks, Jessica, and thanks, everybody, for listening in this morning. 
We had an outstanding fourth quarter, capping off a very successful year in 2016. And for the year, our revenues increased 4% to $29.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10% to $7.6 billion with record results at each of our divisions. 
Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $5.86 per share. That's our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Now looking at the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 11% to $7.9 billion with increases at each of our divisions and adjusted operating income increased 25% to $1.8 billion. 
We generated a record $4.4 billion in free cash flow, and we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends over the course of the year. 
What's driving these results is the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's enabled us to provide superior long-term returns to our shareholders. 
Our strategy starts, as you all know, with investing in and creating the world's most compelling video content. We then ensure that it can be accessed and enjoyed by consumers wherever, whenever and on whatever device they want it all around the world. And increasingly, that means working with both our distribution partners and on our own to ensure great experiences that connect consumers with our content and our brands. You can see the success of this strategy across each of our businesses last year. Let me share a few highlights. We'll start at the networks. 
In 2016, Turner made terrific progress on its goal of transforming its leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids' brands, investing in each of its businesses to make them ever more powerful and engaging for audiences. 
For the year, among adults 18 to 49 in prime time, we held 3 of the top 5 slots among ad-supported cable networks with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim. And in fact, TBS was the #1 entertainment network in prime for the fourth consecutive year, showcasing a great mix of fresh originals, sports and acquired content. 
Early last year, we began introducing a lineup of bold, new comedies that includes Angie Tribeca, The Detour and Wrecked. We've also had a breakout success in Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, which, during the summer, began outpacing The Daily Show and continued to do so in the fourth quarter. We also added 2 new comedies in People of Earth and Search Party, which debuted to strong critical reviews. All of the freshman shows have been renewed. And if you haven't seen them, we've made the entire seasons available on demand to binge view as are all the latest Turner original series, all on demand. 
Now if 2016 was TBS's year, we expect 2017 to belong to TNT. It's just underway in its refresh process, but it's already off to an encouraging start with newcomers Animal Kingdom produced by Warner Bros. and Good Behavior, both of which have also been renewed. 
And this year, we're rolling out a slate that includes exciting, new series like The Alienist, Will and Claus, adding compelling franchise movies, which include those from the DC Universe and the entire Star Wars library and recent Marvel movies and you can see why we're very confident in TNT's future as the home for great drama. 
Another part of Turner's success, a critical part and, well, basically a vital part, is our success in sports. And our rights to the NCAA tournament, the NBA and Major League Baseball. Last year, we had the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game for the first time ever, and we generated record revenues across our March Madness properties. This is such a strong relationship for us that we, along with CBS, renewed our deal with the NCAA through 2032. Our NBA package also continues to deliver tremendous results, and that was highlighted by Game 7 of last year's -- last season's Western Conference Finals. It became the most watched telecast ever in the history of TNT. We also launched our ELEAGUE gaming network in partnership with WME | IMG, and that's off to a promising start and it's already bringing new, younger viewers to TBS. Speaking of younger viewers, I have to mention Adult Swim again and its leading position with millennial audiences. In 2016, it was the #1 network among 18- to 34-year-olds for the 12th year in a row. 
Now what a year for CNN, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time. Let's just say that again, the #1 news network among adults 18 to 49 at prime time and the #1 digital news destination in 2016. CNN capped off its most watched year ever with a record-setting election night, ranked #1 in prime that evening across all cable and broadcast networks. 
With the historic U.S. Presidential election behind us and the new administration in place, we have every confidence that CNN will continue to reinforce its reputation as not only the source the world turns to for trusted news coverage but also as the destination for compelling original series and documentaries. 
And international, Turner launched a dozen new networks while holding its position as the #1 portfolio of pay TV networks across Latin America. 
Whether it's content, advertising or distribution, Turner is making important progress evolving its business in ways that recognize changing media habits and that put the consumer first. 
Last year, Turner continued to build on the successful 2015 launches of short-form news site, Great Big Story, and digital studio, Super Deluxe. And in November, Turner Classic Movies launched FilmStruck, a new over-the-top service for lovers of art house movies. 
And in distribution, Turner has demonstrated the value of its portfolio by being an anchor tenant on each of the new virtual MVPD services that have launched as well as on Hulu's upcoming new service. 
Now let's move to the gold standard in premium video, Home Box Office. HBO had another great year while making investments for an even stronger original programming lineup. 
Once again, 2016 brought more Primetime Emmy Awards to HBO than any other network, and that's for the 15th straight year. Game of Thrones' sixth season hit record viewership of 26 million people per episode. That's about a 50 rating on HBO, actually more than that on the subbase. And we also had the biggest launch of a new series in HBO history with Westworld. It's produced by Warner Bros. and it surpassed even the Game of Thrones' first season. I want to pause on that and say that even with the explosion of new outlets and choices in this golden age of video, HBO remains singular in its ability to attract artists who push the boundaries of what's creatively possible. And that's the case whether it's on an epic scale of a show like Westworld or on a human scale with a show like Girls, which begins its sixth and final season this weekend. You'll also see that in our upcoming limited series, Big Little Lies, with a stellar cast including Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, which follows last year's acclaimed series, The Night Of. 
In 2016 at HBO, we also premiered the well-received freshman seasons of Insecure, Divorce, Vice Principals and High Maintenance. And those ran alongside returning comedy powerhouses Veep, Silicon Valley and Ballers. 
Of course, HBO offers much more than its original programming. It's got the best lineup of recent Hollywood films -- hit films available anywhere. And they account for a significant amount of HBO's viewership. 
When you add in great documentaries, sports and late-night powerhouses like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver or Real Time with Bill Maher, both of which experienced record viewership last year, as well as our new nightly series, VICE News Tonight, you can see why HBO stands out from the pack and why we're very confident about the growth opportunities ahead. 
HBO has also been blazing the trail and connecting with consumers through its streaming product, which added distribution on Microsoft's Xbox, on Samsung's smart TVs, Sony's PlayStation and Amazon Prime Channels in 2016. 
In total, HBO recently surpassed 2 million domestic over-the-top subscribers. So we're really pleased with the progress. 
And HBO is just as focused on reaching consumers abroad with over-the-top launches in Spain, Brazil and Argentina in 2016. 
Finally, let's turn to Warner Bros., the global entertainment leader. Warner has had another record year with strong results in television and film and a growing consumer products business that ties into its focus on franchise properties. 
In movies, we reached nearly $5 billion in global box office. That's the second best year in our history. And it was driven across a range of hits led by our franchise releases: Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. But the depth and diversity of our slate was also on display with strong performances from movies like Central Intelligence, Lights Out, The Conjuring 2 and Sully.  We are just as excited about 2017 with a lineup that starts with the LEGO Batman Movie, which opened, by the way, this weekend, and we also have the highly anticipated next installments in our DC slate with Wonder Woman in June and Justice League in November. 
In television at Warner's, we were the #1 supplier to broadcast networks again. This is now for the eighth year in a row with at least 4 shows on each network this season. And that includes the #1 overall series on television, The Big Bang Theory, and the #1 non-scripted series on television, The Voice, as well as newcomers like Lethal Weapon and Riverdale. 
We've mentioned before that our DC franchise has been one of our most important priorities at Warner's, and you can see the results not just at the box office but also in the 10 DC-based shows we have on TV; in the $4.5 billion consumers spent on DC merchandise last year, contributing to our record performance in consumer products; and finally in our hit video game franchises, including Injustice 2, which will release this coming May. 
Similar to Turner and HBO, Warner Bros. also continues to make strides in developing direct-to-consumer capabilities to serve its fans in today's evolving environment. We created the Warner Bros. Digital Networks division and we closed deals to buy Machinima, giving us a platform to connect to coveted and hard-to-reach young gamers, and DramaFever, which gives us the capability to launch and operate new over-the-top broadband VOD services. 
Across our company, we had a very active and successful year and we’re inspired by the future of media that we're helping to shape. As we've said many times before, connecting more directly with consumers as our businesses evolve, both within and outside the existing ecosystem, is one of our most important strategic priorities, and we're making a lot of progress. 
We believe our deal to be acquired by AT&T, which we announced on October 22, will further enhance our ability to innovate and thrive. A special meeting of shareholders to vote on the transaction will be held a week from today. The regulatory review process is underway, and we remain confident that the deal will be approved later this year. Once that happens, we're very excited about the potential of combining AT&T's great strength in mobile and video distribution and its fantastic customer relationships with the world's greatest storytelling and the value we can create together by accelerating the evolution of our company and our industries for the benefit of consumers. In the meantime, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to lead the industry both creatively and financially not just for 2017 but for many years to come. 
Thanks again for listening. And with that, let me turn it over to Howard."

Starting with consolidated results. We finished 2016 with a great fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11%, adjusted operating income was up a very strong 25% with growth across all divisions and adjusted EPS grew 18%. 
We also had strong results for the full year with revenue up 4%, adjusted operating income up 10% and each of our divisions posted record profits, leading to our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. 
Margins expanded over 100 basis points for the year even as we increased our investment in content and marketing across the company to over $15 billion. And we continue to remain focused on tightly managing overhead costs and operating efficiently to help fund these investments. 
Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $5.86 for the year, which included a $0.29 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change that we recognized in the third quarter. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a robust 17% to $5.57, led by our strong operating performance as well as a lower share count. 
In 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion of our stock prior to discontinuing share repurchases in October as a result of the pending merger with AT&T. And combined with our dividend, we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders during the year. 
So we delivered strong financial results in 2016 while continuing to make investments across our businesses to sustain attractive growth over the long term. And we expect to carry that momentum into 2017. 
Looking ahead, in order to better reflect our operating performance and given the volatility in certain below-the-line items that impact our adjusted EPS, we are providing 2017 guidance for adjusted operating income, which we expect will grow in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. I'll provide more context on the key drivers across our businesses throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segments. I'll start at Turner, where we closed out a record year with another quarter of strong profit growth as we continue to benefit from our domestic affiliate renewals. 
Subscription revenues increased 14% in the fourth quarter and were up 12% for the year, including a 150 basis point FX headwind. Domestic Subscription revenues grew 15% in the quarter, and we finished 2016 up over 14%, on the higher end of what we expected coming into the year. So we're really pleased with the outcome of our affiliate renewals, and we remain confident in our outlook for solid, double-digit domestic Subscription revenue growth in 2017. 
International Subscription revenue was up in the high single digits in the quarter, and that included a 300 basis points drag from FX. 
Advertising revenue was down 2% in the fourth quarter. That was a bit below our expectations because of a slowdown in certain international regions. As a result, international Advertising declined mid-single digits, excluding about a 350 basis point drag from FX. However, we still believe secular trends internationally remain strong. 
Domestically, we faced a 300 basis point headwind from the comparison to last year's record Major League Baseball postseason performance. Even so, Advertising was flat in the quarter. That capped off a strong year for domestic Advertising, which increased mid-single digits. The growth was led by the record performance at our news business as it benefited from the presidential election coverage, as well as healthy demand for our premium sports properties. 
Looking at the first quarter, we expect total Advertising revenue to be flat to up low single digits. The scatter market remained healthy with pricing up double digits versus the upfront at our domestic entertainment networks, and we expect our sports and news businesses to be the key drivers and international trends to improve. 
Moving on. Turner's strong revenue trends resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. And we achieved that while continuing to make significant investments at programming, marketing and new digital initiatives. 
Programming expenses were flat in the fourth quarter and up low single digits, excluding programming charges from both periods. For the full year, programming was up 5% primarily related to higher sports costs and CNN's election coverage. 
Marketing costs increased around 20% both for the quarter and the year as we invested in the rebrands at TNT and TBS, including support for our new original series. 
Overall, Turner delivered great financial results in 2016 and has a lot of operating momentum. And with the strength of our brands and the investments we're making across the business, we believe we're very well positioned to continue delivering attractive growth for the long term. 
Turning now to HBO, where our investments in high-quality programming contributed to double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter and have positioned HBO to capitalize on the big global opportunity for subscription services. 
Domestic Subscription revenue was up in the mid-single digits for the quarter and the year.  Similar to recent quarters, we continue to see subscriber headwinds at our traditional affiliates, especially those involved in M&A integration. As a result, despite very strong growth in digital subscribers, total domestic subs across HBO and Cinemax were essentially flat for the year. 
Looking forward, we believe HBO has a big untapped subscriber opportunity in the U.S., and capitalizing on that is our most important long-term growth driver. So on the deals we've recently signed, we're emphasizing subscriber growth. That means as our partners grow HBO subs, it will benefit our Subscription revenue growth. And while it takes time to implement new deals, we're very encouraged with the initial progress on the deals we've closed. However, finishing this affiliate cycle has taken longer than anticipated and we're still in the midst of renewing some deals. So we do not expect sequential improvement in Subscription revenue growth in the first quarter. But we do anticipate that sub-revenue trends will improve as the year progresses, especially in the second half of 2017, as we complete affiliate negotiations and continue to expand our digital distribution. We've seen a nice pickup in OTT sub growth recently, and our goal is to add more digital partners later this year. Along with a return to subscriber growth in our traditional business, that should contribute to a solid increase in total subs for the year. And taking all these factors into account, we anticipate high single-digit growth in Subscription revenue for the year. 
Moving on. Content and other revenues were up 7% for the quarter mainly due to higher home video revenue. For the year, content and other revenues grew 2%, primarily reflecting healthy growth in international licensing as demand for HBO's original content remains robust. 
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits for the year, excluding FX, and that's a result of strong trends in the Nordics and LatAm. 
Adjusted operating income was up 10% for the quarter and 3% for the year. 
Programming expenses declined 2% in the fourth quarter given the comparison to last year's programming charges. Excluding the charges from both periods and the benefit from reduced amortization this year, programming costs were up double digits in the quarter and the year. That's a result of our continued investments in original programming, including new series like Westworld, Divorce, The Night Of and Insecure. 
So we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016, and we have a lot of momentum on the content side. With global demand for HBO's distinctive premium content only growing and Subscription revenue trends improving, we're confident HBO can deliver healthy growth for years to come. 
Now looking at Warner Bros., where our theatrical business continues to perform exceptionally well, thanks to our franchise-led film slate. And that resulted in significant profit growth, including record adjusted operating income for both the quarter and the year. 
Coming into the year, we plan for theatrical to be the primary driver at Warner's, and that's exactly what played out. Our 2 DC movies and first Fantastic Beasts installment led a very strong, diverse slate that drove high single-digit growth in theatrical revenues in 2016. And we more than doubled theatrical profits, making this our most profitable film slate in close to a decade. 
The success of the film slate is also contributing to healthy growth in our consumer products business, where revenue increased close to 40% last year. So we're already benefiting from the new strategy we put in place and think we have a big opportunity to keep growing our consumer products business over the next few years. 
In TV, we had difficult comparisons on the licensing side, but total revenues were up in the quarter and for the year mainly due to double-digit growth in initial telecast revenue. That's a result of increased production, reflecting Warner's continued expansion at the cable, premium and SVOD production. Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong international licensing demand for Warner's TV content. 
As we discussed, we also had difficult comparisons in games after record results in 2015 and no franchise console releases last year. So as expected, revenues declined significantly. Looking to 2017, we have a strong lineup anchored by 2 franchise console releases and several mobile games. So we're set up for a great year in games. 
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down double digits for the year primarily due to fewer releases and a softer home video release schedule. But revenue did grow starting in the second half of 2016 as our franchise titles started to move into the home entertainment window. We also remain encouraged by EST, which was up double digits for the year. And digital now represents about half of our home entertainment profits. So we're encouraged as we head into 2017 when we expect to grow both home entertainment revenue and profits. 
Overall, Warner Bros. had another terrific year, thanks to great execution of it strategy focused on monetizing key global franchises across all its businesses. And with a tremendous multiyear film slate, healthy trends in the TV business and upcoming franchise games releases, Warner is positioned to deliver strong growth in its adjusted operating income in 2017 and beyond. 
Turning to the next slide. We also had a great year for free cash flow, which increased 22% to a record $4.4 billion. So we converted 94% of our earnings into cash, continuing our strong track record of conversion. We benefited from strong growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes related to the tax accounting change I mentioned earlier. 
Looking to 2017, while we certainly have difficult comparisons, especially on cash taxes, we expect strong conversion and another year of healthy free cash flow. 
Moving on to our balance sheet. We ended 2016 with $22.8 billion of net debt. That's up from 2015 mainly due to our share repurchases and dividends. It also reflects about $1 billion in debt redemption premiums and costs associated with our tender offers in December. We spent about $800 million on M&A for the year largely related to the investment at Hulu we made in August. So we ended the year right around our leverage target of 2.75x. And with share repurchases discontinued, we continue to expect our net leverage ratio to decline as we progress through 2017. 
So on the whole, we had a great year in 2016, and we believe we're set up for a strong 2017. And I'll touch on some of the key items for the year ahead. 
Starting at Turner. We anticipate solid double-digit domestic Subscription revenue growth as we continue to benefit from our affiliate renewals. At the same time, as we planned for, we expect programming costs to grow in the double digits primarily due to the new NBA deal, which will account for approximately $400 million of incremental costs in the first half of 2017. And similar to the past few years, Turner remains focused on constraining overhead costs to help fund these investments in great content and new growth opportunities. So that should add up to another year of healthy revenue trends and solid profit growth at Turner. 
At HBO, as I mentioned, we expect Subscription revenue growth to be in the high single digits in 2017. That growth should step up through the year as we complete additional affiliate deals, continue to make progress implementing our new deals and expand digital distribution. The improvement in Subscription revenue trends should translate to attractive adjusted operating income growth in 2017. 
At Warner's, we're also poised for healthy growth in adjusted operating income led by our theatrical and video game businesses. Our franchise slate continues in 2017 with 2 more DC films as well as the LEGO Batman Movie. And we expect other businesses like home entertainment, consumer products and TV licensing will benefit from a strong film slate and recent theatrical success. 
I already mentioned our strong game slate this year. We also continued to see healthy demand in our TV business and expect another year of solid results as we further expand production. 
So we're positioned to deliver attractive financial results at all of our businesses. And that's reflected in our expectation for 2017 adjusted operating income growth to be in the high single digits. 
Given the NBA deal costs in the first half, the timing of improvement in HBO's sub-revenue trends and the cadence of the film and game slate at Warner Bros., at this point we anticipate that growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 
Overall, we're very pleased about how we're executing across the company and the progress we're making on key initiatives. And we expect to deliver healthy growth in 2017 even as we continue to make important investments in high-quality video content and new business models that should position us for sustained attractive growth trends well into the future. 
With that, let me turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A."

You have new entrants coming in all the time, Amazon, Hulu, et cetera. Given the range of all of these things, I think it's safe to say that what they're going to help do is invigorate consumer interest everywhere in watching networks on demand, watching them on the go in mobile devices and a whole range of offerings, which is what, I think, we'd all like to see. And what that's doing is fueling production -- increases in production spending across the network industry. So terrific. And of course, Warner's, as the biggest supplier to all networks, is part of that. I think it's too early to say, if you're asking for timing, what the relative size of the virtual MVPD sub growth is, let's say, in '17 versus what the continued slope of the at-home ecosystem sub count turns out to be.

So that's important when you think about the guidance we've given for Subscription revenues. But certainly, there's an opportunity for that between DirecTV, now Sling and Sony. Each of them have really started to gain traction very recently, proving that there is consumer demand for smaller video packages with top networks at lower prices. I think if you aggregate the number of subscribers for the 3, we're approaching 2 million now in the United States. And if new OTT offerings can combine attractive pricing and packaging with great on-demand comment -- content, excuse me, better interfaces and easier navigation, we think that we can attract new subs into the ecosystem. And importantly, we think a lot of these subs are not cannibalizing existing subscribers. So that's a great opportunity for Turner to take share since we're in all the major virtual MVPDs that have launched to date, and we expect to be in those packages with wide consumer appeal."

Thank you for your question. The deals that we completed already, I think, are very indicative of why we're so encouraged and why we're looking optimistically and confidently to sub revenue acceleration in the second half of the year. Look, the blended penetration on the 2 deals that we completed is less than 50% of what the acquired company's penetration is. And we built incentives into those deals to drive that blended penetration up not only to where the acquired companies are, which are in the high 30s, low-40s, but beyond that. So as we look forward with those partners, the nature of the packaging, the nature of the marketing makes us very comfortable that we're going to see that sub acceleration, number one. Number two, in the deals -- couple deals that we have remaining, I think they, too, are going to see the opportunity before them to grow penetration beyond where they are now. And in some of our higher-performing affiliates, I think there's an opportunity to go even further. So we like the deals that we've completed. We'll finish the rest of our deals in the coming months. And I would say about our OTT business, it's very, very dynamic. It's actually 3x of the number that we reported at the end of '15. And I think that shows not only the robust demand for HBO but the opportunity we have out there not only in the traditional ecosystem but outside of it. So we're looking very confidently to this year. These deals take time. The integration takes time. In one of our major deals, they're just beginning to put us in to the packaging that we've codified into the deal at the end of this month. And so that's really what the lag is, but it will kick in, in the second half of the year."

So Mike, listen, I feel really confident in the sports that we're in. And if you look across the industry, ratings in general have improved recently as we've moved past the election, and we've seen better matchups and more competitive games. So I think that indicates that the declines that were occurring back in the summer and the early fall are not really necessarily indicative of a secular trend, and we're seeing very strong advertiser demand for both the NBA and the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship. So we continue to feel really good about our premium sports properties. But just to amplify one more thing, you can't forget about the importance of matchups and competitive games. And when we look at the season, whether it's Cleveland versus Golden State or Oklahoma versus the Clippers or the Lakers versus Portland, those games all performed extremely well with us growing year-over-year. So I think we're going to continue to hope for competitive games, but we love the advertiser demand, and we are optimistic that we're going to be able to continue to grow our ratings in these -- for these properties."

We think we're going to continue that in '17 when we look at what we have in '18 and '19, and we feel very good about it. We also feel that we could still grow in television. And while the growth won't occur primarily in broadcast, where we've been #1 for a long time, we do feel that there are opportunities in premium, in pay and in cable. And I feel really good about the fact that we did Westworld with HBO and Richard this year and Animal Kingdom with John. And we had some really big hits for Netflix with Fuller House and Gilmore Girls as well. So that is a business that we think that we can grow and continue to grow. Games, again, a business, while it's lumpy, we feel like we can create more sustainable pipeline as we get more to scale there. On the console side, we have 2 big console games this year, and it's our goal to be able to put out a more consistent path with those games but also grow mobile, which doesn't have that lumpiness. So if you look at those 3 big drivers in the content side, that creates opportunities for consumer products. And geography-wise, we think that there's a big opportunity in China. We continue to develop a SVOD service that's doing very well with our partner, Tencent, and we also believe that our partnership to create local language content as well as export content into China is going to create a big growth opportunity for the company in the coming years. So we think that we feel good about '17 and, more importantly, we feel about the growth trajectory going forward."

So we've been aggressively working with exhibitors to talk about models that will grow the market versus cannibalize the market, and we think that we're making a lot of progress on that end because ultimately, it's not really about the business model per se, but it's really about giving consumers what they want because if we don't give it to them, they're going to go to the pirated version. So this is very high on our list, and I think that it has the potential to change some of the economics of some of the films, the adult that we're having problems with right now on the theatrical side, which is really important for a company like ours that creates a real broad slate every year."

As Jeff said, it's the most watched year ever in the history of CNN. It's closer to FOX News than it's been in 8 years and have the greatest advantage over MSNBC since 2009. And the strategy this year, we fully expect that linear ratings for the entire year are not going to be able to stay at last year's record levels, so we could have some difficult advertising comps. But CNN still has great momentum, thanks to its strategy, which is multipronged. It's going in on -- it's going all in on covering big stories. It's adding originals. There'll be more hours of originals this year than in the past, which brings younger viewers to the network and usually garners big audiences. And it's investing in digital, which we expect is going to keep growing. It's been growing in ad revenue double digits. Digital now represents 25% of all of CNN's overall ad revenue. And last year, it had its best year ever, overtaking Yahoo! News. So I think CNN is positioned for another record year of profit growth in 2017. We're highly confident that we're going to be able to achieve that, and that's going to be led by a healthy increase in affiliate revenues and absolutely lower election-related expenses."

And as we look ahead to next year, we don't see any net benefit from that as we look ahead to 2017."

And then also, I just wanted to ask if you could comment just on the behavior that you've seen in terms of churn. Obviously, around big content releases like Game of Thrones or Westworld, you're going to see higher gross adds, and just curious if you can comment on what you've seen after people have consumed those series, whether they stick around?"

On churn, particularly over the last few months, we've seen the lowest churn in -- really since the beginning of introducing HBO NOW in our OTT product. That, I think, is a result of 2 things. Number one, as our subscriber base ages, there's, of course, less churn. Number two, I think it speaks to the quality of the content and the range of the content. I think it's important to remember when you look at the usage on digital platforms and on demand you see the usage going across a wide range of categories. It's not just Westworld and Game of Thrones and The Night Of, it's comedies, it's late night, it's documentaries, it's sports programming. It's important to punctuate that the usage of HBO programming is across a wide range of genres, and we're in the business, of course, of curating great content. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen on churn. Your question about investment, yes, we are going to take those margins and we are going to invest a lot of it in what we do for a living, which is trying to make the best content and curate the best content across a lot of different genres of our programming. And the exciting thing is the amount of talent that continues to come to the door with new projects literally on a weekly basis gives us no shortage, in fact, gives us better [indiscernible] to choose from. And we're very excited about the announcement that you'll see in the coming weeks for 2018, and the investment that we're going to make robustly in programming speaks to, I think, the best of the brand."

And for Jeff, there's been a lot of discussion on over-the-top and direct-to-consumer on this call and others in media. I was curious, do you look at the TV network business as ultimately continuing to be a regional business or developing into a global network business? And the reason I ask is there's an argument that TV networks are going global and direct-to-consumer and that those economics will be superior and more sustainable. And Netflix and Amazon are there. FOX is headed there quickly. You've got CNN globally, but many of your other networks are regional. So I was curious, how do you see the marketplace evolving, what it might mean, if anything, for Time Warner in that regard."

And as you see the development of that -- I know you were referencing some brands that started in the tech world, -- we -- if you think of something like either CNN or HBO and then you can expand that out to other networks, both -- things like CNN and HBO are global brands. They've got global distribution now. What we've been doing over the years is we've essentially tried to capitalize on these SVOD and linear network opportunities going global in terms of territory and going digital in terms of VOD across platforms. So not just TV but mobile devices. You're -- the bulk of people in India or Brazil are watching differently on different device setups than, say, those in Western Europe or the United States. So we've been pursuing essentially that strategy of distribution for our networks that optimizes the reach of whatever distribution is in place. If you look at -- so there's a combination. HBO is an easy way to describe it because it started VOD and it started more global distribution, as did CNN. So we've got places where HBO is over-the-top direct as a network. We just launched a few in Western Europe, Spain. We are launching in Latin America. We have things in Eastern Europe like that. We also have HBO in Western Europe licensed into other SVOD like Sky and other sorts of platforms if they have superior reach and can therefore get our programming, which is usually branded as HBO neighborhood programming. And it then creates a choice as time goes on of whether we decide to move to direct network full schedule or whether we continue to license to optimize the value of the network name and the programming associated with it. You've got examples of Turner doing that at FilmStruck. You've got examples of Warner's doing it in China with -- what are we, the second largest SVOD service in China?"

We continued our momentum into 2017 and delivered a strong first quarter that sets us up very well to achieve our goals for the year. Our results highlight not just our focus on being home to the world's best video content, but also on delivering that content to consumers in new ways and developing new revenue streams that will drive continued growth. 
For the quarter, revenues grew 6% to $7.7 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $2.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.66 a share. These results reflect the successful execution of the strategy we've discussed with you before, and which has served us and our shareholders very well. 
It's starts with investing in great content, whether it's drama like Big Little Lies on HBO, action films like Warner Bros.' Kong: Skull Island; comedy such as The Big Bang Theory and The Detour; sports like March Madness and NBA on Turner; news on CNN; or kids with properties like The LEGO Batman Movie and Powerpuff Girls on Cartoon Network. 
Another core part of our strategy is broadly distributing our content as we move decisively to connect more directly with consumers and to give them new and better ways to experience our content and brands. As you know, this consumer focus is an important strategic priority for us, and it's one of the key underpinnings of our merger with AT&T, which we remain on track to close by year-end. 
As we get closer to joining forces with AT&T, we're increasingly excited about the potential of our organizations to accelerate innovation together. And to do it across the entire media and entertainment industry in ways that will excite and benefit consumers in an area where video consumption is increasingly happening on demand and on multiple platforms. 
At the same time, we're focused on executing our business plans and doing what we do best. So let me share some recent highlights starting with Turner, where the tremendous value of our premium high-quality sports has been on display in the first part of the year. 
As I mentioned, we had another very successful presentation of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament across platforms, and that's in partnership with CBS, as you know. We posted record revenue, strong ratings growth and record digital performance. This year was the second most-watched NCAA Tournament in 23 years and viewership was up 16% over last year. 
And we've transitioned from March Madness right into the NBA playoffs on TNT, which kicked off a few weeks ago. 
We're already off to a great start with viewership through the first round of the playoffs that are up 9%, and we're very excited to be the exclusive home to the Eastern conference finals later this month. 
Our commitment to high-quality sports also extends overseas. Turner, in conjunction with Fox, recently announced its acquisition of the rights to 1st Division soccer in Argentina, further strengthening our leading position in Latin America. And so we're really pleased with our portfolio and the genre that resonates so passionately with both viewers and advertisers. 
Sports are what makes or part of what makes TNT and TBS attractive to audience, but so is Turner's increasing focus on whole exciting original series. At TBS, we continue to see the benefits of the content refresh we began about a year ago, reinforcing TBS as a preeminent comedy brand. Our returning shows are building on last year's momentum. The new seasons of Angie Tribeca and The Detour have each grown audiences by double digits from last season, and we've already green lit The Detour for season 3. 
And Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has built tremendous followings, almost doubling its audiences the debut early last year. And with that growth, Samantha Bee ranked as the #1 late-night show across all networks among adults 18 to 34 in the first quarter. 
We're earlier on in the content refresh at TNT where in coming months, we'll be rolling out new originals, including Will, that's a show about a young William Shakespeare, as well as 2 Warner Bros. production, the premiere of Claus and the return of Animal Kingdom for its second season. 
We also saw Adult Swim maintain its stronghold on millennial audiences. It's the #1 ad-supported cable network among adults 18 to 34 for the 36th consecutive quarter, that's 9 years. And there's already tremendous buzz for the return of one of Adult Swim's most popular shows, Rick and Morty later this year. 
Last month, we unveiled a new virtual reality experience based on the show that lets each of you live the adventures of Rick and Morty. That's a great example and now, we're focused on leveraging technology and building experience around our brands in ways that allow consumers to reach across platforms in a variety of devices and ways. 
CNN continues to build on its strength as a trusted source for news and analysis in a complex world, growing its total day ratings among adults 25 to 54 by 21% in the quarter and posting its most-watched first quarter since 2003. And CNN remains the undisputed leader in digital news, continuing to grow its multiplatform mix and its video starts by solid double digits. 
Turner is also one of the founding partners in OpenAP, that's a new platform announced last month that will make it easier and more efficient for advertisers to target audiences in a consistent way across TV networks and offer our partners important third-party verification. This is further evidence of Turner's innovation in the ad space and advanced advertising is an important area where combining with AT&T can accelerate our progress and improve our chance for success. 
Now moving over to Home Box Office. We continue to define what premium television means for the digital age with a mix of groundbreaking originals, Hollywood hits and a broad range of other distinctive program. 
Our limited series, Big Little Lies with a stellar cast including Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, was both a critical and a cultural breakout, averaging over 8 million viewers per episode. And the final season of The Leftovers, produced by Warner Bros., has also received tremendous critical acclaim and viewership for its premier episode grew 26% from last season. 
Other standouts in the quarter at HBO were Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which is having its most-watched season-to-date and Real Time with Bill Maher, where our viewership is up 22% this season. 
Last month, we also had much anticipated returns of new seasons of comedies, Veep and Silicon Valley, while Girls wrapped up its run with its most-watched season finale since Season 1. And we're already in development on 2 new projects with Lena Dunham, so we're excited building on the great success of Girls. 
We're now reporting the finishing touches on Season 7 of Game of Thrones, which returns in July. 
And later this year, we'll also premier The Dukes, a new drama from David Simon, creator of The Wire and that's set in the gritty streets of New York in the 1970s and '80s, and it stars James Franco. 
As I've mentioned before, HBO's originals are so good they can overshadow the powerful lineup of hit Hollywood movies that rounds out HBO's programming lineup. Thanks to our output deals with top studio like Warner Bros. 
In fact, Batman v Superman, The Legend of Tarzan and Suicide Squad, all three from Warner's, were the most viewed Saturday night film premieres on HBO over the past 6 months. 
And we continue to see big Hollywood hit films like Batman v Superman gross over 20 million viewers did during their initial run on HBO. 
So we're really pleased with the value that HBO bring to its subscribers and the exciting lineup that it has planned for the rest of 2017 and the years beyond. 
Now let's turn to our studio, Warner Bros., which remains the #1 supplier of broadcast television for the current season, which includes the strong results of our line up on the CW, where total viewing is up 16% this season across all CW platforms. 
On the film side at Warner's, the first quarter was highlighted by the strong global performance of Kong: Skull Island and The LEGO Batman Movie. And we're also very excited about Warner's slate for the rest of the year, which includes Dunkirk from legendary director, Christopher Nolan, and the next 2 installment on an our DC franchise, Wonder Woman comes to theaters June 2; and Justice League will hit theaters in the fall. 
As we did highlight before, our focus on franchises like DC Entertainment encompasses not just film and TV, but also consumer products and video games. 
And a great example of that is Injustice 2, which is set for release on May 16, and we anticipate will be one of the cornerstones of a very strong year for our games business. 
Finally, I want to update you on some of our efforts to furnace technology to directly reach audiences. 
Last month, Turner and Warner Bros. jointly launched a new kid's subscription VOD service under the Boomerang brand that features our company's deep library of iconic animated content as well as fresh, new originated animated fair that will debut weekly. 
And last week, Warner's announced its developing 2 series for a DC-branded over the top service we plan to launch next year. 
These are great examples of how we investing in both high-quality content as well as in the technology and new capabilities to make sure we get that content to consumers whenever and wherever they want. 
The Boomerang subscription VOD service and the upcoming DC Digital Products are both powered by DramaFever, which Warner's acquired last year. 
Similarly, we've been increasingly leveraging the capabilities of Ice Cream Planet, which Turner acquired in 2015, across a range of live sports properties including March Madness Live and NBA League Pass. 
Among our over-the-top offerings, the Boomerang service joins FilmStruck, our White House film service that Turner launched last year, Warner Archived and DramaFever, both at Warner Bros. and of course, HBO's over-the-top products, which continue to grow subscribers at a very healthy pace in the quarter. These all reflect our growing recognition of the importance of delivering great experiences to consumers alongside our great content and doing it across distribution channels. 
And so joining with AT&T will expand our capabilities in this area, allowing us to significantly accelerate our efforts to deliver consumers more innovative products. 
As you can see, we had a very active quarter, and we have a lot of momentum across our businesses. Thanks, again, for listening. And I'll turn it over to Howard."

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.

I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
We are up to our terrific start to 2017, posting our highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever as we continue to benefit from growing global demand for our high-quality content. Revenues grew 6% and adjusted operating income was up 7%. Total expenses increased 5% as we continue to make significant investments in content across our businesses, and that was partly balanced by our ongoing focus on constraining overhead cost. 
Adjusted EPS grew slightly faster at 11% and included an approximately $0.07 benefit from the adoption of new guidance on a tax accounting of equity-based compensation. So we've carried our operating momentum into 2017 and remain focused on executing our strategy. And we remain on track to deliver on the outlook for high single digit growth and adjusted operating income that we laid out at the start of the year, which I'll touch on more throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we continue to benefit from strong subscription revenue trends as we invest in great content, new capabilities and innovative business models to position the business for long-term success. 
Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, domestic affiliate revenue were up a robust 13%, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of domestic growth in the teens, and we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to be solidly in the double digits for the remainder of the year. 
International subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits with particular strength in Latin America. 
Total advertising decreased 2% and domestic advertising was down a similar amount, both below our expectations. That was in part because of some rating softness. 
In addition, during the NCAA Tournament, CBS fair games with more favorable matchups calling higher viewership than initially projected. 
And because of how we account for the NCAA deal, that resulted in Turner recognizing less ad revenue than anticipated related to the NCAA Tournament in the first quarter. But keep in mind, based on the structure of the collaborative arrangement with CBS, the shift in revenue recognition does not impact our bottom line. So this year's tournament was, again, very successful with strong ratings growth and record revenues across both linear and digital, further reinforcing the value of our premium sports portfolio. 
Moving on. International advertising was up in the mid-single digits and was also led by healthy growth in Latin America as well as in Europe. 
Turning to the second quarter. We've seen overall market demand moderate a bit relative to the strength we saw over the past year, although scatter pricing remains healthy. 
Looking specifically at Turner. We expect total advertising revenue to be down this quarter since we have approximately 700 basis point negative impact from the shift of the NCAA Final 4 and championship games from Turner to CBS. And excluding the NCAA shift, we expect total advertising revenue to be about flat in the quarter. 
Adjusted operating income was down 4%. That's a reflection of significantly higher programming costs, investments in new digital initiatives and higher marketing spend. 
Programming expenses grew 17% due to the increased costs associated with the first year of our new NBA deal and higher original programming expenses. 
And as we discussed, we expect the new NBA deal will also have a material impact on programming costs in the second quarter. Turner is set up to have another good year, and we're confident that the investments we're making across the business, combined with continued strong execution, make Turner well positioned to sustain how the growth trend long-term. 
Turning now to HBO where the strength of the brand and the global demand for its premium content translated into record quarterly profit and is contributing to solid subscriber growth year-to-date, setting HBO up for accelerating subscription revenue growth. 
Total subscription revenues increased 5% in the quarter right in line with our expectations. Domestics sub revenues were also up in the mid-single digits, similar to recent quarters. 
International subscription revenue increased in the double-digit as we benefited from healthy demand for our OTT products in Europe. 
Looking ahead, we're seeing better subscriber performance at our traditional distributors as we begin to benefit from our new affiliate deals, and we expect that to continue improving throughout the year. 
When combined with continues healthy growth for our OTT products and solid international trends, we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the high single digits in the second quarter and to remain strong throughout the year. So we're very confident in delivering the high single digit growth for the year that we previously discussed. 
Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter due to the timing of home entertainment releases. That was largely offset by healthy growth in international licensing revenues as demand for HBO's original content around the world remains robust. 
Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 22% in the quarter as total expenses declined 5%. That was related to lower distribution costs associated with a decline in home video revenue and lower programming expenses. Programming costs declined 2% as a result of the timing of the reduction in amortization, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the lower amortization, programming expenses would have been up high single digits as we continue to invest in new original content like Big Little Lies and the [indiscernible] as well as higher acquired programming expenses tied to the delivery of major theatrical titles. 
Overall, HBO was off to a great start to the year and with a strong pipeline of content and accelerating subscription revenue trends, HBO is set up for a very healthy growth in adjusted operating income in 2017. 
Moving on to Warner Bros. where we also had a tremendous first quarter with revenues up 8% and adjusted operating income increasing 20%, led by our TV and theatrical businesses. 
Revenues and associated profits in our TV business grew well into the double digits as we benefited from strong growth in licensing revenue related to a few catalog titles, including Friends and continuous healthy demand internationally. This reinforces the staying power and value of the biggest hits, which bodes well for Warner Bros. going forward as the leading producer of TV shows. 
The strong performance of global demand for hit content is also evident at theatrical business. In the first quarter, we benefited from the box office releases of The LEGO Batman Movie and Kong: Skull Island. We also posted strong home entertainment results with revenues up 15%, including over 40% growth in ASP. That was led by last year's franchise films with the Home Entertainment release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as well as carryover revenues from Suicide Squad. 
We expect to maintain the momentum in our theatrical business as our franchise release slate continues with Wonder Woman next month and Justice League later this year, and we should continue to see the benefit in Home Entertainment and TV licensing as these films move through those windows. 
Turning to games. We faced difficult comparisons in the quarter and we did not release any major console games. So as expected, revenues declined. But with 2 franchise console releases on this year's slate, starting with Injustice 2 later this month, we expect significant growth in our games business in 2017. 
So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is executing at a very high level. And with its strong franchise theatrical and games slates combined with healthy trends in the TV business, Warner is positioned to deliver another year of strong adjusted operating income growth. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter almost doubled compared to last year totaling close to $1.4 billion. In addition to the growth in adjusted operating income, working capital was a significantly lower use of cash in the quarter. Working capital benefited from the positive impact to accounts receivable from the strong performance of Warner Bros. theatrical and home entertainment slate in the fourth quarter as well as the timing of production spend. So we had a strong first quarter of cash generation, and we expect another year of healthy free cash flow. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $21.8 billion of net debt, down about $1 billion compared to the end of 2016. That's primarily result of our strong free cash flow generation. 
As a result, our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6x, lower a target leverage ratio of 2.75x, and we expect our leverage ratio will continue to fall through the year as a result of this continuing share repurchases in connection with entering into the merger agreement with AT&T. 
So overall, we're very pleased with our strong financial results in the first quarter, and that keeps is on pace for the outlook we laid out in February for full year adjusted operating income growth in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. We continue to expect growth for the remainder of 2017 to be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of expenses at Turner. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter. As we plan for, Turner will see the biggest impact related to its new contract with the NBA, and we expect that to contribute to total programming cost growth of approximately 20%. 
We also plan to continue investing in new digital initiatives, including the Boomerang-branded SVOD service we recently launched and in marketing to support upcoming original programming like Season 2 of Animal Kingdom and the debuts of Claus and Will on TNT. 
So as a result of these factors, we expect adjusted operating income to decline in the second quarter for both Turner and the total company with both returning to very healthy growth in the second half of the year. 
Overall, we continue to make great progress in our key strategic initiatives across the company, and we're confident that with our continued investments in high-quality content and new digital initiatives in business models, we're well positioned to specific sustain our momentum and deliver strong financial results in 2017 and for many years to come.

Listen, let me begin by saying that I and the Turner team remains pretty optimistic about the health of the overall U.S. ad market for the full year, but I think there are a few factors to consider. So let me just go through them, and I'll do it reasonably quickly. I mean, not to repeat everything the Howard just said, but while the news category for the second quarter remains incredibly, incredibly strong, we have seen -- particularly in the beginning of the quarter somewhat of a moderation and a bit of a strength as compared to the year ago. And we think there's a few factors that our contributing into that. Given some uncertainty in the economy, we think that advertisers are holding back a little bit and they're taking a little bit more of a wait-and-see approach. And in addition, a number of large advertisers saw fewer product launches early in the year which have impacted categories like tech autos and pharma, which was stronger year ago. So I think that it's probably more timing-related as opposed to something that's purely cyclical. We've seen the market moving cycles, but given the reach of TV and our innovative targeting products and high-quality programming lineup, we continue to believe we're pretty well positioned. And also I think interestingly enough, in the most recent weeks, as we get deeper into the quarter, we have seen the entertainment marketplace actually improve modestly as compared to what it look like in the beginning of the second quarter, and we're experiencing elevated level of activities with continuing strong pricing. The sports marketplace is a little bit fragmented. There's a lot of inventory, and the heightened political climate continues to benefit CNN, resulting in news market moving early and there's a lot of demand. I mean, the last thing I would say -- because I just listed through a prime bunch of stuff, so I apologize if I just ramble through it. This time in the year, we always see postering a position going into the upfront. So we expect the upfront is going to be healthy. And I think it's hard, particularly in the second quarter to look at as being a sustainable trend because I think a lot of advertisers are looking at the budgets and figuring out how to run a play in the upfront. So we continue to remain optimistic, and we don't see anything that's going to be problematic for us, and we're going to continue to try to lead the industry with our innovative ad products to try to take much share as we can."

For those who may not realize what audience buying is it essential is going to be a big boom to our industry overtime because it will essentially us daypart-agnostic, demo-agnostic and network-agnostic, which we think is going to be critical to move the business forward. The OpenAP platform provides advertisers with a standardized way to create audience-based targets and reporting through an independent third party. So OpenAP is going to make it more efficient for advertisers to buy audience targeting products at scale across programmers and increases transparency and verification, something the advertising community has been asking for, which has been a shortcoming frankly of a lot of the digital companies. So far early days, it's received an incredibly positive response from the ad community and combined with the benefits of our advanced products, we think this initiative is really going to help accelerate advertising."

Overall, we've been talking about how increasingly the consumer experience is critical for us to be able to compete against particularly all platforms and starting with TNT's Good Behavior and Animal Kingdom last year and going forward all of our new original is on TNT are going to have limited commercial interruption. The goal is to offer a much, much more engaging viewer experience and an ad experience for consumers that adds more value for advertising partners. And so far the results are very, very encouraging. More viewers are watching through the ad rates, our research indicates higher consumer satisfaction, brand awareness and ad recall are up, so we're delivering more value to our partners and viewers. And separately, starting in the fourth quarter of last year, we reduced our ad loads on truTV in half, it's been extremely well received by advertisers, and we're seeing better and higher pricing so the change has been essentially revenue-neutral, which we see as a positive. But we expect to continue to experiment more and more with ad loads over time."

So if new offerings can combine that kind of attractive pricing and packaging with the sort of new 21st century on demand platforms interfaces and so on, then we think they can definitely attract new subs into the network system, and that's a great opportunity for Turner and every other network to find its natural audience.

I think in the way you asked the question, you almost sort of gave me the answer, which is, as we look across the landscape and I've been pretty outspoken over the last number of years that there's a lot of networks that are in existence today that add no value to consumers, yet get paid affiliate fees and in a perfectly competitive market, those are eventually going to go away. That will be good for us. We have 10 network brands, we have way of the top 10 for the top 20, truTV has grown five quarters in a row in ratings. I think we've got an incredibly popular networks and the most concentrated portfolio of popular networks in the United States. I don't see any need for further consolidation. I think other network groups are going to need to consolidate. And as it relates to TNT, I'm really optimistic about the rebranding efforts that Kevin Reilly and the team, Aubrey are are doing with TNT. I think last year was the really big rebrand year for TBS and I couldn't be more pleased with how successful that's going and to reiterate what Jeff said in his proactive remarks, we're seeing returning shows actually grow ratings year-on-year, which you're not seeing a lot and the television landscape. Anything that's a testament to the quality of shows themselves plus the way that we've marketed them. And this year, you're going to see a number of really distinctive, unique dramas on TNT that will be a bit of a departure from the type of original programs that we're on in the past. They're going to have a much more distinctive voice, they will probably be much more even between male-female and bringing younger audiences. And we want TNT to be the place where people want to go to see great distinctive voice dramas, drama category is very crowded, but I think we've got a great opportunity, we've got scale, and we've got lead position."

We continued our momentum into 2017 and delivered a strong first quarter that sets us up very well to achieve our goals for the year. Our results highlight not just our focus on being",1786,"Thanks, Jessica, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. 
We continued our momentum into 2017 and delivered a strong first quarter that sets us up very well to achieve our goals for the year. Our results highlight not just our focus on being home to the world's best video content, but also on delivering that content to consumers in new ways and developing new revenue streams that will drive continued growth. 
For the quarter, revenues grew 6% to $7.7 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $2.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.66 a share. These results reflect the successful execution of the strategy we've discussed with you before, and which has served us and our shareholders very well. 
It starts with investing in great content, whether it's drama like Big Little Lies on HBO; action films like Warner Bros.' Kong: Skull Island; comedy such as The Big Bang Theory and The Detour; sports like March Madness and the NBA on Turner; news on CNN; or kids with properties like The LEGO Batman Movie and Powerpuff Girls on Cartoon Network. 
Another core part of our strategy is broadly distributing our content as we move decisively to connect more directly with consumers and to give them new and better ways to experience our content and brands. As you know, this consumer focus is an important strategic priority for us, and it's one of the key underpinnings of our merger with AT&T, which we remain on track to close by year-end. 
As we get closer to joining forces with AT&T, we're increasingly excited about the potential of our organizations to accelerate innovation together, and to do it across the entire media and entertainment industry in ways that will excite and benefit consumers in an area where video consumption is increasingly happening on demand and on multiple platforms. 
At the same time, we're focused on executing our business plans and doing what we do best. So let me share some recent highlights starting with Turner, where the tremendous value of our premium high-quality sports has been on display in the first part of the year. 
As I mentioned, we had another very successful presentation of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament across platforms, and that's in partnership with CBS, as you know. We posted record revenue, strong ratings growth and record digital performance. This year was the second most-watched NCAA Tournament in 23 years and viewership was up 16% over last year. 
And we've transitioned from March Madness right into the NBA playoffs on TNT, which kicked off a few weeks ago. 
We're already off to a great start with viewership through the first round of the playoffs, that are up 9%. And we're very excited to be the exclusive home to the Eastern Conference Finals later this month. 
Our commitment to high-quality sports also extends overseas. Turner, in conjunction with Fox, recently announced its acquisition of the rights to First Division soccer in Argentina, further strengthening our leading position in Latin America. And so we're really pleased with our portfolio and the genre that resonates so passionately with both viewers and advertisers. 
Sports are what makes or part of what makes TNT and TBS attractive to audience, but so is Turner's increasing focus on old exciting original series. At TBS, we continue to see the benefits of the content refresh we began about a year ago, reinforcing TBS as a preeminent comedy brand. Our returning shows are building on last year's momentum. The new seasons of Angie Tribeca and The Detour have each grown audiences by double digits from last season, and we've already green lit The Detour for season 3. 
The Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has built tremendous followings, almost doubling its audience since the debut early last year. And with that growth, Samantha Bee ranked as the #1 late-night show across all networks among adults 18 to 34 in the first quarter. 
We're earlier on in the content refresh at TNT, where in coming months we'll be rolling out new originals, including Will, that's a show about a young William Shakespeare, as well as 2 Warner Bros. production, the premiere of Claus and the return of Animal Kingdom for its second season.
We also saw Adult Swim maintain its stronghold on millennial audiences. It's the #1 ad-supported cable network among adults 18 to 34 for the 36th consecutive quarter, that's 9 years. And there's already tremendous buzz for the return of one of Adult Swim's most popular shows, Rick and Morty later this year. Last month, we unveiled a new virtual reality experience based on the show that lets each of you live the adventures of Rick and Morty. That's a great example, and now we're focused on leveraging technology and building experience around our brands in ways that allow consumers to reach across platforms in a variety of devices and ways. 
CNN continues to build on its strength as a trusted source for news and analysis in a complex world, growing its total day ratings among adults 25 to 54 by 21% in the quarter and posting its most-watched first quarter since 2003. And CNN remains the undisputed leader in digital news, continuing to grow its multiplatform uniques and its video starts by solid double digits. 
Turner is also one of the founding partners in OpenAP, that's a new platform announced last month that will make it easier and more efficient for advertisers to target audiences in a consistent way across TV networks and offer our partners important third-party verification. This is further evidence of Turner's innovation in the ad space, and advanced advertising is an important area where combining with AT&T can accelerate our progress and improve our chance for success. 
Now moving over to Home Box Office. We continue to define what premium television means for the digital age with a mix of groundbreaking originals, Hollywood hits and a broad range of other distinctive program. 
Our limited series, Big Little Lies with a stellar cast including Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, was both a critical and a cultural breakout, averaging over 8 million viewers per episode. And the final season of The Leftovers, produced by Warner Bros., has also received tremendous critical acclaim and viewership for its premier episode grew 26% from last season. 
Other standouts in the quarter at HBO were Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which is having its most-watched season to date and Real Time with Bill Maher, where our viewership is up 22% this season. 
Last month, we also had much-anticipated returns of new seasons of comedies Veep and Silicon Valley, while Girls wrapped up its run with its most-watched season finale since Season 1. And we're already in development on 2 new projects with Lena Dunham, so we're excited building on the great success of Girls. 
We're now putting the finishing touches on Season 7 of Game of Thrones, which returns in July. 
And later this year, we'll also premier The Deuce, a new drama from David Simon, creator of The Wire, and that's set in the gritty streets of New York in the 1970s and '80s, and it stars James Franco. 
As I've mentioned before, HBO's originals are so good they can overshadow the powerful lineup of hit Hollywood movies that rounds out HBO's programming lineup. Thanks to our output deals with top studios like Warner Bros. 
In fact, Batman v Superman, The Legend of Tarzan and Suicide Squad, all three from Warner's, were the most viewed Saturday-night film premieres on HBO over the past 6 months. 
And we continue to see big Hollywood hit films like Batman v Superman gross over 20 million viewers did -- during their initial run on HBO. 
So we're really pleased with the value that HBO bring to its subscribers and the exciting lineup that it has planned for the rest of 2017 and the years beyond. 
Now let's turn to our studio, Warner Bros., which remains the #1 supplier of broadcast television for the current season, which includes the strong results of our lineup on the CW, where total viewing is up 16% this season across all CW platforms. 
On the film side at Warner's, the first quarter was highlighted by the strong global performance of Kong: Skull Island and The LEGO Batman Movie. And we're also very excited about Warner's slate for the rest of the year, which includes Dunkirk from legendary director Christopher Nolan. And the next 2 installments in our DC franchise: Wonder Woman comes to theaters June 2, and Justice League will hit theaters in the fall. 
As we did highlight before, our focus on franchises like DC Entertainment encompasses not just film and TV, but also consumer products and video games. And a great example of that is Injustice 2, which is set for release on May 16, and we anticipate it will be one of the cornerstones of a very strong year for our games business. 
Finally, I want to update you on some of our efforts to furnace technology to directly reach audiences. Last month, Turner and Warner Bros. jointly launched a new kid's subscription VOD service under the Boomerang brand that features our company's deep library of iconic animated content as well as fresh, new originated animated fair that will debut weekly. 
And last week, Warner's announced its developing 2 series for a DC-branded over-the-top service we plan to launch next year. 
These are great examples of how we're investing in both high-quality content as well as in the technology and new capabilities to make sure we get that content to consumers wherever and whenever they want. 
The Boomerang subscription VOD service and the upcoming DC digital products are both powered by DramaFever, which Warner's acquired last year. 
Similarly, we've been increasingly leveraging the capabilities of iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired in 2015, across a range of live sports properties including March Madness Live and NBA League Pass. 
Among our over-the-top offerings, the Boomerang service joins FilmStruck, our arthouse film service that Turner launched last year, Warner Archive and DramaFever, both at Warner Bros. and of course, HBO's over-the-top products, which continue to grow subscribers at a very healthy pace in the quarter. These all reflect our growing recognition of the importance of delivering great experiences to consumers alongside our great content and doing it across distribution channels. 
And so joining with AT&T will expand our capabilities in this area, allowing us to significantly accelerate our efforts to deliver consumers more innovative products. 
As you can see, we had a very active quarter, and we have a lot of momentum across our businesses. Thanks, again, for listening, and I'll turn it over to Howard."
24689,424207541,1187656,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. We are off to a terrific start to 2017, posting our highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever as we continue",1725,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
We are off to a terrific start to 2017, posting our highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever as we continue to benefit of growing global demand for our high-quality content. Revenues grew 6% and adjusted operating income was up 7%. Total expenses increased 5% as we continue to make significant investments in content across our businesses, and that was partly balanced by our ongoing focus on constraining overhead cost. 
Adjusted EPS grew slightly faster at 11% and included an approximately $0.07 benefit from the adoption of new guidance on a tax accounting of equity-based compensation. So we've carried our operating momentum into 2017 and remain focused on executing our strategy, and we remain on track to deliver on the outlook for high single-digit growth and adjusted operating income that we laid out at the start of the year, which I'll touch on more throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we continue to benefit from strong subscription revenue trends as we invest in great content, new capabilities and innovative business models to position the business for long-term success. 
Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, domestic affiliate revenue were up a robust 13%, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of domestic growth in the teens, and we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to be solidly in the double digits for the remainder of the year. 
International subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits, with particular strength in Latin America. 
Total advertising decreased 2% and domestic advertising was down a similar amount, both below our expectations. That was in part because of some rating softness. 
In addition, during the NCAA Tournament, CBS aired games with more favorable matchups calling higher viewership than we initially projected. And because of how we account for the NCAA deal, that resulted in Turner recognizing less ad revenue than anticipated related to the NCAA Tournament in the first quarter. But keep in mind, based on the structure of the collaborative arrangement with CBS, the shift in revenue recognition does not impact our bottom line. So this year's tournament was again very successful, with strong ratings growth and record revenues across both linear and digital, further reinforcing the value of our premium sports portfolio. 
Moving on. International advertising was up in the mid-single digits and was also led by healthy growth in Latin America as well as in Europe. 
Turning to the second quarter, we've seen overall market demand moderate a bit relative to the strength we saw over the past year, although scatter pricing remains healthy. 
Looking specifically at Turner, we expect total advertising revenue to be down this quarter since we have an approximately 700 basis point negative impact from the shift of the NCAA Final Four and championship games from Turner to CBS. And excluding the NCAA shift, we expect total advertising revenue to be about flat in the quarter. 
Adjusted operating income was down 4%. That's a reflection of significantly higher programming costs, investments in new digital initiatives and higher marketing spend. 
Programming expenses grew 17% due to the increased costs associated with the first year of our new NBA deal and higher original programming expenses. 
And as we've discussed, we expect the new NBA deal will also have a material impact on programming costs in the second quarter. Turner is set up to have another good year, and we're confident that the investments we're making across the business, combined with continued strong execution, leave Turner well positioned to sustain healthy growth trend long-term. 
Turning now to HBO, where the strength of the brand and the global demand for its premium content translated into record quarterly profit and is contributing to solid subscriber growth year-to-date, setting HBO up for accelerating subscription revenue growth. 
Total subscription revenues increased 5% in the quarter, right in line with our expectations. Domestics sub revenues were also up in the mid-single digits, similar to recent quarters. 
International subscription revenue increased in the double-digit as we benefited from healthy demand for our OTT products in Europe. 
Looking ahead, we're seeing better subscriber performance at our traditional distributors as we begin to benefit from our new affiliate deals, and we expect that to continue improving throughout the year. 
When combined with continuous healthy growth for our OTT products and solid international trends, we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the high single digits in the second quarter and to remain strong throughout the year. So we're very confident in delivering the high single-digit growth for the year that we previously discussed. 
Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter due to the timing of home entertainment releases. That was largely offset by healthy growth in international licensing revenues as demand for HBO's original content around the world remains robust. 
Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 22% in the quarter as total expenses declined 5%. That was related to lower distribution costs associated with the decline in home video revenue and lower programming expenses. Programming cost declined 2% as a result of the timing of the reduction in amortization, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the lower amortization, programming expenses would have been up high single digits as we continue to invest in new original content like Big Little Lies and The Young Pope as well as higher acquired programming expenses tied to the delivery of major theatrical titles. 
Overall, HBO was off to a great start to the year. And with a strong pipeline of content and accelerating subscription revenue trends, HBO is set up for a very healthy growth in adjusted operating income in 2017. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where we also had a tremendous first quarter with revenues up 8% and adjusted operating income increasing 20%, led by our TV and theatrical businesses. 
Revenues and associated profits in our TV business grew well into the double digits as we benefited from strong growth in licensing revenue related to a few catalog titles, including Friends, and continuous healthy demand internationally. This reinforces the staying power and value of the biggest hits, which bodes well for Warner Bros. going forward as the leading producer of TV shows. 
The strong performance and the global demand for hit contents is also evident at the theatrical business. In the first quarter, we benefited from the box office releases of The LEGO Batman Movie and Kong: Skull Island. We also posted strong home entertainment results, with revenues up 15% including over 40% growth in ESP. That was led by last year's franchise films with the Home Entertainment release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as well as carryover revenues from Suicide Squad. 
We expect to maintain the momentum in our theatrical business as our franchise release slate continues with Wonder Woman next month and Justice League later this year, and we should continue to see the benefit in Home Entertainment and TV licensing as these films move through those windows. 
Turning to games. We faced difficult comparisons in the quarter and we did not release any major console games. So as expected, revenues declined. But with 2 franchise console releases on this year's slate, starting with Injustice 2 later this month, we expect significant growth in our games business in 2017. 
So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is executing at a very high level. And with its strong franchise-led theatrical and games slates combined with healthy trends in the TV business, Warner is positioned to deliver another year of strong adjusted operating income growth. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter almost doubled compared to last year, totaling close to $1.4 billion. In addition to the growth in adjusted operating income, working capital was a significantly lower use of cash in the quarter. Working capital benefited from the positive impact to accounts receivable from the strong performance of Warner Bros. theatrical and Home Entertainment slate in the fourth quarter as well as the timing of production spend. So we had a strong first quarter of cash generation, and we expect another year of healthy free cash flow. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $21.8 billion of net debt, down about $1 billion compared to the end of 2016. That's primarily result of our strong free cash flow generation. 
As a result, our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6x, below our target leverage ratio of 2.75x, and we expect our leverage ratio will continue to fall through the year as a result of discontinuing share repurchases in connection with entering into the merger agreement with AT&T. 
So overall, we're very pleased with our strong financial results in the first quarter, and that keeps us on pace for the outlook we laid out in February for full year adjusted operating income growth in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. We continue to expect growth for the remainder of 2017 to be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of expenses at Turner. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter. As we plan for, Turner will see the biggest impact related to its new contract with the NBA, and we expect that to contribute to total programming cost growth of approximately 20%. 
We also plan to continue investing in new digital initiatives, including the Boomerang-branded SVOD service we recently launched, and in marketing to support upcoming original programming like Season 2 of Animal Kingdom and the debuts of Claws and Will on TNT. 
So as a result of these factors, we expect adjusted operating income to decline in the second quarter for both Turner and the total company, with both returning to very healthy growth in the second half of the year. 
Overall, we continue to make great progress on our key strategic initiatives across the company, and we are confident that with our continued investments in high-quality content and new digital initiatives in business models, we're well positioned to sustain our momentum and deliver strong financial results in 2017 and for many years to come. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jessica for Q&A."

Listen, let me begin by saying that I and the Turner team remains pretty optimistic about the health of the overall U.S. ad market for the full year, but I think there are a few factors to consider. So let me just go through them, and I'll do it reasonably quickly. I mean, not to repeat everything the Howard just said, but while the news category in the second quarter remains incredibly, incredibly strong, we have seen, particularly in the beginning of the quarter, somewhat of a moderation and a bit of a strength as compared to the year ago. And we think there's a few factors that our contributing to that. Given some uncertainty in the economy, we think that advertisers are holding back a little bit and they're taking a little bit more of a wait-and-see approach. And in addition, a number of large advertisers saw fewer product launches early in the year which have impacted categories like tech, autos and pharma, which was stronger a year ago. So I think that it's probably more timing-related as opposed to something that's purely cyclical. We've seen the market moving cycles, but given the reach of TV and our innovative targeting products and high-quality programming lineup, we continue to believe we're pretty well positioned. And also I think -- interestingly enough, in the most recent weeks, as we get deeper into the quarter, we have seen the entertainment marketplace actually improve modestly as compared to what it looked like in the beginning of the second quarter, and we're experiencing elevated level of activities with continuing strong pricing. The sports marketplace is a little bit fragmented, there's a lot of inventory. And the heightened political climate continues to benefit CNN, resulting in news market moving early and there's a lot of demand. I mean, the last thing I would say -- because I just listed through a bunch of stuff, so I apologize if I just rambled through it. This time of the year, we always see postering a position in going into the upfront. So we expect the upfront is going to be healthy. But -- and I think it's hard, particularly in the second quarter, to look at as being a sustainable trend because I think a lot of advertisers are looking at their budgets and figuring out how they want to play in the upfront. So we continue to remain optimistic, and we don't see anything that's going to be problematic for us. And we're going to continue to try to lead the industry with our innovative ad products to try to take as much share as we can."

And it achieves 2 things that we hope are going to facilitate the adoption of audience-based ad buying. For those who may not realize what audience-based ad buying is, it essential is going to be a big boom to our industry over time because it will essentially make us daypart-agnostic, demo-agnostic and network-agnostic, which we think is going to be critical to move the business forward. The OpenAP platform provides advertisers with a standardized way to create audience-based targets and reporting through an independent third party. So OpenAP is going to make it more efficient for advertisers to buy audience targeting products at scale across programmers and increase this transparency and verification, something the advertising community has been asking for, which has been a shortcoming, frankly, of a lot of the digital companies. So far early days, it's received an incredibly positive response from the ad community. And combined with the benefits of our advanced products, we think this initiative is really going to help accelerate advertising."

Overall, we've been talking about how increasingly the consumer experience is critical for us to be able to compete against, particularly, all platforms. And starting with TNT's Good Behavior and Animal Kingdom, last year and going forward, all of our new originals on TNT are going to have limited commercial interruption. The goal is to offer a much, much more engaging viewer experience and an ad experience for consumers that adds more value for advertising partners. And so far the results are very, very encouraging. More viewers are watching through the ad breaks. Our research indicates higher consumer satisfaction, brand awareness and ad recall are up. So we're delivering more value to our partners and viewers. And separately, starting in the fourth quarter of last year, we reduced our ad loads on truTV in half, and it's been extremely well received by advertisers, and we're seeing better and higher pricing. So the change has been essentially revenue-neutral, which we see as a positive. And we expect to continue to experiment more and more with ad loads over time."

I think in the way you asked the question, you almost sort of gave me the answer, which is, as we look across the landscape -- and I've been pretty outspoken over the last number of years that there's a lot of networks that are in existence today that add no value to consumers yet get paid affiliate fees. And in a perfectly competitive market, those are eventually going to go away. That will be good for us. We have 10 network brands, we have 3 of the top 10, 4 of the top 20, truTV has grown five quarters in a row its ratings. I think we've got an incredibly popular networks and the most concentrated portfolio of popular networks in the United States. I don't see any need for further consolidation. I think other network groups are going to need to consolidate. And as it relates to TNT, I'm really optimistic about the rebranding efforts that Kevin Reilly and the team, Sarah Aubrey are doing with TNT. I think last year was the really big rebrand year for TBS, and I couldn't be more pleased with how successful that's going. And to reiterate what Jeff said in his proactive remarks, we're seeing returning shows actually grow ratings year-on-year, which you're not seeing a lot in the television landscape. And I think that's a testament to the quality of shows themselves plus the way that we've marketed them. And this year, you're going to see a number of really distinctive, unique dramas on TNT that will be a bit of a departure from the type of original programs that were on in the past. They're going to have a much more distinctive voice, they will probably be much more even between male-female and they'll bring in younger audiences. And we want TNT to be the place where people want to go to see great distinctive voice dramas. Drama category is very crowded, but I think we've got a great opportunity, we've got scale and we've got lead position."

We continued our momentum into 2017 and delivered a strong first quarter that sets us up very well to achieve our goals for the year. Our results highlight not just our focus on being",1786,"Thanks, Jessica, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. 
We continued our momentum into 2017 and delivered a strong first quarter that sets us up very well to achieve our goals for the year. Our results highlight not just our focus on being home to the world's best video content, but also on delivering that content to consumers in new ways and developing new revenue streams that will drive continued growth. 
For the quarter, revenues grew 6% to $7.7 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $2.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.66 a share. These results reflect the successful execution of the strategy we've discussed with you before, and which has served us and our shareholders very well. 
It starts with investing in great content, whether it's drama like Big Little Lies on HBO; action films like Warner Bros.' Kong: Skull Island; comedy such as The Big Bang Theory and The Detour; sports like March Madness and the NBA on Turner; news on CNN; or kids with properties like The LEGO Batman Movie and Powerpuff Girls on Cartoon Network. 
Another core part of our strategy is broadly distributing our content as we move decisively to connect more directly with consumers and to give them new and better ways to experience our content and brands. As you know, this consumer focus is an important strategic priority for us, and it's one of the key underpinnings of our merger with AT&T, which we remain on track to close by year-end. 
As we get closer to joining forces with AT&T, we're increasingly excited about the potential of our organizations to accelerate innovation together, and to do it across the entire media and entertainment industry in ways that will excite and benefit consumers in an area where video consumption is increasingly happening on demand and on multiple platforms. 
At the same time, we're focused on executing our business plans and doing what we do best. So let me share some recent highlights starting with Turner, where the tremendous value of our premium high-quality sports has been on display in the first part of the year. 
As I mentioned, we had another very successful presentation of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament across platforms, and that's in partnership with CBS, as you know. We posted record revenue, strong ratings growth and record digital performance. This year was the second most-watched NCAA Tournament in 23 years and viewership was up 16% over last year. 
And we've transitioned from March Madness right into the NBA playoffs on TNT, which kicked off a few weeks ago. 
We're already off to a great start with viewership through the first round of the playoffs, that are up 9%. And we're very excited to be the exclusive home to the Eastern Conference Finals later this month. 
Our commitment to high-quality sports also extends overseas. Turner, in conjunction with Fox, recently announced its acquisition of the rights to First Division soccer in Argentina, further strengthening our leading position in Latin America. And so we're really pleased with our portfolio and the genre that resonates so passionately with both viewers and advertisers. 
Sports are what makes or part of what makes TNT and TBS attractive to audience, but so is Turner's increasing focus on old exciting original series. At TBS, we continue to see the benefits of the content refresh we began about a year ago, reinforcing TBS as a preeminent comedy brand. Our returning shows are building on last year's momentum. The new seasons of Angie Tribeca and The Detour have each grown audiences by double digits from last season, and we've already green lit The Detour for season 3. 
The Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has built tremendous followings, almost doubling its audience since the debut early last year. And with that growth, Samantha Bee ranked as the #1 late-night show across all networks among adults 18 to 34 in the first quarter. 
We're earlier on in the content refresh at TNT, where in coming months we'll be rolling out new originals, including Will, that's a show about a young William Shakespeare, as well as 2 Warner Bros. production, the premiere of Claus and the return of Animal Kingdom for its second season.
We also saw Adult Swim maintain its stronghold on millennial audiences. It's the #1 ad-supported cable network among adults 18 to 34 for the 36th consecutive quarter, that's 9 years. And there's already tremendous buzz for the return of one of Adult Swim's most popular shows, Rick and Morty later this year. Last month, we unveiled a new virtual reality experience based on the show that lets each of you live the adventures of Rick and Morty. That's a great example of how we're focused on leveraging technology and building experience around our brands in ways that allow consumers to reach across platforms in a variety of devices and ways. 
CNN continues to build on its strength as a trusted source for news and analysis in a complex world, growing its total day ratings among adults 25 to 54 by 21% in the quarter and posting its most-watched first quarter since 2003. And CNN remains the undisputed leader in digital news, continuing to grow its multiplatform uniques and its video starts by solid double digits. 
Turner is also one of the founding partners in OpenAP, that's a new platform announced last month that will make it easier and more efficient for advertisers to target audiences in a consistent way across TV networks and offer our partners important third-party verification. This is further evidence of Turner's innovation in the ad space, and advanced advertising is an important area where combining with AT&T can accelerate our progress and improve our chance for success. 
Now moving over to Home Box Office. We continue to define what premium television means for the digital age with a mix of groundbreaking originals, Hollywood hits and a broad range of other distinctive program. 
Our limited series, Big Little Lies with a stellar cast including Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, was both a critical and a cultural breakout, averaging over 8 million viewers per episode. And the final season of The Leftovers, produced by Warner Bros., has also received tremendous critical acclaim and viewership for its premier episode grew 26% from last season. 
Other standouts in the quarter at HBO were Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which is having its most-watched season to date and Real Time with Bill Maher, where our viewership is up 22% this season. 
Last month, we also had much-anticipated returns of new seasons of comedies Veep and Silicon Valley, while Girls wrapped up its run with its most-watched season finale since Season 1. And we're already in development on 2 new projects with Lena Dunham, so we're excited building on the great success of Girls. 
We're now putting the finishing touches on Season 7 of Game of Thrones, which returns in July. 
And later this year, we'll also premier The Deuce, a new drama from David Simon, creator of The Wire, and that's set in the gritty streets of New York in the 1970s and '80s, and it stars James Franco. 
As I've mentioned before, HBO's originals are so good they can overshadow the powerful lineup of hit Hollywood movies that rounds out HBO's programming lineup. Thanks to our output deals with top studios like Warner Bros. 
In fact, Batman v Superman, The Legend of Tarzan and Suicide Squad, all three from Warner's, were the most viewed Saturday-night film premieres on HBO over the past 6 months. 
And we continue to see big Hollywood hit films like Batman v Superman gross over 20 million viewers did -- during their initial run on HBO. 
So we're really pleased with the value that HBO bring to its subscribers and the exciting lineup that it has planned for the rest of 2017 and the years beyond. 
Now let's turn to our studio, Warner Bros., which remains the #1 supplier of broadcast television for the current season, which includes the strong results of our lineup on the CW, where total viewing is up 16% this season across all CW platforms. 
On the film side at Warner's, the first quarter was highlighted by the strong global performance of Kong: Skull Island and The LEGO Batman Movie. And we're also very excited about Warner's slate for the rest of the year, which includes Dunkirk from legendary director Christopher Nolan. And the next 2 installments in our DC franchise: Wonder Woman comes to theaters June 2, and Justice League will hit theaters in the fall. 
As we did highlight before, our focus on franchises like DC Entertainment encompasses not just film and TV, but also consumer products and video games. And a great example of that is Injustice 2, which is set for release on May 16, and we anticipate it will be one of the cornerstones of a very strong year for our games business. 
Finally, I want to update you on some of our efforts to harness technology to directly reach audiences. Last month, Turner and Warner Bros. jointly launched a new kid's subscription VOD service under the Boomerang brand that features our company's deep library of iconic animated content as well as fresh, new originated animated fair that will debut weekly. 
And last week, Warner's announced its developing 2 series for a DC-branded over-the-top service we plan to launch next year. 
These are great examples of how we're investing in both high-quality content as well as in the technology and new capabilities to make sure we get that content to consumers wherever and whenever they want. 
The Boomerang subscription VOD service and the upcoming DC digital products are both powered by DramaFever, which Warner's acquired last year. 
Similarly, we've been increasingly leveraging the capabilities of iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired in 2015, across a range of live sports properties including March Madness Live and NBA League Pass. 
Among our over-the-top offerings, the Boomerang service joins FilmStruck, our arthouse film service that Turner launched last year, Warner Archive and DramaFever, both at Warner Bros. and of course, HBO's over-the-top products, which continue to grow subscribers at a very healthy pace in the quarter. These all reflect our growing recognition of the importance of delivering great experiences to consumers alongside our great content and doing it across distribution channels. 
And so joining with AT&T will expand our capabilities in this area, allowing us to significantly accelerate our efforts to deliver consumers more innovative products. 
As you can see, we had a very active quarter, and we have a lot of momentum across our businesses. Thanks, again, for listening, and I'll turn it over to Howard."
24689,424207541,1187993,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. We are off to a terrific start to 2017, posting our highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever as we continue",1725,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
We are off to a terrific start to 2017, posting our highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever as we continue to benefit of growing global demand for our high-quality content. Revenues grew 6% and adjusted operating income was up 7%. Total expenses increased 5% as we continue to make significant investments in content across our businesses, and that was partly balanced by our ongoing focus on constraining overhead cost. 
Adjusted EPS grew slightly faster at 11% and included an approximately $0.07 benefit from the adoption of new guidance on a tax accounting of equity-based compensation. So we've carried our operating momentum into 2017 and remain focused on executing our strategy, and we remain on track to deliver on the outlook for high single-digit growth and adjusted operating income that we laid out at the start of the year, which I'll touch on more throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we continue to benefit from strong subscription revenue trends as we invest in great content, new capabilities and innovative business models to position the business for long-term success. 
Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, domestic affiliate revenue were up a robust 13%, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of domestic growth in the teens, and we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to be solidly in the double digits for the remainder of the year. 
International subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits, with particular strength in Latin America. 
Total advertising decreased 2% and domestic advertising was down a similar amount, both below our expectations. That was in part because of some rating softness. 
In addition, during the NCAA Tournament, CBS aired games with more favorable matchups calling higher viewership than we initially projected. And because of how we account for the NCAA deal, that resulted in Turner recognizing less ad revenue than anticipated related to the NCAA Tournament in the first quarter. But keep in mind, based on the structure of the collaborative arrangement with CBS, the shift in revenue recognition does not impact our bottom line. So this year's tournament was again very successful, with strong ratings growth and record revenues across both linear and digital, further reinforcing the value of our premium sports portfolio. 
Moving on. International advertising was up in the mid-single digits and was also led by healthy growth in Latin America as well as in Europe. 
Turning to the second quarter, we've seen overall market demand moderate a bit relative to the strength we saw over the past year, although scatter pricing remains healthy. 
Looking specifically at Turner, we expect total advertising revenue to be down this quarter since we have an approximately 700 basis point negative impact from the shift of the NCAA Final Four and championship games from Turner to CBS. And excluding the NCAA shift, we expect total advertising revenue to be about flat in the quarter. 
Adjusted operating income was down 4%. That's a reflection of significantly higher programming costs, investments in new digital initiatives and higher marketing spend. 
Programming expenses grew 17% due to the increased costs associated with the first year of our new NBA deal and higher original programming expenses. 
And as we've discussed, we expect the new NBA deal will also have a material impact on programming costs in the second quarter. Turner is set up to have another good year, and we're confident that the investments we're making across the business, combined with continued strong execution, leave Turner well positioned to sustain healthy growth trend long-term. 
Turning now to HBO, where the strength of the brand and the global demand for its premium content translated into record quarterly profit and is contributing to solid subscriber growth year-to-date, setting HBO up for accelerating subscription revenue growth. 
Total subscription revenues increased 5% in the quarter, right in line with our expectations. Domestics sub revenues were also up in the mid-single digits, similar to recent quarters. 
International subscription revenue increased in the double-digit as we benefited from healthy demand for our OTT products in Europe. 
Looking ahead, we're seeing better subscriber performance at our traditional distributors as we begin to benefit from our new affiliate deals, and we expect that to continue improving throughout the year. 
When combined with continuous healthy growth for our OTT products and solid international trends, we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the high single digits in the second quarter and to remain strong throughout the year. So we're very confident in delivering the high single-digit growth for the year that we previously discussed. 
Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter due to the timing of home entertainment releases. That was largely offset by healthy growth in international licensing revenues as demand for HBO's original content around the world remains robust. 
Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 22% in the quarter as total expenses declined 5%. That was related to lower distribution costs associated with the decline in home video revenue and lower programming expenses. Programming cost declined 2% as a result of the timing of the reduction in amortization, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the lower amortization, programming expenses would have been up high single digits as we continue to invest in new original content like Big Little Lies and The Young Pope as well as higher acquired programming expenses tied to the delivery of major theatrical titles. 
Overall, HBO was off to a great start to the year. And with a strong pipeline of content and accelerating subscription revenue trends, HBO is set up for a very healthy growth in adjusted operating income in 2017. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where we also had a tremendous first quarter with revenues up 8% and adjusted operating income increasing 20%, led by our TV and theatrical businesses. 
Revenues and associated profits in our TV business grew well into the double digits as we benefited from strong growth in licensing revenue related to a few catalog titles, including Friends, and continued healthy demand internationally. This reinforces the staying power and value of the biggest hits, which bodes well for Warner Bros. going forward as the leading producer of TV shows. 
The strong performance and the global demand for hit contents is also evident at the theatrical business. In the first quarter, we benefited from the box office releases of The LEGO Batman Movie and Kong: Skull Island. We also posted strong home entertainment results, with revenues up 15% including over 40% growth in ESP. That was led by last year's franchise films with the Home Entertainment release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as well as carryover revenues from Suicide Squad. 
We expect to maintain the momentum in our theatrical business as our franchise release slate continues with Wonder Woman next month and Justice League later this year, and we should continue to see the benefit in Home Entertainment and TV licensing as these films move through those windows. 
Turning to games. We faced difficult comparisons in the quarter and we did not release any major console games. So as expected, revenues declined. But with 2 franchise console releases on this year's slate, starting with Injustice 2 later this month, we expect significant growth in our games business in 2017. 
So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is executing at a very high level. And with its strong franchise-led theatrical and games slates combined with healthy trends in the TV business, Warner is positioned to deliver another year of strong adjusted operating income growth. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter almost doubled compared to last year, totaling close to $1.4 billion. In addition to the growth in adjusted operating income, working capital was a significantly lower use of cash in the quarter. Working capital benefited from the positive impact to accounts receivable from the strong performance of Warner Bros. theatrical and Home Entertainment slate in the fourth quarter as well as the timing of production spend. So we had a strong first quarter of cash generation, and we expect another year of healthy free cash flow. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $21.8 billion of net debt, down about $1 billion compared to the end of 2016. That's primarily result of our strong free cash flow generation. 
As a result, our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6x, below our target leverage ratio of 2.75x, and we expect our leverage ratio will continue to fall through the year as a result of discontinuing share repurchases in connection with entering into the merger agreement with AT&T. 
So overall, we're very pleased with our strong financial results in the first quarter, and that keeps us on pace for the outlook we laid out in February for full year adjusted operating income growth in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. We continue to expect growth for the remainder of 2017 to be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of expenses at Turner. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter. As we plan for, Turner will see the biggest impact related to its new contract with the NBA, and we expect that to contribute to total programming cost growth of approximately 20%. 
We also plan to continue investing in new digital initiatives, including the Boomerang-branded SVOD service we recently launched, and in marketing to support upcoming original programming like Season 2 of Animal Kingdom and the debuts of Claws and Will on TNT. 
So as a result of these factors, we expect adjusted operating income to decline in the second quarter for both Turner and the total company, with both returning to very healthy growth in the second half of the year. 
Overall, we continue to make great progress on our key strategic initiatives across the company, and we are confident that with our continued investments in high-quality content and new digital initiatives in business models, we're well positioned to sustain our momentum and deliver strong financial results in 2017 and for many years to come. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jessica for Q&A."

Listen, let me begin by saying that I and the Turner team remains pretty optimistic about the health of the overall U.S. ad market for the full year, but I think there are a few factors to consider. So let me just go through them, and I'll do it reasonably quickly. I mean, not to repeat everything the Howard just said, but while the news category in the second quarter remains incredibly, incredibly strong, we have seen, particularly in the beginning of the quarter, somewhat of a moderation and a bit of a strength as compared to the year ago. And we think there's a few factors that our contributing to that. Given some uncertainty in the economy, we think that advertisers are holding back a little bit and they're taking a little bit more of a wait-and-see approach. And in addition, a number of large advertisers saw fewer product launches early in the year which have impacted categories like tech, autos and pharma, which were stronger a year ago. So I think that it's probably more timing-related as opposed to something that's purely cyclical. We've seen the market moving cycles, but given the reach of TV and our innovative targeting products and high-quality programming lineup, we continue to believe we're pretty well positioned. And also I think, interestingly enough, in the most recent weeks, as we get deeper into the quarter, we have seen the entertainment marketplace actually improve modestly as compared to what it looked like in the beginning of the second quarter, and we're experiencing elevated level of activities with continuing strong pricing. The sports marketplace is a little bit fragmented, there's a lot of inventory. And the heightened political climate continues to benefit CNN, resulting in news market moving early and there's a lot of demand. I mean, the last thing I would say -- because I just listed through a bunch of stuff, so I apologize if I just rambled through it. This time of the year, we always see postering a position in going into the upfront. So we expect the upfront is going to be healthy. But -- and I think it's hard, particularly in the second quarter, to look at as being a sustainable trend because I think a lot of advertisers are looking at their budgets and figuring out how they want to play in the upfront. So we continue to remain optimistic, and we don't see anything that's going to be problematic for us.

And it achieves 2 things that we hope are going to facilitate the adoption of audience-based ad buying. For those who may not realize what audience-based ad buying is, it essential is going to be a big boom to our industry over time because it will essentially make us daypart-agnostic, demo-agnostic and network-agnostic, which we think is going to be critical to move the business forward. The OpenAP platform provides advertisers with a standardized way to create audience-based targets and reporting through an independent third party. So OpenAP is going to make it more efficient for advertisers to buy audience targeting products at scale across programmers and increases transparency and verification, something the advertising community has been asking for, which has been a shortcoming, frankly, of a lot of the digital companies. So far early days, it's received an incredibly positive response from the ad community. And combined with the benefits of our advanced products, we think this initiative is really going to help accelerate advertising."

Overall, we've been talking about how increasingly the consumer experience is critical for us to be able to compete against, particularly, all platforms. And starting with TNT's Good Behavior and Animal Kingdom, last year and going forward, all of our new originals on TNT are going to have limited commercial interruption. The goal is to offer a much, much more engaging viewer experience and an ad experience for consumers that adds more value for advertising partners. And so far the results are very, very encouraging. More viewers are watching through the ad breaks. Our research indicates higher consumer satisfaction, brand awareness and ad recall are up. So we're delivering more value to our partners and viewers. And separately, starting in the fourth quarter of last year, we reduced our ad loads on truTV in half, and it's been extremely well received by advertisers, and we're seeing better and higher pricing. So the change has been essentially revenue-neutral, which we see as a positive. And we expect to continue to experiment more and more with ad loads over time."

But we do see an opportunity for it, and they're gaining traction. It's mitigating some other clients of the traditional providers. And it also proves there's consumer demand for smaller video packages with top networks, lower prices, depending what the appetite in a given household is, and better interfaces for VOD search and channel surfing. So if new offerings can combine that kind of attractive pricing and packaging with the sort of new 21st century on-demand platforms, interfaces and so on, then we think they can definitely attract new subs into the network system.

I think last year was the really big rebrand year for TBS, and I couldn't be more pleased with how successful that's going. And to reiterate what Jeff said in his proactive remarks, we're seeing returning shows actually grow ratings year-on-year, which you're not seeing a lot in the television landscape. And I think that's a testament to the quality of shows themselves plus the way that we've marketed them. And this year, you're going to see a number of really distinctive, unique dramas on TNT that will be a bit of a departure from the type of original programs that were on in the past. They're going to have a much more distinctive voice, they will probably be much more even between male-female and they'll bring in younger audiences. And we want TNT to be the place where people want to go to see great distinctive voice dramas.

We continued our momentum into 2017 and delivered a strong first quarter that sets us up very well to achieve our goals for the year. Our results highlight not just our focus on being home to the world's best video content, but also on delivering that content to consumers in new ways and developing new revenue streams that will drive continued growth. 
For the quarter, revenues grew 6% to $7.7 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $2.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share was up 11% to $1.66 a share. These results reflect the successful execution of the strategy we've discussed with you before, and which has served us and our shareholders very well. 
It starts with investing in great content, whether it's drama like Big Little Lies on HBO; action films like Warner Bros.' Kong: Skull Island; comedy such as The Big Bang Theory and The Detour; sports like March Madness and the NBA on Turner; news on CNN; or kids with properties like The LEGO Batman Movie and Powerpuff Girls on Cartoon Network. 
Another core part of our strategy is broadly distributing our content as we move decisively to connect more directly with consumers and to give them new and better ways to experience our content and brands. As you know, this consumer focus is an important strategic priority for us, and it's one of the key underpinnings of our merger with AT&T, which we remain on track to close by year-end. 
As we get closer to joining forces with AT&T, we're increasingly excited about the potential of our organizations to accelerate innovation together, and to do it across the entire media and entertainment industry in ways that will excite and benefit consumers in an area where video consumption is increasingly happening on demand and on multiple platforms. 
At the same time, we're focused on executing our business plans and doing what we do best. So let me share some recent highlights starting with Turner, where the tremendous value of our premium high-quality sports has been on display in the first part of the year. 
As I mentioned, we had another very successful presentation of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament across platforms, and that's in partnership with CBS, as you know. We posted record revenue, strong ratings growth and record digital performance. This year was the second most-watched NCAA Tournament in 23 years and viewership was up 16% over last year. 
And we've transitioned from March Madness right into the NBA playoffs on TNT, which kicked off a few weeks ago. 
We're already off to a great start with viewership through the first round of the playoffs, that are up 9%. And we're very excited to be the exclusive home to the Eastern Conference Finals later this month. 
Our commitment to high-quality sports also extends overseas. Turner, in conjunction with Fox, recently announced its acquisition of the rights to First Division soccer in Argentina, further strengthening our leading position in Latin America. And so we're really pleased with our portfolio and the genre that resonates so passionately with both viewers and advertisers. 
Sports are what makes or part of what makes TNT and TBS attractive to audience, but so is Turner's increasing focus on old exciting original series. At TBS, we continue to see the benefits of the content refresh we began about a year ago, reinforcing TBS as a preeminent comedy brand. Our returning shows are building on last year's momentum. The new seasons of Angie Tribeca and The Detour have each grown audiences by double digits from last season, and we've already green lit The Detour for season 3. 
The Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has built tremendous followings, almost doubling its audience since the debut early last year. And with that growth, Samantha Bee ranked as the #1 late-night show across all networks among adults 18 to 34 in the first quarter. 
We're earlier on in the content refresh at TNT, where in coming months we'll be rolling out new originals, including Will, that's a show about a young William Shakespeare, as well as 2 Warner Bros. production, the premiere of Claus and the return of Animal Kingdom for its second season.
We also saw Adult Swim maintain its stronghold on millennial audiences. It's the #1 ad-supported cable network among adults 18 to 34 for the 36th consecutive quarter, that's 9 years. And there's already tremendous buzz for the return of one of Adult Swim's most popular shows, Rick and Morty later this year. Last month, we unveiled a new virtual reality experience based on the show that lets each of you live the adventures of Rick and Morty. That's a great example of how we're focused on leveraging technology and building experience around our brands in ways that allow consumers to reach across platforms in a variety of devices and ways. 
CNN continues to build on its strength as a trusted source for news and analysis in a complex world, growing its total day ratings among adults 25 to 54 by 21% in the quarter and posting its most-watched first quarter since 2003. And CNN remains the undisputed leader in digital news, continuing to grow its multiplatform uniques and its video starts by solid double digits. 
Turner is also one of the founding partners in OpenAP, that's a new platform announced last month that will make it easier and more efficient for advertisers to target audiences in a consistent way across TV networks and offer our partners important third-party verification. This is further evidence of Turner's innovation in the ad space, and advanced advertising is an important area where combining with AT&T can accelerate our progress and improve our chance for success. 
Now moving over to Home Box Office. We continue to define what premium television means for the digital age with a mix of groundbreaking originals, Hollywood hits and a broad range of other distinctive program. 
Our limited series, Big Little Lies with a stellar cast including Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, was both a critical and a cultural breakout, averaging over 8 million viewers per episode. And the final season of The Leftovers, produced by Warner Bros., has also received tremendous critical acclaim and viewership for its premier episode grew 26% from last season. 
Other standouts in the quarter at HBO were Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, which is having its most-watched season to date and Real Time with Bill Maher, where our viewership is up 22% this season. 
Last month, we also had much-anticipated returns of new seasons of comedies Veep and Silicon Valley, while Girls wrapped up its run with its most-watched season finale since Season 1. And we're already in development on 2 new projects with Lena Dunham, so we're excited building on the great success of Girls. 
We're now putting the finishing touches on Season 7 of Game of Thrones, which returns in July. 
And later this year, we'll also premier The Deuce, a new drama from David Simon, creator of The Wire, and that's set in the gritty streets of New York in the 1970s and '80s, and it stars James Franco. 
As I've mentioned before, HBO's originals are so good they can overshadow the powerful lineup of hit Hollywood movies that rounds out HBO's programming lineup. Thanks to our output deals with top studios like Warner Bros. 
In fact, Batman v Superman, The Legend of Tarzan and Suicide Squad, all three from Warner's, were the most viewed Saturday-night film premieres on HBO over the past 6 months. 
And we continue to see big Hollywood hit films like Batman v Superman gross over 20 million viewers did -- during their initial run on HBO. 
So we're really pleased with the value that HBO bring to its subscribers and the exciting lineup that it has planned for the rest of 2017 and the years beyond. 
Now let's turn to our studio, Warner Bros., which remains the #1 supplier of broadcast television for the current season, which includes the strong results of our lineup on the CW, where total viewing is up 16% this season across all CW platforms. 
On the film side at Warner's, the first quarter was highlighted by the strong global performance of Kong: Skull Island and The LEGO Batman Movie. And we're also very excited about Warner's slate for the rest of the year, which includes Dunkirk from legendary director Christopher Nolan. And the next 2 installments in our DC franchise: Wonder Woman comes to theaters June 2, and Justice League will hit theaters in the fall. 
As we did highlight before, our focus on franchises like DC Entertainment encompasses not just film and TV, but also consumer products and video games. And a great example of that is Injustice 2, which is set for release on May 16, and we anticipate it will be one of the cornerstones of a very strong year for our games business. 
Finally, I want to update you on some of our efforts to harness technology to directly reach audiences. Last month, Turner and Warner Bros. jointly launched a new kid's subscription VOD service under the Boomerang brand that features our company's deep library of iconic animated content as well as fresh, new originated animated fair that will debut weekly. 
And last week, Warner's announced its developing 2 series for a DC-branded over-the-top service we plan to launch next year. 
These are great examples of how we're investing in both high-quality content as well as in the technology and new capabilities to make sure we get that content to consumers wherever and whenever they want. 
The Boomerang subscription VOD service and the upcoming DC digital products are both powered by DramaFever, which Warner's acquired last year. 
Similarly, we've been increasingly leveraging the capabilities of iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired in 2015, across a range of live sports properties including March Madness Live and NBA League Pass. 
Among our over-the-top offerings, the Boomerang service joins FilmStruck, our arthouse film service that Turner launched last year, Warner Archive and DramaFever, both at Warner Bros. and of course, HBO's over-the-top products, which continue to grow subscribers at a very healthy pace in the quarter. These all reflect our growing recognition of the importance of delivering great experiences to consumers alongside our great content and doing it across distribution channels. 
And so joining with AT&T will expand our capabilities in this area, allowing us to significantly accelerate our efforts to deliver consumers more innovative products. 
As you can see, we had a very active quarter, and we have a lot of momentum across our businesses. Thanks, again, for listening, and I'll turn it over to Howard."
24689,424207541,1192534,"Time Warner Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 03, 2017",2017-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Media, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. We are off to a terrific start to 2017, posting our highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever as we continue",1725,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. 
We are off to a terrific start to 2017, posting our highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever as we continue to benefit of growing global demand for our high-quality content. Revenues grew 6% and adjusted operating income was up 7%. Total expenses increased 5% as we continue to make significant investments in content across our businesses, and that was partly balanced by our ongoing focus on constraining overhead cost. 
Adjusted EPS grew slightly faster at 11% and included an approximately $0.07 benefit from the adoption of new guidance on a tax accounting of equity-based compensation. So we've carried our operating momentum into 2017 and remain focused on executing our strategy, and we remain on track to deliver on the outlook for high single-digit growth and adjusted operating income that we laid out at the start of the year, which I'll touch on more throughout my presentation. 
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner, where we continue to benefit from strong subscription revenue trends as we invest in great content, new capabilities and innovative business models to position the business for long-term success. 
Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, domestic affiliate revenue were up a robust 13%, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of domestic growth in the teens, and we remain on track for domestic subscription revenue growth to be solidly in the double digits for the remainder of the year. 
International subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits, with particular strength in Latin America. 
Total advertising decreased 2% and domestic advertising was down a similar amount, both below our expectations. That was in part because of some rating softness. 
In addition, during the NCAA Tournament, CBS aired games with more favorable matchups calling higher viewership than we initially projected. And because of how we account for the NCAA deal, that resulted in Turner recognizing less ad revenue than anticipated related to the NCAA Tournament in the first quarter. But keep in mind, based on the structure of the collaborative arrangement with CBS, the shift in revenue recognition does not impact our bottom line. So this year's tournament was again very successful, with strong ratings growth and record revenues across both linear and digital, further reinforcing the value of our premium sports portfolio. 
Moving on. International advertising was up in the mid-single digits and was also led by healthy growth in Latin America as well as in Europe. 
Turning to the second quarter, we've seen overall market demand moderate a bit relative to the strength we saw over the past year, although scatter pricing remains healthy. 
Looking specifically at Turner, we expect total advertising revenue to be down this quarter since we have an approximately 700 basis point negative impact from the shift of the NCAA Final Four and championship games from Turner to CBS. And excluding the NCAA shift, we expect total advertising revenue to be about flat in the quarter. 
Adjusted operating income was down 4%. That's a reflection of significantly higher programming costs, investments in new digital initiatives and higher marketing spend. 
Programming expenses grew 17% due to the increased costs associated with the first year of our new NBA deal and higher original programming expenses. 
And as we've discussed, we expect the new NBA deal will also have a material impact on programming costs in the second quarter. Turner is set up to have another good year, and we're confident that the investments we're making across the business, combined with continued strong execution, leave Turner well positioned to sustain healthy growth trend long-term. 
Turning now to HBO, where the strength of the brand and the global demand for its premium content translated into record quarterly profit and is contributing to solid subscriber growth year-to-date, setting HBO up for accelerating subscription revenue growth. 
Total subscription revenues increased 5% in the quarter, right in line with our expectations. Domestics sub revenues were also up in the mid-single digits, similar to recent quarters. 
International subscription revenue increased in the double-digit as we benefited from healthy demand for our OTT products in Europe. 
Looking ahead, we're seeing better subscriber performance at our traditional distributors as we begin to benefit from our new affiliate deals, and we expect that to continue improving throughout the year. 
When combined with continuous healthy growth for our OTT products and solid international trends, we expect subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the high single digits in the second quarter and to remain strong throughout the year. So we're very confident in delivering the high single-digit growth for the year that we previously discussed. 
Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter due to the timing of home entertainment releases. That was largely offset by healthy growth in international licensing revenues as demand for HBO's original content around the world remains robust. 
Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 22% in the quarter as total expenses declined 5%. That was related to lower distribution costs associated with the decline in home video revenue and lower programming expenses. Programming cost declined 2% as a result of the timing of the reduction in amortization, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the lower amortization, programming expenses would have been up high single digits as we continue to invest in new original content like Big Little Lies and The Young Pope as well as higher acquired programming expenses tied to the delivery of major theatrical titles. 
Overall, HBO was off to a great start to the year. And with a strong pipeline of content and accelerating subscription revenue trends, HBO is set up for a very healthy growth in adjusted operating income in 2017. 
Moving on to Warner Bros., where we also had a tremendous first quarter with revenues up 8% and adjusted operating income increasing 20%, led by our TV and theatrical businesses. 
Revenues and associated profits in our TV business grew well into the double digits as we benefited from strong growth in licensing revenue related to a few catalog titles, including Friends, and continued healthy demand internationally. This reinforces the staying power and value of the biggest hits, which bodes well for Warner Bros. going forward as the leading producer of TV shows. 
The strong performance and the global demand for hit contents is also evident at the theatrical business. In the first quarter, we benefited from the box office releases of The LEGO Batman Movie and Kong: Skull Island. We also posted strong home entertainment results, with revenues up 15% including over 40% growth in ESP. That was led by last year's franchise films with the Home Entertainment release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as well as carryover revenues from Suicide Squad. 
We expect to maintain the momentum in our theatrical business as our franchise release slate continues with Wonder Woman next month and Justice League later this year, and we should continue to see the benefit in Home Entertainment and TV licensing as these films move through those windows. 
Turning to games. We faced difficult comparisons in the quarter and we did not release any major console games. So as expected, revenues declined. But with 2 franchise console releases on this year's slate, starting with Injustice 2 later this month, we expect significant growth in our games business in 2017. 
So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is executing at a very high level. And with its strong franchise-led theatrical and games slates combined with healthy trends in the TV business, Warner is positioned to deliver another year of strong adjusted operating income growth. 
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow in the quarter almost doubled compared to last year, totaling close to $1.4 billion. In addition to the growth in adjusted operating income, working capital was a significantly lower use of cash in the quarter. Working capital benefited from the positive impact to accounts receivable from the strong performance of Warner Bros. theatrical and Home Entertainment slate in the fourth quarter as well as the timing of production spend. So we had a strong first quarter of cash generation, and we expect another year of healthy free cash flow. 
Looking at our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with approximately $21.8 billion of net debt, down about $1 billion compared to the end of 2016. That's primarily result of our strong free cash flow generation. 
As a result, our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.6x, below our target leverage ratio of 2.75x, and we expect our leverage ratio will continue to fall through the year as a result of discontinuing share repurchases in connection with entering into the merger agreement with AT&T. 
So overall, we're very pleased with our strong financial results in the first quarter, and that keeps us on pace for the outlook we laid out in February for full year adjusted operating income growth in the high single digits based on current exchange rates. We continue to expect growth for the remainder of 2017 to be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of expenses at Turner. 
Looking specifically at the second quarter. As we plan for, Turner will see the biggest impact related to its new contract with the NBA, and we expect that to contribute to total programming cost growth of approximately 20%. 
We also plan to continue investing in new digital initiatives, including the Boomerang-branded SVOD service we recently launched, and in marketing to support upcoming original programming like Season 2 of Animal Kingdom and the debuts of Claws and Will on TNT. 
So as a result of these factors, we expect adjusted operating income to decline in the second quarter for both Turner and the total company, with both returning to very healthy growth in the second half of the year. 
Overall, we continue to make great progress on our key strategic initiatives across the company, and we are confident that with our continued investments in high-quality content and new digital initiatives in business models, we're well positioned to sustain our momentum and deliver strong financial results in 2017 and for many years to come. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jessica for Q&A."

Listen, let me begin by saying that I and the Turner team remains pretty optimistic about the health of the overall U.S. ad market for the full year, but I think there are a few factors to consider. So let me just go through them, and I'll do it reasonably quickly. I mean, not to repeat everything the Howard just said, but while the news category in the second quarter remains incredibly, incredibly strong, we have seen, particularly in the beginning of the quarter, somewhat of a moderation and a bit of a strength as compared to the year ago. And we think there's a few factors that our contributing to that. Given some uncertainty in the economy, we think that advertisers are holding back a little bit and they're taking a little bit more of a wait-and-see approach. And in addition, a number of large advertisers saw fewer product launches early in the year which have impacted categories like tech, autos and pharma, which were stronger a year ago. So I think that it's probably more timing-related as opposed to something that's purely cyclical. We've seen the market moving cycles, but given the reach of TV and our innovative targeting products and high-quality programming lineup, we continue to believe we're pretty well positioned. And also I think, interestingly enough, in the most recent weeks, as we get deeper into the quarter, we have seen the entertainment marketplace actually improve modestly as compared to what it looked like in the beginning of the second quarter, and we're experiencing elevated level of activities with continuing strong pricing. The sports marketplace is a little bit fragmented, there's a lot of inventory. And the heightened political climate continues to benefit CNN, resulting in news market moving early and there's a lot of demand. I mean, the last thing I would say -- because I just listed through a bunch of stuff, so I apologize if I just rambled through it. This time of the year, we always see postering a position in going into the upfront. So we expect the upfront is going to be healthy. But -- and I think it's hard, particularly in the second quarter, to look at as being a sustainable trend because I think a lot of advertisers are looking at their budgets and figuring out how they want to play in the upfront. So we continue to remain optimistic, and we don't see anything that's going to be problematic for us. And we're going to continue to try to lead the industry with our innovative ad products to try to take as much share as we can."

And it achieves 2 things that we hope are going to facilitate the adoption of audience-based ad buying. For those who may not realize what audience-based ad buying is, it essential is going to be a big boom to our industry over time because it will essentially make us daypart-agnostic, demo-agnostic and network-agnostic, which we think is going to be critical to move the business forward. The OpenAP platform provides advertisers with a standardized way to create audience-based targets and reporting through an independent third party. So OpenAP is going to make it more efficient for advertisers to buy audience targeting products at scale across programmers and increases transparency and verification, something the advertising community has been asking for, which has been a shortcoming, frankly, of a lot of the digital companies. So far early days, it's received an incredibly positive response from the ad community. And combined with the benefits of our advanced products, we think this initiative is really going to help accelerate advertising."

Listen, with respect to the soccer rights that you were referring to, unfortunately, I can't specifically comment because at this point it's only press speculation. But broadly speaking, our sports strategy is unchanged and it's long focused on high-quality popular sports, with the overwhelming majority of the value coming from championship tournament or playoff games. And so we're always open to opportunities that would fit that criteria and where we think we can earn earn an attractive return on investment. Last point I would make is as we think about securing sports rights in the future, multiplatform rights are going to become more and more important. So I'll leave it at that."

So we can barely hear the questions. Like everything is working perfectly here. So I think I heard your question and let me address the idea of commercial ad loads. Overall, we've been talking about how increasingly the consumer experience is critical for us to be able to compete against, particularly, all platforms. And starting with TNT's Good Behavior and Animal Kingdom, last year and going forward, all of our new originals on TNT are going to have limited commercial interruption. The goal is to offer a much, much more engaging viewer experience and an ad experience for consumers that adds more value for advertising partners. And so far the results are very, very encouraging. More viewers are watching through the ad breaks. Our research indicates higher consumer satisfaction, brand awareness and ad recall are up. So we're delivering more value to our partners and viewers. And separately, starting in the fourth quarter of last year, we reduced our ad loads on truTV in half, and it's been extremely well received by advertisers, and we're seeing better and higher pricing. So the change has been essentially revenue-neutral, which we see as a positive. And we expect to continue to experiment more and more with ad loads over time."

But we do see an opportunity for it, and they're gaining traction. It's mitigating some other clients of the traditional providers. And it also proves there's consumer demand for smaller video packages with top networks, lower prices, depending what the appetite in a given household is, and better interfaces for VOD search and channel surfing. So if new offerings can combine that kind of attractive pricing and packaging with the sort of new 21st century on-demand platforms, interfaces and so on, then we think they can definitely attract new subs into the network system.

I think we've got an incredibly popular networks and the most concentrated portfolio of popular networks in the United States. I don't see any need for further consolidation. I think other network groups are going to need to consolidate. And as it relates to TNT, I'm really optimistic about the rebranding efforts that Kevin Reilly and the team, Sarah Aubrey are doing with TNT. I think last year was the really big rebrand year for TBS, and I couldn't be more pleased with how successful that's going. And to reiterate what Jeff said in his proactive remarks, we're seeing returning shows actually grow ratings year-on-year, which you're not seeing a lot in the television landscape. And I think that's a testament to the quality of shows themselves plus the way that we've marketed them. And this year, you're going to see a number of really distinctive, unique dramas on TNT that will be a bit of a departure from the type of original programs that were on in the past. They're going to have a much more distinctive voice, they will probably be much more even between male-female and they'll bring in younger audiences. And we want TNT to be the place where people want to go to see great distinctive voice dramas. Drama category is very crowded, but I think we've got a great opportunity, we've got scale and we've got lead position."
