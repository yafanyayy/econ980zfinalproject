We are pleased to report an excellent fourth quarter, which concluded a solid year for our company across all areas of the business. We completed a record high volume of high-quality property acquisitions, access to capital markets at favorable pricing and terms and actively managed the portfolio to maximize value.  As a result, AFFO per share during the fourth quarter increased 10.3% to $0.75, which contributed to 2016 AFFO per share growth of 5.1% to $2.88. 
As announced in yesterday's press release, we are introducing our AFFO per share guidance for 2017 of $3 to $3.06 as we anticipate another attractive year of earnings growth. 
Now let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on the financials."
339305,416154292,1140773,"Realty Income Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2017",2017-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Realty Income Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. I'll provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter and year starting with the income statement.Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $3 million to $49 million and decreased in 2016 by $13 million to $22",494,"Thanks, John. I'll provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter and year starting with the income statement.
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $3 million to $49 million and decreased in 2016 by $13 million to $220 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we have primarily sold common equity for our capital needs over the last 2 years to repay outstanding bonds and mortgages.  Our October bond offering of $600 million was the first large debt offering we had completed in over 2 years. The decrease in interest expense was also driven by the recognition of noncash gains on interest rate swaps during the quarter and year, which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of noncash swap gains or losses to calculate our AFFO. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rent to another [ph] revenues was only 4.9% for the quarter and year as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. We project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2017. 
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rent to other [ph] revenues was 1.9% in 2016. This was slightly higher than 2015 due to higher carrying costs associated with some vacant properties. We expect nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rent to another [ph] revenues to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range for 2017.
Provisions for impairment were $20.7 million in 2016 on [ph] 32 sold properties, 6 properties held for sale and 2 properties held for investment. We have increased our property sales activity a little with $90.5 million [ph] in sales in 2016 and $75 million [ph] to $100 million [ph] of sales expected in 2017.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In 2016, we raised approximately $573 million of common equity capital. In fact, over the last 2 years, approximately 70% of the capital we have raised has been common equity, and our balance sheet remains very flexible. 
Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 6.6 years, and we have approximately $900 million available under our $2 billion revolving credit facility.  Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just [ph] $38 million of mortgage debt. 
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $278 million of debt coming due in 2017 and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter. 
Finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our [ph] debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.7x. [ph] In summary, we have a low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital, both of which remain well-priced financing options today. 
Let me turn the call now back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on a number properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. During the year,",593,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on a number properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the year, we released 186 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing 105% of the expiring rent, which is well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,300 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric. 
We remain active in our asset management efforts as we look to enhance the returns on our existing properties as well. Our same-store rent increased 0.9% during the quarter and 1.2% in 2016, which is generally consistent with the run rate we expect for our portfolio in 2017. 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties. 
Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 248 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico, 79% of our rental revenues from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11.4% of rental revenue.
During the fourth quarter, we added 2 new tenants to our top 20, including 7 11, which represents 1.8% of our annualized rental revenue; and Home Depot, which represents 1.1% of our annualized revenue. We are pleased with these additions as both of these tenants are investment-grade rated, best-in-class operators in their respective industries, with excellent real estate locations and strong store level metrics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 47% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x on a 4-wall basis and the median remains 2 7x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed 1.86 billion in property level acquisitions in 2016, of which, 786 million was completed during the fourth quarter. Both of these amounts were record high volumes for our company, and were completed at investment spreads relative to our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital that well exceed our historical average. 
We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. 
In 2016, we sourced 28.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 7% of the amount sourced, which is consistent with our average since 2010.
Our selectivity reflects our focus on quality. Our distinctive cost of capital advantage allows us to consistently grow earnings, while adding the highest quality investment opportunities to our portfolio. Given the pipeline we are seeing today, we are introducing 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, this estimate reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to further discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we invested 786 million in 279 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.3 years. 
On a revenue basis, approximately 84% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 27 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, financial services and discount grocery stores. 
We closed 24 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter and the average investment per property was approximately  2.8 million. 
During 2016, we invested 1.86 billion in 505 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.7 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 64% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. 
These assets are leased to 51 different tenants in 28 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, drugstores and financial services. Of the 85 discrete transactions closed during 2016, 5 transactions were above [ph] 50 million. Transactions flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than 5 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2016, we sourced 28.5 billion in potential concession opportunities. Of these opportunities, 61% of the volumes source were portfolios and 39% or approximately 12 billion, were one-off assets. 
Investment grade opportunities represented 26% for the fourth quarter. Of the 786 million in acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 30% were one-off transactions. 
A surprising cap rates remained flat in the fourth quarter with investment grade properties trading around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital, were healthy, averaging 214 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first tier weighted average cost of capital. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties with net proceeds of 34.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7%, and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.5%. This brings us to 75 properties sold during 2016 or 87.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.3% and an unlevered IRR of 8.5%. 
In conclusion, we had an exceptional year in 2016 regarding acquisitions as well as dispositions. We look forward to achieving our 2017 acquisition target of approximately 1 billion and disposition volume between 75 million and 100 million. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As Paul mentioned, 2016 was an active year for our capital markets activities. We issued 573 million in common equity at an average price of approximately $61 per share, reflecting the lowest cost of equity raised in any year in our company's history. Additionally, with the highest credit rating in the net lease sector, we issued 600 million in 10-year fixed-rate unsecured debt at a yield of 3.15%, the lowest yield for debt we have issued with this time in our company's history. Our 10-year credit spread, which is narrowed by over 20 basis points since the offering, is now amongst the lowest in the entire REIT industry. Our leverage remains slow with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 28% and debt-to-EBITDA 5.7x. We currently have approximately 1.1 billion outstanding on our $2 billion line of credit, which can be expanded to $3 billion at our option. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we continue to grow our company. 
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 90th time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance in 2016 and remain quite optimistic for 2017. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 93%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business. Our portfolio remains healthy, and we continue to see an ample volume of acquisition opportunities that allows us to consistently grow earnings. The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities, given our sector leading cost of capital, access to capital and balance sheet flexibility.

I'll provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter and year starting with the income statement.Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $3 million to $49 million and decreased in 2016 by $13 million to $22",483,"Thanks, John. I'll provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter and year starting with the income statement.
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $3 million to $49 million and decreased in 2016 by $13 million to $220 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we have primarily sold common equity for our capital needs over the last 2 years to repay outstanding bonds and mortgages.  Our October bond offering of $600 million was the first large debt offering we had completed in over 2 years. The decrease in interest expense was also driven by the recognition of noncash gains on interest rate swaps during the quarter and year, which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of noncash swap gains or losses to calculate our AFFO. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.9% for the quarter and year as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. We project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2017. 
Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.9% in 2016. This was slightly higher than 2015 due to higher carrying costs associated with some vacant properties. We expect nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range for 2017.
Provisions for impairment were $20.7 million in 2016 on 32 sold properties, 6 properties held for sale and 2 properties held for investment. We have increased our property sales activity a little with $90.5 million in sales in 2016 and $75 million to $100 million of sales expected in 2017.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In 2016, we raised approximately $573 million of common equity capital. In fact, over the last 2 years, approximately 70% of the capital we have raised has been common equity, and our balance sheet remains very flexible. 
Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 6.6 years, and we have approximately $900 million available under our $2 billion revolving credit facility.  Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $38 million of mortgage debt. 
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $278 million of debt coming due in 2017 and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter. 
Finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.7x. In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access  to attractively priced equity and debt capital, both of which remain well-priced financing options today. 
Let me turn the call now back over to John."

Occupancy based on the number properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the year, we released 186 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing 105% of the expiring rent, which is well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,300 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric. 
We remain active in our asset management efforts as we look to enhance the returns on our existing properties as well. Our same-store rent increased 0.9% during the quarter and 1.2% in 2016, which is generally consistent with the run rate we expect for our portfolio in 2017. 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties. 
Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 248 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.  Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11.4% of rental revenue.
During the fourth quarter, we added 2 new tenants to our top 20, including 7-Eleven, which represents 1.8% of our annualized rental revenue; and Home Depot, which represents 1.1% of our annualized revenue. We are pleased with these additions as both of these tenants are investment-grade rated, best-in-class operators in their respective industries, with excellent real estate locations and strong store level metrics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 47% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. 
The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x on a 4-wall basis and the median remains 2.7x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $1.86 billion in property level acquisitions in 2016, of which, $786 million was completed during the fourth quarter. Both of these amounts were record-high volumes for our company and were completed at investment spreads relative to our nominal first year-weighted average cost of capital that well exceed our historical average. 
We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters.  In 2016, we sourced $28.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 7% of the amount sourced, which is consistent with our average since 2010.
Our selectivity reflects our focus on quality. Our distinct cost of capital advantage allows us to consistently grow earnings while adding the highest quality investment opportunities to our portfolio. Given the pipeline we are seeing today, we are introducing 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, this estimate reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to further discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

These assets are leased to 51 different tenants in 28 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, drugstores and financial services. Of the 85 discrete transactions closed during 2016, 5 transactions were above $50 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $5 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2016, we sourced $28.5 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 61% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 39% or approximately $12 billion, were one-off assets. 
Investment-grade opportunities represented 26% for the fourth quarter. Of the $786 million in acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 30% were one-off transactions. 
Our surprising cap rates remained flat in the fourth quarter with investment-grade properties trading around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital, were healthy, averaging 214 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year-weighted average cost of capital. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties with net proceeds of $34.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7%, and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.5%. This brings us to 75 properties sold during 2016 or $87.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.3% and an unlevered IRR of 8.5%. 
In conclusion, we had an exceptional year in 2016 regarding acquisitions as well as dispositions. We look forward to achieving our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As Paul mentioned, 2016 was an active year for our capital markets activities. We issued $573 million in common equity at an average price of approximately $61 per share, reflecting the lowest cost of equity raised in any year in our company's history. Additionally, with the highest credit rating in the net lease sector, we issued $600 million in 10-year fixed-rate unsecured debt at a yield of 3.15%, the lowest yield for debt we have issued with this term in our company's history. Our 10-year credit spread, which is narrowed by over 20 basis points since the offering, is now amongst the lowest in the entire REIT industry. Our leverage remains low with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 28% and debt-to-EBITDA 5.7x. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion  outstanding on our $2 billion line of credit, which can be expanded to $3 billion at our option. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we continue to grow our company. 
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 90th time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance in 2016 and remain quite optimistic for 2017. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 93%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business. Our portfolio remains healthy, and we continue to see an ample volume of acquisition opportunities that allows us to consistently grow earnings. The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our sector-leading cost of capital, access to capital and balance sheet flexibility.

You flash forward to today and at the end of 2016, the average rating of our top 20 tenants is a solid BBB. So we've made real good progress over the years and upgrading the credit profile, and we feel good about where the portfolio stands, Dan."

And we're -- we don't financially engineer transaction, so yes, we want to underwrite market rents. We could choose those rents and show higher cap rates, but that gives you risk on the residual and long-term risk, so we've always avoided that. And we don't mind announcing an initial yield of 6.1% like we did in the fourth quarter when we're buying the sort of quality assets that we're buying. We're still making, as I said, great spreads well above our historical average. And on our IRRs, we're exceeding notably our hurdles there. So what we see, Dan, in the industry is some players dressing up their yields by buying assets that have rents that are well above market. And in the long run, it's our opinion that, that's just not a value-creating exercise."

As a result, AFFO per share during the fourth quarter increased 10.3% to $0.75, which contributed to 2016 AFFO per share growth of 5.1% to $2.88.

Now, let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on the financials."

I'll provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter and year starting with the income statement.Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $3 million to $49 million and decreased in 2016 by $13 million to $22",483,"Thanks, John. I'll provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter and year starting with the income statement.
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $3 million to $49 million and decreased in 2016 by $13 million to $220 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we have primarily sold common equity for our capital needs over the last 2 years to repay outstanding bonds and mortgages.  Our October bond offering of $600 million was the first large debt offering we had completed in over 2 years. The decrease in interest expense was also driven by the recognition of noncash gains on interest rate swaps during the quarter and year, which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of noncash swap gains or losses to calculate our AFFO. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.9% for the quarter and year as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. We project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2017. 
Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.9% in 2016. This was slightly higher than 2015 due to higher carrying costs associated with some vacant properties. We expect nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range for 2017.
Provisions for impairment were $20.7 million in 2016 on 32 sold properties, 6 properties held for sale and 2 properties held for investment. We have increased our property sales activity a little with $90.5 million in sales in 2016 and $75 million to $100 million of sales expected in 2017.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In 2016, we raised approximately $573 million of common equity capital. In fact, over the last 2 years, approximately 70% of the capital we have raised has been common equity, and our balance sheet remains very flexible. 
Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 6.6 years, and we have approximately $900 million available under our $2 billion revolving credit facility.  Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $38 million of mortgage debt. 
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $278 million of debt coming due in 2017 and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter. 
Finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.7x. In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access  to attractively priced equity and debt capital, both of which remain well-priced financing options today. 
Let me turn the call now back over to John."

Occupancy based on the number properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the year, we released 186 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing 105% of the expiring rent, which is well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,300 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric. 
We remain active in our asset management efforts as we look to enhance the returns on our existing properties as well. Our same-store rent increased 0.9% during the quarter and 1.2% in 2016, which is generally consistent with the run rate we expect for our portfolio in 2017. 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties. 
Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 248 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue.  Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11.4% of rental revenue.
During the fourth quarter, we added 2 new tenants to our top 20, including 7-Eleven, which represents 1.8% of our annualized rental revenue; and Home Depot, which represents 1.1% of our annualized revenue. We are pleased with these additions as both of these tenants are investment-grade rated, best-in-class operators in their respective industries, with excellent real estate locations and strong store level metrics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 47% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. 
The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x on a 4-wall basis and the median remains 2.7x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $1.86 billion in property level acquisitions in 2016, of which, $786 million was completed during the fourth quarter. Both of these amounts were record-high volumes for our company and were completed at investment spreads relative to our nominal first year-weighted average cost of capital that well exceed our historical average. 
We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters.  In 2016, we sourced $28.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 7% of the amount sourced, which is consistent with our average since 2010.
Our selectivity reflects our focus on quality. Our distinct cost of capital advantage allows us to consistently grow earnings while adding the highest quality investment opportunities to our portfolio. Given the pipeline we are seeing today, we are introducing 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, this estimate reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to further discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we invested $786 million in 279 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.3 years.  On a revenue basis, approximately 84% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 27 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, financial services and discount grocery stores. 
We closed 24 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter and the average investment per property was approximately  $2.8 million. 
During 2016, we invested $1.86 billion in 505 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.7 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 64% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. 
These assets are leased to 51 different tenants in 28 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, drugstores and financial services. Of the 85 discrete transactions closed during 2016, 5 transactions were above $50 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $5 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2016, we sourced $28.5 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 61% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 39% or approximately $12 billion, were one-off assets. 
Investment-grade opportunities represented 26% for the fourth quarter. Of the $786 million in acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 30% were one-off transactions. 
Our surprising cap rates remained flat in the fourth quarter with investment-grade properties trading around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital, were healthy, averaging 214 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year-weighted average cost of capital. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties with net proceeds of $34.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7%, and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.5%. This brings us to 75 properties sold during 2016 or $87.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.3% and an unlevered IRR of 8.5%. 
In conclusion, we had an exceptional year in 2016 regarding acquisitions as well as dispositions. We look forward to achieving our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As Paul mentioned, 2016 was an active year for our capital markets activities. We issued $573 million in common equity at an average price of approximately $61 per share, reflecting the lowest cost of equity raised in any year in our company's history. Additionally, with the highest credit rating in the net lease sector, we issued $600 million in 10-year fixed-rate unsecured debt at a yield of 3.15%, the lowest yield for debt we have issued with this term in our company's history. Our 10-year credit spread, which has narrowed by over 20 basis points since the offering, is now amongst the lowest in the entire REIT industry. Our leverage remains low with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 28% and debt-to-EBITDA 5.7x. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion  outstanding on our $2 billion line of credit, which can be expanded to $3 billion at our option. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we continue to grow our company. 
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 90th time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance in 2016 and remain quite optimistic for 2017. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 93%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business. Our portfolio remains healthy, and we continue to see an ample volume of acquisition opportunities that allows us to consistently grow earnings. The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our sector-leading cost of capital, access to capital and balance sheet flexibility.

I'll provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter and year starting with the income statement.Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $3 million to $49 million and decreased in 2016 by $13 million to $22",483,"Thanks, John. I'll provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter and year starting with the income statement.
Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $3 million to $49 million and decreased in 2016 by $13 million to $220 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we have primarily sold common equity for our capital needs over the last 2 years to repay outstanding bonds and mortgages. Our October bond offering of $600 million was the first large debt offering we had completed in over 2 years. The decrease in interest expense was also driven by the recognition of noncash gains on interest rate swaps during the quarter and year, which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of noncash swap gains or losses to calculate our AFFO. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.9% for the quarter and year as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. We project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2017. 
Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.9% in 2016. This was slightly higher than 2015 due to higher carrying costs associated with some vacant properties. We expect nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range for 2017.
Provisions for impairment were $20.7 million in 2016 on 32 sold properties, 6 properties held for sale and 2 properties held for investment. We have increased our property sales activity a little with $90.5 million in sales in 2016 and $75 million to $100 million of sales expected in 2017.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In 2016, we raised approximately $573 million of common equity capital. In fact, over the last 2 years, approximately 70% of the capital we have raised has been common equity, and our balance sheet remains very flexible. 
Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 6.6 years, and we have approximately $900 million available under our $2 billion revolving credit facility. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $38 million of mortgage debt. 
Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $278 million of debt coming due in 2017 and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter. 
Finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.7x. In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital, both of which remain well-priced financing options today. 
Let me turn the call now back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. During the ye",590,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. 
Occupancy based on the number properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the year, we released 186 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing 105% of the expiring rent, which is well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,300 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric. 
We remain active in our asset management efforts as we look to enhance the returns on our existing properties as well. Our same-store rent increased 0.9% during the quarter and 1.2% in 2016, which is generally consistent with the run rate we expect for our portfolio in 2017. 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties. 
Approximately 75% of our investment-grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 248 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11.4% of rental revenue.
During the fourth quarter, we added 2 new tenants to our top 20, including 7-Eleven, which represents 1.8% of our annualized rental revenue; and Home Depot, which represents 1.1% of our annualized revenue. We are pleased with these additions as both of these tenants are investment-grade rated, best-in-class operators in their respective industries, with excellent real estate locations and strong store level metrics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 47% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. 
The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x on a 4-wall basis and the median remains 2.7x. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $1.86 billion in property level acquisitions in 2016, of which, $786 million was completed during the fourth quarter. Both of these amounts were record-high volumes for our company and were completed at investment spreads relative to our nominal first year-weighted average cost of capital that well exceed our historical average. 
We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. In 2016, we sourced $28.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 7% of the amount sourced, which is consistent with our average since 2010.
Our selectivity reflects our focus on quality. Our distinct cost of capital advantage allows us to consistently grow earnings while adding the highest quality investment opportunities to our portfolio. Given the pipeline we are seeing today, we are introducing 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1 billion. As a reminder, this estimate reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
I'll hand it over to Sumit to further discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we invested $786 million in 279 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.3 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 84% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 27 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, financial services and discount grocery stores. 
We closed 24 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $2.8 million. 
During 2016, we invested $1.86 billion in 505 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.7 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 64% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. 
These assets are leased to 51 different tenants in 28 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, drugstores and financial services. Of the 85 discrete transactions closed during 2016, 5 transactions were above $50 million. 
Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $5 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2016, we sourced $28.5 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 61% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 39% or approximately $12 billion, were one-off assets. 
Investment-grade opportunities represented 26% for the fourth quarter. Of the $786 million in acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 30% were one-off transactions. 
Our surprising cap rates remained flat in the fourth quarter with investment-grade properties trading around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital, were healthy, averaging 214 basis points in the fourth quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year-weighted average cost of capital. 
Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties with net proceeds of $34.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7%, and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.5%. This brings us to 75 properties sold during 2016 or $87.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.3% and an unlevered IRR of 8.5%. 
In conclusion, we had an exceptional year in 2016 regarding acquisitions as well as dispositions. We look forward to achieving our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

As Paul mentioned, 2016 was an active year for our capital markets activities. We issued $573 million in common equity at an average price of approximately $61 per share, reflecting the lowest cost of equity raised in any year in our company's history. Additionally, with the highest credit rating in the net lease sector, we issued $600 million in 10-year fixed-rate unsecured debt at a yield of 3.15%, the lowest yield for debt we have issued with this term in our company's history. Our 10-year credit spread, which has narrowed by over 20 basis points since the offering, is now amongst the lowest in the entire REIT industry. Our leverage remains low with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 28% and debt-to-EBITDA 5.7x. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion outstanding on our $2 billion line of credit, which can be expanded to $3 billion at our option. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we continue to grow our company. 
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 90th time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. 
To wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance in 2016 and remain quite optimistic for 2017. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 93%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business. Our portfolio remains healthy, and we continue to see an ample volume of acquisition opportunities that allows us to consistently grow earnings. The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace, and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our sector-leading cost of capital, access to capital and balance sheet flexibility.

Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $1.4 million to $59.3 million. This decrease is primarily driven by the recognition of a $1.3 million noncash gain on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused the decrease in net liability and lowered our interest expense. 
As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of noncash swap gains or losses to calculate AFFO. Interest expense this quarter was also impacted by the recording of approximately 1 month or $2.3 million of preferred dividend as interest expense. Since the redemption notice for our preferred stock was issued before quarter-end, we were required to reclassify the preferred stock as a liability at that time and then recognize about a month of preferred dividend as interest expense. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.7% for the quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. 
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.7% in the first quarter. We tend to experience slightly higher property expenses in the first quarter, but we continue to expect nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues to be in the 1.5% to 2% range for all of 2017.
Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.71 for the quarter versus $0.68 a year ago. FFO per share was impacted by a $13.4 million or $0.05 per share noncash redemption charge related to the unamortized original issuance costs associated with our preferred F shares. Excluding this noncash charge, FFO per share would have been $0.76 for the quarter.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share, representing an 8.6% increase over the year-ago period. 
Briefly turning to the balanced sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As John mentioned, year-to-date, we have raised approximately $1.5 billion of well priced long-term capital to fund our acquisition activity and retire over $400 million of high coupon preferred stock. 
Our senior unsecured bonds now have a weighted average remaining maturity of 8.1 years, and our fixed charge coverage ratio is now 4.5x. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $38 million of mortgage debt. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only 276 million of debt coming due later this year, and our maturity schedule is very well lathered thereafter.
And finally, our overall leverage remains modest with lower debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.5x. 
In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. 
Our occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3% %, unchanged from last quarter and up 50 basis points from a year ago. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the quarter, we released 49 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is above our long-term average. This quarter was the third consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. 
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.6% during the quarter, primarily due to higher percentage rent. 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property-type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenues from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. 
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.8% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11.1% of the rental revenue. We remain comfortable with the momentum in the drugstore industry and continue to view our exposure favorably, given the industry's attractive demographic tailwinds, nondiscretionary nature and continued growth from in-store pharmacy pick up.
Additionally, Walgreens and CVS, our top 2 drugstore tenants, have generated 15 consecutive quarters of positive same-store pharmacy sales growth. 
During the quarter, we added Kroger to our top 20 tenants, representing 1.2% of our annualized rental revenue. We are pleased with our Kroger locations and the addition of this high-quality investment-grade rated grocery chains, which we view as  one of the better operators in the industry. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remain sound. Our 4-wall weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x and the median is 2.7x.
Moving on to acquisitions briefly before handing it over to Sumit, we completed 371 million in acquisitions during the quarter, and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. 
During the quarter, we sourced 10.8 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain deliberate in our investment strategy, acquiring only 3% of the amount sourced.
Our selectivity reflects our focus on quality. We continue to expect to complete 1 billion of acquisitions in 2017. As a reminder, this estimate primarily reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
Now, let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss acquisitions and dispositions."

During the first quarter of 2017, we invested 371 million in 60 properties located in 18 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.4 years. 
On a revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 98.7% of the revenues are generated from retail and 1.3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, automotive services and dealerships. We closed 11 discrete transactions in the first quarter. 
The transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately 11 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 46%, or more than 5 billion, were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 28% for the first quarter. 
Of the 371 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 23% were one-off transactions. 
As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the first quarter with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 195 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical averages. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
Regarding dispositions. During the first quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of 31.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% unrealized and unlevered IRR of 9.8%. 
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately 1 billion and disposition volume between 75 million and 100 million.

Additionally, with the highest credit rating in the net lease sector, we issued 700 million in fixed rate unsecured debt with a weighted average term of 18.3 years and a yield of 4.1%. Our credit spreads remain among the lowest in the REIT industry, and our leverage continues to decline with net debt-to-total market ca off approximately 26% and debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 5.5x. 
We currently have approximately $1.5 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow the company. 
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 91st time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over 1 year ago. We've increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. We are proud to be one of only 5 REITs in the S&P high-yield dividend Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83.5% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. 
To wrap it up, we've had another good start to the year, our portfolio remains healthy, our growth prospects are attractive and our balanced sheet remains in excellent shape. We continue to be well positioned to capitalize on the highest quality acquisition opportunities, given our sector-leading cost of capital and financial flexibility. These strengths of our business should continue to position us to generate dependable dividends that grow over time.

But those tenants, many of them are strong discount merchandisers that are doing very well. So we're comfortable with the larger boxes. On the grocery side, you mentioned, that's a business we like quite a bit. 95% of grocery sales occur in brick-and-mortar locations, and we are aligned with some of the top operators in the country and the top regional operators there. So that's an area where we're comfortable owning big boxes. And you'll see some properties that are even at 40,000 up to even 65,000, 70,000 square feet range."

And that tenants extended their lease term by a factor of 2x. So when we have those opportunities, we would like to deploy capital with those sort of returns and qualitative results as well. So looking forward, we'll continue to have some of that. It won't be a huge number, but I wouldn't be surprised if we have other quarters right at the same amount or even a little bit higher."

We don't have a target for investment grade. We went from 47% to 45%. That's primarily a result of the Diageo completing their exit on our lease on the something, Vineyards in Napa Valley and treasury outlined states picking up that lease now that they've bought those operations from Diageo. Treasury is the largest vendor, publicly traded vendor in the world. Has a market cap at about $9 billion. It's not rated. It's credit metrics in terms of debt to EBITDA are actually stronger than Diageo's. It's not as large as a company as Diageo, but we're very comfortable with that investment. We're comfortable with our tenants in the top 20 and outside the top 20, both investment-grade and non-investment-grade. So I think you'll continue to see the investment-grade number kind of fluctuate. If the Rite Aid/Walgreens merger happens, it'll tick up about 1.8%. But it'll ebb and flow in this general area I think. Our acquisitions in the first quarter were about 67%, 68% investment-grade. So as long as we continue to stay at that level, we will slowly pull up, but it's not something we'll do consciously. It's sort of to get that investment grade rated tenant and a really good property underwritten conservatively."

We completed $371 million of acquisitions, maintained high portfolio occupancy at 98.3% and raised $1.5 billion of permanent and long-term capital at favorable pricing. 
Our balance sheet strength positions us to continue pursuing the highest-quality net lease properties in the marketplace, while securing attractive returns and investment spreads, given our sector-leading cost of capital.

Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $1.4 million to $59.3 million. This decrease is primarily driven by the recognition of a $1.3 million noncash gain on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused the decrease in net liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of noncash swap gains or losses to calculate AFFO. 
Interest expense this quarter was also impacted by the recording of approximately 1 month or $2.3 million of preferred dividend as interest expense. Since the redemption notice for our preferred stock was issued before quarter end, we were required to reclassify the preferred stock as a liability at that time and then recognize about a month of preferred dividend as interest expense. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.7% for the quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. 
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.7% in the first quarter. We tend to experience slightly higher property expenses in the first quarter, but we continue to expect nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues to be in the 1.5% to 2% range for all of 2017.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.71 for the quarter versus $0.68 a year ago. FFO per share was impacted by a $13.4 million or $0.05 per share noncash redemption charge related to the unamortized original issuance costs associated with our preferred F shares. Excluding this noncash charge, FFO per share would have been $0.76 for the quarter.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share, representing an 8.6% increase over the year ago period. 
Briefly turning to the balanced sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As John mentioned, year-to-date, we have raised approximately $1.5 billion of well-priced long-term capital to fund our acquisition activity and retire over $400 million of high-coupon preferred stock. 
Our senior unsecured bonds now have a weighted average remaining maturity of 8.1 years, and our fixed-charge coverage ratio is now 4.5x. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $38 million of mortgage debt. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $276 million of debt coming due later this year, and our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. 
And finally, our overall leverage remains modest, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.5x. 
In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John."
339305,423411834,1178339,"Realty Income Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2017",2017-04-26,"Earnings Calls","Realty Income Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter and up 50 basis points from a year ago. We expect our occupancy to remain at",509,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. 
Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter and up 50 basis points from a year ago. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the quarter, we re-leased 49 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is above our long-term average. This quarter was the third consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.6% during the quarter primarily due to higher percentage rent. 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. 
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.8% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11.1% of rental revenue. We remain comfortable with the momentum in the drugstore industry and continue to view our exposure favorably given the industry's attractive demographic tailwinds, nondiscretionary nature and continued growth from in-store pharmacy pickup.
Additionally, Walgreens and CVS, our top 2 drugstore tenants, have generated 15 consecutive quarters of positive same-store pharmacy sales growth. 
During the quarter, we added Kroger to our top 20 tenants, representing 1.2% of our annualized rental revenue. We are pleased with our Kroger locations and the addition of this high-quality, investment grade-rated grocery chain, which we view as one of the better operators in the industry. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade tenants. 
The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our 4-wall weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x, and the median is 2.7x.
Moving on to acquisitions briefly before handing it over to Sumit. We completed $371 million in acquisitions during the quarter, and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. 
During the quarter, we sourced $10.8 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain deliberate in our investment strategy, acquiring only 3% of the amount sourced.
Our selectivity reflects our focus on quality. We continue to expect to complete $1 billion of acquisitions in 2017. As a reminder, this estimate primarily reflects our typical flow of business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss acquisitions and dispositions."

During the first quarter of 2017, we invested $371 million in 60 properties located in 18 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.4 years. 
On a revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 98.7% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 1.3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, automotive services and motor vehicle dealerships. We closed 11 discrete transactions in the first quarter. 
The transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $11 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volume sourced were portfolios, and 46% or more than $5 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 28% for the first quarter. Of the $371 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 23% were one-off transactions. 
As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the first quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 195 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical averages. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
Regarding dispositions. During the first quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $31.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.8%. 
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

Additionally, with the highest credit rating in the net lease sector, we issued $700 million in fixed-rate unsecured debt with a weighted average term of 18.3 years and a yield at 4.1%. Our credit spreads remain among the lowest in the REIT industry, and our leverage continues to decline, with net debt-to-total market cap of approximately 26% and debt to EBITDA of approximately 5.5x. 
We currently have approximately $1.5 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow the company. 
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 91st time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over 1 year ago. We've increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. We're proud to be one of only 5 REITs in the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83.5% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. 
To wrap it up, we've had another good start to the year. Our portfolio remains healthy, our growth prospects are attractive, and our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. We continue to be well positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality acquisition opportunities given our sector-leading cost of capital and financial flexibility. These strengths of our business should continue to position us to generate dependable dividends that grow over time.

The cap rates are a bit more sticky, and they lag by a quarter or 2. And you need to see some more stability of interest rates at a certain level.

We're comfortable with our tenants in the top 20 and outside the top 20, both investment grade and non-investment grade. So I think you'll continue to see the investment-grade number kind of fluctuate. If the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger happens, it'll tick up about 1.8%. But it'll ebb and flow in this general area, I think. Our acquisitions in the first quarter were about 67%, 68% investment grade. So as long as we continue to stay at that level, it will slowly pull up, but it's not something we do consciously.

Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $1.4 million to $59.3 million.

Interest expense this quarter was also impacted by the recording of approximately 1 month or $2.3 million of preferred dividend as interest expense. Since the redemption notice for our preferred stock was issued before quarter end, we were required to reclassify the preferred stock as a liability at that time and then recognize about a month of preferred dividend as interest expense. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.7% for the quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. 
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.7% in the first quarter. We tend to experience slightly higher property expenses in the first quarter, but we continue to expect nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues to be in the 1.5% to 2% range for all of 2017.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.71 for the quarter versus $0.68 a year ago. FFO per share was impacted by a $13.4 million or $0.05 per share noncash redemption charge related to the unamortized original issuance costs associated with our preferred F shares. Excluding this noncash charge, FFO per share would have been $0.76 for the quarter.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share, representing an 8.6% increase over the year ago period. 
Briefly turning to the balanced sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As John mentioned, year-to-date, we have raised approximately $1.5 billion of well-priced long-term capital to fund our acquisition activity and retired over $400 million of high-coupon preferred stock. 
Our senior unsecured bonds now have a weighted average remaining maturity of 8.1 years, and our fixed-charge coverage ratio is now 4.5x. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $38 million of mortgage debt. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $276 million of debt coming due later this year, and our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. 
And finally, our overall leverage remains modest, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.5x. 
In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter and up 50 basis points from a year ago. We expect our occupancy to remain at",508,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. 
Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter and up 50 basis points from a year ago. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the quarter, we re-leased 49 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is above our long-term average. This quarter was the third consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.6% during the quarter, primarily due to higher percentage rent. 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties, at about 13% of rental revenue. 
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.8% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11.1% of rental revenue. We remain comfortable with the momentum in the drugstore industry and continue to view our exposure favorably given the industry's attractive demographic tailwinds, nondiscretionary nature and continued growth from in-store pharmacy pickup.
Additionally, Walgreens and CVS, our top 2 drugstore tenants, have generated 15 consecutive quarters of positive same-store pharmacy sales growth. 
During the quarter, we added Kroger to our top 20 tenants, representing 1.2% of our annualized rental revenue. We are pleased with our Kroger locations and the addition of this high-quality, investment-grade-rated grocery chain, which we view as one of the better operators in the industry. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade tenants. 
The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our 4-wall weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x, and the median is 2.7x.
Moving on to acquisitions briefly before handing it over to Sumit. We completed $371 million in acquisitions during the quarter, and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. 
During the quarter, we sourced $10.8 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain deliberate in our investment strategy, acquiring only 3% of the amount sourced.
Our selectivity reflects our focus on quality. We continue to expect to complete $1 billion of acquisitions in 2017. As a reminder, this estimate primarily reflects our typical flow of business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss acquisitions and dispositions."

During the first quarter of 2017, we invested $371 million in 60 properties located in 18 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.4 years. 
On a revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 98.7% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 1.3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, automotive services and motor vehicle dealerships. We closed 11 discrete transactions in the first quarter. 
The transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $11 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volume sourced were portfolios, and 46% or more than $5 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 28% for the first quarter. Of the $371 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 23% were one-off transactions. 
As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the first quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 195 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical averages. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
Regarding dispositions. During the first quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $31.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.8%. 
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We issued approximately $800 million in common equity at an average price to investors of approximately $62 per share. 
Additionally, with the highest credit rating in the net lease sector, we issued $700 million in fixed-rate unsecured debt with a weighted average term of 18.3 years and a yield at 4.1%. Our credit spreads remain among the lowest in the REIT industry, and our leverage continues to decline, with net debt-to-total market cap of approximately 26% and debt to EBITDA of approximately 5.5x. 
We currently have approximately $1.5 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow the company. 
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 91st time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over 1 year ago. We've increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. We're proud to be one of only 5 REITs in the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83.5% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. 
To wrap it up, we've had another good start to the year. Our portfolio remains healthy, our growth prospects are attractive and our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. We continue to be well positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality acquisition opportunities given our sector-leading cost of capital and financial flexibility. These strengths of our business should continue to position us to generate dependable dividends that grow over time.

Bond prices and yields, bond yields can move 10 bps in a day or greater than that. That just doesn't happen in the real estate market. The cap rates are a bit more sticky, and they lag by a quarter or 2. And you need to see some more stability of interest rates at a certain level. Just because they tick up to -- the 10-year ticks up to 2.70% per week and back down to -- and holds for several weeks and then it ends up within a few days back to 2.30%, that's not really going to drive cap rates.

We're comfortable with our tenants in the top 20 and outside the top 20, both investment grade and non-investment grade. So I think you'll continue to see the investment-grade number kind of fluctuate. If the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger happens, it'll tick up about 1.8%. But it'll ebb and flow in this general area, I think. Our acquisitions in the first quarter were about 67%, 68% investment grade.

Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $1.4 million to $59.3 million. This decrease is primarily driven by the recognition of a $1.3 million noncash gain on interest rate swaps during the quarter, which caused the decrease in net liability and lowered our interest expense. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of noncash swap gains or losses to calculate AFFO. 
Interest expense this quarter was also impacted by the recording of approximately 1 month or $2.3 million of preferred dividend as interest expense. Since the redemption notice for our preferred stock was issued before quarter end, we were required to reclassify the preferred stock as a liability at that time and then recognize about a month of preferred dividend as interest expense. 
Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.7% for the quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. 
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.7% in the first quarter. We tend to experience slightly higher property expenses in the first quarter, but we continue to expect nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues to be in the 1.5% to 2% range for all of 2017.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.71 for the quarter versus $0.68 a year ago. FFO per share was impacted by a $13.4 million or $0.05 per share noncash redemption charge related to the unamortized original issuance costs associated with our preferred F shares. Excluding this noncash charge, FFO per share would have been $0.76 for the quarter.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share, representing an 8.6% increase over the year-ago period. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As John mentioned, year-to-date, we have raised approximately $1.5 billion of well-priced long-term capital to fund our acquisition activity and retired over $400 million of high-coupon preferred stock. 
Our senior unsecured bonds now have a weighted average remaining maturity of 8.1 years, and our fixed-charge coverage ratio is now 4.5x. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $38 million of mortgage debt. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $276 million of debt coming due later this year, and our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. 
And finally, our overall leverage remains modest, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.5x. 
In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. 
Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged from last quarter and up 50 basis points from a year ago. We expect our occupancy to remain at approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the quarter, we re-leased 49 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is above our long-term average. This quarter was the third consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 1.6% during the quarter, primarily due to higher percentage rent. 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and, to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties, at about 13% of rental revenue. 
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.8% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11.1% of rental revenue. We remain comfortable with the momentum in the drugstore industry and continue to view our exposure favorably given the industry's attractive demographic tailwinds, nondiscretionary nature and continued growth from in-store pharmacy pickup.
Additionally, Walgreens and CVS, our top 2 drugstore tenants, have generated 15 consecutive quarters of positive same-store pharmacy sales growth. 
During the quarter, we added Kroger to our top 20 tenants, representing 1.2% of our annualized rental revenue. We are pleased with our Kroger locations and the addition of this high-quality, investment-grade-rated grocery chain, which we view as one of the better operators in the industry. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade tenants. 
The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our 4-wall weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x, and the median is 2.7x.
Moving on to acquisitions briefly before handing it over to Sumit. We completed $371 million in acquisitions during the quarter, and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. 
During the quarter, we sourced $10.8 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain deliberate in our investment strategy, acquiring only 3% of the amount sourced.
Our selectivity reflects our focus on quality. We continue to expect to complete $1 billion of acquisitions in 2017. As a reminder, this estimate primarily reflects our typical flow of business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss acquisitions and dispositions."

During the first quarter of 2017, we invested $371 million in 60 properties located in 18 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.4 years. 
On a revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 98.7% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 1.3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, automotive services and motor vehicle dealerships. We closed 11 discrete transactions in the first quarter. 
The transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $11 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volume sourced were portfolios, and 46% or more than $5 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 28% for the first quarter. Of the $371 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 23% were one-off transactions. 
As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the first quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 195 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical averages. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
Regarding dispositions. During the first quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $31.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.8%. 
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million.

We currently have approximately $1.5 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow the company. 
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 91st time in the company's history. The current annualized dividend represents a 6% increase over 1 year ago. We've increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. We're proud to be one of only 5 REITs in the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83.5% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. 
To wrap it up, we've had another good start to the year. Our portfolio remains healthy, our growth prospects are attractive and our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. We continue to be well positioned to capitalize on the highest-quality acquisition opportunities given our sector-leading cost of capital and financial flexibility. These strengths of our business should continue to position us to generate dependable dividends that grow over time. 
At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?"

Cap rates have always followed the cost of capital. When our cost of capital was 10%, we were buying assets at caps of 11.5%. So there's always a lag period, though. Bond prices and yields, bond yields can move 10 bps in a day or greater than that. That just doesn't happen in the real estate market. The cap rates are a bit more sticky, and they lag by a quarter or 2. And you need to see some more stability of interest rates at a certain level. Just because they tick up to -- the 10-year ticks up to 2.70% per week and back down to -- and holds for several weeks and then it ends up within a few days back to 2.30%, that's not really going to drive cap rates. You're going to need to see it -- see rates stay at a sustained higher level. And then you'll see, with a lag period, cap rates move."

And that's primarily a result of Diageo completing their exit on our lease on the wineries and vineyards in Napa Valley and Treasury Wine Estates picking up that lease now that they've bought those operations from Diageo. Treasury is the largest vendor -- publicly traded vendor in the world, has a market cap at about $9 billion. It's not rated. Its credit metrics in terms of debt to EBITDA are actually stronger than Diageo's. It's not as large of a company as Diageo, but we're very comfortable with that investment. We're comfortable with our tenants in the top 20 and outside the top 20, both investment grade and non-investment grade. So I think you'll continue to see the investment-grade number kind of fluctuate. If the Rite Aid-Walgreens merger happens, it'll tick up about 1.8%. But it'll ebb and flow in this general area, I think. Our acquisitions in the first quarter were about 67%, 68% investment grade. So as long as we continue to stay at that level, it will slowly pull it up, but it's not something we do consciously. It's sort of gravy to get that investment grade-rated tenant and a really good property underwritten conservatively."

Interest expense increased in the quarter by $6.3 million to $63.7 million. This increase is primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the second quarter following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term unsecured bonds. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.5% for the quarter and 5.1% year-to-date. We are still projecting approximately 5% for the year and we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease sector.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.6% in the quarter. Our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.75 for the quarter versus $0.70 a year ago. We are revising our 2017 FFO guidance to a range of $2.96 to $3.16 per share. Our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition which includes various noncash items such as quarterly interest rate swap, gains or losses, amortization of lease intangibles and the $0.05 charge incurred in connection with the redemption of our Series F preferred stock in April. This $0.05 preferred stock charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance. 
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, were the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 for the quarter, representing a 7% increase over the year-ago period. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $55.1 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years, and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.4x. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $213 million of debt coming due in the remainder of this year and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. And finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.6x. 
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on our results."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.5%, the highest occupancy we have achieved in 10 years. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98",672,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.5%, the highest occupancy we have achieved in 10 years. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the quarter, we re-leased 53 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 113% of expiring rent, which is well above our long-term average. This quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. 
For the first half of 2017, we have re-leased 102 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 109% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 0.4% during the quarter, primarily due to the timing of percentage rent increases on a year-over-year basis. For the first half of the year, our same-store rent increased by 1%, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2017.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant industry and geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries, located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue and drug stores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. As you all know, due to the regulatory concerns, Walgreens terminated its agreement to purchase Rite Aid and instead plans to purchase about 2,200 Rite Aid stores. While the proposal may still clear regulatory approval, the completion of the transaction would have benefits for both companies. Walgreens would fill in gaps in its geographic footprint and achieve additional financial and operational synergies. And Rite Aid has stated it would deleverage balance sheet, and it would remain the third largest player in the industry, while gaining access to Walgreens' purchasing network.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristic allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environment. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not share these characteristics. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remain sound. 
Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x on a 4-wall basis, and the median remains 2.7x. Our watch list has declined by approximately 15 basis points and remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $321 million in acquisitions during the quarter at attractive investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we source. 
Our low cost of capital allows us to simultaneously acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in the investment pipeline, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2017. We now expect to complete approximately $1.5 billion of acquisitions, an increase from our prior estimate of $1 billion. This estimate does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
I want to hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

On a revenue basis, approximately 33% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 91% of the revenues are generated from retail and 9% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are: health and fitness, quick service restaurants and theaters. 
We closed 26 discrete transactions in the second quarter. 
Year-to-date 2017, we invested $692 million in 126 properties located in 30 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3%, and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years.

Of the 37 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 2 transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $18 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 46% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 54%, or approximately $10 billion, were oneoff assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 35% for the second quarter. Of the $321 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 72% were oneoff transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships, developed over 48 years of operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the second quarter with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 221 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
Regarding dispositions. During the second quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $12.3 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6%, and realized and unlevered IRR of 9.5%. This brings us to 28 properties sold year-to-date for $43.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.9%, and realized and unlevered IRR of 9.7%. 
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

And we do that because those types of tenants have been much more resistant to the impact of e-commerce. So we've not changed our investment parameters on the retail front or on the industrial front. We continue to adhere to those investment parameters. And when you look at the selectivity, as I've said just a moment ago, we're not increasing the percentage of opportunities we see in terms of what we're closing on. Over the last few years, that's averaged probably 8%, and this year we're running at 4%. Again, I think that selectivity metric is something the market can look at and be comfortable that we're not changing our investment parameters."

Interest expense increased in the quarter by $6.3 million to $63.7 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the second quarter following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term unsecured bonds. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.5% for the quarter and 5.1% year-to-date. We are still projecting approximately 5% for the year and we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease sector.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.6% in the quarter. Our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.75 for the quarter versus $0.70 a year ago. We are revising our 2017 FFO guidance to a range of $2.96 to $3.01 per share. Our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition, which includes various noncash items such as quarterly interest rate swap, gains or losses, amortization of lease intangibles and the $0.05 charge incurred in connection with the redemption of our Series F preferred stock in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance. 
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, for the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share for the quarter, representing a 7% increase over the year ago period. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $55.1 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.4x. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $213 million of debt coming due in the remainder of this year and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. And finally, our overall leverage remains modest, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.6x. 
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively-priced equity and debt capital. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on our results."
339305,528703130,1256322,"Realty Income Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2017",2017-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Realty Income Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.5%, the highest occupancy we have achieved in 10 years. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 9",671,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.5%, the highest occupancy we have achieved in 10 years. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the quarter, we re-leased 53 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 113% of expiring rent, which is well above our long-term average. This quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. 
For the first half of 2017, we re-leased 102 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 109% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 0.4% during the quarter, primarily due to the timing of percentage rent increases on a year-over-year basis. For the first half of the year, our same-store rent increased by 1%, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2017.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry and geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries, located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue and drug stores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. As you all know, due to the regulatory concerns, Walgreens terminated its agreement to purchase Rite Aid and instead plans to purchase about 2,200 Rite Aid stores. While the proposal must still clear regulatory approval, the completion of the transaction would have benefits for both companies. Walgreens would fill in gaps in its geographic footprint and achieve additional financial and operational synergies. And Rite Aid has stated it would deleverage balance sheet, and it would remain the third largest player in the industry, while gaining access to Walgreens' purchasing network.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not share these characteristics. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. 
Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x on a four-wall basis, and the median remains 2.7x. Our watch list has declined by approximately 15 basis points and remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $321 million in acquisitions during the quarter at attractive investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we source. 
Our low cost of capital allows us to simultaneously acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in the investment pipeline, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2017. We now expect to complete approximately $1.5 billion of acquisitions, an increase from our prior estimate of $1 billion. This estimate does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
Now I want to hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the second quarter of 2017, we invested $321 million in 73 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 13 years. 
On a revenue basis, approximately 33% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 91% of the revenues are generated from retail and 9% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, quick service restaurants and theaters. 
We closed 26 discrete transactions in the second quarter. 
Year-to-date 2017, we invested $692 million in 126 properties located in 30 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. 
On a revenue basis, 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 34 different tenants in 20 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, automotive services and health and fitness. 
Of the 37 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 2 transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $18 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 46% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 54%, or approximately $10 billion, were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 35% for the second quarter. Of the $321 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 72% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships, developed over 48 years of operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the second quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 221 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
Regarding dispositions. During the second quarter, we sold 14 properties with net proceeds of $12.3 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.5%. This brings us to 28 properties sold year-to-date for $43.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.7%. 
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's operating performance and remain confident in our outlook. Our real estate portfolio is performing well, our acquisition pipeline is robust, and our balance sheet is conservatively capitalized. Our cost of capital remains a competitive advantage in the net lease industry, which we believe allows us to continue generating favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.

And I think it just speaks to the portfolio, the health of the tenants, the quality of the properties, and specifically, those tenants' operations at those specific properties. So we've been pleased with it. Over the life of the company, we have had recapture rates right at about 100%, just a hair below, I think it's 99.4%. So realizing these recapture rates in the 113% range, very healthy. And I think it speaks to the quality and health of the portfolio. I'll tell you, we have a tremendous team in our portfolio management group that is working these properties, in some cases, years in advance, negotiating with our tenants to retain them in those assets, and it makes sense for their business, but also for our business. So it's been a real focus of ours over the last several years and one which we continue to have. And we hope it will yield similar results. It will vary from quarter-to-quarter, but the trend certainly has been positive for us."

So we're having conversations with other tenants beyond Gander for those properties that may yield a better result than what Gander's staying would be. So clearly, they'll stay in a handful and we'll see what happens to the others. We've been -- we're current on Gander rent through the month of July. And we have factored, I think fairly conservatively, our expectations of the impact of Gander into our guidance for this year. And so we're not expecting any surprises from that standpoint.

And then the lease terms were slightly longer in the first quarter than the 13-year term that we had in the second quarter. And hence, you had a bit of a pricing differential on cap rate. But year-to-date, the leasing terms of 15 years, and over the course of the last 3 or 4 years, our lease terms, by quarter, vary quite a bit. Sometime they'd been as low as 10 years and as high as 17 years. So coming in at 15 year-to-date is fine. And the cap rate, we're still guiding to something for the year in the low 6s.

Interest expense increased in the quarter by $6.3 million to $63.7 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the second quarter following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term unsecured bonds. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.5% for the quarter and 5.1% year-to-date. We are still projecting approximately 5% for the year, and we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease sector.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.6% in the quarter. Our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.75 for the quarter versus $0.70 a year ago. We are revising our 2017 FFO guidance to a range of $2.96 to $3.01 per share. Our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition, which includes various noncash items such as quarterly interest rate swap, gains or losses, amortization of lease intangibles and the $0.05 charge incurred in connection with the redemption of our Series F preferred stock in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance. 
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share for the quarter, representing a 7% increase over the year-ago period. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $55.1 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years, and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.4x. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $213 million of debt coming due in the remainder of this year, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. And finally, our overall leverage remains modest, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.6x. 
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on our results."

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.5%, the highest occupancy we have achieved in 10 years. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the quarter, we re-leased 53 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 113% of expiring rent, which is well above our long-term average. This quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. 
For the first half of 2017, we re-leased 102 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 109% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 0.4% during the quarter, primarily due to the timing of percentage rent increases on a year-over-year basis. For the first half of the year, our same-store rent increased by 1%, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2017.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry and geography and, to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties, at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant, at 6.7% of rental revenue, and drug stores remain our largest industry, at 11% of rental revenue. As you all know, due to regulatory concerns, Walgreens terminated its agreement to purchase Rite Aid and instead plans to purchase about 2,200 Rite Aid stores. While the proposal must still clear regulatory approval, the completion of the transaction would have benefits for both companies. Walgreens would fill in gaps in its geographic footprint and achieve additional financial and operational synergies. And Rite Aid has stated it would delever its balance sheet, and it would remain the third largest player in the industry, while gaining access to Walgreens' purchasing network.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not share these characteristics. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. 
Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x on a four-wall basis, and the median remains 2.7x. Our watch list has declined by approximately 15 basis points and remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $321 million in acquisitions during the quarter at attractive investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we source. 
Our low cost of capital allows us to simultaneously acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in the investment pipeline, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2017. We now expect to complete approximately $1.5 billion of acquisitions, an increase from our prior estimate of $1 billion. This estimate does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the second quarter of 2017, we invested $321 million in 73 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 13 years. 
On a revenue basis, approximately 33% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 91% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 9% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, quick-service restaurants and theaters. 
We closed 26 discrete transactions in the second quarter. 
Year-to-date 2017, we invested $692 million in 126 properties located in 30 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. 
On a revenue basis, 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 95% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 5% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 34 different tenants in 20 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, automotive services and health and fitness. 
Of the 37 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 2 transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $18 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 46% of the volumes sourced were portfolios; and 54%, or approximately $10 billion, were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 35% for the second quarter. Of the $321 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 72% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over 48 years of operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain flat in the second quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 221 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
Regarding dispositions. During the second quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $12.3 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.5%. This brings us to 28 properties sold year-to-date for $43.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.7%. 
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's operating performance and remain confident in our outlook. Our real estate portfolio is performing well; our acquisition pipeline is robust, and our balance sheet is conservatively capitalized. Our cost of capital remains a competitive advantage in the net lease industry, which we believe allows us to continue generating favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.

They've been a tenant of hours for a long time. We're in discussions with them. The list that are being put out there I'd say aren't always completely accurate. But in some cases, Gander may want to stay but not at a rent level that makes sense for us. So we're having conversations with other tenants beyond Gander for those properties that may yield a better result than what Gander's staying would be. So clearly, they'll stay in a handful, and we'll see what happens to the others. We've been -- we're current on Gander rent through the month of July. And we have factored, I think fairly conservatively, our expectations of the impact of Gander into our guidance for this year. And so we're not expecting any surprises from that standpoint. And collectively on an annualized basis, Gander is less than 0.5% of 1% of our rent. So that's not completely insignificant, but it's not a large material issue for us. And we think the locations that we have are attractive, in major metropolitan areas. And again, we're seeing good interest from other tenants in those locations. So I think we're going to be fine there."

One is we did more investment grade in the first quarter than we did in the second quarter, and that's really a function of the opportunities available to invest in, in the market. And then the lease terms were slightly longer in the first quarter than the 13-year term that we had in the second quarter. And hence, you had a bit of a pricing differential on cap rate. But year-to-date, the leasing terms of 15 years. And over the course of the last 3 or 4 years, our lease terms by quarter vary quite a bit. Sometime they'd been as low as 10 years and as high as 17 years. So coming in at 15 year-to-date is fine. And the cap rate, we're still guiding to something for the year in the low 6s. And what'll impact that is just simply -- the quality of the properties in both quarters were very strong. And when you do get investment grade on top of strong real estate location with strong operating metrics, you are going -- that is going to be reflected in a more aggressive cap rate."

Interest expense increased in the quarter by $6.3 million to $63.7 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the second quarter following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term unsecured bonds. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.5% for the quarter and 5.1% year-to-date. We are still projecting approximately 5% for the year, and we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease sector.
Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.6% in the quarter. Our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.75 for the quarter versus $0.70 a year ago. We are revising our 2017 FFO guidance to a range of $2.96 to $3.01 per share. Our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition, which includes various noncash items such as quarterly interest rate swap, gains or losses, amortization of lease intangibles and the $0.05 charge incurred in connection with the redemption of our Series F preferred stock in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance. 
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.76 per share for the quarter, representing a 7% increase over the year ago period. 
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $55.1 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years, and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.4x. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $213 million of debt coming due in the remainder of this year, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. And finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.6x. 
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on our results."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.5%, the highest occupancy we have achieved in 10 years. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98%",669,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.5%, the highest occupancy we have achieved in 10 years. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2017. 
During the quarter, we re-leased 53 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 113% of expiring rent, which is well above our long-term average. This quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. 
For the first half of 2017, we re-leased 102 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing approximately 109% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to the companies in our sector who also report this metric. 
Our same-store rent increased 0.4% during the quarter, primarily due to the timing of percentage rent increases on a year-over-year basis. For the first half of the year, our same-store rent increased by 1%, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2017.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry and geography and, to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 250 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue, and drug stores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. As you all know, due to regulatory concerns, Walgreens terminated its agreement to purchase Rite Aid and instead plans to purchase about 2,200 Rite Aid stores. While the proposal must still clear regulatory approval, the completion of the transaction would have benefits for both companies. Walgreens would fill in gaps in its geographic footprint and achieve additional financial and operational synergies. And Rite Aid has stated it would delever its balance sheet, and it would remain the third largest player in the industry, while gaining access to Walgreens' purchasing network.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not share these characteristics. 
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. 
Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.8x on a four-wall basis, and the median remains 2.7x. Our watch list has declined by approximately 15 basis points and remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years. 
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $321 million in acquisitions during the quarter at attractive investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we source. 
Our low cost of capital allows us to simultaneously acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in the investment pipeline, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2017. We now expect to complete approximately $1.5 billion of acquisitions, an increase from our prior estimate of $1 billion. This estimate does not account for any unidentified large-scale transactions. 
Now let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions."

During the second quarter of 2017, we invested $321 million in 73 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 13 years. 
On a revenue basis, approximately 33% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 91% of the revenues are generated from retail and 9% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, quick-service restaurants and theaters. 
We closed 26 discrete transactions in the second quarter. 
Year-to-date 2017, we invested $692 million in 126 properties located in 30 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. 
On a revenue basis, 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 34 different tenants in 20 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, automotive services and health and fitness. 
Of the 37 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 2 transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $18 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 46% of the volumes sourced were portfolios; and 54%, or approximately $10 billion, were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 35% for the second quarter. Of the $321 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 72% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over 48 years of operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain flat in the second quarter with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 221 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. 
Regarding dispositions. During the second quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of $12.3 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.5%. This brings us to 28 properties sold year-to-date for $43.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 9.7%. 
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

So the value creation exercise for the company and its shareholder. So we were pleased with that."

Sometime they'd been as low as 10 years and as high as 17 years. So coming in at 15 year-to-date is fine. And the cap rate, we're still guiding to something for the year in the low 6s. And what'll impact that is just simply -- the quality of the properties in both quarters were very strong. And when you do get investment grade on top of strong real estate location with strong operating metrics, you are going -- that is going to be reflected in a more aggressive cap rate."

Interest expense increased in the quarter by $10 million to $63 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the third quarter, following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term unsecured bonds as well as a smaller gain on our interest rate swaps recognized this quarter as compared to last quarter last year. Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 4.7% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, which is in line with our full year projection.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the REIT sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, were 1.8% in the quarter. And our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017.
Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.77 for the quarter, versus $0.73 a year ago. Our 2017 FFO guidance remains $2.96 to $3.01 per share. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT defined find FFO definition, which includes various noncash items, such as quarterly interest rate swaps, gains or losses, amortization of lease intangibles and the $0.05 charge incurred in connection with the redemption of our Series F preferred stock back in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.77 per share for the quarter, representing a 6.9% increase over the year-ago period.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $444 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years, and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.7x.
Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $1.3 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.
Finally, our overall leverage remains modest, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at 5.2x.
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital.
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on these results."

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged versus the year-ago period. We continue to expect occupancy to be at or above 98% in 2017.
During the quarter, we re-leased 79 properties, recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is notably above our long-term average. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%.
Year-to-date, we re-leased 181 properties, recapturing approximately 107% of expiring rent.
Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,500 properties, with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Our recapture rates reflected net effective rents as we saw them incur any improvements on leasing commissions. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric.
Our same-store rent increased 1% during the quarter, and for the year-to-date period, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2017.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow.
At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 251 commercial tenants and 47 different industries, located in 49 states in Puerto Rico.
80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial at about 13% of rental revenue. 
Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue.
We remained confident in the drugstore industry. And since peaking in 2010, the number of mail order prescriptions has declined each year, and that is coincided with Walgreens positive pharmacy same-store sales growth for 18 consecutive quarters.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments.
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not have these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. Store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound.
Both the median and weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties, 2.7x on a 4-wall basis. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range, as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels over the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $265 million of acquisitions during the quarter at near record investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters.
During the quarter, we sourced $6.7 billion in acquisitions opportunity, bringing us to $24.3 billion [indiscernible] year-to-date. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we've sourced. 
Our low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable, long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline, we are reiterating our 2017 acquisition's guidance of approximately $1.5 billion.

During the third quarter of 2017, we invested $265 million in 56 properties located in 16 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 7%, and with a weighted average lease term of 15.2 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 10% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased in 23 different tenants in 10 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are theaters, automotive services and quick service restaurants. We closed 13 discrete transactions in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, 2017, we invested $957 million in 177 properties located in 35 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 97% of the revenues are generated from retail and 3% are from industrial.
These assets are leased to 47 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, theaters and automotive services.
Of the 50 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million. With regards transactions flow, it continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately 7 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately 24 billion in potential transaction opportunities.
Of these opportunities, 49% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 51% or approximately $12 billion, were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 40% for the third quarter. Of the $265 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 19% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 48-year operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and noninvestment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted average cost of capital, remained healthy, averaging 263 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Regarding dispositions. During the third quarter, we sold 17 properties, for net proceeds of $25.5 million, at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized and unlevered IRR of 13.6%.
This brings us to 45 properties sold year-to-date for $69 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized and unlevered IRR of 10.9%.
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between 125 million and 175 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

So we are aware that AMC stock is not treated well recently. But our properties and our theaters are performing quite well. We like the experience, the nature of the theater business, and in particular, AMCs. It continues to be a low cost form of entertainment. As you know, the theaters have continued to upgrade. Their offerings with more comfortable sitting and better technology and full-service higher-quality food and beverage offerings. And as a result, they're seeing a rise in revenue. 2016 was a record year at the box office for the theater industry, so it's a tough comp year. Year-to-date, we're up about 5% from where we were at this time last year in terms of box office. But most industry experts believe we're going to see a strong fourth quarter, as a number of big blockbusters such as Star Wars, are released during the holidays. So they expect the underperformance this year to turn a little bit and become a bit more favorable. But we're very happy with our theaters. The vast majority of our AMCs have been rough retrofitted with better sitting, better technology and again, food and beverage offerings. So where that's been done, we've seen a 64% increase in revenues versus the pre-reconfiguration revenues for those AMCs.

With regard to the premium video on demand, there has been discussion in the sector to take it from potentially 90 days, which where it is today, down to 45 days for release time. 95% of ticket sales are in the first 40 days after a movie's theatrical release. So we don't think there will be a major impact on our theater business from the PVOD discussions that are taking place. In addition, theaters and studios are negotiating revenue-sharing arrangement with regard to that PVOD business. So the theater should be able to generate some incremental cash flow from that standpoint. So as you know, the theaters typically have given their higher drop to brea keven -- higher drop in sales to break even. They have lower coverage ratios. So something in the low 2s versus in our portfolio average or medium, which is at 2.8x. Because I have more ability to control variable costs, so the coverage once again -- can be a bit lower."

We -- first of all, we're invested in the 3 most significant players in the pharmacy market with Walgreens, TBS and Rite Aid. We have high quality real estate. We've got companies that are affiliated with pharmacy benefit managers, which drive high market shares. So they are barriers to entry here. They have well-developed retail and distribution -- that helps give them a competitive advantage and creates barriers to entry. One thing we've looked at is since 2010, we've looked at how mail order pharmacies have performed relative to brick and mortar pharmacies. And since 2010, the prescriptions dispensed through mail order pharmacies here have declined by 20%, and most of that has been picked up by the Walgreens and CVSs of the world. In addition, the regulation in the drugstore industry will make it difficult, we believe, for Amazon to penetrate easily the sector. So if you look at customers or pharmacies, you'll see that many of them are on short-term -- shorter-term prescriptions. And of the baby boom generation, maybe the older generation, and they like to how the face-to-face consultation with the pharmacists. So often, they prefer picking their prescriptions up in person and having a discussion with the expert on side effects or other issues related to their drugs. So that's something that is, I think, bodes well for the brick-and-mortar business. And Walgreens, as all of these is played out, and you're probably aware of this, Walgreens U.S. pharmacy same-store sales growth has been positive for the last 18 consecutive quarters. So they're doing quite well."

And Rite Aid will be more focused on the West Coast, as they sell more of what they sell to Walgreens is going to be along the eastern seaboard, which will allow Walgreens to fully develop its footprint there. So I think it's a win-win. Walgreens, with a significant synergies. And they're expecting to have maybe up to $400 million in synergies from this transaction in the first 3 to 4 years. And to have a bigger footprint, and they're more efficient company. And then, Rite Aid is still the third largest player, more focused out west, with a much better balance sheet.

Interest expense increased in the quarter by $10 million to $63 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the third quarter following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term, unsecured bonds as well as a smaller gain on our interest rate swaps recognized this quarter as compared to the last -- that quarter last year. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 4.7% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, which is in line with our full year projection.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.8% in the quarter, and our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.77 for the quarter versus $0.73 a year ago. Our 2017 FFO guidance remains $2.96 to $3.01 per share. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various noncash items, such as quarterly interest rate swaps, gains or losses; amortization of lease intangibles; and the $0.05 charge incurred in connection with the redemption of our Series F preferred stock back in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.77 per share for the quarter, representing a 6.9% increase over the year-ago period.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $444 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years, and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.7x.
Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $1.3 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.
Finally, our overall leverage remains modest, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at 5.2x. 
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital.
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on these results."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged versus the year-ago period.

Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged versus the year-ago period. We continue to expect occupancy to be at or above 98% in 2017.
During the quarter, we re-leased 79 properties, recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is notably above our long-term average. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Year-to-date, we re-leased 181 properties, recapturing approximately 107% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,500 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents as we seldom incur any improvements in leasing commissions. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric.
Our same-store rent increased 1% during the quarter and for the year-to-date period, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2017.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 251 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 
80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue.
We remain confident in the drugstore industry. Since peaking in 2010, the number of mail order prescriptions has declined each year, and that has coincided with Walgreens' positive pharmacy same-store sales growth for 18 consecutive quarters.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not have these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. Store level performance at our retail tenants also remain sound. Both the median and weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties are 2.7x on a 4-wall basis. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $265 million of acquisitions during the quarter at near-record investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.7 billion in acquisition opportunity, bringing us to $24.3 billion sourced year-to-date. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we've sourced. 
Our low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable, long-term returns while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline, we are reiterating our 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1.5 billion.
Now I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions [indiscernible]."

During the third quarter of 2017, we invested $265 million in 56 properties located in 16 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.2 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 10% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 10 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are theaters, automotive services and quick-service restaurants. We closed 13 discrete transactions in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, 2017, we invested $957 million in 177 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 97% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 47 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, theaters and automotive services.
Of the 50 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million. With regard to transactions flow, it continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 49% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 51% or approximately $12 billion were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 40% for the third quarter. Of the $265 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 19% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 48-year operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 263 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Regarding dispositions. During the third quarter, we sold 17 properties, for net proceeds of $25.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized and unlevered IRR of 13.6%. This brings us to 45 properties sold year-to-date for $69 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized and unlevered IRR of 10.9%.
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between 125 million and 175 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We currently have approximately $1.3 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company.
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 93rd time in the company's history. Our dividends year-to-date represent a 6% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%.
We're proud to be 1 of only 5 REITs at S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance.
To wrap it up, we're pleased with our company's financial position and operating performance and remain confident in the outlook for our business. Our real estate portfolio is performing well. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and our balance sheet is conservatively capitalized.

So we were pleased with the pricing for the quarter. It was about $58 on a gross basis, and it worked out well for us. But we'll continue to look at all equity raising alternatives in the future."

So the equity performance is a bit divorced from the performance of our theaters. So we're aware that the AMC stock has not traded well recently, but our properties and our theaters are performing quite well. We like the experiential nature of the theater business and in particular, AMCs. It continues to be a low-cost form of entertainment. As you know, the theaters have continued to upgrade their offerings with more comfortable sitting and better technology and full-service, higher-quality food and beverage offerings. And as a result, they're seeing a rise in revenue. 2016 was a record year at the box office for the theater industry, so it's a tough comp year. Year-to-date, we're off about 5% from where we were at this time last year in terms of box office. But most industry experts believe we're going to see a strong fourth quarter as a number of big blockbusters such as Star Wars are released during the holidays. So they expect the underperformance this year to turn a little bit and become a bit more favorable. But we're very happy with our theaters. The vast majority of our AMCs have been retrofitted with better sitting, better technology and again, food and beverage offerings. So where that's been done, we've seen a 64% increase in revenues versus the prereconfiguration revenues for those AMCs. So it really comes down to picking the right properties having strong underwriting structures, and we're pleased with that."

I guess how did you underwrite those from a rent coverage perspective? Certainly, where they are today? And arguably, I would assume rent coverages have declined during the year as box office has declined. And then how did you get comfortable? And I know you talked a lot about the positives that a lot of the theater operators are doing to their assets. But at some point, premium video on demand is going to come, and it's hard to imagine how that's not somewhat impactful to the 4-wall profitability in the theater even if the exhibitors get mid-hole. So how do you get comfortable with the potential rent, ultimately, on renewal if what the exhibitor is generating in those 4 walls would be less?"

So we've seen on our theaters the rent coverage ratios actually improving. And we underwrote these particular theaters that we acquired in the third quarter based on the strong cash flow coverages, high quality of real estate and the fact that they had been renovated. So they were performing quite well. With regard to the premium video on demand, there has been discussion in the sector to take it from potentially 90 days, which is where it is today, down to 45 days for release time. 95% of ticket sales are in the first 40 days after a movie's theatrical release. So we don't think there'll be a major impact on our theater business from the PVOD discussions that are taking place. In addition, theaters and studios are negotiating revenue-sharing arrangement with regard to that PVOD business, so the theater should be able to generate some incremental cash flow from that standpoint. So the -- as you know, the theaters typically have, given their higher drop to break even -- higher drop in sales to break even, they have lower coverage ratios. So something in the low 2s versus in our portfolio average or medium, which is at 2.8x. Because they have more ability to control variable cost so the coverage is -- once again, can be a bit lower."

We've acquired some office over the years in larger portfolio transactions, and we look to reduce our office exposure. It is nonstrategic.

Of course, it's something we've been considering and discussing and analyzing for quite some time now. We -- first of all, we're invested in the 3 most significant players in the pharmacy market with Walgreens, CVS and then Rite Aid. We have high-quality real estate. We've got companies that are affiliated with pharmacy benefit managers, which drive high market shares. So there are barriers to entry here. They have well-developed retail and distribution that helps give them a competitive advantage and creates barriers to entry. One thing we've looked at is since 2010, we've looked at how mail order pharmacies have performed relative to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. And since 2010, the prescriptions dispensed through mail order pharmacies has -- have declined by 20%, and most of that has been picked up by the Walgreens and CVSs of the world. In addition, the regulation in the drugstore industry will make it difficult, we believe, for Amazon to penetrate easily this sector. So if you look at customers of pharmacies, you'll see that many of them are on short term -- shorter-term prescriptions. And the -- of the baby boom generation, maybe the older generation, and they like to have the face-to-face consultation with the pharmacists. So often, they prefer picking their prescriptions up in person and having a discussion with the expert on side effects or other issues related to their drugs. So that's something that is, I think, bodes well for the brick-and-mortar business. And Walgreens, as all of this has played out, and you're probably aware of this, Walgreens' U.S. pharmacy same-store sales growth has been positive for the last 18 consecutive quarters.

So what we -- you don't want to do is keep on the books nonstrategic assets that are potentially creating a drag for the company -- or are creating a drag when we can take that capital and reinvest it in the properties that are higher-quality and meet our investment parameters. That being said, on these vacant asset sales, we're generating unlevered IRRs of roughly 10% or so. So these have been profitable investments. It's just that they've become a bit obsolete in some cases or maybe the real estate markets surrounding these assets have changed. Maybe the most logical uses for the markets don't make sense anymore. So I would expect us to continue to sell that, what I would say, vacant -- the vacant assets that are stale and no longer strategic to our investment philosophy."

Rite Aid is going to take its debt to EBITDA from 7.5x down to approximately 4.5x. And they're also going to have access to Walgreens' purchasing network. And Rite Aid will be more focused on the West Coast as they sell -- more of what they sell to Walgreens is going to be along the eastern seaboard, which will allow Walgreens to fully develop its footprint there. So I think it's a win-win. Walgreens comes out with significant synergies. They're expecting to have maybe up to $400 million in synergies from this transaction in the first 3 to 4 years. And they have a bigger footprint, and they're a more efficient company. And then Rite Aid is still the third largest player, more focused out west, with a much better balance sheet.

Interest expense increased in the quarter by $10 million to $63 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the third quarter following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term, unsecured bonds as well as a smaller gain on our interest rate swaps recognized this quarter as compared to the last -- that quarter last year. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 4.7% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, which is in line with our full year projection.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.8% in the quarter, and our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.77 for the quarter versus $0.73 a year ago. Our 2017 FFO guidance remains $2.96 to $3.01 per share. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various noncash items, such as quarterly interest rate swaps, gains or losses; amortization of lease intangibles; and the $0.05 charge incurred in connection with the redemption of our Series F preferred stock back in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.77 per share for the quarter, representing a 6.9% increase over the year-ago period.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $444 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years, and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.7x.
Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $1.3 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.
Finally, our overall leverage remains modest, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at 5.2x. 
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital.
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on these results."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged versus the year-ago period. We continue to expect occupancy to be at or above 98% in 2017.Durin",570,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged versus the year-ago period. We continue to expect occupancy to be at or above 98% in 2017.
During the quarter, we re-leased 79 properties, recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is notably above our long-term average. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Year-to-date, we re-leased 181 properties, recapturing approximately 107% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,500 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents as we seldom incur any improvements in leasing commissions. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric.
Our same-store rent increased 1% during the quarter and for the year-to-date period, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2017.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 251 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 
80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue.
We remain confident in the drugstore industry. Since peaking in 2010, the number of mail order prescriptions has declined each year, and that has coincided with Walgreens' positive pharmacy same-store sales growth for 18 consecutive quarters.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not have these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. Store level performance at our retail tenants also remain sound. Both the median and weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties are 2.7x on a 4-wall basis. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $265 million of acquisitions during the quarter at near-record investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.7 billion in acquisition opportunity, bringing us to $24.3 billion sourced year-to-date. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we've sourced. 
Our low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable, long-term returns while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline, we are reiterating our 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1.5 billion.
Now I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and [indiscernible]."

During the third quarter of 2017, we invested $265 million in 56 properties located in 16 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.2 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 10% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 10 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are theaters, automotive services and quick-service restaurants. We closed 13 discrete transactions in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, 2017, we invested $957 million in 177 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 97% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 47 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, theaters and automotive services.
Of the 50 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million. With regard to transactions flow, it continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 49% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 51% or approximately $12 billion were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 40% for the third quarter. Of the $265 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 19% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 48-year operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 263 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Regarding dispositions. During the third quarter, we sold 17 properties, for net proceeds of $25.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized and unlevered IRR of 13.6%. This brings us to 45 properties sold year-to-date for $69 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized and unlevered IRR of 10.9%.
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between 125 million and 175 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We were active on the capital markets front in the third quarter, issuing approximately $444 million in common equity at an average price to investors of approximately $58 per share. Our equity issuance activity during the quarter came through our ATM program. This is a cost-effective equity issuance to allow us to match fund our acquisitions activity and to repay $175 million of our bonds that matured in September. We currently have approximately $1.3 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company.
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 93rd time in the company's history. Our dividends year-to-date represent a 6% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%.
We're proud to be 1 of only 5 REITs at S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance.
To wrap it up, we're pleased with our company's financial position and operating performance and remain confident in the outlook for our business. Our real estate portfolio is performing well. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and our balance sheet is conservatively capitalized.
Our cost of capital remains a competitive advantage we believe allows us to continue generating favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.

In the third quarter, we had an opportunity under favorable market conditions to match fund acquisitions and debt maturities.

Going forward, we will consider all forms of equity raising, so whether it be a regular way overnight offering, a marketed offering or additional ATM issuance activity. This was a heavy quarter for us on the ATM. We had -- I'd say half of it was raised through regularly way trading, and about half of it was raised through a reverse inquiry from high-quality institutional investors. So we were pleased with the pricing for the quarter. It was about $58 on a gross basis, and it worked out well for us. But we'll continue to look at all equity raising alternatives in the future."

So the equity performance is a bit divorced from the performance of our theaters. So we're aware that the AMC stock has not traded well recently, but our properties and our theaters are performing quite well. We like the experiential nature of the theater business and in particular, AMCs. It continues to be a low-cost form of entertainment. As you know, the theaters have continued to upgrade their offerings with more comfortable seating and better technology and full-service, higher-quality food and beverage offerings. And as a result, they're seeing a rise in revenue. 2016 was a record year at the box office for the theater industry, so it's a tough comp year. Year-to-date, we're off about 5% from where we were at this time last year in terms of box office. But most industry experts believe we're going to see a strong fourth quarter as a number of big blockbusters such as Star Wars are released during the holidays. So they expect the underperformance this year to turn a little bit and become a bit more favorable. But we're very happy with our theaters. The vast majority of our AMCs have been retrofitted with better seating, better technology and again, food and beverage offerings. So where that's been done, we've seen a 64% increase in revenues versus the prereconfiguration revenues for those AMCs. So it really comes down to picking the right properties, having strong underwriting structures, and we're pleased with that."

And arguably, I would assume rent coverages have declined during the year as box office has declined. And then how did you get comfortable? And I know you talked a lot about the positives that a lot of the theater operators are doing to their assets. But at some point, premium video on demand is going to come, and it's hard to imagine how that's not somewhat impactful to the 4-wall profitability in the theater even if the exhibitors get mid-whole.

So we've seen on our theaters the rent coverage ratios actually improving. And we underwrote these particular theaters that we acquired in the third quarter based on the strong cash flow coverages, high quality of real estate and the fact that they had been renovated. So they were performing quite well. With regard to the premium video on demand, there has been discussion in the sector to take it from potentially 90 days, which is where it is today, down to 45 days for release time. 95% of ticket sales are in the first 40 days after a movie's theatrical release. So we don't think there'll be a major impact on our theater business from the PVOD discussions that are taking place. In addition, theaters and studios are negotiating revenue-sharing arrangement with regard to that PVOD business, so the theater should be able to generate some incremental cash flow from that standpoint. So the -- as you know, the theaters typically have, given their higher drop to break even -- higher drop in sales to break even, they have lower coverage ratios. So something in the low 2s versus in our portfolio average or medium, which is at 2.8x. Because they have more ability to control variable cost so the coverage is -- once again, can be a bit lower."

We -- first of all, we're invested in the 3 most significant players in the pharmacy market with Walgreens, CVS and then Rite Aid. We have high-quality real estate. We've got companies that are affiliated with pharmacy benefit managers, which drive high market shares. So there are barriers to entry here. They have well-developed retail and distribution that helps give them a competitive advantage and creates barriers to entry. One thing we've looked at is since 2010, we've looked at how mail order pharmacies have performed relative to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. And since 2010, the prescriptions dispensed through mail order pharmacies has -- have declined by 20%, and most of that has been picked up by the Walgreens and CVSs of the world. In addition, the regulation in the drugstore industry will make it difficult, we believe, for Amazon to penetrate easily this sector. So if you look at the customers of pharmacies, you'll see that many of them are on short term -- shorter-term prescriptions. And the -- of the baby boom generation, maybe the older generation, and they like to have the face-to-face consultation with the pharmacists. So often, they prefer picking their prescriptions up in person and having a discussion with the expert on side effects or other issues related to their drugs. So that's something that is, I think, bodes well for the brick-and-mortar business. And Walgreens, as all of this has played out, and you're probably aware of this, Walgreens' U.S. pharmacy same-store sales growth has been positive for the last 18 consecutive quarters.

I think that's evidenced by our re-leasing spreads, by our continued high occupancy. Our portfolio has performed well with regard to the impact of e-commerce. Our properties have -- on the retail side, over 90% have a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component. Of the 22 retail bankruptcies this year, 19 have not had any of those characteristics. So our type of real estate so far has proven to be pretty resilient to what is recognized as the most significant potential disruptor, and that is e-commerce. So we do not -- the portfolio is performing well, and we really don't need to shift into a more defensive posture right now."

That being said, on these vacant asset sales, we're generating unlevered IRRs of roughly 10% or so. So these have been profitable investments. It's just that they've become a bit obsolete in some cases or maybe the real estate markets surrounding these assets have changed. Maybe the most logical uses for the markets don't make sense anymore.

Rite Aid is going to take its debt to EBITDA from 7.5x down to approximately 4.5x. And they're also going to have access to Walgreens' purchasing network. And Rite Aid will be more focused on the West Coast as they sell -- more of what they sell to Walgreens is going to be along the eastern seaboard, which will allow Walgreens to fully develop its footprint there. So I think it's a win-win. Walgreens comes out with significant synergies. They're expecting to have maybe up to $400 million in synergies from this transaction in the first 3 to 4 years. And they have a bigger footprint, and they're a more efficient company. And then Rite Aid is still the third largest player, more focused out west, with a much better balance sheet.

We ended the quarter with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7x, which is the highest it's been in our company's history. Given our active investment pipeline, we continue to expect to acquire approximately $1.5 billion in acquisitions this year. We are also reiterating our 2017 AFFO per share guidance of $3.03 to $3.07, which represents annual growth of 5.2% to 6.6%.

Interest expense increased in the quarter by $10 million to $63 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the third quarter following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term, unsecured bonds as well as a smaller gain on our interest rate swaps recognized this quarter as compared to the last -- that quarter last year. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 4.7% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, which is in line with our full year projection.
We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Our nonreimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.8% in the quarter, and our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017.
Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.77 for the quarter versus $0.73 a year ago. Our 2017 FFO guidance remains $2.96 to $3.01 per share. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various noncash items, such as quarterly interest rate swaps, gains or losses; amortization of lease intangibles; and the $0.05 charge incurred in connection with the redemption of our Series F preferred stock back in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance.
Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.77 per share for the quarter, representing a 6.9% increase over the year-ago period.
Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $444 million in equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years, and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.7x.
Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $1.3 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter.
Finally, our overall leverage remains modest, with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at 5.2x. 
In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital.
Now let me turn the call back over to John, who will give you more background on these results."

I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged versus the year-ago period. We continue to expect occupancy to be at or above 98% in 2017.Durin",570,"Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, unchanged versus the year-ago period. We continue to expect occupancy to be at or above 98% in 2017.
During the quarter, we re-leased 79 properties, recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is notably above our long-term average. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Year-to-date, we re-leased 181 properties, recapturing approximately 107% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,500 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents as we seldom incur any improvements in leasing commissions. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric.
Our same-store rent increased 1% during the quarter and for the year-to-date period, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2017.
Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 251 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 
80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue.
We remain confident in the drugstore industry. Since peaking in 2010, the number of mail order prescriptions has declined each year, and that has coincided with Walgreens' positive pharmacy same-store sales growth for 18 consecutive quarters.
Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not have these characteristics.
We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. Store level performance at our retail tenants also remain sound. Both the median and weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties are 2.7x on a 4-wall basis. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years.
Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $265 million of acquisitions during the quarter at near-record investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.7 billion in acquisition opportunity, bringing us to $24.3 billion sourced year-to-date. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we've sourced. 
Our low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest-quality properties that provide favorable, long-term returns while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline, we are reiterating our 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1.5 billion.
Now I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and [indiscernible]."

During the third quarter of 2017, we invested $265 million in 56 properties located in 16 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.2 years.
On a revenue basis, approximately 10% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 10 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are theaters, automotive services and quick-service restaurants. We closed 13 discrete transactions in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, 2017, we invested $957 million in 177 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 97% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 47 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, theaters and automotive services.
Of the 50 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were above $50 million. With regard to transactions flow, it continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 49% of the volumes sourced were portfolios, and 51% or approximately $12 billion were one-off assets.
Investment-grade opportunities represented 40% for the third quarter. Of the $265 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 19% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 48-year operating history.
As to pricing, cap rates continue to remain flat in the third quarter, with investment-grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and noninvestment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range.
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy, averaging 263 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital.
Regarding dispositions. During the third quarter, we sold 17 properties, for net proceeds of $25.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized and unlevered IRR of 13.6%. This brings us to 45 properties sold year-to-date for $69 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized and unlevered IRR of 10.9%.
In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching our 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between 125 million and 175 million.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to John."

We were active on the capital markets front in the third quarter, issuing approximately $444 million in common equity at an average price to investors of approximately $58 per share. Our equity issuance activity during the quarter came through our ATM program. This is a cost-effective equity issuance to allow us to match fund our acquisitions activity and to repay $175 million of our bonds that matured in September. We currently have approximately $1.3 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company.
Last month, we increased the dividend for the 93rd time in the company's history. Our dividends year-to-date represent a 6% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%.
We're proud to be 1 of only 5 REITs at S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance.
To wrap it up, we're pleased with our company's financial position and operating performance and remain confident in the outlook for our business. Our real estate portfolio is performing well. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and our balance sheet is conservatively capitalized.
Our cost of capital remains a competitive advantage we believe allows us to continue generating favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.

In the third quarter, we had an opportunity under favorable market conditions to match fund acquisitions and debt maturities. We were also able to save the shareholders about $17 million relative to what we would have had to pay in order to do an overnight offering. So it worked out particularly well. Going forward, we will consider all forms of equity raising, so whether it be a regular way overnight offering, a marketed offering or additional ATM issuance activity. This was a heavy quarter for us on the ATM. We had -- I'd say half of it was raised through regularly way trading, and about half of it was raised through a reverse inquiry from high-quality institutional investors. So we were pleased with the pricing for the quarter. It was about $58 on a gross basis, and it worked out well for us. But we'll continue to look at all equity raising alternatives in the future."

So the equity performance is a bit divorced from the performance of our theaters. So we're aware that the AMC stock has not traded well recently, but our properties and our theaters are performing quite well. We like the experiential nature of the theater business and in particular, AMCs. It continues to be a low-cost form of entertainment. As you know, the theaters have continued to upgrade their offerings with more comfortable seating and better technology and full-service, higher-quality food and beverage offerings. And as a result, they're seeing a rise in revenue. 2016 was a record year at the box office for the theater industry, so it's a tough comp year. Year-to-date, we're off about 5% from where we were at this time last year in terms of box office. But most industry experts believe we're going to see a strong fourth quarter as a number of big blockbusters such as Star Wars are released during the holidays. So they expect the underperformance this year to turn a little bit and become a bit more favorable. But we're very happy with our theaters. The vast majority of our AMCs have been retrofitted with better seating, better technology and again, food and beverage offerings. So where that's been done, we've seen a 64% increase in revenues versus the prereconfiguration revenues for those AMCs. So it really comes down to picking the right properties, having strong underwriting structures, and we're pleased with that."

And arguably, I would assume rent coverages have declined during the year as box office has declined. And then how did you get comfortable? And I know you talked a lot about the positives that a lot of the theater operators are doing to their assets. But at some point, premium video on demand is going to come, and it's hard to imagine how that's not somewhat impactful to the 4-wall profitability in the theater even if the exhibitors get mid-whole.

So we've seen on our theaters the rent coverage ratios actually improving. And we underwrote these particular theaters that we acquired in the third quarter based on the strong cash flow coverages, high quality of real estate and the fact that they had been renovated. So they were performing quite well. With regard to the premium video on demand, there has been discussion in the sector to take it from potentially 90 days, which is where it is today, down to 45 days for release time. 95% of ticket sales are in the first 40 days after a movie's theatrical release. So we don't think there'll be a major impact on our theater business from the PVOD discussions that are taking place. In addition, theaters and studios are negotiating revenue-sharing arrangement with regard to that PVOD business, so the theater should be able to generate some incremental cash flow from that standpoint. So the -- as you know, the theaters typically have, given their higher drop to break even -- higher drop in sales to break even, they have lower coverage ratios. So something in the low 2s versus in our portfolio average or medium, which is at 2.8x. Because they have more ability to control variable cost so the coverage is -- once again, can be a bit lower."

That being said, we had 9 locations, of which Camping World was interested in the vast majority of those locations. However, they were seeking rent reductions that didn't make sense for us given the quality of the real estate. So 8 of the 9 locations, we are marketing to national retailers at what we believe will be more favorable rates from quite strong tenants than what was being offered by Camping World. So it was a conscious decision for us to take these assets and go-to-market with them, and we think we'll have a better outcome in terms of recovering our prebankruptcy rent. Historically, the company has recovered 82% of the prebankruptcy rent on the bankruptcies we've been involved in. We think we will do that well or better with regard to the Gander portfolio."

Of course, it's something we've been considering and discussing and analyzing for quite some time now. We -- first of all, we're invested in the 3 most significant players in the pharmacy market with Walgreens, CVS and then Rite Aid. We have high-quality real estate. We've got companies that are affiliated with pharmacy benefit managers, which drive high market shares. So there are barriers to entry here. They have well-developed retail and distribution that helps give them a competitive advantage and creates barriers to entry. One thing we've looked at is since 2010, we've looked at how mail order pharmacies have performed relative to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. And since 2010, the prescriptions dispensed through mail order pharmacies has -- have declined by 20%, and most of that has been picked up by the Walgreens and CVSs of the world. In addition, the regulation in the drugstore industry will make it difficult, we believe, for Amazon to penetrate easily this sector. So if you look at the customers of pharmacies, you'll see that many of them are on short term -- shorter-term prescriptions. And the -- of the baby boom generation, maybe the older generation, and they like to have the face-to-face consultation with the pharmacists. So often, they prefer picking their prescriptions up in person and having a discussion with the expert on side effects or other issues related to their drugs. So that's something that is, I think, bodes well for the brick-and-mortar business. And Walgreens, as all of this has played out, and you're probably aware of this, Walgreens' U.S. pharmacy same-store sales growth has been positive for the last 18 consecutive quarters. So they're doing quite well."

In our preliminary discussions, it looks like the range could be anywhere from about 10 to 30 stores. But that's preliminary, and that could change. One thing we like is that Rite Aid is going to use the proceeds from the sale, nearly $5 billion, including the termination fee from the original merger, to improve its balance sheet. Rite Aid is going to take its debt to EBITDA from 7.5x down to approximately 4.5x. And they're also going to have access to Walgreens' purchasing network. And Rite Aid will be more focused on the West Coast as they sell -- more of what they sell to Walgreens is going to be along the eastern seaboard, which will allow Walgreens to fully develop its footprint there. So I think it's a win-win. Walgreens comes out with significant synergies. They're expecting to have maybe up to $400 million in synergies from this transaction in the first 3 to 4 years. And they have a bigger footprint, and they're a more efficient company. And then Rite Aid is still the third largest player, more focused out west, with a much better balance sheet. So we're pleased with the outcome of this asset sale, even though they couldn't get the full merger approved by the FTC."
