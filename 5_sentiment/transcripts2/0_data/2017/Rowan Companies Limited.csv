Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2016 Earnings Call. We appreciate your participation today and your continue to interest and investment in Rowan. Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update",933,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2016 Earnings Call. We appreciate your participation today and your continue to interest and investment in Rowan. Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market. And then, Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open the call up for questions.
In the fourth quarter 2016, we announced several key transactions that solidified our long-term growth and financial stability, even though [indiscernible] earnings continue to be pressured by challenging market conditions. Our announcements of a joint venture with Saudi Aramco, our successful bond offering and [indiscernible] execution of our fleet strategy through continuous sales of our older assets and our outstanding operational and safety performance made the quarter remarkable on many fronts. We accomplished these milestones while continuing to effectively reduce our cost and improve our focus on efficiency across the company. These transactions and solid operational execution mean there are visible liquidity runway now extends comfortably into the next decade, allowing us more flexibility to invest in attractive growth opportunities.
Stephen will review our financial performance in detail, so I will only make a few comments. We reported a loss of $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter, down from $0.04 of earnings per share in the previous quarter. The results this quarter were impacted by a $33.6 million loss in our proactive early retirement of debt. Excluding this loss, our $0.08 of earnings per share this quarter beat consensus. 
Our fourth quarter EBITDA was $143 million versus consensus estimate of $132 million, mainly driven by solid cost control and higher revenue efficiencies.
During the quarter, we executed 2 debt capital market transactions. While we would have preferred to extinguish debt at a discount, we are certainly pleased by the market's recognition of our solid financial position effectively, identifying us as a company that will confidently move through the remainder of this downcycle and emerge in a condition of strength.
I'm pleased that Rowan has led the peer group in relative TSR over [ph] the last 3-year period. And in 2016, we generated [indiscernible] return of 12%. Our strong operational performance in 2016, aided by our outstanding operational uptime of over 98% helped drive solid cash generation. Of course, this uptime performance wouldn't be meaningful if weren't accompanied by our best safety performance on record. 
For a company to have accomplished these performance measures during another year of intense focus on cost reductions is truly a well-founded source of pride for the men and women who work at Rowan. 
However, just as important during this downturn, is that we are highly focused for making structural changes to how we operate to ensure this outstanding performance becomes repeatable and sustained.
During the fourth quarter, we sold 2 of our remaining older assets, the Gorilla II and Gorilla III. This followed the sale of 3 other older assets in 2015. 4 of the 5 sold rigs are now restricted to non-drilling activities. We have only 2 older stack rigs left, allowing us to more fully concentrate our support on rigs mix that will have a meaningful contribution to our earnings when the market recovers.
We're thrilled with our recently announced partnership with Saudi Aramco who has been our largest customer for over 10 years and we're delighted to further that relationship. The new company will expand its fleet over time which will help Saudi Aramco accomplish its strategic goals as well as provide a source to stability and unparalleled growth to Rowan, truly a win-win.
Stephen will provide more details in a moment on this important long-term value creation opportunity. 
Now I would like to share with you thoughts on the market.
A year ago, the year the market was bleak as we expected further decline in demand for both Jack-up and Deepwater market. That forecast proved to be true. We've seen operated budgets decline for 3 years in a row, assisted by lower rig day rates and other costs. As we've seen in cycles in the past, activities with lower capital commitment, batches unconventional land drilling and shallow water Brownfield projects recover more quickly than larger capital-intensive activity such as ultradeep water exploration and development. We saw some improvements in oil prices last quarter and OPEC production cuts further supported crude oil prices. This stability, in all, seems to be driving increased tendering activities for late 2017, especially for Jack-ups. However, the floating market seems to be pushing off to 2018. 
While becoming more comfortable with forecasting and reasonable recovery over the coming years, more attrition of older asset is necessary for true recovery. We have seen further Jack-up and floaters scrapping and requirements recently and expect those to continue over the next years. While a robust recovery of the drilling market may take multiple years, we are confident that the strength of our balance sheet and our operational performance will carry us through.
Finally, as with previous quarters, we continue to have a keen focus on optimal capital allocation with impressive work that our finance team has done in extending our visible runway combined with our extremely solid operational performance in a market recovery, that is becoming a little [indiscernible] each day, we feel well-positioned to act on many attractive opportunities that come our way. Those opportunities may take many forms from debt requirements too stressed asset acquisitions, but we'll always view them through the same long-term shareholder value lens.
Now, for look at the market where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

As we enter 2017, we reflect on our position in the cycle and look forward cautiously optimistic that this year will present a turning point for the industry though recovery may be modest for several years. This mo",1220,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As we enter 2017, we reflect on our position in the cycle and look forward cautiously optimistic that this year will present a turning point for the industry though recovery may be modest for several years. This morning I will visit with you about the Jack-up and ultra-Deepwater markets and our outlook for the year and conclude with a few thoughts on the attrition needs that our industry must address.
We were pleased to report several jack-up contract extensions on our last fleet status update. The additional projects signed in Trinidad exhibit our customer satisfaction and our outstanding drilling performance and our continued commitment to have Rowan as their chosen partner in executing their drilling programs. Although we did not disclose the day rates due to the competitive nature of the global markets, they continue to provide significant operating margin, and we were happy to add utilization to those 3 rig units. 
In the North Sea, we currently have 3 Jack-ups contracted and 3 available. We're in discussions with multiple operators about opportunities for the Rowan Norway, the Rowan Stavanger and the Rowan 6 with project commencements seem weighted toward the second half of 2017. We're looking at P&A work, both in Norway and the U.K. sector but also considering attractive opportunities outside of the region.
We continue to see the most promising opportunity for increased demand in the Middle East. We're honored to be selected as the 50-50 joint venture partner with Saudi Aramco and expect that this new company will gain significant market share within Saudi Aramco's fleet of jack-ups in the coming years. We look forward to the commencement of the company in the second quarter. 
Throughout the region, we see a focus on high specification Jack-ups and our 2 available units, EXL I and EXL IV are being tendered aggressively both in the Middle East and around the world.
The Gorilla IV and EXL III continue operations with the offshore and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We see several additional opportunities in the region as operators look to develop lower-cost, faster-cycle Brownfield projects in the current budget environment.
quickly touch on other areas of the world, we see increased tender activity in Southeast Asia. However, we anticipate initial needs will be met by units currently in the region. We are actively participating in contracting opportunities in West Africa as operators look to high-grade units in that market. In Mexico, we're closely monitoring the bidding rounds and expect multiple shallow water blocks to be offered in 2017. However, the commencement of these projects may not materialize until some time in 2018.
Worldwide marketing jack-up utilization is now 68%, but we anticipate the bottoming of the trough within 2017 for Jack-ups. While downward pressure on day rates may continue due to idle supply and the newbuilds waiting to enter the market, the combination of an increase in joint activity and in anticipation of continued attrition should improve effective utilization levels worldwide, especially in niche markets.
Now let's look at the ultra-deepwater market. Market utilization fell approximately 9% during 2016, and we expect 2017 to be another challenging year as new contract awards struggle to keep pace with contract loss.
As operators, seem focus on capital spending in short cycle investments, several ultra- Deepwater projects that we previously anticipated commencing in 2017 now appear to be slipping into 2018. However, we are pleased with ongoing conversations with our customers about opportunities for available drillships and continue to believe that dual BOP, 1,250-ton units will be the first to return to work. These rigs offer operators the technical capabilities that give them the flexibility to address their worldwide portfolios that are especially critical to the demand in drilling and regulatory requirements in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Two of our 4 units are currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and our remaining 2 units are warm stacked. We believe that warm stacking is the best approach for these vessels as our customers have made it clear that cold stacking will be the last in line to be contracted.
Although the crew numbers are reduced on our ships, repairs and maintenance are ongoing and there will be nominal cost when units return to work. 2018 appears promising for the seventh-generation ultra-deepwater market, assuming commodity prices can maintain their stability and as many are forecasting continue to climb steadily as the year progresses. We are actively participating in tenders for work in East and West Africa, Central and south America and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we are encouraged by the activity in the recently completed bidding rounds in Mexico and the anticipated offers in Brazil, which include the second production sharing round and the 14th bidding round of blocks under the concession regime. Despite this anticipated demand, recovery for the floater market as a whole seems to be more in the 2019 timeframe.
As I alluded earlier on the call, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing attrition, both for floaters and jack-ups. On the floater side, approximately 74 units have been removed from the fleet since October of 2014. While this is a good start, given our view of demand over the coming years, we believe that an additional 100 units could be retired from the current fleet. In tandem with strengthening commodity process that encourage increased demand, this attrition could accelerate the industry's ability to obtain a healthy utilization target of 85%. The majority of these retirements should come from older units, those that are currently stacked and those that are off contract. As technology has advanced, many of these floaters have become obsolete and contractors will struggle to maintain them and put them back to work.
Regarding jack-up attrition, only 32 units have been removed from the fleet over the same time period. But there are currently 230 jack-ups in the total fleet that are 35 years or older, 62 of which are cold stacked or out of service. While it is significantly less expensive, the stacked jack-ups and floaters, which contributes to the rationale of delayed attrition, we believe that most of these older units will not reenter the market. With approximately 100 newbuilds waiting to enter the fleet, it's hard to imagine a customer choosing an aged jack-up that has been stacked for a significant amount of time over a newbuild unit for a potential project, provided a suitable drilling contractor's sponsoring their market entry.
Applying similar analysis for supportable jack-up supply in the future, we believe many of the older jack-ups could be retired from the current fleet over the coming years. No one has been diligent in our attrition efforts, having removed 4 of our older units in the market since the downturn and we will most likely retire the program in California. Attrition has accelerated recovery of the offshore drilling market, and considering the aging fleet, this is certainly an obtainable goal. 
While we acknowledge the uphill battle that the industry faces in 2017, our high spec fleet of jack-ups and drillships, backed by our outstanding workforce, gives us the utmost confidence in our ability to take advantage of the opportunities that the recovery will bring. 
This concludes my remarks this morning, and I will now turn the call over to Steve."

On the call today, I will review our fourth quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter. Next, I'll provide some additional color around our agreement with Saudi Aramco to jointly form a new drilling company in 2017 and implication for our financial results. Lastly, we will provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
This morning, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $24 million or $0.19 per share, which includes a $33.6 million loss on the extinguishment of $464 million of debt. Excluding this item, earnings were $0.08 per share for the fourth quarter, down $0.22 from the previous quarter non-GAAP earnings per share due primarily to a reduction in jack-up utilization. 
We generated $346 million in revenue during the fourth quarter, excluding the billable item, an 8% decline from the previous quarter as we incurred increased jack-up idle time in a couple of rigs out of service in the Middle East. 
We completed 26 team [ph] of less than 1.5% operational downtime [indiscernible] wide for the entire year. We are especially proud that we have not incurred any downtime on our drill [indiscernible] for 3 straight quarters and less than 1/10 of 1% downtime for the year. 
Our idle days, as a percentage of available days, showed only a slight 2% increase from the third quarter, up to approximately 29%. Our average service time for the Jack-up fleet was approximately 7% of our available rig days in the fourth quarter due primarily to repairs and inspections on the Bob Palmer and [indiscernible] and upgrades in J.P. Bussell in preparation for the contribution to the new joint venture with Saudi Aramco.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were $174 million, a reduction of $8 million from the previous quarter, attributable to lower activity on idle rigs and continued [indiscernible] effort. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
In line with our guidance, SG&A expenses totaled $26 million in the fourth quarter and $102 million for the full year, down 12% from 2015 level and 19% versus 2014 [ph]. 
Our fourth quarter depreciation expense remained with the third quarter level at $102 million. Interest expense was $39 million in the quarter. 
With respect to the income tax provision, we recognized a tax benefit in the quarter of $9.7 million as a result of a reduction in our tax asset valuation allowance due to certain intercompany transactions. Our annual effective tax rate was still in the low single digit, as previously guided. 
Now for a look at our cash flow and balance sheet. For the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $29 million, slightly above the third quarter level, primarily due to regularly scheduled surveys for the Bob Palmer and Hank Boswell and preparations for the J.P. Bussell's contribution to the joint venture with Saudi Aramco. 
Full year CapEx for 2016 came in at $118 million, somewhat below our previous guidance and some capital spend slipped into 2017.
All in all, we generated $218 million in cash in the fourth quarter and our current cash balance today stands at $1.1 billion. With an additional $1.5 billion on capital revolver, our liquidity continues to be very strong. 
In the fourth quarter, we issued $500 million of 8.5-year senior unsecured notes with a [ph] yield 7 3/8. Simultaneously, we executed a tender offer, focused on clearing out a substantial portion of our near-term debt maturity. Following the expiration of our tender offer, on February 8 of this year, we also exercised our early redemption option on the remaining 2017 note. In total, we extinguished approximately $590 million of debt maturity that were slated to come due between 2017 and 2022. The combined effect of these actions significantly extends our already lengthy visible runway, we believe solidifying our liquidity well into eventual market recovery and affording us the flexibility to make more opportunistic capital allocation decisions. 
Now I'd like to take some time to walk you through some of the economics of the new company that we are forming together with Saudi Aramco.
Upon legal formation late in the first quarter of 2017, Saudi Aramco and Rowan will each contribute $25 million in cash to capitalize the new entity. Shortly thereafter on startup, Saudi Aramco will also contribute 2 Jack-up rigs and related assets. Rowan will contribute 3 of its Jack-up rigs, the Gilbert Rowe, Bob Keller and J.P. Bussell, our surveys facilities and related assets. Due to the uneven value of these contributions, Saudi Aramco is expected to contribute cash to maintain a 50-50 ownership split. Day rates for these first 5 contributed rigs have been negotiated for the first 3 years into 2020.
The end dates of the current contracts on the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell has been leveled out for the ramp-up simultaneously in October 2018 when these rigs will also be contributed to the new company. This adjustment contract will still provide the same backlog to Rowan between the 2 rigs. 
As with the initial contribution, Saudi Aramco is then expected to contribute cash to maintain its ownership level. The second tranche of contributed rigs, the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell, will receive initial contracts of 3 years with day rates [indiscernible] discounted market index. The 7 contributed rigs, 5 initial [ph] and 2 i 2018 are expected to remain under contract for the remaining [indiscernible] to meet Saudi Aramco's drilling needs, provided that the rigs continue to meet the technical and operational requirements for Saudi Aramco. 
You will note that the contributed rigs from Rowan's side do not account for all those rigs currently under contract with Saudi Aramco. From startup, the new company will manage Rowan's 7 remaining Jack-ups in the kingdom through the remainder of their contract for a customary management fee. At the conclusion of each managed rig contract, other than the Boswell and Yeargain, which will be contributed, the rig may be leased by the new company as needed. 
Looking beyond the next few years, the new company will begin ordering Jack-ups to be built by a joint venture between Lamprell, a highly qualified and experienced player in rig construction and Saudi Aramco. We expect the first rig to be delivered in 2021, generally followed by 2 rigs per year for 10 years and up to 20 new build rigs in total. Each of these rigs will be placed on an initial long-term contract with Saudi Aramco. In a similar fashion to the contributed rig, following their initial contract, the newbuild rigs will remain under contract for the remaining useful lives at day rates determined by a discounted market index.
Although we're not providing details of all the economic arrangement, the newbuild rigs are expected to be generating attractive return on investment. I want to reinforce that both Saudi Aramco and Rowan expect the newbuild program to be fully funded through internal JV cash generation and external debt financing.
Given the magnitude of the backlog, coupled with the strength of our counterparty, we expect the new company will be able to self- and externally fund the growth without additional shareholder injection.
However, should this fund be insufficient, Saudi Aramco and Rowan intend to stand behind these orders. 
Both of the parties expect that the new company will generally not hold excess levels of cash other than what will be needed under the business plan. Any additional funds will typically be distributed to the shareholders. Therefore, given Saudi Aramco's massive contribution and the cash generation from the new entity, we expect to see a further strengthening of Rowan's already robust liquidity over the next 2 years as excess cash is distributed.
We expect account for our investment in the JV under the equity method and our share of the ventures income will flow through equity and unconsolidated subsidiary on our income statement.
As we are contributing our [indiscernible] shore base operations and facilities, those costs will also be absorbed by the new venture [indiscernible] forward. Though the intent is to create a self-sustaining business, the new company is expected to rely on Rowan for various back office support services for the first few years. We expect the reimbursement of these services to be recorded as revenue on Rowan's book. 
Now, to review our guidance for 2017, updated from our preliminary numbers provided in the last quarter. On the heels of 2 very strong years for cash generation, the next 2 years will be much more challenging in terms of our financial results, with 2 drill [indiscernible] currently idle and 1 additional backhaul potentially approaching end of its contract next quarter. As Tom and Mark discussed, while we anticipate reaching a bottom in demand for Jack-ups in 2017 and floaters in early 2018, we believe the industry will need to rationalize significant excess capacity before we experience a meaningful recovery in day rate. 
We estimate that our full year 2017 operating costs, excluding rebillable, will range between $625 million and $675 million, depending on the level of activity for our idled rigs or idle rigs rolling off contract during [ph] the year. This represents an 11% to 17% reduction from our 2016 level, primarily due to reduced activity, the new joint venture absorbing approximately $25 million of shore-based cost and incremental cost control measures. 
First quarter 2017 operating expenses are expected to be approximate $170 million. This guidance excludes certain potential joint venture costs that may be grossed up on our income statement and offset by equal revenue.
We expect incur SG&A expense of $95 million to $100 million in 2017, which represents a slight decline from the 2016 level of $102 million with approximately $26 million in the first quarter. 
We expect to record depreciation expense of $385 million to $395 million, slightly below our 2016 level. 
Our full year interest expense guidance is $155 million to $160 million, slightly above our previous guidance, taking into account the impact of the recent capital market transaction.
Moving on to our income tax provision. As pretax income declines to a fairly low level, the effective tax rate starts becoming less meaningful. For this year, instead of providing you with an estimated tax rate, we will provide guidance for the estimated tax expense. We expect our income tax expense for 2017 will approximate $50 million versus only $5 million in 2016. The significant expected difference from 2016 to 2017 is primarily driven by 2 noncash factors. Under U.S. GAAP, certain transactions that occurred in 2016, while creating no income tax in aggregate, created a tax benefit in 2016 which will be offset by expense in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, yearly [ph] adoption of the new accounting standard will result in our eliminating a deferred tax liability and taking into retained earnings over $200 million in January of 2017 but will eliminate a roughly annual $20 million benefit over the next decade.
First quarter tax expense is expected to range from $10 million to $15 million. 
Our income tax expense would like vary significantly quarter to quarter, depending on the actual results, additional backlog, additions or other transactions as they impact our forecast and our valuation allowances on our net deferred tax asset. So while the provision may be remain volatile, we expect our cash taxes to remain flat, in the $40 million range range, in 2017, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous year.
Finally, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $105 million to $115 million in 2017, an approximate 10% increase from previous guidance, primarily due to the deferral of certain fourth quarter capital spend into 2017.
We are proud of Rowan's performance during 2016 and the flexibility we have built for the company to maneuver through the challenging time facing our industry. Over the course of the year, we continued to reduce cost, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity without any dilution to shareholders. Our safety, environmental and drilling performance has been excellent. Our intense focus on customer satisfaction is yielding positive results, as is exemplified by our groundbreaking partnership with the world's largest oil company and consumer of Jack-up drilling rig. We are cautiously optimistic that we will see a bottom in offshore drilling activity over the next year or so and will then begin the road back towards healthy market fundamental. 
Meanwhile, it we continue to focus on what is under control as we position Rowan to thrive in the eventual market recovery. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

There normally will be 6 months, 9 months of lead time. And so we feel that keeping all of the junior crews on the rigs, meaning keep it hot stacked, if we don't have something which we can see moving to, Mark described it as walking the rig between contracts, then we would go down to a hot stack basis.

Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open the call up for questions.
In the fourth quarter 2016, we announced several key transactions that solidified our long-term growth and financial stability even though our earnings continued to be pressured by challenging market conditions. Our announcement of a joint venture with Saudi Aramco, our successful bond offering and debt tender offer, execution of our fleet strategies through continued sales of our older assets and our outstanding operational and safety performance made the quarter remarkable on many fronts. We accomplished these milestones while continuing to effectively reduce our costs and improve our focus on efficiency across the company. These transactions and solid operational execution mean that our visible liquidity runway now extends comfortably into the next decade, allowing us more flexibility to invest in attractive growth opportunities.
Stephen will review our financial performance in detail, so I will only make a few comments. We reported a loss of $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter, down from $0.04 of earnings per share in the previous quarter. The results this quarter were impacted by a $33.6 million loss on our proactive early retirement of debt. Excluding this loss, our $0.08 of earnings per share this quarter beat consensus.
Our fourth quarter EBITDA was $143 million versus consensus estimate of $132 million, mainly driven by solid cost control and higher revenue efficiencies.
During the quarter, we executed 2 debt capital market transactions. Though we would have preferred to extinguish debt at a discount, we are certainly pleased by the market's recognition of our solid financial position, effectively identifying us as a company that will confidently move through the remainder of this down cycle and emerge in a position of strength. I'm pleased that Rowan has led the peer group in relative TSR over the last 3-year period. And then in 2016, we generated a positive return of 12%. Our strong operational performance in 2016, aided by our outstanding operational uptime of over 98%, helped drive solid cash generation. Of course, this uptime performance wouldn't be meaningful if it weren't accompanied by our best safety performance on record.
For a company to have accomplished these performance measures during another year of intense focus on cost reductions is truly a well-founded source of pride for men and women who work at Rowan. However, just as important during this downturn is that we are highly focused on making structural changes to how we operate to ensure this outstanding performance becomes repeatable and sustained. During the fourth quarter, we sold 2 of our remaining older assets, the Gorilla II and Gorilla III. This followed the sale of 3 other older assets in 2015. 4 of the 5 sold rigs are now restricted to non-drilling activities. We have only 2 older stacked rigs left, allowing us to more fully concentrate our support on rigs that will have a meaningful contribution to our earnings when the market recovers.
We're thrilled with our recently announced partnership with Saudi Aramco, who has been our largest customer for over 10 years, and we're delighted to further that relationship. The new company will expand its fleet over time, which will help Saudi Aramco accomplish its strategic goals as well as provide a source of [ph] stability and unparalleled growth to Rowan, truly a win-win. Stephen will provide more details in a moment on this important long-term value-creation opportunity.
Now I'd like to share with you thoughts on the market.
A year ago was a year the market was bleak, as we expected further declines in demand for both Jack-up and Deepwater markets. That forecast proved to be true. We've seen operated budgets decline for 3 years in a row, assisted by lower rig day rates and other costs. As we've seen in cycles in the past, activities with lower capital commitments such as unconventional land drilling and shallow-water brownfield projects recover more quickly than larger, capital-intensive activities such as ultra-deepwater exploration and development. With some -- we saw some improvements in oil prices last quarter, and then OPEC's production cuts further supported crude oil prices. This stability in oil price seems to be driving increased tendering activity for late 2017, especially for jack-ups. However, the floating market seems to be pushing off to 2018.
While we're becoming more comfortable with forecasting a reasonable recovery over the coming years, more attrition of older assets is necessary for true recovery. We have seen further jack-up and floater scrapping and retirements recently and expect those to continue over the next years. While a robust recovery of the drilling market may take multiple years, we are confident that the strength of our balance sheet and our operational performance will carry us through.
Finally, as with previous quarters, we continued to have a keen focus on optimal capital allocation. With the impressive work that our finance team has done in extending our visible runway, combined with our extremely solid operational performance and a market recovery that is becoming a little clearer each day, we feel well positioned to act on any attractive opportunities that come our way. Those opportunities may take many forms, from debt retirements to distressed asset acquisitions, but we'll always view them through the same long-term shareholder value lens.
Now for a look at the market where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

And good morning, everyone.As we enter 2017, we reflect on our position in the cycle and look forward, cautiously optimistic, that this year will present a turning point for the industry, though recovery may be modest for several years. Thi",1222,"Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone.
As we enter 2017, we reflect on our position in the cycle and look forward, cautiously optimistic, that this year will present a turning point for the industry, though recovery may be modest for several years. This morning, I'll revisit with you about the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and our outlook for the year and conclude with a few thoughts on the attrition needs that our industry must address.
We were pleased to report several jack-up contract extensions on our last fleet status update. The additional projects signed in Trinidad exhibit our customer satisfaction and our outstanding drilling performance and our continued commitment to have Rowan as their chosen partner in executing their drilling programs. Although we did not disclose the day rates due to the competitive nature of the global markets, they continue to provide significant operating margin. And we were happy to add utilization to those 3 units.
In the North Sea, we currently have 3 jack-ups contracted and 3 available. We're in discussions with multiple operators about opportunities for the Rowan Norway, the Rowan Stavanger and the Gorilla VI, but project commencements seem weighted toward the second half of 2017. We are looking at P&A work both in Norway and the U.K. sector but also considering attractive opportunities outside of the region.
We continue to see the most promising opportunity for increased demand in the Middle East. We are honored to be selected as the 50-50 joint venture partner with Saudi Aramco and expect that this new company will gain significant market share within Saudi Aramco's fleet of jack-ups in the coming years. We look forward to the commencement of the company in the second quarter. Throughout the region, we see a focus on high-specification jack-ups. And our 2 available units, EXL I and EXL IV, are being tendered aggressively both in the Middle East and around the world. The Gorilla IV and EXL III continue operations with Arena Offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We see several additional opportunities in the region as operators look to develop lower-cost, faster-cycle brownfield projects in the current budget environment.
To quickly touch on other areas of the world. We see increased tender activity in Southeast Asia. However, we anticipate initial needs will be met by units currently in the region. We are actively participating in contracting opportunities in West Africa as operators look to high-grade units in that market. In Mexico, we are closely monitoring the bidding rounds and expect multiple shallow-water blocks to be offered in 2017. However, the commencement of these projects may not materialize until sometime in 2018. Worldwide marketing jack-up utilization is now 68%, but we anticipate the bottoming of the trough within 2017 for jack-ups. While downward pressure on day rates may continue due to idle supply and the newbuilds waiting to enter the market, the combination of an increase in drilling activity and an anticipation of continued attrition should improve effective utilization levels worldwide, especially in niche markets.
Now let's look at the ultra-deepwater market. Market utilization fell approximately 9% during 2016, and we expect 2017 to be another challenging year as new contract awards struggle to keep pace with contract roll-offs. As operators seem focused on capital spending in shorter-cycle investments, several ultra-deepwater projects that we previously anticipated commencing in 2017 now appear to be slipping into 2018. However, we are pleased with ongoing conversations with our customers about opportunities for our available drillships and continue to believe that dual-BOP 1,250-ton units will be the first to return to work. These rigs offer operators the technical capabilities that give them the flexibility to address their worldwide portfolios that are especially critical to the demanding drilling and regulatory requirements in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
2 of our 4 units are currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and our remaining 2 units are warm stacked. We believe that warm stacking is the best approach for these vessels, as our customers have made it clear that cold-stacked units will be the last in line to be contracted. Although the crew numbers are reduced on our ships, repairs and maintenance are ongoing, and there will be minimal costs when the units return to work. 2018 appears promising for the seventh-generation ultra-deepwater market, assuming commodity prices can maintain their stability and, as many are forecasting, continue to climb steadily as the year progresses. We are actively participating in tenders for work in East and West Africa, Central and South America and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Additionally, we are encouraged by the activity in the recently completed bidding rounds in Mexico and the anticipated offers in Brazil, which include the second production-sharing round and the 14th bidding round of blocks under the concession regime. Despite this anticipated demand, recovery for the floater market as a whole seems to be more in the 2019 time frame.
As I alluded earlier in the call, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing attrition both for floaters and jack-ups. On the floater side, approximately 74 units have been removed from the fleet since October of 2014. While this is a good start, given our view of demand over the coming years, we believe that an additional 100 units could be retired from the current fleet. In tandem with strengthening commodity prices that encourage increased demand, this attrition could accelerate the industry's ability to attain a healthy utilization target of 85%. The majority of these retirements should come from older units, those that are currently stacked and those rolling off contract. As technology has advanced, many of these floaters have become obsolete, and contractors will struggle to maintain them and put them back to work.
Regarding jack-up attrition, only 32 units have been removed from the fleet over the same time period, but there are currently 230 jack-ups in the total fleet that are 35 years or older, 62 of which are cold stacked or out of service. While it is significantly less expensive for the stacked jack-ups than floaters, which contributes to the rationale of delayed attrition, we believe that most of these older units will not reenter the market. With approximately 100 newbuilds waiting to enter the fleet, it's hard to imagine a customer choosing an aged jack-up that has been stacked for a significant amount of time over a newbuild unit for a potential project, provided a suitable drilling contractor is sponsoring their market entry. Applying similar analysis for a supportable jack-up supply in the future, we believe many of the older jack-ups could be retired from the current fleet over the coming years. Rowan has been diligent in our attrition efforts, having removed 4 of our older units from the market since the downturn. And we will most likely retire the Cecil Provine and Rowan California. Attrition is vital to accelerating the recovery of the offshore drilling market, and considering the aging fleet, this is certainly an attainable goal.
While we acknowledge the uphill battle that the industry faces in 2017, our high-spec fleet of jack-ups and drillships, backed by our outstanding workforce, gives us the utmost confidence in our ability to take advantage of the opportunities that the recovery will bring.
This concludes my remarks this morning, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

On the call today, I will review our fourth quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter. Next, I will provide some additional color around our agreement with Saudi Aramco to jointly form a new drilling company in 2017 and the implications for our financial results. Lastly, we will provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
This morning, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $24 million or $0.19 per share, which includes a $33.6 million loss on the extinguishment of $464 million of debt. Excluding this item, earnings were $0.08 per share for the fourth quarter, down $0.22 from the previous quarter non-GAAP earnings per share due primarily to a reduction in jack-up utilization. We generated $346 million in revenue during the fourth quarter, excluding rebillable items, an 8% decline from the previous quarter as we incurred increased jack-up idle time and had a couple of rigs out of service in the Middle East.
We completed 26 team [ph] of less than 1.5% operational downtime fleetwide for the entire year. We are especially proud that we have not incurred any downtime on our drillships for 3 straight quarters and less than 0.10% downtime for the year.
Our idle days as a percentage of available days showed only a slight 2% increase from the third quarter up to approximately 29%. Our out-of-service time for the Jack-up fleet was approximately 7% of our available rig days in the fourth quarter due primarily to repairs and inspections on the Bob Palmer and Hank Boswell and upgrades to the J.P. Bussell in preparation for the contribution to the new joint venture with Saudi Aramco.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were $174 million, a reduction of $8 million from the previous quarter, attributable to lower activity on idle rigs and continued cost-control efforts. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues.
In line with our guidance, SG&A expenses totaled $26 million in the fourth quarter and $102 million for the full year, down 12% from 2015 levels and 19% versus 2014 [ph]. Our fourth quarter depreciation expense remained flat with the third quarter level at $102 million. Interest expense was $39 million in the quarter.
With respect to the income tax provision, we recognized a tax benefit in the quarter of $9.7 million as a result of a reduction in our tax asset valuation allowance due to certain intercompany transactions. Our annual effective tax rate was still in the low single digits, as previously guided.
Now for a look at our cash flow and balance sheet.
For the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $29 million, slightly above the third quarter level primarily due to regularly scheduled surveys for the Bob Palmer and Hank Boswell and preparations for the J.P. Bussell's contribution to the joint venture with Saudi Aramco. Full year CapEx for 2016 came in at $118 million, somewhat below our previous guidance as some capital spend slipped into 2017.
All in all, we generated $218 million in cash in the fourth quarter, and our current cash balance today stands at $1.1 billion. With an additional $1.5 billion untapped revolver, our liquidity continues to be very strong.
In the fourth quarter, we issued $500 million of 8.5-year senior unsecured notes with a yield 7 3/8. Simultaneously, we executed the tender offer focused on clearing out a substantial portion of our near-term debt maturities. Following the expiration of our tender offer, on February 8 of this year, we also exercised our early redemption option on the remaining 2017 note. In total, we extinguished approximately $590 million of debt maturities that were slated to come due between 2017 and 2022. The combined effect of these actions significantly extend our already lengthy visible runway, we believe, solidifying our liquidity well into eventual market recovery and affording us the flexibility to make more opportunistic capital allocation decisions.
Now I'd like to take some time to walk you through some of the economics of the new company that we are forming together with Saudi Aramco.
Upon legal formation late in the first quarter of 2017, Saudi Aramco and Rowan will each contribute $25 million in cash to capitalize the new entity. Shortly thereafter on startup, Saudi Aramco will also contribute 2 jack-up rigs and related assets. Rowan will contribute 3 of its jack-up rigs, the Gilbert Rowe, Bob Keller and J.P. Bussell; our shorebase facilities; and related assets. Due to the uneven value of these contributions, Saudi Aramco is expected to contribute cash to maintain a 50-50 ownership split. Day rates for these first 5 contributed rigs have been negotiated for the first 3 years into 2020.
The end dates of the current contracts on the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell have been leveled out so they ramp up simultaneously in October 2018, when these rigs will also be contributed to the new company. These adjusted contracts will still provide the same backlog to Rowan between the 2 rigs.
As with the initial contribution, Saudi Aramco is then expected to contribute cash to maintain its ownership level. The second tranche of contributed rigs, the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell, will receive initial contracts of 3 years with day rates determined by a discounted market index. The 7 contributed rigs, 5 initials and 2 in 2018, are expected to remain under contract for their remaining useful lives to meet Saudi Aramco's drilling needs, provided that the rigs continue to meet the technical and operational requirements for Saudi Aramco.
You will note that the contributed rigs from Rowan's side do not account for all of the rigs currently under contract with Saudi Aramco. From startup, the new company will manage Rowan's 7 remaining jack-ups in the kingdom through the remainder of their contracts for a customary management fee. At the conclusion of each managed rig contract, other than the Boswell and Yeargain which will be contributed, the rig may be leased by the new company as needed.
Looking beyond the next few years, the new company will begin ordering jack-ups to be built by a joint venture between Lamprell, a highly qualified and experienced player in rig construction; and Saudi Aramco. We expect the first rig to be delivered in 2021, generally followed by 2 rigs per year for 10 years and up to 20 newbuild rigs in total. Each of these rigs will be placed on an initial long-term contract with Saudi Aramco. In a similar fashion to the contributed rigs, following their initial contracts, the newbuild rigs will remain under contract for their remaining useful lives at day rates determined by a discounted market index.
Although we're not providing the details of all the economic arrangements, the newbuild rigs are expected to be generate an attractive return on investment. I want to reinforce that both Saudi Aramco and Rowan expect the newbuild program to be fully funded through internal JV cash generation and external debt financing. Given the magnitude of the backlogs, coupled with the strengths of our counterparty, we expect the new company will be able to self- and externally fund the growth without additional shareholder injection.
However, should these funds be insufficient, Saudi Aramco and Rowan intend to stand behind these orders. Both of the parties expect that the new company will generally not hold excess levels of cash other than what will be needed under the business plan. Any additional funds will typically be distributed to the shareholders. Therefore, given Saudi Aramco's matching contributions and the cash generation from the new entity, we expect to see a further strengthening of Rowan's already robust liquidity over the next 2 years as excess cash is distributed.
We expect to account for our investment in the JV under the equity method, and our share of the venture's income will flow through equity and unconsolidated subsidiaries on our income statement. As we are contributing our in-kingdom shorebase operations and facilities, those costs will also be absorbed by the new venture from inception forward. Though the intent is to create a self-sustaining business, the new company is expected to rely on Rowan for various back-office support services for the first few years. We expect the reimbursement of these services to be recorded as revenue on Rowan's book.
Now to review our guidance for 2017, updated from our preliminary numbers provided in the last quarter.
On the heels of 2 very strong years for cash generation, the next 2 years will be much more challenging in terms of our financial results, with 2 drillships currently idle and 1 additional vessel potentially approaching the end of its contract next quarter. As Tom and Mark discussed, while we anticipate reaching a bottom in demand for jack-ups in 2017 and floaters in early 2018, we believe the industry will need to rationalize significant excess capacity before we experience a meaningful recovery in day rates.
We estimate that our full year 2017 operating costs excluding rebillables will range between $625 million and $675 million, depending on the level of activity for our idle rigs or other rigs rolling off contract during the year. This represents an 11% to 17% reduction from our 2016 level primarily due to reduced activity, the new joint venture absorbing approximately $25 million of shore-based costs and incremental cost-control measures.
First quarter 2017 operating expenses are expected to approximate $170 million. This guidance excludes certain potential joint venture costs that may be grossed up on our income statement and offset by equal revenue. We expect to incur SG&A expense of $95 million to $100 million in 2017, which represents a slight decline from the 2016 level of $102 million, with approximately $26 million in the first quarter. We expect to record depreciation expense of $385 million to $395 million, slightly below our 2016 level. Our full year interest expense guidance is $155 million to $160 million, slightly above our previous guidance taking into account the impact of the recent capital market transactions.
Moving on to our income tax provisions. As pretax income declines to a fairly low level, the effective tax rate starts becoming less meaningful, so this year, instead of providing you with an estimated tax rate, we will provide guidance for the estimated tax expense. We expect our income tax expense for 2017 will approximate $50 million versus only $5 million in 2016. The significant expected difference from 2016 to 2017 is primarily driven by 2 noncash factors. Under U.S. GAAP, certain transactions that occurred in 2016, while creating no income tax in aggregate, created a tax benefit in 2016 which will be offset by expense in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, the early adoption of a new accounting standard will result in our eliminating a deferred tax liability and taking into retained earnings over $200 million in January of 2017 but will eliminate a roughly annual $20 million benefit over the next decade.
First quarter tax expense is expected to range from $10 million to $15 million, but our income tax expense will like vary significantly quarter to quarter, depending on the actual results, additional backlog, additions or other transactions, as they impact our forecast and our valuation allowances on our net deferred tax assets. So while the provision may be -- remain volatile, we expect our cash taxes to remain flat in the $40 million range in 2017, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous year.
Finally, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $105 million to $115 million in 2017, an approximate 10% increase from previous guidance primarily due to the deferral of certain fourth quarter capital spend into 2017.
We are proud of Rowan's performance during 2016 and the flexibility we have built for the company to maneuver through the challenging time facing our industry. Over the course of the year, we continued to reduce costs, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity without any dilution to shareholders. Our safety, environmental and drilling performance have been excellent. Our intense focus on customer satisfaction is yielding positive results, as is exemplified by our groundbreaking partnership with the world's largest oil company and consumer of jack-up drilling rigs. We are cautiously optimistic that when -- that we will see a bottom in offshore drilling activity over the next year or so and will then begin the road back towards healthy market fundamentals. Meanwhile, we will continue to focus on what is under our control as we position Rowan to thrive in the eventual market recovery.

And when you say a recovery, I would imagine you're talking about more of a rebalancing of utilization by '19. Is what -- is that a good interpretation of your comments?"

And so we're going to be very careful how we approach those, but I think a good indicator for us, we believe -- as I said earlier, we believe the Jack-up market will trough in '17. A good indicator for the Deepwater market beginning to trough is when the IOCs come out for long-term contracts. I just don't think they're going to let this pricing opportunity pass without coming out with 3- to 5-year contracts, particularly the big IOCs that have enough backlog of wells to do that. So I think that's going to be your best indicator of when things would start."

The pricing is different in every one of those markets, but inside of those markets, the class of rig is what's going to drive it. Commodity rigs in certain markets are at cash cost today or below. We've seen some of them, but the higher-spec rigs in different markets such as Trinidad, Middle East and other areas, you're seeing day rates with good margins on them. And I think a good market fixture or indicator is the 2 contracts Noble signed with Saudi Aramco at $159,000. And those are 5-year term. If Saudi Aramco haven't dealt with them since 2004, I can tell you Saudi Aramco wouldn't offer a 5-year contract unless they felt like the bottom of the market was near or certainly was here. And they feel like they want to maintain those high-spec rigs and won't then take a chance on letting them get away from them [ph]. So I think that's a good market indicator.

Certainly the lowest state we would go down to would be warm stacks because, if we had some lower fifth-generation or lower sixth-generation rigs, we would certainly maybe consider taking them down lower. But warm stacked would be the lowest-state readiness we would go to. Most of the customers, when we're talking about these type of programs, they don't sort of like spring them on you, like, tomorrow. There's normally a good, fair amount of lead time, so it's [indiscernible]. And which is not necessarily also true of jack-ups, but with these water rigs, it's less likely they'll say, ""Have you got a rig? Let's go."" There normally will be 6 months, 9 months of lead time. And so we feel that keeping all of the Juneau crews on the rigs, on -- and i.e. meaning keeping it hot stacked, if we don't have something which we can see moving to, Mark described it as, walking the rig between contracts, then we would go down to a hot-stack basis. But -- so it would be kind of less likely to keep it hot stacked if -- unless we have something cleared to go to. Otherwise, you will take it down to warm stacks. And then -- and when we say warm stacked, I mean, we really warm stack, meaning it is warm. We're not expecting any additional capital to go back to work but the understanding between operations, operations support and marketing is -- that the rig can be moved anywhere at very short notice. And it is all the maintenance being done and for customers to come and inspect it. They will -- and while a customer who order it [ph] will find a rig that is ready to go back to work, exactly it doesn't have the Juneau crews. So I don't see us keeping a rig hot stacked, Eduardo, unless we had something fairly substantial.

Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open the call up for questions.
In the fourth quarter 2016, we announced several key transactions that solidified our long-term growth and financial stability even though our earnings continued to be pressured by challenging market conditions. Our announcement of a joint venture with Saudi Aramco, our successful bond offering and debt tender offer, execution of our fleet strategies through continued sales of our older assets and our outstanding operational and safety performance made the quarter remarkable on many fronts. We accomplished these milestones while continuing to effectively reduce our costs and improve our focus on efficiency across the company. These transactions and solid operational execution mean that our visible liquidity runway now extends comfortably into the next decade, allowing us more flexibility to invest in attractive growth opportunities.
Stephen will review our financial performance in detail, so I will only make a few comments. We reported a loss of $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter, down from $0.04 of earnings per share in the previous quarter. The results this quarter were impacted by a $33.6 million loss on our proactive early retirement of debt. Excluding this loss, our $0.08 of earnings per share this quarter beat consensus.
Our fourth quarter EBITDA was $143 million versus consensus estimate of $132 million, mainly driven by solid cost control and higher revenue efficiencies.
During the quarter, we executed 2 debt capital market transactions. Though we would have preferred to extinguish debt at a discount, we are certainly pleased by the market's recognition of our solid financial position, effectively identifying us as a company that will confidently move through the remainder of this down cycle and emerges in a position of strength. I'm pleased that Rowan has led the peer group in relative TSR over the last 3-year period. And then in 2016, we generated a positive return of 12%. Our strong operational performance in 2016, aided by our outstanding operational uptime of over 98%, helped drive solid cash generation. Of course, this uptime performance wouldn't be meaningful if it weren't accompanied by our best safety performance on record.
For a company to have accomplished these performance measures during another year of intense focus on cost reductions is truly a well-founded source of pride for men and women who work at Rowan. However, just as important during this downturn is that we are highly focused on making structural changes to how we operate to ensure this outstanding performance becomes repeatable and sustained. During the fourth quarter, we sold 2 of our remaining older assets, the Gorilla II and Gorilla III. This followed the sale of 3 other older assets in 2015. 4 of the 5 sold rigs are now restricted to non-drilling activities. We have only 2 older stacked rigs left, allowing us to more fully concentrate our support on rigs that will have a meaningful contribution to our earnings when the market recovers.
We're thrilled with our recently announced partnership with Saudi Aramco, who has been our largest customer for over 10 years, and we're delighted to further that relationship. The new company will expand its fleet over time, which will help Saudi Aramco accomplish its strategic goals as well as provide a source of [ph] stability and unparalleled growth to Rowan, truly a win-win. Stephen will provide more details in a moment on this important long-term value-creation opportunity.
Now I'd like to share with you thoughts on the market.
A year ago was a year the market was bleak, as we expected further declines in demand for both Jack-up and Deepwater markets. That forecast proved to be true. We've seen operated budgets decline for 3 years in a row, assisted by lower rig day rates and other costs. As we've seen in cycles in the past, activities with lower capital commitments such as unconventional land drilling and shallow-water brownfield projects recover more quickly than larger, capital-intensive activities such as ultra-deepwater exploration and development. With some -- we saw some improvements in oil prices last quarter, and then OPEC's production cuts further supported crude oil prices. This stability in oil price seems to be driving increased tendering activity for late 2017, especially for jack-ups. However, the floating market seems to be pushing off to 2018.
While we're becoming more comfortable with forecasting a reasonable recovery over the coming years, more attrition of older assets is necessary for true recovery. We have seen further jack-up and floater scrapping and retirements recently and expect those to continue over the next years. While a robust recovery of the drilling market may take multiple years, we are confident that the strength of our balance sheet and our operational performance will carry us through.
Finally, as with previous quarters, we continued to have a keen focus on optimal capital allocation. With the impressive work that our finance team has done in extending our visible runway, combined with our extremely solid operational performance and a market recovery that is becoming a little clearer each day, we feel well positioned to act on any attractive opportunities that come our way. Those opportunities may take many forms, from debt retirements to distressed asset acquisitions, but we'll always view them through the same long-term shareholder value lens.
Now for a look at the market where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Thi",1222,"Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone.
As we enter 2017, we reflect on our position in the cycle and look forward, cautiously optimistic, that this year will present a turning point for the industry, though recovery may be modest for several years. This morning, I'll revisit with you about the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and our outlook for the year and conclude with a few thoughts on the attrition needs that our industry must address.
We were pleased to report several jack-up contract extensions on our last fleet status update. The additional projects signed in Trinidad exhibit our customer satisfaction and our outstanding drilling performance and our continued commitment to have Rowan as their chosen partner in executing their drilling programs. Although we did not disclose the day rates due to the competitive nature of the global markets, they continue to provide significant operating margin. And we were happy to add utilization to those 3 units.
In the North Sea, we currently have 3 jack-ups contracted and 3 available. We're in discussions with multiple operators about opportunities for the Rowan Norway, the Rowan Stavanger and the Gorilla VI, but project commencements seem weighted toward the second half of 2017. We are looking at P&A work both in Norway and the U.K. sector but also considering attractive opportunities outside of the region.
We continue to see the most promising opportunity for increased demand in the Middle East. We are honored to be selected as the 50-50 joint venture partner with Saudi Aramco and expect that this new company will gain significant market share within Saudi Aramco's fleet of jack-ups in the coming years. We look forward to the commencement of the company in the second quarter. Throughout the region, we see a focus on high-specification jack-ups. And our 2 available units, EXL I and EXL IV, are being tendered aggressively both in the Middle East and around the world. The Gorilla IV and EXL III continue operations with Arena Offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We see several additional opportunities in the region as operators look to develop lower-cost, faster-cycle brownfield projects in the current budget environment.
To quickly touch on other areas of the world. We see increased tender activity in Southeast Asia. However, we anticipate initial needs will be met by units currently in the region. We are actively participating in contracting opportunities in West Africa as operators look to high-grade units in that market. In Mexico, we are closely monitoring the bidding rounds and expect multiple shallow-water blocks to be offered in 2017. However, the commencement of these projects may not materialize until sometime in 2018. Worldwide marketing jack-up utilization is now 68%, but we anticipate the bottoming of the trough within 2017 for jack-ups. While downward pressure on day rates may continue due to idle supply and the newbuilds waiting to enter the market, the combination of an increase in drilling activity and an anticipation of continued attrition should improve effective utilization levels worldwide, especially in niche markets.
Now let's look at the ultra-deepwater market. Market utilization fell approximately 9% during 2016, and we expect 2017 to be another challenging year as new contract awards struggle to keep pace with contract roll-offs. As operators seem focused on capital spending in shorter-cycle investments, several ultra-deepwater projects that we previously anticipated commencing in 2017 now appear to be slipping into 2018. However, we are pleased with ongoing conversations with our customers about opportunities for our available drillships and continue to believe that dual-BOP 1,250-ton units will be the first to return to work. These rigs offer operators the technical capabilities that give them the flexibility to address their worldwide portfolios that are especially critical to the demanding drilling and regulatory requirements in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
2 of our 4 units are currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and our remaining 2 units are warm stacked. We believe that warm stacking is the best approach for these vessels, as our customers have made it clear that cold-stacked units will be the last in line to be contracted. Although the crew numbers are reduced on our ships, repairs and maintenance are ongoing, and there will be minimal costs when the units return to work. 2018 appears promising for the seventh-generation ultra-deepwater market, assuming commodity prices can maintain their stability and, as many are forecasting, continue to climb steadily as the year progresses. We are actively participating in tenders for work in East and West Africa, Central and South America and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Additionally, we are encouraged by the activity in the recently completed bidding rounds in Mexico and the anticipated offers in Brazil, which include the second production-sharing round and the 14th bidding round of blocks under the concession regime. Despite this anticipated demand, recovery for the floater market as a whole seems to be more in the 2019 time frame.
As I alluded earlier in the call, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing attrition both for floaters and jack-ups. On the floater side, approximately 74 units have been removed from the fleet since October of 2014. While this is a good start, given our view of demand over the coming years, we believe that an additional 100 units could be retired from the current fleet. In tandem with strengthening commodity prices that encourage increased demand, this attrition could accelerate the industry's ability to attain a healthy utilization target of 85%. The majority of these retirements should come from older units, those that are currently stacked and those rolling off contract. As technology has advanced, many of these floaters have become obsolete, and contractors will struggle to maintain them and put them back to work.
Regarding jack-up attrition, only 32 units have been removed from the fleet over the same time period, but there are currently 230 jack-ups in the total fleet that are 35 years or older, 62 of which are cold stacked or out of service. While it is significantly less expensive for the stacked jack-ups than floaters, which contributes to the rationale of delayed attrition, we believe that most of these older units will not reenter the market. With approximately 100 newbuilds waiting to enter the fleet, it's hard to imagine a customer choosing an aged jack-up that has been stacked for a significant amount of time over a newbuild unit for a potential project, provided a suitable drilling contractor is sponsoring their market entry. Applying similar analysis for a supportable jack-up supply in the future, we believe many of the older jack-ups could be retired from the current fleet over the coming years. Rowan has been diligent in our attrition efforts, having removed 4 of our older units from the market since the downturn. And we will most likely retire the Cecil Provine and Rowan California. Attrition is vital to accelerating the recovery of the offshore drilling market, and considering the aging fleet, this is certainly an attainable goal.
While we acknowledge the uphill battle that the industry faces in 2017, our high-spec fleet of jack-ups and drillships, backed by our outstanding workforce, gives us the utmost confidence in our ability to take advantage of the opportunities that the recovery will bring.
This concludes my remarks this morning, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

On the call today, I will review our fourth quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter. Next, I will provide some additional color around our agreement with Saudi Aramco to jointly form a new drilling company in 2017 and the implications for our financial results. Lastly, we will provide you with an update on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
This morning, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $24 million or $0.19 per share, which includes a $33.6 million loss on the extinguishment of $464 million of debt. Excluding this item, earnings were $0.08 per share for the fourth quarter, down $0.22 from the previous quarter non-GAAP earnings per share due primarily to a reduction in jack-up utilization. We generated $346 million in revenue during the fourth quarter, excluding rebillable items, an 8% decline from the previous quarter as we incurred increased jack-up idle time and had a couple of rigs out of service in the Middle East.
We completed 26 payments of less than 1.5% operational downtime fleetwide for the entire year. We are especially proud that we have not incurred any downtime on our drillships for 3 straight quarters and less than 0.10% downtime for the year.
Our idle days as a percentage of available days showed only a slight 2% increase from the third quarter up to approximately 29%. Our out-of-service time for the Jack-up fleet was approximately 7% of our available rig days in the fourth quarter due primarily to repairs and inspections on the Bob Palmer and Hank Boswell and upgrades to the J.P. Bussell in preparation for the contribution to the new joint venture with Saudi Aramco.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were $174 million, a reduction of $8 million from the previous quarter, attributable to lower activity on idled rigs and continued cost-control efforts. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues.
In line with our guidance, SG&A expenses totaled $26 million in the fourth quarter and $102 million for the full year, down 12% from 2015 levels and 19% versus 2014. Our fourth quarter depreciation expense remained flat with the third quarter level at $102 million. Interest expense was $39 million in the quarter.
With respect to the income tax provision, we recognized a tax benefit in the quarter of $9.7 million as a result of a reduction in our tax asset valuation allowance due to certain intercompany transactions. Our annual effective tax rate was still in the low single digits, as previously guided.
Now for a look at our cash flow and balance sheet.
For the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $29 million, slightly above the third quarter level primarily due to regularly scheduled surveys for the Bob Palmer and Hank Boswell and preparations for the J.P. Bussell's contribution to the joint venture with Saudi Aramco. Full year CapEx for 2016 came in at $118 million, somewhat below our previous guidance as some capital spend slipped into 2017.
All in all, we generated $218 million in cash in the fourth quarter, and our current cash balance today stands at $1.1 billion. With an additional $1.5 billion untapped revolver, our liquidity continues to be very strong.
In the fourth quarter, we issued $500 million of 8.5-year senior unsecured notes to yield 7 3/8. Simultaneously, we executed the tender offer focused on clearing out a substantial portion of our near-term debt maturities. Following the expiration of our tender offer, on February 8 of this year, we also exercised our early redemption option on the remaining 2017 note. In total, we extinguished approximately $590 million of debt maturities that were slated to come due between 2017 and 2022. The combined effect of these actions significantly extends our already lengthy visible runway, we believe, solidifying our liquidity well into eventual market recovery and affording us the flexibility to make more opportunistic capital allocation decisions.
Now I'd like to take some time to walk you through some of the economics of the new company that we are forming together with Saudi Aramco.
Upon legal formation late in the first quarter of 2017, Saudi Aramco and Rowan will each contribute $25 million in cash to capitalize the new entity. Shortly thereafter on startup, Saudi Aramco will also contribute 2 jack-up rigs and related assets. Rowan will contribute 3 of its jack-up rigs, the Gilbert Rowe, Bob Keller and J.P. Bussell; our shorebase facilities; and related assets. Due to the uneven value of these contributions, Saudi Aramco is expected to contribute cash to maintain a 50-50 ownership split. Day rates for these first 5 contributed rigs have been negotiated for the first 3 years into 2020.
The end dates of the current contracts on the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell have been leveled out so they ramp up simultaneously in October 2018, when these rigs will also be contributed to the new company. These adjusted contracts will still provide the same backlog to Rowan between the 2 rigs.
As with the initial contribution, Saudi Aramco is then expected to contribute cash to maintain its ownership level. The second tranche of contributed rigs, the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell, will receive initial contracts of 3 years with day rates determined by a discounted market index. The 7 contributed rigs, 5 initial and 2 in 2018, are expected to remain under contract for their remaining useful lives to meet Saudi Aramco's drilling needs, provided that the rigs continue to meet the technical and operational requirements for Saudi Aramco.
You will note that the contributed rigs from Rowan's side do not account for all of the rigs currently under contract with Saudi Aramco. From startup, the new company will manage Rowan's 7 remaining jack-ups in the kingdom through the remainder of their contracts for a customary management fee. At the conclusion of each managed rig contract, other than the Boswell and Yeargain which will be contributed, the rig may be leased by the new company as needed.
Looking beyond the next few years, the new company will begin ordering jack-ups to be built by a joint venture between Lamprell, a highly qualified and experienced player in rig construction; and Saudi Aramco. We expect the first rig to be delivered in 2021, generally followed by 2 rigs per year for 10 years and up to 20 newbuild rigs in total. Each of these rigs will be placed on an initial long-term contract with Saudi Aramco. In a similar fashion to the contributed rigs, following their initial contracts, the newbuild rigs will remain under contract for their remaining useful lives at day rates determined by a discounted market index.
Although we're not providing the details of all the economic arrangements, the newbuild rigs are expected to generate an attractive return on investment. I want to reinforce that both Saudi Aramco and Rowan expect the newbuild program to be fully funded through internal JV cash generation and external debt financing. Given the magnitude of the backlogs, coupled with the strength of our counterparty, we expect the new company will be able to self- and externally fund the growth without additional shareholder injection.
However, should these funds be insufficient, Saudi Aramco and Rowan intend to stand behind these orders. Both of the parties expect that the new company will generally not hold excess levels of cash other than what will be needed under the business plan. Any additional funds will typically be distributed to the shareholders. Therefore, given Saudi Aramco's matching contributions and the cash generation from the new entity, we expect to see a further strengthening of Rowan's already robust liquidity over the next 2 years as excess cash is distributed.
We expect to account for our investment in the JV under the equity method, and our share of the venture's income will flow through equity and unconsolidated subsidiaries on our income statement. As we are contributing our in-kingdom shorebase operations and facilities, those costs will also be absorbed by the new venture from inception forward. Though the intent is to create a self-sustaining business, the new company is expected to rely on Rowan for various back-office support services for the first few years. We expect the reimbursement of these services to be recorded as revenue on Rowan's books.
Now to review our guidance for 2017, updated from our preliminary numbers provided in the last quarter.
On the heels of 2 very strong years for cash generation, the next 2 years will be much more challenging in terms of our financial results, with 2 drillships currently idle and 1 additional vessel potentially approaching the end of its contract next quarter. As Tom and Mark discussed, while we anticipate reaching a bottom in demand for jack-ups in 2017 and floaters in early 2018, we believe the industry will need to rationalize significant excess capacity before we experience a meaningful recovery in day rates.
We estimate that our full year 2017 operating costs excluding rebillables will range between $625 million and $675 million, depending on the level of activity for our idled rigs or other rigs rolling off contract during the year. This represents an 11% to 17% reduction from our 2016 level primarily due to reduced activity, the new joint venture absorbing approximately $25 million of shore-based costs and incremental cost-control measures.
First quarter 2017 operating expenses are expected to approximate $170 million. This guidance excludes certain potential joint venture costs that may be grossed up on our income statement and offset by equal revenue. We expect to incur SG&A expense of $95 million to $100 million in 2017, which represents a slight decline from the 2016 level of $102 million, with approximately $26 million in the first quarter. We expect to record depreciation expense of $385 million to $395 million, slightly below our 2016 level. Our full year interest expense guidance is $155 million to $160 million, slightly above our previous guidance taking into account the impact of the recent capital market transactions.
Moving on to our income tax provisions. As pretax income declines to a fairly low level, the effective tax rate starts becoming less meaningful, so this year, instead of providing you with an estimated tax rate, we will provide guidance for the estimated tax expense. We expect our income tax expense for 2017 will approximate $50 million versus only $5 million in 2016. The significant expected difference from 2016 to 2017 is primarily driven by 2 noncash factors. Under U.S. GAAP, certain transactions that occurred in 2016, while creating no income tax in aggregate, created a tax benefit in 2016 which will be offset by expense in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, the early adoption of a new accounting standard will result in our eliminating a deferred tax liability and taking into retained earnings over $200 million in January of 2017 but will eliminate a roughly annual $20 million benefit over the next decade.
First quarter tax expense is expected to range from $10 million to $15 million, but our income tax expense will likely vary significantly quarter to quarter, depending on the actual results, additional backlog, additions or other transactions, as they impact our forecast and our valuation allowances on our net deferred tax assets. So while the provision may be -- remain volatile, we expect our cash taxes to remain flat in the $40 million range in 2017, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to the previous year.
Finally, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $105 million to $115 million in 2017, an approximate 10% increase from previous guidance primarily due to the deferral of certain fourth quarter capital spend into 2017.
We are proud of Rowan's performance during 2016 and the flexibility we have built for the company to maneuver through the challenging time facing our industry. Over the course of the year, we continued to reduce costs, strengthen our balance sheet and improved our liquidity without any dilution to shareholders. Our safety, environmental and drilling performance have been excellent. Our intense focus on customer satisfaction is yielding positive results, as is exemplified by our groundbreaking partnership with the world's largest oil company and consumer of jack-up drilling rigs. We are cautiously optimistic that when -- that we will see a bottom in offshore drilling activity over the next year or so and will then begin the road back toward healthy market fundamentals. Meanwhile, we will continue to focus on what is under our control as we position Rowan to thrive in the eventual market recovery.

If Saudi Aramco hasn't dealt with them since 2004, I can tell you Saudi Aramco wouldn't offer a 5-year contract unless they felt like the bottom of the market was near or certainly was here.

They have a -- there really hasn't been any appreciable exploration drilling since early 2014. So at some point, when that begins to occur and they have these backlogs of wells, I think you will be tempted with that opportunity. But to your question, if we see the market improving and the fact that we're doing in a -- we believe -- as IOCs term up, that they will go for the 32 dual-stack 1,250-ton rigs, I do think we'll be cognizant of that certainly and be cautious. We would try to contract the rig short term rather than long term once we see the market start to move. But that's what we see right now. I mean, like Tom said, that changes. If you have all your deepwater rigs down, then you may go take one of those jobs and then play the market with the other 3 or something like that, but right now that's kind of where we are."

Depending on what happens, obviously, with Cobalt, and Reliance may work a little bit longer, but you could end up -- obviously, if that one goes down, that'd be your third rig that doesn't have a job. How should we think about the thought process around stacking for one of those? If you sense a job is 3 months out, do you have to keep the thing fully crewed and hot? Sort of what's the threshold where it's worth it to bring it down to warm stack and then bring it back up? Or do you feel like that actually puts you at a competitive disadvantage with customers then maybe literally want every single guy that just finished the prior program on the rig? How should we think about the potential thought process for that rig considering that you'd probably want one pretty ready to go kind of bullet in the gun if you will?"

Certainly, the lowest state we would go down to would be warm stacks because, if we had some lower fifth-generation or lower sixth-generation rigs, we would certainly maybe consider taking them down lower. But warm stacked would be the lowest state of readiness we would go to. Most of the customers, when we're talking about these type of programs, they don't sort of like spring them on you, like, tomorrow. There's normally a good -- a fair amount of lead time, so it's -- which is not necessarily as true of jack-ups, but with these water rigs, it's less likely they'll say, ""Have you got a rig? Let's go."" They'll -- normally it will be 6 months, 9 months of lead time. And so we feel that keeping all of the junior crews on the rigs, on -- and i.e. meaning keeping it hot stacked, if we don't have something which we can see moving to, Mark described it as walking the rig between contracts.  And we would -- we would go down to a hot-stack basis.  But -- so it would be kind of less likely to keep it hot stacked if -- unless we have something clear to go to. Otherwise, we will take it down to warm stacked.  And then -- and when we say warm stacked, I mean, we really mean warm stacked, meaning it is warm. We're not expecting any additional capital to go back to work but the understanding between operations, operations support and marketing is that the rig can be moved anywhere at very short notice. And it is all the maintenance being done if the customers come and inspect it, they will -- or a customer audit will find a rig that is ready to go back to work except it doesn't have the junior crews. So I don't see us keeping a rig hot stacked, Eduardo, unless we had something fairly substantial. But our warm stacked is -- it is a -- is truly warm where we can -- what we're looking to do is add the junior crews back."

Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open the call up for questions.
In the fourth quarter 2016, we announced several key transactions that solidified our long-term growth and financial stability even though our earnings continued to be pressured by challenging market conditions. Our announcement of a joint venture with Saudi Aramco, our successful bond offering and debt tender offer, execution of our fleet strategies through continued sales of our older assets and our outstanding operational and safety performance made the quarter remarkable on many fronts. We accomplished these milestones while continuing to effectively reduce our costs and improve our focus on efficiency across the company. These transactions and solid operational execution mean that our visible liquidity runway now extends comfortably into the next decade, allowing us more flexibility to invest in attractive growth opportunities.
Stephen will review our financial performance in detail, so I will only make a few comments. We reported a loss of $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter, down from $0.04 of earnings per share in the previous quarter. The results this quarter were impacted by a $33.6 million loss on our proactive early retirement of debt. Excluding this loss, our $0.08 of earnings per share this quarter beat consensus.
Our fourth quarter EBITDA was $143 million versus consensus estimate of $132 million, mainly driven by solid cost control and higher revenue efficiencies.
During the quarter, we executed 2 debt capital market transactions. Though we would have preferred to extinguish debt at a discount, we are certainly pleased by the market's recognition of our solid financial position, effectively identifying us as a company that will confidently move through the remainder of this down cycle and emerges in a position of strength. I'm pleased that Rowan has led the peer group in relative TSR over the last 3-year period. And then in 2016, we generated a positive return of 12%. Our strong operational performance in 2016, aided by our outstanding operational uptime of over 98%, helped drive solid cash generation. Of course, this uptime performance wouldn't be meaningful if it weren't accompanied by our best safety performance on record.
For a company to have accomplished these performance measures during another year of intense focus on cost reductions is truly a well-founded source of pride for men and women who work at Rowan. However, just as important during this downturn is that we are highly focused on making structural changes to how we operate to ensure this outstanding performance becomes repeatable and sustained. During the fourth quarter, we sold 2 of our remaining older assets, the Gorilla II and Gorilla III. This followed the sale of 3 other older assets in 2015. 4 of the 5 sold rigs are now restricted to non-drilling activities. We have only 2 older stacked rigs left, allowing us to more fully concentrate our support on rigs that will have a meaningful contribution to our earnings when the market recovers.
We're thrilled with our recently announced partnership with Saudi Aramco, who has been our largest customer for over 10 years, and we're delighted to further that relationship. The new company will expand its fleet over time, which will help Saudi Aramco accomplish its strategic goals as well as provide a source of [ph] stability and unparalleled growth to Rowan, truly a win-win. Stephen will provide more details in a moment on this important long-term value-creation opportunity.
Now I'd like to share with you thoughts on the market.
A year ago was a year the market was bleak, as we expected further declines in demand for both Jack-up and Deepwater markets. That forecast proved to be true. We've seen operated budgets decline for 3 years in a row, assisted by lower rig day rates and other costs. As we've seen in cycles in the past, activities with lower capital commitments such as unconventional land drilling and shallow-water brownfield projects recover more quickly than larger, capital-intensive activities such as ultra-deepwater exploration and development. With some -- we saw some improvements in oil prices last quarter, and then OPEC's production cuts further supported crude oil prices. This stability in oil price seems to be driving increased tendering activity for late 2017, especially for jack-ups. However, the floating market seems to be pushing off to 2018.
While we're becoming more comfortable with forecasting a reasonable recovery over the coming years, more attrition of older assets is necessary for true recovery. We have seen further jack-up and floater scrapping and retirements recently and expect those to continue over the next years. While a robust recovery of the drilling market may take multiple years, we are confident that the strength of our balance sheet and our operational performance will carry us through.
Finally, as with previous quarters, we continued to have a keen focus on optimal capital allocation. With the impressive work that our finance team has done in extending our visible runway, combined with our extremely solid operational performance and a market recovery that is becoming a little clearer each day, we feel well positioned to act on any attractive opportunities that come our way. Those opportunities may take many forms, from debt retirements to distressed asset acquisitions, but we'll always view them through the same long-term shareholder value lens.
Now for a look at the market where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Thi",1222,"Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone.
As we enter 2017, we reflect on our position in the cycle and look forward, cautiously optimistic, that this year will present a turning point for the industry, though recovery may be modest for several years. This morning, I'll revisit with you about the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and our outlook for the year and conclude with a few thoughts on the attrition needs that our industry must address.
We were pleased to report several jack-up contract extensions on our last fleet status update. The additional projects signed in Trinidad exhibit our customer satisfaction and our outstanding drilling performance and our continued commitment to have Rowan as their chosen partner in executing their drilling programs. Although we did not disclose the day rates due to the competitive nature of the global markets, they continue to provide significant operating margin. And we were happy to add utilization to those 3 units.
In the North Sea, we currently have 3 jack-ups contracted and 3 available. We're in discussions with multiple operators about opportunities for the Rowan Norway, the Rowan Stavanger and the Gorilla VI, but project commencements seem weighted toward the second half of 2017. We are looking at P&A work both in Norway and the U.K. sector but also considering attractive opportunities outside of the region.
We continue to see the most promising opportunity for increased demand in the Middle East. We are honored to be selected as the 50-50 joint venture partner with Saudi Aramco and expect that this new company will gain significant market share within Saudi Aramco's fleet of jack-ups in the coming years. We look forward to the commencement of the company in the second quarter. Throughout the region, we see a focus on high-specification jack-ups. And our 2 available units, EXL I and EXL IV, are being tendered aggressively both in the Middle East and around the world. The Gorilla IV and EXL III continue operations with Arena Offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We see several additional opportunities in the region as operators look to develop lower-cost, faster-cycle brownfield projects in the current budget environment.
To quickly touch on other areas of the world. We see increased tender activity in Southeast Asia. However, we anticipate initial needs will be met by units currently in the region. We are actively participating in contracting opportunities in West Africa as operators look to high-grade units in that market. In Mexico, we are closely monitoring the bidding rounds and expect multiple shallow-water blocks to be offered in 2017. However, the commencement of these projects may not materialize until sometime in 2018. Worldwide marketing jack-up utilization is now 68%, but we anticipate the bottoming of the trough within 2017 for jack-ups. While downward pressure on day rates may continue due to idle supply and the newbuilds waiting to enter the market, the combination of an increase in drilling activity and an anticipation of continued attrition should improve effective utilization levels worldwide, especially in niche markets.
Now let's look at the ultra-deepwater market. Market utilization fell approximately 9% during 2016, and we expect 2017 to be another challenging year as new contract awards struggle to keep pace with contract roll-offs. As operators seem focused on capital spending in shorter-cycle investments, several ultra-deepwater projects that we previously anticipated commencing in 2017 now appear to be slipping into 2018. However, we are pleased with ongoing conversations with our customers about opportunities for our available drillships and continue to believe that dual-BOP 1,250-ton units will be the first to return to work. These rigs offer operators the technical capabilities that give them the flexibility to address their worldwide portfolios that are especially critical to the demanding drilling and regulatory requirements in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
2 of our 4 units are currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and our remaining 2 units are warm stacked. We believe that warm stacking is the best approach for these vessels, as our customers have made it clear that cold-stacked units will be the last in line to be contracted. Although the crew numbers are reduced on our ships, repairs and maintenance are ongoing, and there will be minimal costs when the units return to work. 2018 appears promising for the seventh-generation ultra-deepwater market, assuming commodity prices can maintain their stability and, as many are forecasting, continue to climb steadily as the year progresses. We are actively participating in tenders for work in East and West Africa, Central and South America and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Additionally, we are encouraged by the activity in the recently completed bidding rounds in Mexico and the anticipated offers in Brazil, which include the second production-sharing round and the 14th bidding round of blocks under the concession regime. Despite this anticipated demand, recovery for the floater market as a whole seems to be more in the 2019 time frame.
As I alluded earlier in the call, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing attrition both for floaters and jack-ups. On the floater side, approximately 74 units have been removed from the fleet since October of 2014. While this is a good start, given our view of demand over the coming years, we believe that an additional 100 units could be retired from the current fleet. In tandem with strengthening commodity prices that encourage increased demand, this attrition could accelerate the industry's ability to attain a healthy utilization target of 85%. The majority of these retirements should come from older units, those that are currently stacked and those rolling off contract. As technology has advanced, many of these floaters have become obsolete, and contractors will struggle to maintain them and put them back to work.
Regarding jack-up attrition, only 32 units have been removed from the fleet over the same time period, but there are currently 230 jack-ups in the total fleet that are 35 years or older, 62 of which are cold stacked or out of service. While it is significantly less expensive for the stacked jack-ups than floaters, which contributes to the rationale of delayed attrition, we believe that most of these older units will not reenter the market. With approximately 100 newbuilds waiting to enter the fleet, it's hard to imagine a customer choosing an aged jack-up that has been stacked for a significant amount of time over a newbuild unit for a potential project, provided a suitable drilling contractor is sponsoring their market entry. Applying similar analysis for a supportable jack-up supply in the future, we believe many of the older jack-ups could be retired from the current fleet over the coming years. Rowan has been diligent in our attrition efforts, having removed 4 of our older units from the market since the downturn. And we will most likely retire the Cecil Provine and Rowan California. Attrition is vital to accelerating the recovery of the offshore drilling market, and considering the aging fleet, this is certainly an attainable goal.
While we acknowledge the uphill battle that the industry faces in 2017, our high-spec fleet of jack-ups and drillships, backed by our outstanding workforce, gives us the utmost confidence in our ability to take advantage of the opportunities that the recovery will bring.
This concludes my remarks this morning, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

On the call today, I will review our fourth quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter. Next, I will provide some additional color around our agreement with Saudi Aramco to jointly form a new drilling company in 2017 and the implications for our financial results. Lastly, we will provide you with an update on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
This morning, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $24 million or $0.19 per share, which includes a $33.6 million loss on the extinguishment of $464 million of debt. Excluding this item, earnings were $0.08 per share for the fourth quarter, down $0.22 from the previous quarter non-GAAP earnings per share due primarily to a reduction in jack-up utilization. We generated $346 million in revenue during the fourth quarter, excluding rebillable items, an 8% decline from the previous quarter as we incurred increased jack-up idle time and had a couple of rigs out of service in the Middle East.
We completed 26 payments of less than 1.5% operational downtime fleetwide for the entire year. We are especially proud that we have not incurred any downtime on our drillships for 3 straight quarters and less than 0.10% downtime for the year.
Our idle days as a percentage of available days showed only a slight 2% increase from the third quarter up to approximately 29%. Our out-of-service time for the Jack-up fleet was approximately 7% of our available rig days in the fourth quarter due primarily to repairs and inspections on the Bob Palmer and Hank Boswell and upgrades to the J.P. Bussell in preparation for the contribution to the new joint venture with Saudi Aramco.
Fourth quarter operating expenses were $174 million, a reduction of $8 million from the previous quarter, attributable to lower activity on idled rigs and continued cost-control efforts. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues.
In line with our guidance, SG&A expenses totaled $26 million in the fourth quarter and $102 million for the full year, down 12% from 2015 levels and 19% versus 2014. Our fourth quarter depreciation expense remained flat with the third quarter level at $102 million. Interest expense was $39 million in the quarter.
With respect to the income tax provision, we recognized a tax benefit in the quarter of $9.7 million as a result of a reduction in our tax asset valuation allowance due to certain intercompany transactions. Our annual effective tax rate was still in the low single digits, as previously guided.
Now for a look at our cash flow and balance sheet.
For the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $29 million, slightly above the third quarter level primarily due to regularly scheduled surveys for the Bob Palmer and Hank Boswell and preparations for the J.P. Bussell's contribution to the joint venture with Saudi Aramco. Full year CapEx for 2016 came in at $118 million, somewhat below our previous guidance as some capital spend slipped into 2017.
All in all, we generated $218 million in cash in the fourth quarter, and our current cash balance today stands at $1.1 billion. With an additional $1.5 billion untapped revolver, our liquidity continues to be very strong.
In the fourth quarter, we issued $500 million of 8.5-year senior unsecured notes to yield 7 3/8. Simultaneously, we executed the tender offer focused on clearing out a substantial portion of our near-term debt maturities. Following the expiration of our tender offer, on February 8 of this year, we also exercised our early redemption option on the remaining 2017 note. In total, we extinguished approximately $590 million of debt maturities that were slated to come due between 2017 and 2022. The combined effect of these actions significantly extends our already lengthy visible runway, we believe, solidifying our liquidity well into eventual market recovery and affording us the flexibility to make more opportunistic capital allocation decisions.
Now I'd like to take some time to walk you through some of the economics of the new company that we are forming together with Saudi Aramco.
Upon legal formation late in the first quarter of 2017, Saudi Aramco and Rowan will each contribute $25 million in cash to capitalize the new entity. Shortly thereafter on startup, Saudi Aramco will also contribute 2 jack-up rigs and related assets. Rowan will contribute 3 of its jack-up rigs, the Gilbert Rowe, Bob Keller and J.P. Bussell; our shorebase facilities; and related assets. Due to the uneven value of these contributions, Saudi Aramco is expected to contribute cash to maintain a 50-50 ownership split. Day rates for these first 5 contributed rigs have been negotiated for the first 3 years into 2020.
The end dates of the current contracts on the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell have been leveled out so they ramp up simultaneously in October 2018, when these rigs will also be contributed to the new company. These adjusted contracts will still provide the same backlog to Rowan between the 2 rigs.
As with the initial contribution, Saudi Aramco is then expected to contribute cash to maintain its ownership level. The second tranche of contributed rigs, the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell, will receive initial contracts of 3 years with day rates determined by a discounted market index. The 7 contributed rigs, 5 initial and 2 in 2018, are expected to remain under contract for their remaining useful lives to meet Saudi Aramco's drilling needs, provided that the rigs continue to meet the technical and operational requirements for Saudi Aramco.
You will note that the contributed rigs from Rowan's side do not account for all of the rigs currently under contract with Saudi Aramco. From startup, the new company will manage Rowan's 7 remaining jack-ups in the kingdom through the remainder of their contracts for a customary management fee. At the conclusion of each managed rig contract, other than the Boswell and Yeargain which will be contributed, the rig may be leased by the new company as needed.
Looking beyond the next few years, the new company will begin ordering jack-ups to be built by a joint venture between Lamprell, a highly qualified and experienced player in rig construction; and Saudi Aramco. We expect the first rig to be delivered in 2021, generally followed by 2 rigs per year for 10 years and up to 20 newbuild rigs in total. Each of these rigs will be placed on an initial long-term contract with Saudi Aramco. In a similar fashion to the contributed rigs, following their initial contracts, the newbuild rigs will remain under contract for their remaining useful lives at day rates determined by a discounted market index.
Although we're not providing the details of all the economic arrangements, the newbuild rigs are expected to generate an attractive return on investment. I want to reinforce that both Saudi Aramco and Rowan expect the newbuild program to be fully funded through internal JV cash generation and external debt financing. Given the magnitude of the backlogs, coupled with the strength of our counterparty, we expect the new company will be able to self- and externally fund the growth without additional shareholder injection.
However, should these funds be insufficient, Saudi Aramco and Rowan intend to stand behind these orders. Both of the parties expect that the new company will generally not hold excess levels of cash other than what will be needed under the business plan. Any additional funds will typically be distributed to the shareholders. Therefore, given Saudi Aramco's matching contributions and the cash generation from the new entity, we expect to see a further strengthening of Rowan's already robust liquidity over the next 2 years as excess cash is distributed.
We expect to account for our investment in the JV under the equity method, and our share of the venture's income will flow through equity and unconsolidated subsidiaries on our income statement. As we are contributing our in-kingdom shorebase operations and facilities, those costs will also be absorbed by the new venture from inception forward. Though the intent is to create a self-sustaining business, the new company is expected to rely on Rowan for various back-office support services for the first few years. We expect the reimbursement of these services to be recorded as revenue on Rowan's books.
Now to review our guidance for 2017, updated from our preliminary numbers provided in the last quarter.
On the heels of 2 very strong years for cash generation, the next 2 years will be much more challenging in terms of our financial results, with 2 drillships currently idle and 1 additional vessel potentially approaching the end of its contract next quarter. As Tom and Mark discussed, while we anticipate reaching a bottom in demand for jack-ups in 2017 and floaters in early 2018, we believe the industry will need to rationalize significant excess capacity before we experience a meaningful recovery in day rates.
We estimate that our full year 2017 operating costs excluding rebillables will range between $625 million and $675 million, depending on the level of activity for our idled rigs or other rigs rolling off contract during the year. This represents an 11% to 17% reduction from our 2016 level primarily due to reduced activity, the new joint venture absorbing approximately $25 million of shore-based costs and incremental cost-control measures.
First quarter 2017 operating expenses are expected to approximate $170 million. This guidance excludes certain potential joint venture costs that may be grossed up on our income statement and offset by equal revenue. We expect to incur SG&A expense of $95 million to $100 million in 2017, which represents a slight decline from the 2016 level of $102 million, with approximately $26 million in the first quarter. We expect to record depreciation expense of $385 million to $395 million, slightly below our 2016 level. Our full year interest expense guidance is $155 million to $160 million, slightly above our previous guidance taking into account the impact of the recent capital market transactions.
Moving on to our income tax provisions. As pretax income declines to a fairly low level, the effective tax rate starts becoming less meaningful, so this year, instead of providing you with an estimated tax rate, we will provide guidance for the estimated tax expense. We expect our income tax expense for 2017 will approximate $50 million versus only $5 million in 2016. The significant expected difference from 2016 to 2017 is primarily driven by 2 noncash factors. Under U.S. GAAP, certain transactions that occurred in 2016, while creating no income tax in aggregate, created a tax benefit in 2016 which will be offset by expense in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, the early adoption of a new accounting standard will result in our eliminating a deferred tax liability and taking into retained earnings over $200 million in January of 2017 but will eliminate a roughly annual $20 million benefit over the next decade.
First quarter tax expense is expected to range from $10 million to $15 million, but our income tax expense will likely vary significantly quarter to quarter, depending on the actual results, additional backlog, additions or other transactions, as they impact our forecast and our valuation allowances on our net deferred tax assets. So while the provision may be -- remain volatile, we expect our cash taxes to remain flat in the $40 million range in 2017, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to the previous year.
Finally, we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $105 million to $115 million in 2017, an approximate 10% increase from previous guidance primarily due to the deferral of certain fourth quarter capital spend into 2017.
We are proud of Rowan's performance during 2016 and the flexibility we have built for the company to maneuver through the challenging time facing our industry. Over the course of the year, we continued to reduce costs, strengthen our balance sheet and improved our liquidity without any dilution to shareholders. Our safety, environmental and drilling performance have been excellent. Our intense focus on customer satisfaction is yielding positive results, as is exemplified by our groundbreaking partnership with the world's largest oil company and consumer of jack-up drilling rigs. We are cautiously optimistic that when -- that we will see a bottom in offshore drilling activity over the next year or so and will then begin the road back toward healthy market fundamentals. Meanwhile, we will continue to focus on what is under our control as we position Rowan to thrive in the eventual market recovery.

And I think a good market fixture or indicator is the 2 contracts Noble signed with Saudi Aramco at $159,000. And those are 5-year terms. If Saudi Aramco hasn't dealt with them since 2004, I can tell you Saudi Aramco wouldn't offer a 5-year contract unless they felt like the bottom of the market was near or certainly was here.

Our operation teams have done a great job from an operation standpoint. But right now I think there is work beyond '17 in Trinidad for those rigs, but it's -- without a firm commitment, it's very difficult to make that claim to you. But they are very visible projects for the operators that we're currently working for. In the Middle East, in the UAE, in Qatar, we're seeing some demand there for jack-ups, the EXL I and EXL IV are certainly tendered there. We're tendering those rigs all over the world, but we are seeing some demand both in Qatar and in the UAE. And those type of rigs are the preferred type of rig in that region, so..."

And you kind of do a search on Google, and you'll see some press releases on it. And it's going to build platforms. It's going to build ships. It's got bulk ships, tankers. It's going to build a lot of different assets, including offshore rigs, jack-up rigs.

And I think they're also -- again, I can't speak for Saudi Aramco, but I think they're also very focused of diversifying their economy away from -- just from hydrocarbon. I mean they are the biggest in the world on -- from a number of different metrics around hydrocarbon. But they're also focused on other -- developing other parts of their economy, and so I think that's part of it. And also, they have a big focus on workforce developments.

Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore dr",1062,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market and then Steven will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions.
In the first quarter 2017, we put finishing touches on 2 transactions that we executed in the fourth quarter. Our joint venture with Saudi Aramco and our debt refinancing. The first of these transactions will deliver long-term profitable growth for Rowan, and the second, significantly improves our debt maturity profile, even though our earnings continued to be pressured by the current challenging market conditions.
I continue to be pleased by our strong operating performance and focus on cost control as our management team works diligently to drive improvements to our return on invested capital.
As an update from last quarter, we'll continue to make solid progress towards the start-up of our joint venture with Saudi Aramco and expect the commencement of operations at the end of the second quarter. We have recently agreed with our partner to name the company ARO drilling, with ARO spelt A-R-O, which is an abbreviation for Aramco Roan Offshore. The successful execution of the new company's business plan should provide ARO Drilling with tremendous earnings growth through the next decade. Naturally, we are excited to get started and look forward to the value ARO Drilling will provide to both partners.
During the first quarter, we followed up on the debt capital markets transaction that we executed in the fourth quarter by retiring the remainder of our 2017 unsecured notes. These transactions have left us with only $208 million of debt due before 2022, though our $1.5 billion revolver remains untapped.
Stephen will walk you through our financial performance in detail, but in summary, we reported earnings of $0.07 per share in the first quarter, up from a loss of $0.19 per share in the previous quarter. Our first quarter EBITDA was $177 million versus consensus estimate of $158 million, driven mainly by increased the Deepwater revenue at the Rowan resolute returns to a higher day rate, following the period, where we proactively agreed to reduce the day rate to enable a valued customer to execute 2 wells in 2017 drilling program.
In the first quarter, our strong operational performance continued with revenue efficiency of around 98%. This strong uptime performance coupled with solid expense control resulted in our cash balance at the end of the quarter of around $1.2 billion. We continue to focus on improving operational performance across our fleet and we are making good progress in this year. As an example, during the first quarter, all 3 of our rigs operating in Trinidad, have dramatically outperformed our customers drilling plans. While this has resulted in contractual end date that was shorter than expected, all of these rigs have been awarded extension to that contract, to that program.
The downturn begin, began in the third quarter 2014, floater attrition now stands at 74 rigs. In jack-ups, attrition has quietly accumulated to a total of 34 rigs, with most of those rigs leaving the market in the last year or so. from the population of remaining jack-ups that are over 20 years old, 76 rigs are currently called back and we believe most of these will be eventually be recycled or repurposed to non-drilling applications. Another 42 rigs from the same age group, have been idle for more than a year, with all but 2 of those jack-ups been over 30 years old. Altogether, since the downturn in the market began, 34 jack-ups have permanently left the markets and another 118 older rigs look prime for retirement.
While there is still an oversupply, the majority of recently-signed contracts have favored modern assets and we believe this trend will continue. At Raon, we've made steady progress in divesting our older assets over the last couple of years and have only 2 cold stack legacy rigs in our fleet. We are in active discussions that will likely lead to these 2 rigs being removed from our fleet over the next quarter or so.
Before handing the call over to Mark, I would like to share a few thoughts on the market. Last quarter, we shared that we expected a limited customer spending this year with a focus on activities with lower capital commitment and short cash cycles, such as unconventional land drilling and shallow-water Brownfield projects, with muted spending on large and capital extensive activities, structures, Ultra-Deepwater exploration and development. We continue to subscribe to this view. Jack-up tender and continues to improve. And based on conversations with operators, we believe demand for jack-up is likely to grow any higher as the year progresses. While we're cautious to call the bottom in jack-up demands, the number of rigs working has increased since October of last year, although at a gradual pace. Given continued tendering activity, we are optimistic that demand in the jack-up market will earn higher this year than when it started, so long as the commodity price stay supported.
The majority of incremental Deepwater demand has pushed into  2018 and 2019, which is likely the same time frame that Mexico and Brazil will reemerge and stronger regions. Our expectation is that any new awards in the next several quarters will struggle to keep up with the cadence of rigs rolling off contract. However, the floating market appears to be starting to work its way towards bottom. In particular, we're closely monitoring the supply of 7th generation rigs that arrived at currently available or scheduled to roll off contract before the end of 2018 as that has a more direct effect on our contracting prospects.
We went in this business investor the cycles and we believe that first signs of market recovery will drive more players to action. With our healthy cash position and liquidity runway, we are well-positioned to act on attractive opportunities and continue to review the distressed assets from other opportunities. Of course, I can't comment more specifically at this time, but I do believe there are good opportunities available that will enhance shareholder return.
Now, for the look the markets where Rowan competes. I'll hand the call over to Mark."

We continue to be encouraged by strong tendering activity, but remain mindful of the long road to recovery that lies ahead of our industry. At this point in the cycle, we're strategically approaching opportunities around the world to best position our company as initial signs of the market improvement begin to take shape. This morning, I will provide an update on our recent contract announcements and discuss our views on the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets before turning the call over to Stephen.
Our latest fleet status report disclose the extension of work that Rowan in reliance with Cobalt. Operations continue on North flat 4, and we anticipate completion of that program in late May, early June of this year. As a reminder, the day rate changed to 262,000 per day on April 1 to supplement the $96 million payment of that was made for the right to early terminate the contract. We are in ongoing discussions with Cobalt on the possibility of drilling the North flat 5 program, though we anticipated gap between the wells.
In the North sea, we signed a 90-day extension with providing a continuation of work for the Rowan Viking through February 2018. In the Middle East, the government Road contract has been extended with Saudi Aramco to align with the commencement of ARO Drilling. And the XL 3 will work for an additional 3 months for Energy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico through September 2017.
Turning to an overview of the jack-up market. Worldwide market of utilization is currently at 70%, up from 68% on our last call. As we analyze an approximately 80 jack-up fixtures that have been announced in 2017, 73% of those units are younger than 20 years of age. This supports our thesis that as the market troughs and jack-ups return to work, operators will prefer newer, more capable rigs, leaving many older jack-ups with limited value to their owners. As Tom mentioned, our strategy remains to divest our legacy jack-ups and focus on marketing our high-spec equipment.
The Middle East continues to be the most active region for anticipated jack-up demand in the next 12 to 18 months, not only are we looking forward to the commencement of ARO Drilling, but we're optimistic about the potential opportunities for incremental demand in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Kuwait. The EXL I and the EXL IV, which are currently idle in the region, are being actively tendered on multiple projects in Middle East and around the world.
Though the North Sea remains oversupplied, we are having constructive conversations with your customers regarding programs in the second half of the year and early next year for our in-class [indiscernible] class units.
In Norway and [indiscernible] are best positioned to work in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors in the North Sea. Probably, the class jack-ups have more flexibility to take advantages of suitable projects that may arise outside of the region. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad, we see potential for all 5 of our jack-ups to remain fully utilized through 2017. our longtime presence and excellent operating performance support earning additional backlog from our established customers.
Regarding other regions around the world, we are keeping a close eye on the developments in Mexico and the anticipated round 2.1 tender in June. We believe that Latin America will play an increasingly important role in jack-up demand in 2018 and beyond. Southeast Asia has been a hotbed for tender activity with contract awards are dominated by rigs in the region with low rates and short-term programs. We are hopeful for improving fundamentals in that market next year.
We continue to see West Africa as an opportunity for the longer-term projects for high-spec units. However, anticipating commencements typically range between late 2017 and the first half of 2018.
Now, I would like to briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market. Our views are consistent with the overall industry, sentiment that 2018 is projected bottom of the cycle. Though we don't expect to a healthy supply and demand balance to return until later in the decade. This scenario is based on a modest increase of commodity price that can be significantly affected by swings in either direction as projects move into and out of attractive returns for our customers.
The current market utilization for ultra-deepwater units is 73%, fairly flat since our call in February. Despite the great clouds surrounding the broader floater market, the silver lining for Rowan continues to be the quality of our ultra-deepwater assets. Operators prefer the high-spec technical capabilities of these units, but competition will be fierce for upcoming tenders.
We are confident that 7th generation drillships will be the first to secure contracts and reside in the first group of Deepwater rigs that will enjoy the more favorable supply balance. Two of our ships are currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico into our warm stack, but being actively marketed worldwide. We see 68 high potential opportunities for drill ships of our caliber with commencement in 2018.
As we emerged from the cycle, we are strategically thinking, creatively tendering and aggressively pursuing opportunities worldwide. Let me assure you that we are focused on securing additional backlog, maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and delivering value to our shareholders.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Steve."

But first, I'd like to say a few words a",1190,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our first quarter 2017 financial results and update you on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. But first, I'd like to say a few words about ARO drilling, our JV with Saudi Aramco as we look forward to its commencement in the near term.
We provided certain details around the economics and the accounting for the joint venture on our last quarterly conference call, and have also provided additional detail by filing the shareholders agreement with our form 10-K. This included the initial day rates for the first 5 contributed rigs and the agreed value of each of our contributions to the joint venture, which should be helpful for you in your forecasting for Rowan and the new entity. As a reminder, Rowan will receive a modest cash distribution shortly after commencement from the company and Saudi Aramco will contribute additional cash to maintain a 50-50 ownership split as we contribute 3 versus better 2 rigs. We expect to receive a more meaningful cash distribution in the fourth quarter of 2018 as we contribute 2 more rigs at that time.
ARO drilling will bolster our already strong liquidity in the short term, which is very positive in this environment. But we are also extremely pleased with a highly-visible long-term growth of this entity, which should be substantial and unprecedented in our industry.
Now, I'll walk you through our quarterly results. This morning, we reported net income of $10.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter EPS at $0.08, excluding the loss on early retirement of debt.
However, first quarter results include income tax expense of $30 million versus nearly a $10 million benefit in the fourth quarter. While the income tax provisions for the first quarter was higher than our guidance, we still expect our provision to total approximately $50 million for 2017. It is just now more heavily weighted towards the first quarter than previously expected.
When normalized EPS was essentially flat, our adjusted EBITDA increased by $34 million versus the sequential quarter to $177 million. And our EBITDA margin of 47% represents a 6% increase from our 41% fourth quarter margin. The improvement was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and a 6% reduction in both the operating cost and G&A. $29 million of the $34 million increase in EBITDA was driven by higher part of revenues as a result of the Rowan Resolute day rate, reverting back to its original $615,000 rate on January 23. However, it is still noteworthy that we were able to increase EBITDA, albeit modestly, on the rest of our operations.
Our quarterly jack-ups utilization improved by 12 percentage points, although average day rates declined by approximately 20,000. Deepwater utilization remains flat but average day rates increased by almost 130,000 on the aforementioned rate increase on the resolute. Our out-of-service time declined to 6% for the jack-ups, and there was no out-of-service time for the drill ships. Our total operational downtime increased slightly to 2% fleetwide, but was primarily driven by downtime on the Rowan Middletown, One of our lowest rate rigs.
Once again, our Deepwater segment has phenomenal operating performance. For the third consecutive quarter, our drill ships did not incur any on unbillable downtime. And since the beginning of 2016 or over the last nearly 450 days, unbillable downtime for our drill ships has only totaled 17 hours.
Finally, our idle time across the fleet declined to 19% of available days from 29% in the prior quarter, due primarily to increased operating days on the EXL III in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the Gorilla VII in the North Sea.
Moving on to expenses. Operating cost for the first quarter were $166 million net of rebillable items, slightly below our guidance. Operating expenses were approximately $9 million lower than the previous quarter, due in part to cost reductions related to the long stacking of the Renaissance in the fourth quarter and the timing or repair and maintenance expenses in the jack-ups fleet. For the second quarter, we expect operating cost to approximate $165 million, and we are reducing our range on full year guidance to $625 million to $650 million. This guidance excludes certain potential joint venture cost that may be grossed up on our income statement and offset by equal revenue.
First quarter SG&A expenses totaled $24 million, approximately $2 million less than the previous quarter and below our guidance.
Although as most of the reduction was driven by mark-to-market accounting for certain share base and performance awards, which may certainly reversed, we are still maintaining our second quarter guidance of $26 million, with full year SG&A expense expected to range from $95 million to $100 million. Depreciation expense for the first quarter totaled $99 million, and we maintained our full year guidance of $385 million to $395 million. First quarter interest expense was approximately $40 million, and our 2017 estimates of $155 million to $160 million remains unchanged.
As I mentioned in our last quarterly call, in 2017, we will guide to our expected income tax expense as opposed to projecting an estimate rate going forward. While our first quarter income tax expense of $30 million was higher than our $10 million to $15 million guidance, this was driven by timing difference on the expense recognition versus our previous expedition, and much of the expected income tax expense for the year shifted to the first quarter. Our full year 2017 guidance is unchanged at approximately $50 million.
Income tax expense will likely remain volatile at the current levels of income, and each quarter can be impacted significantly, not only by actual results but also by changes in our forecast, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. We continue to expect our cash tax payments for 2017 will remain in the $40 million range, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous years.
Moving onto our cash flow and balance sheet. In the first quarter, our capital expenditures totaled $31 million. We are increasing our full year guidance to $120 million to $130 million, due primarily to the anticipation of capital projects, which prepares certain jack-ups for visible demand in late 2017 and early 2018. Our current cash balance is $1.2 billion, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Overall, we are pleased with our strong financial performance during the first quarter in spite of the challenging market conditions.
Though our results will weaken as we work through some of our higher-priced backlog, we will continue to focus on pace and reliable operations and solid drilling performance so that our backlog will be realized. As Tom and Mark both discussed, after more than 2 years of declining backlog, we are somewhat encouraged as we move into the next phase of the cycle and are beginning to see more opportunities, although at lower pricing, to put certain of our idle rigs back to work.
We are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

So there has been some movement. And normally, movement to get movement, right? And then finally, the outlook is improving, at least from the jack-up side and maybe it's hard to call a broader movement of flow this side. But the outlook on jack-ups side is improving. Now the outlook, as you mentioned, not clear exactly what M&A will do on the jack-ups side. And also, when you say the jack-up market is improving, that is basically a stagnant market or almost stagnant market in 2015 and 2016.

I don't mean it's -- when you think of the oil and cash cost per rig, including CapEx and overhead, a lot of jack-up contracts that are coming right now are not that exciting.

But we do believe, we will see some movement in this -- in 2017, early 2018. Whether or not Rowan will participate, it really be around how much value we think create for our shareholders.

Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Steven will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open up the call for your questions.
In the first quarter 2017, we put finishing touches on 2 transactions that we executed in the fourth quarter: our joint venture with Saudi Aramco and our debt refinancing. The first of these transactions will deliver long-term profitable growth for Rowan, and the second significantly improves our debt maturity profile, even though our earnings continued to be pressured by the current challenging market conditions.
I continue to be pleased by our strong operating performance and focus on cost control as our management team works diligently to drive improvements to our return on invested capital.
As an update from last quarter, we'll continue to make solid progress towards the startup of our joint venture with Saudi Aramco and expect the commencement of operations at the end of the second quarter. We have recently agreed our partner to name the new company ARO Drilling, with ARO spelt A-R-O, which is an abbreviation for Aramco-Rowan Offshore. The successful execution of the new company's business plan should provide ARO Drilling with tremendous earnings growth through the next decade. Naturally, we are excited to get started and look forward to the value ARO Drilling will provide to both partners.
During the first quarter, we followed up on the debt capital markets' transaction that we executed in the fourth quarter by retiring the remainder of our 2017 unsecured notes. These transactions have left us with only $208 million of debt due before 2022, though our $1.5 billion revolver remains untapped.
Stephen will walk you through our financial performance in detail, but in summary, we reported earnings of $0.07 per share in the first quarter, up from a loss of $0.19 per share in the previous quarter. Our first quarter EBITDA was $177 million versus consensus estimate of $158 million, driven mainly by increased Deepwater revenue at the Rowan resolute returns to a higher day rate, following the period where we proactively agreed to reduce the day rate to enable a valued customer to execute key wells in the 2017 drilling program.
In the first quarter, our strong operational performance continued with revenue efficiency of around 98%. This strong uptime performance, coupled with solid expense control, resulted in our cash balance at the end of the quarter of around $1.2 billion. We continue to focus on improving operational performance across our fleet, and we are making good progress in this year. As an example, during the first quarter, all 3 of our rigs operating in Trinidad have dramatically outperformed our customers' drilling plans. While this has resulted in contractual end date that was shorter than expected, all of these rigs have been awarded extension to that to that program.
Since the downturn begin in -- began in the third quarter 2014, floater attrition now stands at 74 rigs. In jack-ups, attrition has quietly accumulated to a total of 34 rigs, with most of those rigs leaving the market in the last year or so. From the population of remaining jack-ups that are over 20 years old, 76 rigs are currently called stack, and we believe most of these will be eventually be recycled or repurposed to nondrilling applications. Another 42 rigs from the same age group have been idle for more than a year, with all but 2 of those jack-ups being over 30 years old. Altogether, since the downturn in the market began, 34 jack-ups have permanently left the markets, and another 118 older rigs look prime for retirement.
While there is still an oversupply, the majority of recently-signed contracts have favored modern assets, and we believe this trend will continue. At Rowan, we've made steady progress in divesting our older assets over the last couple of years and have only 2 cold stack legacy rigs in our fleet. We are in active discussions that will likely lead to these 2 rigs being removed from our fleet over the next quarter or so.
Before handing the call over to Mark, I'd like to share a few thoughts on the market. Last quarter, we shared that we expected limited customer spending this year with a focus on activities with lower capital commitment and short cash cycles, such as unconventional land drilling and shallow-water brownfield projects, with muted spending on large and capital-extensive activities, structures, ultra-deepwater exploration and development. We continue to subscribe to this view. Jack-up tendering continues to improve, and based on conversations with operators, we believe demand for jack-up is likely growing higher as the year progresses. While we're cautious to call the bottom in jack-up demands, the number of rigs working has increased since October of last year, although at a gradual pace. Given continued tendering activity, we are optimistic that demand in the jack-up market will earn higher this year than when it started, so long as the commodity price stays supported.
The majority of incremental deepwater demand has pushed into 2018 and 2019, which is likely the same time frame that Mexico and Brazil will then reemerge as stronger regions. Our expectation is that any new awards in the next several quarters will struggle to keep up with the cadence of rigs rolling off contract. However, the floating market appears to be starting to work its way towards bottom. In particular, we are closely monitoring the supply of 7th generation rigs that arrived at currently available or scheduled to roll off contract before the end of 2018 as that has a more direct effect on our contracting prospects.
Winners in this business invest through the cycles, and we believe that first signs of market recovery will drive more players to action. With our healthy cash position and liquidity runway, we are well positioned to act on attractive opportunities and continue to review the distressed assets and other opportunities. Of course, I can't comment more specifically at this time, but I do believe there are good opportunities available that will enhance shareholder return.
Now for the look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

We continue to be encouraged by strong tendering activity but remain mindful of the long road to recovery that lies ahead of our industry. At this point in the cycle, we are strategically approaching opportunities around the world to best position our company as initial signs of the market improvement begin to take shape. This morning, I will provide an update on our recent contract announcements and discuss our views on the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets before turning the call over to Stephen.
Our latest fleet status report disclose the extension of work of the Rowan Reliance with Cobalt. Operations continue on North Platte 4, and we anticipate completion of that program in late May, early June of this year. As a reminder, the day rate changed to $262,000 per day on April 1 to supplement the $96 million payment that was made for their right to early terminate the contract. We're in ongoing discussions with Cobalt on the possibility of drilling the North Platte 5 program, though, we anticipated gap between the wells.
In the North sea, we signed a 90-day extension with Lundin, providing a continuation of work for the Rowan Viking through February 2018. 
In the Middle East, the government road contract has been extended with Saudi Aramco to align with the commencement of ARO Drilling. And the EXL III will work for an additional 3 months for Arena Energy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico through September 2017.
Turning to an overview of the jack-up market. Worldwide market at utilization is currently at 70%, up from 68% on our last call. As we analyze the approximately 80 jack-up fixtures that have been announced in 2017, 73% of those units are younger than 20 years of age. This supports our thesis that as the market troughs and jack-ups return to work, operators will prefer newer, more capable rigs, leaving many older jack-ups with limited future value to their owners. As Tom mentioned, our strategy remains to divest our legacy jack-ups and focus on marketing our high-spec equipment.
The Middle East continues to be the most active region for anticipated jack-up demand in the next 12 to 18 months. Not only are we looking forward to the commencement of ARO Drilling, but we're optimistic about the potential opportunities for incremental demand in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Kuwait. The EXL I and the EXL IV, which are currently idle in the region, are being actively tendered on multiple projects in the Middle East and around the world.
Though the North Sea remains oversupplied, we are having constructive conversations with our customers regarding programs in the second half of the year and early next year for our in-class and Super Gorilla class units. Rowan Norway and the Rowan Stavanger are best positioned to work in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors in the North Sea, while the Gorilla class jack-ups have more flexibility to take advantages of suitable projects that may arise outside of the region. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad, we see potential for all 5 of our jack-ups to remain fully utilized through 2017. Our longtime presence and excellent operating performance support earning additional backlog from our established customers.
Regarding other regions around the world, we are keeping a close eye on the developments in Mexico and the anticipated round 2.1 tender in June. We believe that Latin America will play an increasingly important role in jack-up demand in 2018 and beyond. 
Southeast Asia has been a hotbed for tender activity with contract awards are dominated by rigs in the region with low rates and short-term programs. We are hopeful for improving fundamentals in that market next year.
We continue to see West Africa as an opportunity for the longer-term projects for high-spec units. However, anticipating commencements typically range between late 2017 and the first half of 2018.
Now I would like to briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market. Our views are consistent with the overall industry sentiment that 2018 is projected bottom of the cycle, though, we don't expect to a healthy supply and demand balance to return until later in the decade. This scenario is based on a modest increase and commodity price but can be significantly affected by swings in either direction as projects move into and out of attractive returns for our customers.
The current market utilization for ultra-deepwater units is 73%, fairly flat since our call in February. Despite the gray clouds surrounding the broader floater market, the silver lining for Rowan continues to be the quality of our ultra-deepwater assets. Operators prefer the high-spec technical capabilities of these units, but competition will be fierce for upcoming tenders.
We are confident that 7th generation drillships will be the first to secure contracts and reside in the first group of deepwater rigs that will enjoy the a favorable supply balance. Two of our ships are currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico into our warm stack but being actively marketed worldwide. We see 68 high potential opportunities for drillships of our caliber with commencement in 2018.
As we emerge from the cycle, we are strategically thinking, creatively tendering and aggressively pursuing opportunities worldwide. Let me assure you that we are focused on securing additional backlog, maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and delivering value to our shareholders.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Steve."
300794,426448773,1185830,"Rowan Companies plc, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our first quarter 2017 financial results and update you on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. But first, I would like to say a few w",1186,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, I will review our first quarter 2017 financial results and update you on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. But first, I would like to say a few words about ARO Drilling, our JV with Saudi Aramco, as we look forward to its commencement in the near term.
We provided certain details around the economics and the accounting for the joint venture on our last quarterly conference call and have also provided additional detail by filing the shareholders agreement with our form 10-K. This included the initial day rates for the first 5 contributed rigs and the agreed value of each of our contributions to the joint venture, which should be helpful to you in your forecasting for Rowan and the new entity. As a reminder, Rowan will receive a modest cash distribution shortly after commencement from the company, and Saudi Aramco will contribute additional cash to maintain a 50-50 ownership split as we contribute 3 versus better 2 rigs. We expect to receive a more meaningful cash distribution in the fourth quarter of 2018 as we contribute 2 more rigs at that time.
ARO Drilling will bolster our already strong liquidity in the short term, which is very positive in this environment. But we are also extremely pleased with a highly-visible long-term growth of this entity, which should be substantial and unprecedented in our industry.
Now I'll walk you through our quarterly results. This morning, we reported net income of $10.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter EPS at $0.08, excluding the loss on early retirement of debt.
However, first quarter results include income tax expense of $30 million versus nearly a $10 million benefit in the fourth quarter. While the income tax provisions for the first quarter was higher than our guidance, we still expect our provision to total approximately $50 million for 2017. It is just now more heavily weighted towards the first quarter than previously expected.
While normalized EPS was essentially flat, our adjusted EBITDA increased by $34 million versus the sequential quarter to $177 million, and our EBITDA margin of 47% represents a 6% increase from our 41% fourth quarter margin. The improvement was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and a 6% reduction in both operating cost and G&A. $29 million of the $34 million increase in EBITDA was driven by higher deepwater revenues as a result of the Rowan Resolute day rate, reverting back to its original $615,000 rate on January 23. However, it is still noteworthy that we were able to increase EBITDA, albeit modestly, on the rest of our operations.
Our quarterly jack-up utilization improved by 12 percentage points, although average day rates declined by approximately 20,000. Deepwater utilization remains flat, but average day rates increased by almost 130,000 on the aforementioned rate increase on the Resolute. Our out-of-service time declined to 6% for the jack-ups, and there was no out-of-service time for the drillships. Our total operational downtime increased slightly to 2% fleet-wide but was primarily driven by downtime on the Rowan Middletown, one of our lowest rate rigs.
Once again, our Deepwater segment has phenomenal operating performance. For the third consecutive quarter, our drillships did not incur any on unbillable downtime. And since the beginning of 2016 or over the last nearly 450 days, unbillable downtime for our drillships has only totaled 17 hours.
Finally, our idle time across the fleet declined to 19% of available days from 29% in the prior quarter, due primarily to increased operating days on the EXL III in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the Gorilla VII in the North Sea.
Moving on to expenses. Operating costs for the first quarter were $166 million net of rebillable items, slightly below our guidance. Operating expenses were approximately $9 million lower than the previous quarter, due in part to cost reductions related to the warm stacking of the Renaissance in the fourth quarter and the timing of repair and maintenance expenses in the jack-up fleet. For the second quarter, we expect operating costs to approximate $165 million, and we are reducing our range on full year guidance to $625 million to $650 million. This guidance excludes certain potential joint venture costs that may be grossed up on our income statement and offset by equal revenue.
First quarter SG&A expenses totaled $24 million, approximately $2 million less than the previous quarter and below our guidance. Although as most of the reduction was driven by mark-to-market accounting for certain share-based and performance awards, which may certainly reversed, we are still maintaining our second quarter guidance of $26 million, with full year SG&A expense expected to range from $95 million to $100 million. 
Depreciation expense for the first quarter totaled $99 million, and we maintained our full year guidance of $385 million to $395 million. 
First quarter interest expense was approximately $40 million, and our 2017 estimate of $155 million to $160 million remains unchanged.
As I mentioned in our last quarterly call, in 2017, we will guide to our expected income tax expense as opposed to projecting an estimated rate going forward. While our first quarter income tax expense of $30 million was higher than our $10 million to $15 million guidance, it was driven by timing differences on the expense recognition versus our previous expectation, and much of the expected income tax expense for the year shifted to the first quarter. Our full year 2017 guidance is unchanged at approximately $50 million. Income tax expense will likely remain volatile at the current levels of income, and each quarter can be impacted significantly not only by actual results but also by changes in our forecast, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. We continue to expect our cash tax payments for 2017 will remain in the $40 million range, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous years.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. In the first quarter, our capital expenditures totaled $31 million. We are increasing our full year guidance to $120 million to $130 million, due primarily to the anticipation of capital projects, which prepares certain jack-ups for visible demand in late 2017 and early 2018. Our current cash balance is $1.2 billion, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Overall, we are pleased with our strong financial performance during the first quarter in spite of the challenging market conditions.
Though our results will weaken as we work through some of our higher-priced backlog, we will continue to focus on safe and reliable operations and solid drilling performance so that our backlog will be realized. As Tom and Mark both discussed, after more than 2 years of declining backlog, we are somewhat encouraged as we move into the next phase of the cycle and are beginning to see more opportunities, although at lower pricing, to put certain of our idle rigs back to work.
We are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

We're just really focused on how it looks or going forward under our model, so as far as what the value of buying asset would be and how value creative it is. And so it tends to go as we look at the estimated EBIT model of a particular asset transaction, and we also reflected back that we -- while we think the market is pricing our jack-ups in our enterprise value. And I -- so I do feel, while I feel that asset price and fees have moved up a bit, it's sure that the prices -- as our stock price has gone down over the last several months, it feels like the asset prices have gone down a bit. So the ranges with our asset prices trade in our stock, I mean, depending how much you value the different assets, but it's definitely on the lower side of -- more in line with the board transaction or a little higher than the first board transaction than the second. So I don't know if I could give you any color on how we think about it, but we definitely -- we look at our -- where our assets are trading, and we also look at an NPV on future cash flow."

One is the capital markets or at least the debt markets are constructive or help [indiscernible] now. We see the equity market had been pushed down for the publicly-traded drillers. But the debt markets are open, which is positive towards M&A. We have seen 4 of the asset deals announced, 1 with Shell, 2 with Bohr, and 1 with Northern Drilling. And so we have seen that, so there has been some movement. And normally, it's the movements that get movement, right? And then finally, the outlook is improving, at least, from the jack-up side. And maybe it's hard to call a broader movement at the floaters side, but the outlook on jack-ups side is improving. Now the outlook, as you mentioned, it's not clear exactly what M&A will do on the jack-up side. And also, when we say the jack-up market is improving, that is basically a stagnant market or almost stagnant market in 2015 and 2016. So any level of contracting really, over '15 and '16, would be improving. I don't mean it's -- when you think of the oil and cash cost per rig, including CapEx and overhead, a lot of jack-up contracts that are coming out right now are not that exciting. So I do think with those 3 elements, deals have happened, debt markets have opened in the recovery market, it would lead -- some transactions have happened, it would lead to more transactions. But we do believe we will see some movement in this -- in 2017, early 2018. Whether or not Rowan will participate, it'd really be around how much value we think it creates for our shareholders. And then the thing what we talked about on this, on calls like this, on our earnings calls and we talk about in [indiscernible], first of all, we're certainly not in the trends management team, so it'll be right thing for the shareholders. Secondly is, we don't want to back into too much debt. We believe we have a strong balance sheet in this business, and we're willing take on some more debt. But it has to be -- the cash flows have to support it. And we have to have to buy assets at a reasonable price, at a good price. As I made in my prepared comments, we believe we should invest through the cycles, through the cycle. And so we want to improve our firm, we want to scale down our investment per rig. So now is a good time to do that whether it's through M&A or through individual asset transactions, remains to be seen. But I would say that we work on it real hard, and we spend a lot of time working and -- on -- attack some issues. So yes, I think it's likely than it has been for the last 2 years, I think."

Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Steven will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open up the call for your questions.
In the first quarter 2017, we put finishing touches on 2 transactions that we executed in the fourth quarter: our joint venture with Saudi Aramco and our debt refinancing. The first of these transactions will deliver long-term profitable growth for Rowan, and the second significantly improves our debt maturity profile, even though our earnings continued to be pressured by the current challenging market conditions.
I continue to be pleased by our strong operating performance and focus on cost control as our management team works diligently to drive improvements to our return on invested capital.
As an update from last quarter, we'll continue to make solid progress towards the startup of our joint venture with Saudi Aramco and expect the commencement of operations at the end of the second quarter. We have recently agreed our partner to name the new company ARO Drilling, with ARO spelt A-R-O, which is an abbreviation for Aramco-Rowan Offshore. The successful execution of the new company's business plan should provide ARO Drilling with tremendous earnings growth through the next decade. Naturally, we are excited to get started and look forward to the value ARO Drilling will provide to both partners.
During the first quarter, we followed up on the debt capital markets' transaction that we executed in the fourth quarter by retiring the remainder of our 2017 unsecured notes. These transactions have left us with only $208 million of debt due before 2022, though our $1.5 billion revolver remains untapped.
Stephen will walk you through our financial performance in detail, but in summary, we reported earnings of $0.07 per share in the first quarter, up from a loss of $0.19 per share in the previous quarter. Our first quarter EBITDA was $177 million versus consensus estimate of $158 million, driven mainly by increased Deepwater revenue as the Rowan Resolute returns to a higher day rate, following the period where we proactively agreed to reduce the day rate to enable a valued customer to execute key wells in the 2017 drilling program.
In the first quarter, our strong operational performance continued with revenue efficiency of around 98%. This strong uptime performance, coupled with solid expense control, resulted in our cash balance at the end of the quarter of around $1.2 billion. We continue to focus on improving operational performance across our fleet, and we are making good progress in this year. As an example, during the first quarter, all 3 of our rigs operating in Trinidad have dramatically outperformed our customers' drilling plans. While this has resulted in contractual end date that was shorter than expected, all of these rigs have been awarded extension to that to their programs.
Since the downturn begin in -- began in the third quarter 2014, floater attrition now stands at 74 rigs. In jack-ups, attrition has quietly accumulated to a total of 34 rigs, with most of those rigs leaving the market in the last year or so. From the population of remaining jack-ups that are over 20 years old, 76 rigs are currently cold stacked, and we believe most of these will be eventually be recycled or repurposed to nondrilling applications. Another 42 rigs from the same age group have been idle for more than a year, with all but 2 of those jack-ups being over 30 years old. Altogether, since the downturn in the market began, 34 jack-ups have permanently left the markets, and another 118 older rigs look prime for retirement.
While there is still an oversupply, the majority of recently-signed contracts have favored modern assets, and we believe this trend will continue. At Rowan, we've made steady progress in divesting our older assets over the last couple of years and have only 2 cold stack legacy rigs in our fleet. We are in active discussions that will likely lead to these 2 rigs being removed from our fleet over the next quarter or so.
Before handing the call over to Mark, I'd like to share a few thoughts on the market. Last quarter, we shared that we expected limited customer spending this year with a focus on activities with lower capital commitment and short cash cycles, such as unconventional land drilling and shallow-water brownfield projects, with muted spending on larger capital-extensive activities, structures, ultra-deepwater exploration and development. We continue to subscribe to this view. Jack-up tendering continues to improve, and based on conversations with operators, we believe demand for jack-up is likely growing higher as the year progresses. While we're cautious to call the bottom in jack-up demands, the number of rigs working has increased since October of last year, although at a gradual pace. Given continued tendering activity, we are optimistic that demand in the jack-up market will earn higher this year than when it started, so long as the commodity price stays supported.
The majority of incremental deepwater demand has pushed into 2018 and 2019, which is likely the same time frame that Mexico and Brazil will then reemerge as stronger regions. Our expectation is that any new awards in the next several quarters will struggle to keep up with the cadence of rigs rolling off contract. However, the floating market appears to be starting to work its way towards bottom. In particular, we are closely monitoring the supply of 7th generation rigs that arrived at currently available or scheduled to roll off contract before the end of 2018 as that has a more direct effect on our contracting prospects.
Winners in this business invest through the cycles, and we believe that first signs of market recovery will drive more players to action. With our healthy cash position and liquidity runway, we are well positioned to act on attractive opportunities and continue to review the distressed assets and other opportunities. Of course, I can't comment more specifically at this time, but I do believe there are good opportunities available that will enhance shareholder return.
Now for the look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

We continue to be encouraged by strong tendering activity but remain mindful of the long road to recovery that lies ahead of our industry. At this point in the cycle, we are strategically approaching opportunities around the world to best position our company as initial signs of the market improvement begin to take shape. This morning, I will provide an update on our recent contract announcements and discuss our views on the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets before turning the call over to Stephen.
Our latest fleet status report disclose the extension of work of the Rowan Reliance with Cobalt. Operations continue on North Platte 4, and we anticipate completion of that program in late May, early June of this year. As a reminder, the day rate changed to $262,000 per day on April 1 to supplement the $96 million payment that was made for their right to early terminate the contract. We're in ongoing discussions with Cobalt on the possibility of drilling the North Platte 5 program, though, we anticipated gap between the wells.
In the North Sea, we signed a 90-day extension with Lundin, providing a continuation of work for the Rowan Viking through February 2018. 
In the Middle East, the government road contract has been extended with Saudi Aramco to align with the commencement of ARO Drilling. And the EXL III will work for an additional 3 months for Arena Energy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico through September 2017.
Turning to an overview of the jack-up market. Worldwide market at utilization is currently at 70%, up from 68% on our last call. As we analyze the approximately 80 jack-up fixtures that have been announced in 2017, 73% of those units are younger than 20 years of age. This supports our thesis that as the market troughs and jack-ups return to work, operators will prefer newer, more capable rigs, leaving many older jack-ups with limited future value to their owners. As Tom mentioned, our strategy remains to divest our legacy jack-ups and focus on marketing our high-spec equipment.
The Middle East continues to be the most active region for anticipated jack-up demand in the next 12 to 18 months. Not only are we looking forward to the commencement of ARO Drilling, but we're optimistic about the potential opportunities for incremental demand in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Kuwait. The EXL I and the EXL IV, which are currently idle in the region, are being actively tendered on multiple projects in the Middle East and around the world.
Though the North Sea remains oversupplied, we are having constructive conversations with our customers regarding programs in the second half of the year and early next year for our in-class and Super Gorilla class units. Rowan Norway and the Rowan Stavanger are best positioned to work in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors in the North Sea, while the Gorilla class jack-ups have more flexibility to take advantages of suitable projects that may arise outside of the region. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad, we see potential for all 5 of our jack-ups to remain fully utilized through 2017. Our longtime presence and excellent operating performance support earning additional backlog from our established customers.
Regarding other regions around the world, we are keeping a close eye on the developments in Mexico and the anticipated round 2.1 tender in June. We believe that Latin America will play an increasingly important role in jack-up demand in 2018 and beyond. 
Southeast Asia has been a hotbed for tender activity with contract awards are dominated by rigs in the region with low rates and short-term programs. We are hopeful for improving fundamentals in that market next year.
We continue to see West Africa as an opportunity for the longer-term projects for high-spec units. However, anticipating commencements typically range between late 2017 and the first half of 2018.
Now I would like to briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market. Our views are consistent with the overall industry sentiment that 2018 is projected bottom of the cycle, though, we don't expect a healthy supply and demand balance to return until later in the decade. This scenario is based on a modest increase and commodity price but can be significantly affected by swings in either direction as projects move into and out of attractive returns for our customers.
The current market utilization for ultra-deepwater units is 73%, fairly flat since our call in February. Despite the gray clouds surrounding the broader floater market, the silver lining for Rowan continues to be the quality of our ultra-deepwater assets. Operators prefer the high-spec technical capabilities of these units, but competition will be fierce for upcoming tenders.
We are confident that 7th generation drillships will be the first to secure contracts and reside in the first group of deepwater rigs that will enjoy the a favorable supply balance. Two of our ships are currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico into our warm stack but being actively marketed worldwide. We see 68 high potential opportunities for drillships of our caliber with commencement in 2018.
As we emerge from the cycle, we are strategically thinking, creatively tendering and aggressively pursuing opportunities worldwide. Let me assure you that we are focused on securing additional backlog, maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and delivering value to our shareholders.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Steve."

Today, I will review our first quarter 2017 financial results and update you on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. But first, I would like to say a few words about ARO Drilling, our JV with Saudi Aramco, as we look forward to its commencement in the near term.
We provided certain details around the economics and the accounting for the joint venture on our last quarterly conference call and have also provided additional detail by filing the shareholders agreement with our form 10-K. This included the initial day rates for the first 5 contributed rigs and the agreed value of each of our contributions to the joint venture, which should be helpful to you in your forecasting for Rowan and the new entity. As a reminder, Rowan will receive a modest cash distribution shortly after commencement from the company, and Saudi Aramco will contribute additional cash to maintain a 50-50 ownership split as we contribute 3 versus better 2 rigs. We expect to receive a more meaningful cash distribution in the fourth quarter of 2018 as we contribute 2 more rigs at that time.
ARO Drilling will bolster our already strong liquidity in the short term, which is very positive in this environment. But we are also extremely pleased with a highly-visible long-term growth of this entity, which should be substantial and unprecedented in our industry.
Now I'll walk you through our quarterly results. This morning, we reported net income of $10.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter EPS at $0.08, excluding the loss on early retirement of debt.
However, first quarter results include income tax expense of $30 million versus nearly a $10 million benefit in the fourth quarter. While the income tax provisions for the first quarter was higher than our guidance, we still expect our provision to total approximately $50 million for 2017. It is just now more heavily weighted towards the first quarter than previously expected.
While normalized EPS was essentially flat, our adjusted EBITDA increased by $34 million versus the sequential quarter to $177 million, and our EBITDA margin of 47% represents a 6% increase from our 41% fourth quarter margin. The improvement was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and a 6% reduction in both operating cost and G&A. $29 million of the $34 million increase in EBITDA was driven by higher deepwater revenues as a result of the Rowan Resolute day rate, reverting back to its original $615,000 rate on January 23. However, it is still noteworthy that we were able to increase EBITDA, albeit modestly, on the rest of our operations.
Our quarterly jack-up utilization improved by 12 percentage points, although average day rates declined by approximately 20,000. Deepwater utilization remains flat, but average day rates increased by almost 130,000 on the aforementioned rate increase on the Resolute. Our out-of-service time declined to 6% for the jack-ups, and there was no out-of-service time for the drillships. Our total operational downtime increased slightly to 2% fleet-wide but was primarily driven by downtime on the Rowan Middletown, one of our lowest rate rigs.
Once again, our Deepwater segment has phenomenal operating performance. For the third consecutive quarter, our drillships did not incur any on unbillable downtime. And since the beginning of 2016 or over the last nearly 450 days, unbillable downtime for our drillships has only totaled 17 hours.
Finally, our idle time across the fleet declined to 19% of available days from 29% in the prior quarter, due primarily to increased operating days on the EXL III in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the Gorilla VII in the North Sea.
Moving on to expenses. Operating costs for the first quarter were $166 million net of rebillable items, slightly below our guidance. Operating expenses were approximately $9 million lower than the previous quarter, due in part to cost reductions related to the warm stacking of the Renaissance in the fourth quarter and the timing of repair and maintenance expenses in the jack-up fleet. For the second quarter, we expect operating costs to approximate $165 million, and we are reducing our range on full year guidance to $625 million to $650 million. This guidance excludes certain potential joint venture costs that may be grossed up on our income statement and offset by equal revenue.
First quarter SG&A expenses totaled $24 million, approximately $2 million less than the previous quarter and below our guidance. Although as most of the reduction was driven by mark-to-market accounting for certain share-based and performance awards, which may certainly reverse, we are still maintaining our second quarter guidance of $26 million, with full year SG&A expense expected to range from $95 million to $100 million. 
Depreciation expense for the first quarter totaled $99 million, and we maintained our full year guidance of $385 million to $395 million. 
First quarter interest expense was approximately $40 million, and our 2017 estimate of $155 million to $160 million remains unchanged.
As I mentioned in our last quarterly call, in 2017, we will guide to our expected income tax expense as opposed to projecting an estimated rate going forward. While our first quarter income tax expense of $30 million was higher than our $10 million to $15 million guidance, it was driven by timing differences on the expense recognition versus our previous expectation, and much of the expected income tax expense for the year shifted to the first quarter. Our full year 2017 guidance is unchanged at approximately $50 million. Income tax expense will likely remain volatile at the current levels of income, and each quarter can be impacted significantly not only by actual results but also by changes in our forecast, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. We continue to expect our cash tax payments for 2017 will remain in the $40 million range, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous years.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. In the first quarter, our capital expenditures totaled $31 million. We are increasing our full year guidance to $120 million to $130 million, due primarily to the anticipation of capital projects, which prepares certain jack-ups for visible demand in late 2017 and early 2018. Our current cash balance is $1.2 billion, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Overall, we are pleased with our strong financial performance during the first quarter in spite of the challenging market conditions.
Though our results will weaken as we work through some of our higher-priced backlog, we will continue to focus on safe and reliable operations and solid drilling performance so that our backlog will be realized. As Tom and Mark both discussed, after more than 2 years of declining backlog, we are somewhat encouraged as we move into the next phase of the cycle and are beginning to see more opportunities, although at lower pricing, to put certain of our idle rigs back to work.
We are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

And so we tend to go as we look at the [indiscernible] model of a particular asset transaction, and we also reflected back that we -- while we think the market is pricing our jack-ups in our enterprise value. And I -- so I do feel, while I feel that asset price and fees have moved up a bit, it's sure that the prices -- as our stock price has gone down over the last several months, it feels like the asset prices have gone down a bit. So the ranges where our asset prices trade in our stock, I mean, depending how much you value the different assets, but it's definitely on the lower side of -- more in line with the board transaction or a little higher in the first board transaction than the second.

Because guys, to the extent they start thinking about market share, obviously, maybe more inclined to scrap some older iron, if you had that. It's a little bit tougher maybe to think about that on the jack-up side, which is so fragmented both versus the floating rigs side. But I guess, maybe this is just more a broader comment of it seems like depending on the earnings seasons, some guys talk a little bit more or less about the role that larger scale M&A can ultimately play. A lot of guys are recently arguing that as you get down to these levels, probably the synergies aren't insignificant going forward because rates are depressed, and obviously, they're much smaller businesses.

One is the capital markets or at least the debt markets are constructive or are open a now. We see the equity market had been pushed down for the publicly-traded drillers. But the debt markets are open, which is positive towards M&A. We have seen 4 of the asset deals announced, 1 with Shell, 2 with Bohr, and 1 with Northern Drilling. And so we have seen that, so there has been some movement. And normally, it's the movements that get movement, right? And then finally, the outlook is improving, at least, from the jack-up side. And maybe it's hard to call a broader movement at the floaters side, but the outlook on jack-ups side is improving. Now the outlook, as you mentioned, it's not clear exactly what M&A will do on the jack-up side. And also, when we say the jack-up market is improving, that is basically a stagnant market or almost stagnant market in 2015 and 2016. So any level of contracting really, over '15 and '16, would be improving. I don't mean it's -- when you think of the oil and cash cost per rig, including CapEx and overhead, a lot of jack-up contracts that are coming out right now are not that exciting. So I do think with those 3 elements, deals have happened, debt markets have opened in the recovery market, it would lead -- some transactions have happened, it would lead to more transactions. But we do believe we will see some movement in this -- in 2017, early 2018. Whether or not Rowan will participate, it'd really be around how much value we think it creates for our shareholders. And then the thing what we talked about on this, on calls like this, on our earnings calls and we talk about in [indiscernible], first of all, we're certainly not in the trends management team, so it'll be right thing for the shareholders. Secondly is, we don't want to back into too much debt. We believe we have a strong balance sheet in this business, and we're willing take on some more debt. But it has to be -- the cash flows have to support it. And we have to have to buy assets at a reasonable price, at a good price. As I made in my prepared comments, we believe we should invest through the cycles, through the cycle. And so we want to improve our firm, we want to scale down our investment per rig. So now is a good time to do that whether it's through M&A or through individual asset transactions, remains to be seen. But I would say that we work on it real hard, and we spend a lot of time working and -- on -- this exact issue. So yes, I think it's likelier than it has been for the last 2 years, I think."

300794,426448773,1189980,"Rowan Companies plc, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore dr",1061,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Steven will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open up the call for your questions.
In the first quarter 2017, we put finishing touches on 2 transactions that we executed in the fourth quarter: our joint venture with Saudi Aramco and our debt refinancing. The first of these transactions will deliver long-term profitable growth for Rowan, and the second significantly improves our debt maturity profile, even though our earnings continued to be pressured by the current challenging market conditions.
I continue to be pleased by our strong operating performance and focus on cost control as our management team works diligently to drive improvements to our return on invested capital.
As an update from last quarter, we'll continue to make solid progress towards the startup of our joint venture with Saudi Aramco and expect the commencement of operations at the end of the second quarter. We have recently agreed our partner to name the new company ARO Drilling, with ARO spelt A-R-O, which is an abbreviation for Aramco-Rowan Offshore. The successful execution of the new company's business plan should provide ARO Drilling with tremendous earnings growth through the next decade. Naturally, we are excited to get started and look forward to the value ARO Drilling will provide to both partners.
During the first quarter, we followed up on the debt capital markets' transaction that we executed in the fourth quarter by retiring the remainder of our 2017 unsecured notes. These transactions have left us with only $208 million of debt due before 2022, though our $1.5 billion revolver remains untapped.
Stephen will walk you through our financial performance in detail, but in summary, we reported earnings of $0.07 per share in the first quarter, up from a loss of $0.19 per share in the previous quarter. Our first quarter EBITDA was $177 million versus consensus estimate of $158 million, driven mainly by increased Deepwater revenue as the Rowan Resolute returns to a higher day rate, following the period where we proactively agreed to reduce the day rate to enable a valued customer to execute key wells in the 2017 drilling program.
In the first quarter, our strong operational performance continued with revenue efficiency of around 98%. This strong uptime performance, coupled with solid expense control, resulted in our cash balance at the end of the quarter of around $1.2 billion. We continue to focus on improving operational performance across our fleet, and we are making good progress in this year. As an example, during the first quarter, all 3 of our rigs operating in Trinidad have dramatically outperformed our customers' drilling plans. While this has resulted in contractual end date that was shorter than expected, all of these rigs have been awarded extension to that to their programs.
Since the downturn begin in -- began in the third quarter 2014, floater attrition now stands at 74 rigs. In jack-ups, attrition has quietly accumulated to a total of 34 rigs, with most of those rigs leaving the market in the last year or so. From the population of remaining jack-ups that are over 20 years old, 76 rigs are currently cold stacked, and we believe most of these will be eventually be recycled or repurposed to nondrilling applications. Another 42 rigs from the same age group have been idle for more than a year, with all but 2 of those jack-ups being over 30 years old. Altogether, since the downturn in the market began, 34 jack-ups have permanently left the markets, and another 118 older rigs look prime for retirement.
While there is still an oversupply, the majority of recently-signed contracts have favored modern assets, and we believe this trend will continue. At Rowan, we've made steady progress in divesting our older assets over the last couple of years and have only 2 cold stack legacy rigs in our fleet. We are in active discussions that will likely lead to these 2 rigs being removed from our fleet over the next quarter or so.
Before handing the call over to Mark, I'd like to share a few thoughts on the market. Last quarter, we shared that we expected limited customer spending this year with a focus on activities with lower capital commitment and short cash cycles, such as unconventional land drilling and shallow-water brownfield projects, with muted spending on larger capital-extensive activities, structures, ultra-deepwater exploration and development. We continue to subscribe to this view. Jack-up tendering continues to improve, and based on conversations with operators, we believe demand for jack-up is likely growing higher as the year progresses. While we're cautious to call the bottom in jack-up demands, the number of rigs working has increased since October of last year, although at a gradual pace. Given continued tendering activity, we are optimistic that demand in the jack-up market will earn higher this year than when it started, so long as the commodity price stays supported.
The majority of incremental deepwater demand has pushed into 2018 and 2019, which is likely the same time frame that Mexico and Brazil will then reemerge as stronger regions. Our expectation is that any new awards in the next several quarters will struggle to keep up with the cadence of rigs rolling off contract. However, the floating market appears to be starting to work its way towards bottom. In particular, we are closely monitoring the supply of 7th generation rigs that arrived at currently available or scheduled to roll off contract before the end of 2018 as that has a more direct effect on our contracting prospects.
Winners in this business invest through the cycles, and we believe that first signs of market recovery will drive more players to action. With our healthy cash position and liquidity runway, we are well positioned to act on attractive opportunities and continue to review the distressed assets and other opportunities. Of course, I can't comment more specifically at this time, but I do believe there are good opportunities available that will enhance shareholder return.
Now for the look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

We continue to be encouraged by strong tendering activity but remain mindful of the long road to recovery that lies ahead of our industry. At this point in the cycle, we are strategically approaching opportunities around the world to best position our company as initial signs of the market improvement begin to take shape. This morning, I will provide an update on our recent contract announcements and discuss our views on the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets before turning the call over to Stephen.
Our latest fleet status report disclose the extension of work of the Rowan Reliance with Cobalt. Operations continue on North Platte 4, and we anticipate completion of that program in late May, early June of this year. As a reminder, the day rate changed to $262,000 per day on April 1 to supplement the $96 million payment that was made for their right to early terminate the contract. We're in ongoing discussions with Cobalt on the possibility of drilling the North Platte 5 program, though, we anticipated gap between the wells.
In the North Sea, we signed a 90-day extension with Lundin, providing a continuation of work for the Rowan Viking through February 2018. 
In the Middle East, the government road contract has been extended with Saudi Aramco to align with the commencement of ARO Drilling. And the EXL III will work for an additional 3 months for Arena Energy in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico through September 2017.
Turning to an overview of the jack-up market. Worldwide market at utilization is currently at 70%, up from 68% on our last call. As we analyze the approximately 80 jack-up fixtures that have been announced in 2017, 73% of those units are younger than 20 years of age. This supports our thesis that as the market troughs and jack-ups return to work, operators will prefer newer, more capable rigs, leaving many older jack-ups with limited future value to their owners. As Tom mentioned, our strategy remains to divest our legacy jack-ups and focus on marketing our high-spec equipment.
The Middle East continues to be the most active region for anticipated jack-up demand in the next 12 to 18 months. Not only are we looking forward to the commencement of ARO Drilling, but we're optimistic about the potential opportunities for incremental demand in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Kuwait. The EXL I and the EXL IV, which are currently idle in the region, are being actively tendered on multiple projects in the Middle East and around the world.
Though the North Sea remains oversupplied, we are having constructive conversations with our customers regarding programs in the second half of the year and early next year for our in-class and Super Gorilla class units. Rowan Norway and the Rowan Stavanger are best positioned to work in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors in the North Sea, while the Gorilla class jack-ups have more flexibility to take advantages of suitable projects that may arise outside of the region. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad, we see potential for all 5 of our jack-ups to remain fully utilized through 2017. Our longtime presence and excellent operating performance support earning additional backlog from our established customers.
Regarding other regions around the world, we are keeping a close eye on the developments in Mexico and the anticipated round 2.1 tender in June. We believe that Latin America will play an increasingly important role in jack-up demand in 2018 and beyond. 
Southeast Asia has been a hotbed for tender activity with contract awards are dominated by rigs in the region with low rates and short-term programs. We are hopeful for improving fundamentals in that market next year.
We continue to see West Africa as an opportunity for the longer-term projects for high-spec units. However, anticipating commencements typically range between late 2017 and the first half of 2018.
Now I would like to briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market. Our views are consistent with the overall industry sentiment that 2018 is projected bottom of the cycle, though, we don't expect a healthy supply and demand balance to return until later in the decade. This scenario is based on a modest increase and commodity price but can be significantly affected by swings in either direction as projects move into and out of attractive returns for our customers.
The current market utilization for ultra-deepwater units is 73%, fairly flat since our call in February. Despite the gray clouds surrounding the broader floater market, the silver lining for Rowan continues to be the quality of our ultra-deepwater assets. Operators prefer the high-spec technical capabilities of these units, but competition will be fierce for upcoming tenders.
We are confident that 7th generation drillships will be the first to secure contracts and reside in the first group of deepwater rigs that will enjoy the a favorable supply balance. Two of our ships are currently contracted in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico into our warm stack but being actively marketed worldwide. We see 68 high potential opportunities for drillships of our caliber with commencement in 2018.
As we emerge from the cycle, we are strategically thinking, creatively tendering and aggressively pursuing opportunities worldwide. Let me assure you that we are focused on securing additional backlog, maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and delivering value to our shareholders.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Steve."
300794,426448773,1189980,"Rowan Companies plc, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 02, 2017",2017-05-02,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our first quarter 2017 financial results and update you on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. But first, I would like to say a few w",1186,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, I will review our first quarter 2017 financial results and update you on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. But first, I would like to say a few words about ARO Drilling, our JV with Saudi Aramco, as we look forward to its commencement in the near term.
We provided certain details around the economics and the accounting for the joint venture on our last quarterly conference call and have also provided additional detail by filing the shareholders agreement with our form 10-K. This included the initial day rates for the first 5 contributed rigs and the agreed value of each of our contributions to the joint venture, which should be helpful to you in your forecasting for Rowan and the new entity. As a reminder, Rowan will receive a modest cash distribution shortly after commencement from the company, and Saudi Aramco will contribute additional cash to maintain a 50-50 ownership split as we contribute 3 versus better 2 rigs. We expect to receive a more meaningful cash distribution in the fourth quarter of 2018 as we contribute 2 more rigs at that time.
ARO Drilling will bolster our already strong liquidity in the short term, which is very positive in this environment. But we are also extremely pleased with a highly-visible long-term growth of this entity, which should be substantial and unprecedented in our industry.
Now I'll walk you through our quarterly results. This morning, we reported net income of $10.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter EPS at $0.08, excluding the loss on early retirement of debt.
However, first quarter results include income tax expense of $30 million versus nearly a $10 million benefit in the fourth quarter. While the income tax provisions for the first quarter was higher than our guidance, we still expect our provision to total approximately $50 million for 2017. It is just now more heavily weighted towards the first quarter than previously expected.
While normalized EPS was essentially flat, our adjusted EBITDA increased by $34 million versus the sequential quarter to $177 million, and our EBITDA margin of 47% represents a 6% increase from our 41% fourth quarter margin. The improvement was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and a 6% reduction in both operating cost and G&A. $29 million of the $34 million increase in EBITDA was driven by higher deepwater revenues as a result of the Rowan Resolute day rate, reverting back to its original $615,000 rate on January 23. However, it is still noteworthy that we were able to increase EBITDA, albeit modestly, on the rest of our operations.
Our quarterly jack-up utilization improved by 12 percentage points, although average day rates declined by approximately 20,000. Deepwater utilization remains flat, but average day rates increased by almost 130,000 on the aforementioned rate increase on the Resolute. Our out-of-service time declined to 6% for the jack-ups, and there was no out-of-service time for the drillships. Our total operational downtime increased slightly to 2% fleet-wide but was primarily driven by downtime on the Rowan Middletown, one of our lowest rate rigs.
Once again, our Deepwater segment has phenomenal operating performance. For the third consecutive quarter, our drillships did not incur any on unbillable downtime. And since the beginning of 2016 or over the last nearly 450 days, unbillable downtime for our drillships has only totaled 17 hours.
Finally, our idle time across the fleet declined to 19% of available days from 29% in the prior quarter, due primarily to increased operating days on the EXL III in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the Gorilla VII in the North Sea.
Moving on to expenses. Operating costs for the first quarter were $166 million net of rebillable items, slightly below our guidance. Operating expenses were approximately $9 million lower than the previous quarter, due in part to cost reductions related to the warm stacking of the Renaissance in the fourth quarter and the timing of repair and maintenance expenses in the jack-up fleet. For the second quarter, we expect operating costs to approximate $165 million, and we are reducing our range on full year guidance to $625 million to $650 million. This guidance excludes certain potential joint venture costs that may be grossed up on our income statement and offset by equal revenue.
First quarter SG&A expenses totaled $24 million, approximately $2 million less than the previous quarter and below our guidance. Although as most of the reduction was driven by mark-to-market accounting for certain share-based and performance awards, which may certainly reverse, we are still maintaining our second quarter guidance of $26 million, with full year SG&A expense expected to range from $95 million to $100 million. 
Depreciation expense for the first quarter totaled $99 million, and we maintained our full year guidance of $385 million to $395 million. 
First quarter interest expense was approximately $40 million, and our 2017 estimate of $155 million to $160 million remains unchanged.
As I mentioned in our last quarterly call, in 2017, we will guide to our expected income tax expense as opposed to projecting an estimated rate going forward. While our first quarter income tax expense of $30 million was higher than our $10 million to $15 million guidance, it was driven by timing differences on the expense recognition versus our previous expectation, and much of the expected income tax expense for the year shifted to the first quarter. Our full year 2017 guidance is unchanged at approximately $50 million. Income tax expense will likely remain volatile at the current levels of income, and each quarter can be impacted significantly not only by actual results but also by changes in our forecast, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. We continue to expect our cash tax payments for 2017 will remain in the $40 million range, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous years.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. In the first quarter, our capital expenditures totaled $31 million. We are increasing our full year guidance to $120 million to $130 million, due primarily to the anticipation of capital projects, which prepares certain jack-ups for visible demand in late 2017 and early 2018. Our current cash balance is $1.2 billion, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Overall, we are pleased with our strong financial performance during the first quarter in spite of the challenging market conditions.
Though our results will weaken as we work through some of our higher-priced backlog, we will continue to focus on safe and reliable operations and solid drilling performance so that our backlog will be realized. As Tom and Mark both discussed, after more than 2 years of declining backlog, we are somewhat encouraged as we move into the next phase of the cycle and are beginning to see more opportunities, although at lower pricing, to put certain of our idle rigs back to work.
We are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

One is the capital markets or at least the debt markets are constructive or are open a now. We see the equity market had been pushed down for the publicly-traded drillers. But the debt markets are open, which is positive towards M&A. We have seen 4 of the asset deals announced, 1 with Shell, 2 with Bohr, and 1 with Northern Drilling. And so we have seen that, so there has been some movement. And normally, it's the movements that get movement, right? And then finally, the outlook is improving, at least, from the jack-up side. And maybe it's hard to call a broader movement at the floaters side, but the outlook on jack-ups side is improving. Now the outlook, as you mentioned, it's not clear exactly what M&A will do on the jack-up side. And also, when we say the jack-up market is improving, that is basically a stagnant market or almost stagnant market in 2015 and 2016. So any level of contracting really, over '15 and '16, would be improving. I don't mean it's -- when you think of the oil and cash cost per rig, including CapEx and overhead, a lot of jack-up contracts that are coming out right now are not that exciting. So I do think with those 3 elements, deals have happened, debt markets have opened in the recovery market, it would lead -- some transactions have happened, it would lead to more transactions. But we do believe we will see some movement in this -- in 2017, early 2018. Whether or not Rowan will participate, it'd really be around how much value we think it creates for our shareholders. And then the thing what we talked about on this, on calls like this, on our earnings calls and we talk about in [indiscernible], first of all, we're certainly not in the trends management team, so it'll be right thing for the shareholders. Secondly is, we don't want to back into too much debt. We believe we have a strong balance sheet in this business, and we're willing take on some more debt. But it has to be -- the cash flows have to support it. And we have to have to buy assets at a reasonable price, at a good price. As I made in my prepared comments, we believe we should invest through the cycles, through the cycle. And so we want to improve our firm, we want to scale down our investment per rig. So now is a good time to do that whether it's through M&A or through individual asset transactions, remains to be seen. But I would say that we work on it real hard, and we spend a lot of time working and -- on -- this exact issue. So yes, I think it's likelier than it has been for the last 2 years, I think."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. 
Following my prepared remarks, we are giving you an update on the offshore drilling market and then Steven will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open up the call for questions. 
In the second quarter, we secured multiple contract commitments for our jack-up fleet, supporting our position that operators are currently more focused on activities with lower capital commitment and short cap cycles. We continue to see opportunities for our ultra-deepwater drillship in late 2017 and in 2018, but we have a close eye commodity prices as we enter budget season and the effect that, that might have on projected commencement date in 2018. 
We look forward to the launch of ARO drilling, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco. We experienced some delays with certain regulatory approvals due to holidays over the summer, but anticipate an operational start date this quarter. We believe this venture with Saudi Aramco differentiates us from our peer group and will provide steady and profitable growth in the coming years. As ARO drillings begin operations, we believe the scope and scale of this excellent business opportunity will become more apparent to our investors. For the last several months, the ARO drilling team with Saudi Aramco and their own support have been running a thorough newbuild design process. We expect to submit the first newbuild order into the new reformed marine [indiscernible] company in 2018. Delivery is expected in 2021 for the first of 20 state-of-the-art [indiscernible] focus motor jack-ups, each with 16 years of firm contract backlog. 
We are excited about this opportunity. 2 offshore drillers have the chance to meet against long-term contracts. Initiating this project at the bottom of the cycle allows us to have a full attention of rig designers and equipment providers. We also believe that we will be able to harness the later analytics method and other new technology in the rig design stage to reduce rig operating cost and deliver what we believe will be the most efficient jack-ups ever built. 
Steven will review our financial performance in detail, but in summary, we reported a net loss of $0.23 per diluted share in the second quarter, down from earnings of $0.07 per diluted share in the previous quarter, [indiscernible] on consensus. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $131 million versus the consensus estimates of $104 million, partly driven by increased deepwater revenue as the Rowan's Reliance remained on contract with Cobalt until the end of June. 
During the quarter, we repurchased a modest amount of debt, further bolstering our solid financial position. Our outstanding operational outline continued in the second quarter. We have less than 1% downtime fleet-wise and exhibited ongoing capital spending and cost control, which results in a cash balance at cost end of slightly below $1.2 billion. 
We continue to examine options to reduce cost company-wide, but safety and operational integrity remains our utmost priority. A solid safety record and reliable operational performance are important to drive repeat business from our customers. 
We recently moved to [indiscernible] drillship next to each other at a key site in South Texas. We believe we can lower our warm stacking cost from these 2 rigs while not sacrificing the ability to return to our customers in a timely manner with no major reactivation costs. I would note that we have a lot of flexibility the way we stack new drillships into the tractable thrusters. 
Before handing the call over to Mark, I would like to share a few thoughts on the markets. We are pleased to see a recent uptick in fixtures throughout the industry supporting the premise of a transition after recovery. Although we are cognizant that the past [indiscernible] rate utilization may be gradual, both increased requirements of asset and a number of jack-ups and floaters is encouraging. While that have been a few outliers in the past quarter, we continue to hear from our customers that high-spec units in both the jack-up and floater markets are the rigs of choice. When we break down the rate utilization numbers, it wasn't a more capable drilling units are reaching high utilization. As well, our missions is to be focused on demands and contract drilling services, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this customer preference and improved utilization. 
And now for more detailed look of the market, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I will discuss our views of the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and provide an update on our recent contract announcements before turning the call over to Stephen. Commodity price and stability in the",913,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our views of the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and provide an update on our recent contract announcements before turning the call over to Stephen. 
Commodity price and stability in the second quarter [indiscernible] the wave of very sentiments in the capital markets for offshore drillers. However, market utilization held firm, but actually in increased slightly across the worldwide fleet. A significant number of fixtures were announced during the quarter and now restrained activity outlook for the remainder of 2017 has not changed. That being said, we're mindful that if commodity prices don't inspire confidence as we move toward the EMP budget season, the drilling projects currently scheduled for 2018, especially in the ultra-deepwater market could slip to the right. 
In the meantime, we continue to aggressively pursue direct negotiation and opportunities worldwide as we are intensely focused on adding backlog to the Rowan fleet. 
Let's take a look at jack-ups. Worldwide market utilization is currently at 70%, relatively flat since our last call. As Tom mentioned, we continue to believe that younger more capable jack-ups will be the rigs that secure available work as demand gradually recovers and industry fixtures thus far in 2017 supports this conviction. 
In the North Sea, we had an active quarter of contract awards. As outlined in our most recent fleet status report, extended its contract on their own from additional 180 days, keeping that rig busy until August of 2018. While Rowan Norway return to work for the combination of program with [indiscernible] Sinopec in the U.K. and the Rowan anticipated to commence operations in Norway or a program in September. 
Additionally, Total committed to [indiscernible] for 2 years award estimated to start in September, October of this year. The Gorilla V has been in contract with Total for 11 years. This is an example of a great customer relationship and Rowan is very proud of earning on a continued business for Total. Though we haven't disclosed new day rates in the region due to the competitive nature of the market, I can tell you that we continue to have positive margins on all of our new contracts. 
In Saudi Arabia, we extended the contract at the end of August and J.P. Bussell started working for Saudi Aramco on July 9, in advance of its contribution to the joint venture. The 4 [ Tarzan ] class jack-up units are now together, providing standardization synergies to efficiently serve Saudi Aramco's drilling needs for years to come. We're currently in discussion on extending the Bob Palmer as its current contract expires at the end of August. As one of the few jack-ups that drills deep wells in the Arabian Gulf, we are hopeful for a contract extension in the near term. Additionally, we believe that it may be an opportunity to secure incremental demand with our largest customer. 
Outside of Saudi Arabia, multiple [indiscernible] are ongoing as the Middle East continues to be the leading driver of jack-up demand worldwide. 
Now turning to Trinidad. Since our last call, EXL II and contracts were both extended with our current customers. All 3 of our jack-ups operating in the [indiscernible] to perform well operationally. And we anticipate adding backlog to our Trinidad fleet in the near-term. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains one of the weakest jack-up fleets in the world and it may be challenging to secure continuous flow for EXL III and the Gorilla IV while we are talking to multiple operators about future opportunities. 
I'd like to mention a few points about some recent upcoming offshore grounds. In Mexico, we're pleased to see the success of shallow water awards in round 2.1 that should be supported of jack-up demand and look forward to round 2.4 in January 2018, where further deepwater areas would be offered. 
Brazil is also anticipating the upcoming 14th round in September. Additionally, the industry is closely watching the proposed changes with Brazilian legislation, which would reduce local content rules retroactively for blocks ordered in the past that have current than anticipated demand. 
Collectively, we are encouraged by the role of Latin America is positioning itself to play in rig demand recovery. Now focusing on ultra-deepwater. Current market utilization for floaters weighted for operating and water depths 7,500 feet or greater is 75%, up slightly since our last call. While we continue to believe that the overall floater demand will continue to be outstripped by contract loan loss until sometime in 2018, demand for top-tier ultra-deepwater units, specifically the [ Oakwood 7th generation ] drillship may see improvements in advance of the total fleet as the relatively small number of available rigs in that class begin to secure contracts. Again, a caveat on this is an incremental contracting of ultra-deepwater drilling rigs will be largely dependent on the commodity price environment during the upcoming 2018 budget season. 
In general, we continue to see multiple opportunities for our drillships with near-term availability. Commencement date range from late 2017 to mid-2018 to [indiscernible] Although we are strongly pursuing all projects, we are quite mindful not to take on excessive exposure to contract drilling risk purely for safe utilization. In preparation for market recovery, albeit gradual, we focus on what we can control, delivering customer satisfaction through safe and efficient operations which should lead to repeat business and adding backlog providing value to our shareholders. 
This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Steve."
300794,529781449,1262841,"Rowan Companies plc, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2017",2017-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our second quarter 2017 financial results and provide you with an update on capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. As Mark mentioned, we are pleased with",1088,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our second quarter 2017 financial results and provide you with an update on capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. As Mark mentioned, we are pleased with the jack-up contract awards in the second quarter. Combining extensions in new contracts, we booked approximately 1,400 rig days and $137 million in backlog for our jack-up fleet. We expect this backlog will add to our gross profit, albeit not at the levels that we would normally hope for. While we continue to experience downward pressure on day rates, we are encouraged by the slight uptick of jack-up utilization across the industry. 
Now I'll walk you through our quarterly results. This morning, we reported a net loss of $28.7 million or $0.23 per diluted share, which includes a $2.4 million gain on early retirement of approximately $36 million of debt. Second quarter revenue was $318 million, excluding [indiscernible] items, a decrease of 14% from the prior quarter, primarily due to the Rowan Renaissance rolling off contract in April as well as slightly lower average day rates into our operating days for our jack-up fleet. While operating costs remain relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, as ramp up cost on rig schedule to go back to work offset cost reductions in other areas, our adjusted EBITDA declined to $131 million from $177 million in the first quarter of 2017, narrowing our EBITDA margin to a still very solid 41% from 47% in the previous quarter. 
Our quarterly jack-up utilization decreased slightly to 72% and average day rates experienced a 4% decline. Our deepwater utilization declined a 56%, but average day rates remained relatively flat. Our average service time increased to 13% for the jack-ups, primarily due to out-of-service-time from rigs in the Middle East and the North Sea. There was no out-of-service-time on our drill ships. 
Our total operational downtime was less than 1% fleet-wide and for the fourth consecutive quarter, our drillships did not incur any unbillable downtime. While we continue to monitor and closely manage out-of-service-time and operational downtime, of course, the more important factor driving financial results today is idle time, where rigs are available to work but were not secured a contracted. Now idle time across our fleet remained relatively flat in the second quarter at 19%. Moving into the third quarter and taking into account scheduled out-of-service-time and our contract backlogs, we expect our overall utilization rates for the fleet to remain in the high 60% range. 
Looking forward, we expect startup of our drill. Under our Transition Services Agreement, Rowan will be reimbursed for back-office and operations support cost provided to the joint venture, which we will recognize as revenue. While third quarter transition services revenue will depend on the timing of start up, going forward, we expect quarterly run rate of approximately $8 million in transition services revenue, declining over the next several years until the joint venture is more self-sufficient. 
Moving on to expenses. Operating costs for the second quarter were $165 million net of rebillable items, right in line with our guidance. Operating expenses were also in line with the previous quarter with an increase in transfer of Rowan Norway and the J.P. Bussell in preparation for new contracts, offset by lower cost on the Gorilla VI, which was back in the U.K. and lower fuel purchases for our idle drillship. 
For the third quarter, we expect operating cost to increase slightly to range from $165 million to $175 million and for the full year to $635 million to $660 million due to an increase in North Sea drilling activity and the modest delay in the expect the startup of ARO drilling to the third quarter from the second quarter. This guidance excludes rebillables as well as certain potential incremental ARO drilling past due cost that we expect to have an equal offset in revenue. 
Second quarter SG&A expenses totaled $22 million, approximately $2 million less than the previous quarter. SG&A expenses were also below our guidance, due partly to our reduced stock price and its impact on certain compensation awards which are marked to market and various other favorable variances which are expected to reverse over the course of the year. Therefore, we're maintaining our full-year guidance for SG&A of $95 million to $100 million. And we anticipate our third quarter SG&A to increase to the mid to high $20 million range. 
Depreciation expense for the quarter totaled $102 million and we expect full-year expense to approximate $400 million at the high-end of our previous range due to the delayed contribution of rigs to ARO Drilling. Second quarter interest expense was approximately $39 million and our 2017 estimate is approximately $155 million. For the foreseeable future, we will continue to guide our expected income tax expense is close to projecting an estimated tax rate. Our full-year guidance is now in the low $40 million range compared to our prior guidance of $50 million, primarily due to favorable settlements of audits of approximately $6 million. 
Income tax expense will likely continue to remain volatile at current levels of income and each quarter can be impacted significantly not only by actual results but also changes in our forecast, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. More importantly, we expect our cash tax payments for 2017 will approximate $35 million, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous years. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. In the second quarter, our capital expenditures totaled $26 million. We are maintaining our full-year guidance of $125 million to $130 million, which includes the anticipation of capital projects that would prepare certain jack-ups for visible demand in late 2017 and early 2018. Our cash balance at quarter end was just under $1.2 billion and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. We extinguished approximately $36 million of debt in the second quarter, which brings our year-to-date total debt retirements to $163 million. We remain highly focused on our balance sheet and liquidity runway in what may prove to be a slow market recovery. We are exploring additional ways to reduce cost and adapt to the lower for longer oil price environment, while maintaining our record of strong billing performance. We recognize the challenges ahead, but we believe that our fleet quality and balance sheet position given to the downturn and benefit from that perspective market recovery.

I do feel like some of those contracts that we saw, they're definitely well contracts where there is an NOC partner. I'm not exactly understanding how that works, but I do think that typically, with a certain NOCs, basically the lowest technically qualified bid wins. So if you're technically qualified, if it needs an early -- sixth generation, if it's fixed generation rig, it is qualified and we bid the lowest. Think you'll get it, basically. Is my understanding. And I also think that some of the rigs in the shipyard, I would say, that what we believe was maintained is customers would like newbuilds, like hot rigs. The like warm rigs and we closely offer that are newbuilds. And again, I think we're not -- unfortunately, we're not in a position where we have to get a newbuild out of the yard. But are you going to newbuild out of the yard, sooner than later rather than pay they are? I don't really know that -- the answer to that. But I do think that it's certainly were not in a position. We don't have rigs and we are but it's not an issue for us. Do I think it changed the dynamics? I believe that in the second-generation category, there was a limited number of that, the rigs rolling off contract and be able to -- we aren't that many of them on a number of them are contractors. And so I feel like probably hasn't changed that either the landscape around those rigs. But if it's -- frankly, if it's a contract, we'll take a sixth generation rig and early fixed generation rate where thousands on 1 BLT perhaps and then a lot more competition whether it's cold stacked or not."

Welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open up the call for questions.
In the second quarter, we secured multiple contract commitments for our jack-up fleet, supporting our position that operators are currently more focused on activities with lower capital commitment and shorter cap cycles. We continue to see opportunities for our ultra-deepwater drillships in late 2017 and in 2018, but we have a close eye commodity prices as we enter budget season and the effect that might have on projected commencement dates in 2018.
We look forward to the launch of ARO Drilling, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco. We experienced some delays with certain regulatory approvals due to holidays over the summer, but anticipate an operational start date this quarter. We believe this venture with Saudi Aramco differentiates us from our peer group and will provide steady and profitable growth in the coming years. As ARO Drilling begins operations, we believe the scope and scale of this excellent business opportunity will become more apparent to our investors. For the last several months, the ARO Drilling team, with Saudi Aramco and Rowan's support, have been running a thorough newbuild design process. We expect to submit the first newbuild order into the newly formed marine yard company in 2018. Delivery is expected in 2021 for the first of 20 state-of-the-art, fit-for-purpose, modern jack-ups, each with 16 years of firm contract backlog.
We are excited about this opportunity. Few offshore drillers have the chance to newbuild against long-term contracts. Initiating this project at the bottom of the cycle allows us to have the full attention of rig designers and the equipment providers. We also believe we'll be able to harness the latest data analytics methods and other new technology in the rig design stage to reduce rig operating cost and deliver what we believe will be the most efficient jack-ups ever built.
Stephen will review our financial performance in detail, but in summary, we reported a net loss of $0.23 per diluted share in the second quarter, down from earnings of $0.07 per diluted share in the previous quarter, beating consensus. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $131 million versus the consensus estimate of $104 million, partly driven by increased deepwater revenue as the Rowan Reliance remained on contract with Cobalt until the end of June.
During the quarter, we repurchased a modest amount of debt, further bolstering our solid financial position. Our outstanding operational uptime continued in the second quarter. We had less than 1% downtime fleet-wide and exhibited ongoing capital spending and cost control, which resulted in a cash balance at quarter end of slightly below $1.2 billion.
We continue to examine options to reduce costs company-wide, while safety and operational integrity remains our utmost priority. A solid safety record and reliable operational performance are important to drive repeat business from our customers.
We recently have moved 2 of our warm stacked drillships next to each other at a key site in South Texas. We believe we can lower our warm stacking cost on these 2 rigs while not sacrificing the ability to return to our customers in a timely manner with no major reactivation costs. I would note that we have a lot of flexibility in where we stack these drillships due to their retractable thrusters.
Before handing the call over to Mark, I would like to share a few thoughts on the market. We are pleased to see a recent uptick in fixtures throughout the industry supporting the premise of a transition from trough to recovery. Although we are cognizant that the path to higher day rates and utilization may be gradual, both increased retirement of assets and the number of working jack-ups and floaters is encouraging. While there have been a few outliers in the past quarter, we continue to hear from our customers that modern, high-spec units in both the jack-up and floater markets are the rigs of choice. When we break down the recent utilization numbers, modern and more capable drilling units are reaching high utilization. As Rowan's mission is to be focused on demand in contract drilling services, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this customer preference and improve utilization.
Now for a more detailed look at the market, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I will discuss our views of the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and provide an update on our recent contract announcements before turning the call over to Stephen.
Commodity price instability in the second quarter brought about a wave of bearish sentiment in the capital markets for offshore drillers. However, marketed utilization held firm and actually increased slightly across the worldwide fleet. A significant number of fixtures were announced during the quarter and our restrained activity outlook for the remainder of 2017 has not changed. That being said, we are mindful that if commodity prices don't inspire confidence as we move through the E&P budget season that drilling projects currently scheduled for 2018, especially in the ultra-deepwater market, could slip to the right. In the meantime, we continue to aggressively pursue direct negotiation and tender opportunities worldwide as we are intensely focused on adding backlog to the Rowan fleet.
Let's take a look at jack-ups. Worldwide market utilization is currently at 70%, relatively flat since our last call. As Tom mentioned, we continue to believe that younger and more capable jack-ups will be the rigs that secure available work as demand gradually recovers and industry fixtures thus far in 2017 support this conviction.
In the North Sea, we had an active quarter of contract awards. As outlined in our most recent fleet status report, Lundin extended its contract on the Rowan Viking for an additional 180 days, keeping that rig busy until August of 2018. The Rowan Norway returned to work for an accommodation program with Repsol Sinopec in the U.K. and the Rowan Stavanger is anticipated to commence operations with Repsol Norge in Norway for a P&A program in September.
Additionally, Total committed to the Gorilla V for 2 years of work estimated to start in September, October of this year. The Gorilla V has been on contract with Total for over 11 years. This is an example of a great customer relationship and Rowan is very proud of earning the continued business from Total. Though we haven't disclosed new day rates in the region due to the competitive nature of the market, I can tell you that we continue to have positive margins on all of our new contracts.
In Saudi Arabia, we extended the Gilbert Rowe contract to the end of August and the J.P. Bussell started -- has started working for Saudi Aramco on July 9, in advance of its contribution to the joint venture. The 4 Tarzan Class jack-up units are now together, providing standardization synergies to efficiently serve Saudi Aramco's drilling needs for years to come. We're currently in discussion on extending the Bob Palmer as its current contract expires at the end of August. As one of the few jack-ups that drills deep gas wells in the Arabian Gulf, we are hopeful for a contract extension in the near term. Additionally, we believe there may be an opportunity to secure incremental demand with our largest customer.
Outside of Saudi Arabia, multiple tender opportunities are ongoing as the Middle East continues to be the leading driver of jack-up demand worldwide.
Now turning to Trinidad. Since our last call, EXL II and the Ralph Coffman contracts were both extended with their current customers. All 3 of our jack-ups operating in the region continue to perform well operationally. And we anticipate adding backlog to our Trinidad fleet in the near term.
The U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains one of the weakest jack-up regions in the world and it may be challenging to secure continuous work for EXL III and the Gorilla IV, but we're talking to multiple operators about future opportunities.
I'd like to mention a few points about some recent upcoming offshore bid rounds. In Mexico, we're pleased to see the success of shallow water awards in Round 2.1 that should be supportive of jack-up demand and look forward to Round 2.4 in January 2018 when further deepwater areas will be offered.
Brazil is also anticipating the upcoming 14th round in September. Additionally, the industry is closely watching the proposed changes with Brazilian legislation which would reduce local content rules retroactively to blocks awarded in the past that have current and anticipated demand.
Collectively, we are encouraged by the role that Latin America is positioning itself to play in rig demand recovery.
Now focusing on ultra-deepwater. Current marketed utilization for floaters rated for operating in water depths 7,500 feet or greater is 75%, up slightly since our last call. While we continue to believe that the overall floater demand will continue to be outstripped by contractual loss until sometime in 2018, the demand for top-tier ultra-deepwater units, specifically well-equipped, seventh-generation drillships may see improvements in advance of the total fleet as the relatively small number of available rigs in that class begin to secure contracts. Again, a caveat on this is that incremental contracting of ultra-deepwater drilling rigs will be largely dependent on the commodity price environment during the upcoming 2018 budget season.
In general, we continue to see multiple opportunities for our drillships with near-term availability. Commencement dates range from late 2017 to mid-2018, though weighted toward the latter. Although we are strongly pursuing all projects, we are quite mindful not to take on excessive exposure to contractual risk purely for the sake of utilization. In preparation for market recovery, albeit gradual, we focus on what we can control, delivering customer satisfaction through safe and efficient operations which should lead to repeat business and added backlog, providing value to our shareholders.
This concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."

I will now review our second quarter 2017 financial results and provide you with an update on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
As Mark mentioned, we are pleased with the jack-up contract awards in the second quarter. Combining extensions and new contracts, we booked approximately 1,400 rig days and $137 million in backlog for our jack-up fleet. We expect this backlog will add to our gross profit, albeit not at the levels that we would normally hope for. While we continue to experience downward pressure on day rates, we are encouraged by the slight uptick in jack-up utilization across the industry.
Now I'll walk you through our quarterly results. This morning, we reported a net loss of $28.7 million or $0.23 per diluted share, which includes a $2.4 million gain on the early retirement of approximately $36 million of debt. Second quarter revenue was $318 million, excluding rebillable items, a decrease of 14% from the prior quarter, primarily due to the Rowan Renaissance rolling off contract in April as well as slightly lower average day rates and fewer operating days for our jack-up fleet. While operating costs remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, as ramp-up cost on rigs scheduled to go back to work offset cost reductions in other areas, our adjusted EBITDA declined to $131 million from $177 million in the first quarter of 2017, narrowing our EBITDA margin to a still very solid 41% from 47% in the previous quarter.
Our quarterly jack-up utilization decreased slightly to 72% and average day rates experienced a 4% decline. Our deepwater utilization declined to 56%, but average day rates remained relatively flat. Our out-of-service time increased to 13% for the jack-ups, primarily due to out-of-service time for rigs in the Middle East and the North Sea. There was no out-of-service time on our drillships.
Our total operational downtime was less than 1% fleet-wide and for the fourth consecutive quarter, our drillships did not incur any unbillable downtime. While we continue to monitor and closely manage out-of-service time and operational downtime, of course, the more important factor driving financial results today is idle time, where rigs are available to work but we have not secured a contract. Now idle time across our fleet remained relatively flat in the second quarter at 19%. Moving into the third quarter and taking into account scheduled out-of-service time and our contract backlog, we expect our overall utilization rate for the fleet to remain in the high 60% range.
Looking forward to the expected startup of ARO Drilling, under our transition services agreement, Rowan will be reimbursed for back office and operations support costs provided to the joint venture, which we will recognize as revenue. While third quarter transition services revenue will depend on the timing of startup, going forward, we expect a quarterly run rate of approximately $8 million in transition services revenue, declining over the next several years until the joint venture is more self-sufficient.
Moving on to expenses. Operating cost for the second quarter were $165 million net of rebillable items, right in line with our guidance. Operating expenses were also in line with the previous quarter, with an increase in cost for the Rowan Norway and the J.P. Bussell in preparation for new contracts, offset by lower cost on the Gorilla VI, which was stacked in the U.K. and lower fuel purchases for our idle drillships.
For the third quarter, we expect operating cost to increase slightly to range from $165 million to $175 million and for the full year to $635 million to $660 million due to an increase in North Sea drilling activity and the modest delay in the expected startup of ARO Drilling to the third quarter from the second quarter. This guidance excludes rebillables as well as certain potential incremental ARO Drilling pass-through cost that we expect to have an equal offset in revenue.
Second quarter SG&A expenses totaled $22 million, approximately $2 million less than the previous quarter. SG&A expenses were also below our guidance, due partly to our reduced stock price and its impact on certain compensation awards which are marked to market and various other favorable variances which are expected to reverse over the course of the year. Therefore, we're maintaining our full year guidance for SG&A of $95 million to $100 million. And we anticipate our third quarter SG&A to increase in the mid to high $20 million range.
Depreciation expense for the quarter totaled $102 million, and we expect full year expense to approximate $400 million, at the high end of our previous range due to the delayed contribution of rigs to ARO Drilling.
Second quarter interest expense was approximately $39 million and our 2017 estimate is approximately $155 million. For the foreseeable future, we will continue to guide to our expected income tax expense as opposed to projecting an estimated tax rate. Our full year guidance is now in the low $40 million range compared to our prior guidance of $50 million, primarily due to favorable settlement of audits of approximately $6 million.
Income tax expense will likely continue to remain volatile at current levels of income and each quarter can be impacted significantly not only by actual results, but also changes in our forecast, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. More importantly, we expect our cash tax payments for 2017 will approximate $35 million, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous years.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. In the second quarter, our capital expenditures totaled $26 million. We are maintaining our full year guidance of $125 million to $130 million, which includes the anticipation of capital projects that would prepare certain jack-ups for visible demand in late 2017 and early 2018.
Our cash balance at quarter end was just under $1.2 billion and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. We extinguished approximately $36 million of debt in the second quarter, which brings our year-to-date total debt retirement to $163 million. We remain highly focused on our balance sheet and liquidity runway in what may prove to be a slow market recovery. We are exploring additional ways to reduce costs and adapt to the lower for longer oil price environment while maintaining our record of strong drilling performance. We recognize the challenges ahead, but we believe that our fleet quality and balance sheet position us well to endure the downturn and benefit from the prospective market recovery.

But we certainly are going to spend an awful lot of time and effort in that maritime shipyard over the next several years. And we believe that Lamprell and HHI are both first class."

Obviously, rates not disclosed, but would seem to be -- it's kind of on an all-in basis cash neutral at best, maybe cash negative. One, do you think those are somewhat unique situations or one-offs?

But I do think -- I was -- certainly, we're not in that position. We don't have rigs in the yard. That's not an issue for us. Do I think it changed the dynamics? I believe that in the seventh-generation category, there's a limited number of them. There are, of course, rigs rolling off contract. But a seventh-gen drillship, 2 BOPs, 1,250 ton, there aren't that many of them and a number of them are contracted. And so I feel like it probably doesn't change the -- with respect to the landscape around those rigs. But frankly, if it's a contract and you take a sixth-generation rig, an early sixth-generation rig, 1,000 ton, 1 BOP perhaps, then there's a lot more competition, whether it's cold stacked or not."

But -- and I would note that while we have beat in a number of quarters on cost, this quarter, we came right in line with guidance. Hopefully, we'll be able to get back and beating again, but this is our expectation today. And then furthermore, I would say that we have guided to a pretty big reduction in operating cost in the fourth quarter. And if you take the midpoint of our annual guidance, that represents a pretty significant reduction in cost in the fourth quarter."

Welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open up the call for questions.
In the second quarter, we secured multiple contract commitments for our jack-up fleet, supporting our position that operators are currently more focused on activities with lower capital commitment and shorter cap cycles. We continue to see opportunities for our ultra-deepwater drillships in late 2017 and in 2018, but we have a close eye on commodity prices as we enter budget season and the effect that might have on projected commencement dates in 2018.
We look forward to the launch of ARO Drilling, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco. We experienced some delays with certain regulatory approvals due to holidays over the summer, but anticipate an operational start date this quarter. We believe this venture with Saudi Aramco differentiates us from our peer group and will provide steady and profitable growth in the coming years. As ARO Drilling begins operations, we believe the scope and scale of this excellent business opportunity will become more apparent to our investors. For the last several months, the ARO Drilling team, with Saudi Aramco and Rowan's support, have been running a thorough newbuild design process. We expect to submit the first newbuild order into the newly formed marine yard company in 2018. Delivery is expected in 2021 for the first of 20 state-of-the-art, fit-for-purpose, modern jack-ups, each with 16 years of firm contract backlog.
We are excited about this opportunity. Few offshore drillers have the chance to newbuild against long-term contracts. Initiating this project at the bottom of the cycle allows us to have the full attention of rig designers and the equipment providers. We also believe we'll be able to harness the latest data analytics methods and other new technology in the rig design stage to reduce rig operating cost and deliver what we believe will be the most efficient jack-ups ever built.
Stephen will review our financial performance in detail, but in summary, we reported a net loss of $0.23 per diluted share in the second quarter, down from earnings of $0.07 per diluted share in the previous quarter, but beating consensus. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $131 million versus the consensus estimates of $104 million, partly driven by increased deepwater revenue as the Rowan Reliance remained on contract with Cobalt until the end of June.
During the quarter, we repurchased a modest amount of debt, further bolstering our solid financial position. Our outstanding operational uptime continued in the second quarter. We had less than 1% downtime fleet-wide and exhibited ongoing capital spending and cost control, which resulted in a cash balance at quarter end of slightly below $1.2 billion.
We continue to examine options to reduce costs company-wide, while safety and operational integrity remains our utmost priority. A solid safety record and reliable operational performance are important to drive repeat business from our customers.
We recently moved 2 of our warm stacked drillships next to each other at a key site in South Texas. We believe we can lower our warm stacking cost on these 2 rigs while not sacrificing the ability to return to our customers in a timely manner with no major reactivation costs. I would note that we have a lot of flexibility in where we stack these drillships due to their retractable thrusters.
Before handing the call over to Mark, I would like to share a few thoughts on the market. We are pleased to see a recent uptick in fixtures throughout the industry supporting the premise of a transition from trough to recovery. Although we are cognizant that the path to higher day rates and utilization may be gradual, both increased retirement of assets and the number of working jack-ups and floaters is encouraging. While there have been a few outliers in the past quarter, we continue to hear from our customers that modern, high-spec units in both the jack-up and floater markets are the rigs of choice. When we break down the recent utilization numbers, modern and more capable drilling units are reaching high utilization. As Rowan's mission is to be focused on demand in contract drilling services, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this customer preference and improve utilization.
Now for a more detailed look at the market, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I will discuss our views of the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and provide an update on our recent contract announcements before turning the call over to Stephen.Commodity price instability in the sec",939,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our views of the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and provide an update on our recent contract announcements before turning the call over to Stephen.
Commodity price instability in the second quarter brought about a wave of bearish sentiment in the capital markets for offshore drillers. However, marketed utilization held firm and actually increased slightly across the worldwide fleet. A significant number of fixtures were announced during the quarter and our restrained activity outlook for the remainder of 2017 has not changed. That being said, we are mindful that if commodity prices don't inspire confidence as we move through the E&P budget season that drilling projects currently scheduled for 2018, especially in the ultra-deepwater market, could slip to the right. In the meantime, we continue to aggressively pursue direct negotiation and tender opportunities worldwide as we are intensely focused on adding backlog to the Rowan fleet.
Let's take a look at jack-ups. Worldwide market utilization is currently at 70%, relatively flat since our last call. As Tom mentioned, we continue to believe that younger and more capable jack-ups will be the rigs that secure available work as demand gradually recovers and industry fixtures thus far in 2017 support this conviction.
In the North Sea, we had an active quarter of contract awards. As outlined in our most recent fleet status report, Lundin extended its contract on the Rowan Viking for an additional 180 days, keeping that rig busy until August of 2018. The Rowan Norway returned to work for an accommodation program with Repsol Sinopec in the U.K. and the Rowan Stavanger is anticipated to commence operations with Repsol Norge in Norway for a P&A program in September.
Additionally, Total committed to the Gorilla V for 2 years of work estimated to start in September, October of this year. The Gorilla V has been on contract with Total for over 11 years. This is an example of a great customer relationship and Rowan is very proud of earning the continued business from Total. Though we haven't disclosed new day rates in the region due to the competitive nature of the market, I can tell you that we continue to have positive margins on all of our new contracts.
In Saudi Arabia, we extended the Gilbert Rowe contract to the end of August and the J.P. Bussell started -- has started working for Saudi Aramco on July 9, in advance of its contribution to the joint venture. The 4 Tarzan Class jack-up units are now together, providing standardization synergies to efficiently serve Saudi Aramco's drilling needs for years to come. We're currently in discussion on extending the Bob Palmer as its current contract expires at the end of August. As one of the few jack-ups that drills deep gas wells in the Arabian Gulf, we are hopeful for a contract extension in the near term. Additionally, we believe there may be an opportunity to secure incremental demand with our largest customer.
Outside of Saudi Arabia, multiple tender opportunities are ongoing as the Middle East continues to be the leading driver of jack-up demand worldwide.
Now turning to Trinidad. Since our last call, the EXL II and the Ralph Coffman contracts were both extended with their current customers. All 3 of our jack-ups operating in the region continue to perform well operationally. And we anticipate adding backlog to our Trinidad fleet in the near term.
The U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains one of the weakest jack-up regions in the world and it may be challenging to secure continuous work for the EXL III and the Gorilla IV, but we're talking to multiple operators about future opportunities.
I'd like to mention a few points about some recent upcoming offshore bid rounds. In Mexico, we're pleased to see the success of shallow water awards in Round 2.1 that should be support with jack-up demand and look forward to Round 2.4 in January 2018 when further [ph]  Deepwater areas will be offered.
Brazil is also anticipating the upcoming 14th round in September. Additionally, the industry is closely watching the proposed changes with Brazilian legislation which would reduce local content rules retroactively to blocks awarded in the past that have current and anticipated demand.
Collectively, we are encouraged by the role that Latin America is positioning itself to play in rig demand recovery.
Now focusing on ultra-deepwater. Current marketed utilization for floaters rated for operating in water depths 7,500 feet or greater is 75%, up slightly since our last call. While we continue to believe that the overall floater demand will continue to be outstripped by contractual loss until sometime in 2018, the demand for top-tier ultra-deepwater units, specifically well-equipped, seventh-generation drillships may see improvements in advance of the total fleet as the relatively small number of available rigs in that class begin to secure contracts. Again, a caveat on this is that incremental contracting of ultra-deepwater drilling rigs will be largely dependent on the commodity price environment during the upcoming 2018 budget season.
In general, we continue to see multiple opportunities for our drillships with near-term availability. Commencement dates range from late 2017 to mid-2018, though weighted toward the latter. Although we are strongly pursuing all projects, we are quite mindful not to take on excessive exposure to contractual risk purely for the sake of utilization. In preparation for market recovery, albeit gradual, we focus on what we can control, delivering customer satisfaction through safe and efficient operations which should lead to repeat business and added backlog, providing value to our shareholders.
This concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."

I will now review our second quarter 2017 financial results and provide you with an update on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
As Mark mentioned, we are pleased with the jack-up contract awards in the second quarter. Combining extensions and new contracts, we booked approximately 1,400 rig days and $137 million in backlog for our jack-up fleet. We expect this backlog will add to our gross profit, albeit not at the levels that we would normally hope for. While we continue to experience downward pressure on day rates, we are encouraged by the slight uptick in jack-up utilization across the industry.
Now I'll walk you through our quarterly results. This morning, we reported a net loss of $28.7 million or $0.23 per diluted share, which includes a $2.4 million gain on the early retirement of approximately $36 million of debt. Second quarter revenue was $318 million, excluding rebillable items, a decrease of 14% from the prior quarter, primarily due to the Rowan Renaissance rolling off contract in April as well as slightly lower average day rates and fewer operating days for our jack-up fleet. While operating costs remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, as ramp-up cost on rigs scheduled to go back to work offset cost reductions in other areas, our adjusted EBITDA declined to $131 million from $177 million in the first quarter of 2017, narrowing our EBITDA margin to a still very solid 41% from 47% in the previous quarter.
Our quarterly jack-up utilization decreased slightly to 72% and average day rates experienced a 4% decline. Our deepwater utilization declined to 56%, but average day rates remained relatively flat. Our out-of-service time increased to 13% for the jack-ups, primarily due to out-of-service time for rigs in the Middle East and the North Sea. There was no out-of-service time on our drillships.
Our total operational downtime was less than 1% fleet-wide and for the fourth consecutive quarter, our drillships did not incur any unbillable downtime. While we continue to monitor and closely manage out-of-service time and operational downtime, of course, the more important factor driving financial results today is idle time, where rigs are available to work but we have not secured a contract. Now idle time across our fleet remained relatively flat in the second quarter at 19%. Moving into the third quarter and taking into account scheduled out-of-service time and our contract backlog, we expect our overall utilization rate for the fleet to remain in the high 60% range.
Looking forward to the expected startup of ARO Drilling, under our transition services agreement, Rowan will be reimbursed for back office and operations support costs provided to the joint venture, which we will recognize as revenue. While third quarter transition services revenue will depend on the timing of startup, going forward, we expect a quarterly run rate of approximately $8 million in transition services revenue, declining over the next several years until the joint venture is more self-sufficient.
Moving on to expenses. Operating cost for the second quarter were $165 million net of rebillable items, right in line with our guidance. Operating expenses were also in line with the previous quarter, with an increase in cost for the Rowan Norway and the J.P. Bussell in preparation for new contracts, offset by lower cost on the Gorilla VI, which was stacked in the U.K. and lower fuel purchases for our idle drillships.
For the third quarter, we expect operating cost to increase slightly to range from $165 million to $175 million and for the full year to $635 million to $660 million due to an increase in North Sea drilling activity and the modest delay in the expected startup of ARO Drilling to the third quarter from the second quarter. This guidance excludes rebillables as well as certain potential incremental ARO Drilling pass-through cost that we expect to have an equal offset in revenue.
Second quarter SG&A expenses totaled $22 million, approximately $2 million less than the previous quarter. SG&A expenses were also below our guidance, due partly to our reduced stock price and its impact on certain compensation awards which are marked to market and various other favorable variances, which are expected to reverse over the course of the year. Therefore, we're maintaining our full year guidance for SG&A of $95 million to $100 million. And we anticipate our third quarter SG&A to increase to the mid to high $20 million range.
Depreciation expense for the quarter totaled $102 million, and we expect full year expense to approximate $400 million, at the high end of our previous range due to the delayed contribution of rigs to ARO Drilling.
Second quarter interest expense was approximately $39 million and our 2017 estimate is approximately $155 million. For the foreseeable future, we will continue to guide to our expected income tax expense as opposed to projecting an estimated tax rate. Our full year guidance is now in the low $40 million range compared to our prior guidance of $50 million, primarily due to favorable settlements of audits of approximately $6 million.
Income tax expense will likely continue to remain volatile at current levels of income and each quarter can be impacted significantly not only by actual results, but also changes in our forecast, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. More importantly, we expect our cash tax payments for 2017 will approximate $35 million, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous years.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. In the second quarter, our capital expenditures totaled $26 million. We are maintaining our full year guidance of $125 million to $130 million, which includes the anticipation of capital projects that would prepare certain jack-ups for visible demand in late 2017 and early 2018.
Our cash balance at quarter end was just under $1.2 billion and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. We extinguished approximately $36 million of debt in the second quarter, which brings our year-to-date total debt retirement to $163 million. We remain highly focused on our balance sheet and liquidity runway in what may prove to be a slow market recovery. We are exploring additional ways to reduce costs and adapt to the lower for longer oil price environment while maintaining our record of strong drilling performance. We recognize the challenges ahead, but we believe that our fleet quality and balance sheet position us well to endure the downturn and benefit from the prospective market recovery.

Just thinking about capital upgrades, we've seen some more moves by some of your peers. Are there any planned upgrades across the fleet? You picked up the 2 jack-ups from Petrobras, just curious if there's anything to highlight there."

We do have our special surveys and our 5-year maintenance and those kind of things which are ongoing and in our CapEx forecast, but we don't have anything major. We might look at -- as other drillers have stated, we might look at adding -- changing our rigs from MPD-ready to full MPD. Our drillships are -- have already a lot of MPD equipment on them, but would need some additional capital to make them -- to buy the rotary control device. And it's probably about $15 million a ship or thereabouts, but we haven't made that decision to do that. And we may determine to do that depending on which contract, et cetera. As far as the Petrobras assets, we've had a chance to do an inspection on them. We understand that rig very well. We are -- don't know exactly what the CapEx upgrade would be, but we're estimating from $10 million to $15 million per rig at this point once -- if and when we basically complete the auction with Petrobras, which is ongoing at this point."

And that just takes time. And I think everybody is willing and fully behind it. It just takes a bit of time to do that. And of course, we had the national holidays at the end of Ramadan during the quarter, which slowed things down a little bit. But I think we've got good momentum. We basically say it's going to be third quarter is our plan. I do recognize I've been saying it's going to start.

And we have a Super Gorilla working in the Arabian Gulf right now. Super Gorillas have worked in Canada, Angola, Gulf of Mexico. So Super Gorillas are more likely to work elsewhere. And they would have a -- they're a big rig with 5 cranes. So that they're more likely -- customers often like to put a bit more crew on them so they can get to use the full capabilities of the enormous sort of deck space, et cetera. So our OpEx on those rigs is often a bit higher than, say, a sort of standard Super 116E or a 240-C, but we can have a -- reduce the crew size on them and not use all the capabilities of the rig, the pick-ups [ph] , the [indiscernible] as well."

  So there were a number of contractors out there, a number of your competitors that were of the view that if you had an asset that was stacked or an undelivered newbuild that had been delayed, that those effectively were out of the competitive supply stack, at least until the hot rigs or the warm rigs went back to work.

But I do think -- I was -- certainly, we're not in that position. We don't have rigs in the yard. That's not an issue for us. Do I think it changed the dynamics? I believe that in the seventh-generation category, there's a limited number of them. There are, of course, rigs rolling off contract. But in the seventh-gen drillship, 2 BOPs, 1,250 ton, there aren't that many of them and a number of them are contracted. And so I feel like it probably doesn't change the -- the landscape around those rigs. But frankly, if it's a contract, you take a sixth-generation rig, an early sixth-generation rig, 1,000 ton, 1 BOP, perhaps, then there's a lot more competition, whether it's cold-stacked or not."

Welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. After that, we will open up the call for questions.
In the second quarter, we secured multiple contract commitments for our jack-up fleet, supporting our position that operators are currently more focused on activities with lower capital commitment and shorter cap cycles. We continue to see opportunities for our ultra-deepwater drillships in late 2017 and in 2018, but we have a close eye on commodity prices as we enter budget season and the effect that might have on projected commencement dates in 2018.
We look forward to the launch of ARO Drilling, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco. We experienced some delays with certain regulatory approvals due to holidays over the summer, but anticipate an operational start date this quarter. We believe this venture with Saudi Aramco differentiates us from our peer group and will provide steady and profitable growth in the coming years. As ARO Drilling begins operations, we believe the scope and scale of this excellent business opportunity will become more apparent to our investors. For the last several months, the ARO Drilling team, with Saudi Aramco and Rowan's support, have been running a thorough newbuild design process. We expect to submit the first newbuild order into the newly formed marine yard company in 2018. Delivery is expected in 2021 for the first of 20 state-of-the-art, fit-for-purpose, modern jack-ups, each with 16 years of firm contract backlog.
We are excited about this opportunity. Few offshore drillers have the chance to newbuild against long-term contracts. Initiating this project at the bottom of the cycle allows us to have the full attention of rig designers and the equipment providers. We also believe we'll be able to harness the latest data analytics methods and other new technology in the rig design stage to reduce rig operating cost and deliver what we believe will be the most efficient jack-ups ever built.
Stephen will review our financial performance in detail, but in summary, we reported a net loss of $0.23 per diluted share in the second quarter, down from earnings of $0.07 per diluted share in the previous quarter, but beating consensus. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $131 million versus the consensus estimates of $104 million, partly driven by increased deepwater revenue as the Rowan Reliance remained on contract with Cobalt until the end of June.
During the quarter, we repurchased a modest amount of debt, further bolstering our solid financial position. Our outstanding operational uptime continued in the second quarter. We had less than 1% downtime fleet-wide and exhibited ongoing capital spending and cost control, which resulted in a cash balance at quarter end of slightly below $1.2 billion.
We continue to examine options to reduce costs company-wide, while safety and operational integrity remains our utmost priority. A solid safety record and reliable operational performance are important to drive repeat business from our customers.
We recently moved 2 of our warm stacked drillships next to each other at a key site in South Texas. We believe we can lower our warm stacking cost on these 2 rigs while not sacrificing the ability to return to our customers in a timely manner with no major reactivation costs. I would note that we have a lot of flexibility in where we stack these drillships due to their retractable thrusters.
Before handing the call over to Mark, I would like to share a few thoughts on the market. We are pleased to see a recent uptick in fixtures throughout the industry supporting the premise of a transition from trough to recovery. Although we are cognizant that the path to higher day rates and utilization may be gradual, both increased retirement of assets and the number of working jack-ups and floaters is encouraging. While there have been a few outliers in the past quarter, we continue to hear from our customers that modern, high-spec units in both the jack-up and floater markets are the rigs of choice. When we break down the recent utilization numbers, modern and more capable drilling units are reaching high utilization. As Rowan's mission is to be focused on demand in contract drilling services, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this customer preference and improve utilization.
Now for a more detailed look at the market, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I will discuss our views of the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and provide an update on our recent contract announcements before turning the call over to Stephen.Commodity price instability in the sec",940,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our views of the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets and provide an update on our recent contract announcements before turning the call over to Stephen.
Commodity price instability in the second quarter brought about a wave of bearish sentiment in the capital markets for offshore drillers. However, marketed utilization held firm and actually increased slightly across the worldwide fleet. A significant number of fixtures were announced during the quarter and our restrained activity outlook for the remainder of 2017 has not changed. That being said, we are mindful that if commodity prices don't inspire confidence as we move through the E&P budget season that drilling projects currently scheduled for 2018, especially in the ultra-deepwater market, could slip to the right. In the meantime, we continue to aggressively pursue direct negotiation and tender opportunities worldwide as we are intensely focused on adding backlog to the Rowan fleet.
Let's take a look at jack-ups. Worldwide market utilization is currently at 70%, relatively flat since our last call. As Tom mentioned, we continue to believe that younger and more capable jack-ups will be the rigs that secure available work as demand gradually recovers and industry fixtures thus far in 2017 support this conviction.
In the North Sea, we had an active quarter of contract awards. As outlined in our most recent fleet status report, Lundin extended its contract on the Rowan Viking for an additional 180 days, keeping that rig busy until August of 2018. The Rowan Norway returned to work for an accommodation program with Repsol Sinopec in the U.K. and the Rowan Stavanger is anticipated to commence operations with Repsol Norge in Norway for a P&A program in September.
Additionally, Total committed to the Gorilla V for 2 years of work estimated to start in September, October of this year. The Gorilla V has been on contract with Total for over 11 years. This is an example of a great customer relationship and Rowan is very proud of earning the continued business from Total. Though we haven't disclosed new day rates in the region due to the competitive nature of the market, I can tell you that we continue to have positive margins on all of our new contracts.
In Saudi Arabia, we extended the Gilbert Rowe contract to the end of August and the J.P. Bussell started -- has started working for Saudi Aramco on July 9, in advance of its contribution to the joint venture. The 4 Tarzan Class jack-up units are now together, providing standardization synergies to efficiently serve Saudi Aramco's drilling needs for years to come. We're currently in discussion on extending the Bob Palmer as its current contract expires at the end of August. As one of the few jack-ups that drills deep gas wells in the Arabian Gulf, we are hopeful for a contract extension in the near term. Additionally, we believe there may be an opportunity to secure incremental demand with our largest customer.
Outside of Saudi Arabia, multiple tender opportunities are ongoing as the Middle East continues to be the leading driver of jack-up demand worldwide.
Now turning to Trinidad. Since our last call, the EXL II and the Ralph Coffman contracts were both extended with their current customers. All 3 of our jack-ups operating in the region continue to perform well operationally. And we anticipate adding backlog to our Trinidad fleet in the near term.
The U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains one of the weakest jack-up regions in the world and it may be challenging to secure continuous work for the EXL III and the Gorilla IV, but we're talking to multiple operators about future opportunities.
I'd like to mention a few points about some recent upcoming offshore bid rounds. In Mexico, we're pleased to see the success of shallow water awards in Round 2.1 that should be support with jack-up demand and look forward to Round 2.4 in January 2018 when [ further ]  Deepwater areas will be offered.
Brazil is also anticipating the upcoming 14th round in September. Additionally, the industry is closely watching the proposed changes with Brazilian legislation which would reduce local content rules retroactively to blocks awarded in the past that have current and anticipated demand.
Collectively, we are encouraged by the role that Latin America is positioning itself to play in rig demand recovery.
Now focusing on ultra-deepwater. Current marketed utilization for floaters rated for operating in water depths 7,500 feet or greater is 75%, up slightly since our last call. While we continue to believe that the overall floater demand will continue to be outstripped by contractual loss until sometime in 2018, the demand for top-tier ultra-deepwater units, specifically well-equipped, seventh-generation drillships may see improvements in advance of the total fleet as the relatively small number of available rigs in that class begin to secure contracts. Again, a caveat on this is that incremental contracting of ultra-deepwater drilling rigs will be largely dependent on the commodity price environment during the upcoming 2018 budget season.
In general, we continue to see multiple opportunities for our drillships with near-term availability. Commencement dates range from late 2017 to mid-2018, though weighted toward the latter. Although we are strongly pursuing all projects, we are quite mindful not to take on excessive exposure to contractual risk purely for the sake of utilization. In preparation for market recovery, albeit gradual, we focus on what we can control, delivering customer satisfaction through safe and efficient operations which should lead to repeat business and added backlog, providing value to our shareholders.
This concludes my remarks. And I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."

I will now review our second quarter 2017 financial results and provide you with an update on our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
As Mark mentioned, we are pleased with the jack-up contract awards in the second quarter. Combining extensions and new contracts, we booked approximately 1,400 rig days and $137 million in backlog for our jack-up fleet. We expect this backlog will add to our gross profit, albeit not at the levels that we would normally hope for. While we continue to experience downward pressure on day rates, we are encouraged by the slight uptick in jack-up utilization across the industry.
Now I'll walk you through our quarterly results. This morning, we reported a net loss of $28.7 million or $0.23 per diluted share, which includes a $2.4 million gain on the early retirement of approximately $36 million of debt. Second quarter revenue was $318 million, excluding rebillable items, a decrease of 14% from the prior quarter, primarily due to the Rowan Renaissance rolling off contract in April as well as slightly lower average day rates and fewer operating days for our jack-up fleet. While operating costs remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, as ramp-up cost on rigs scheduled to go back to work offset cost reductions in other areas, our adjusted EBITDA declined to $131 million from $177 million in the first quarter of 2017, narrowing our EBITDA margin to a still very solid 41% from 47% in the previous quarter.
Our quarterly jack-up utilization decreased slightly to 72% and average day rates experienced a 4% decline. Our deepwater utilization declined to 56%, but average day rates remained relatively flat. Our out-of-service time increased to 13% for the jack-ups, primarily due to out-of-service time for rigs in the Middle East and the North Sea. There was no out-of-service time on our drillships.
Our total operational downtime was less than 1% fleet-wide and for the fourth consecutive quarter, our drillships did not incur any unbillable downtime. While we continue to monitor and closely manage out-of-service time and operational downtime, of course, the more important factor driving financial results today is idle time, where rigs are available to work but we have not secured a contract. Now idle time across our fleet remained relatively flat in the second quarter at 19%. Moving into the third quarter and taking into account scheduled out-of-service time and our contract backlog, we expect our overall utilization rate for the fleet to remain in the high 60% range.
Looking forward to the expected startup of ARO Drilling, under our transition services agreement, Rowan will be reimbursed for back office and operations support costs provided to the joint venture, which we will recognize as revenue. While third quarter transition services revenue will depend on the timing of startup, going forward, we expect a quarterly run rate of approximately $8 million in transition services revenue, declining over the next several years until the joint venture is more self-sufficient.
Moving on to expenses. Operating cost for the second quarter were $165 million net of rebillable items, right in line with our guidance. Operating expenses were also in line with the previous quarter, with an increase in cost for the Rowan Norway and the J.P. Bussell in preparation for new contracts, offset by lower cost on the Gorilla VI, which was stacked in the U.K. and lower fuel purchases for our idle drillships.
For the third quarter, we expect operating cost to increase slightly to range from $165 million to $175 million and for the full year to $635 million to $660 million due to an increase in North Sea drilling activity and the modest delay in the expected startup of ARO Drilling to the third quarter from the second quarter. This guidance excludes rebillables as well as certain potential incremental ARO Drilling pass-through cost that we expect to have an equal offset in revenue.
Second quarter SG&A expenses totaled $22 million, approximately $2 million less than the previous quarter. SG&A expenses were also below our guidance, due partly to our reduced stock price and its impact on certain compensation awards which are marked to market and various other favorable variances, which are expected to reverse over the course of the year. Therefore, we're maintaining our full year guidance for SG&A of $95 million to $100 million. And we anticipate our third quarter SG&A to increase to the mid to high $20 million range.
Depreciation expense for the quarter totaled $102 million, and we expect full year expense to approximate $400 million, at the high end of our previous range due to the delayed contribution of rigs to ARO Drilling.
Second quarter interest expense was approximately $39 million and our 2017 estimate is approximately $155 million. For the foreseeable future, we will continue to guide to our expected income tax expense as opposed to projecting an estimated tax rate. Our full year guidance is now in the low $40 million range compared to our prior guidance of $50 million, primarily due to favorable settlements of audits of approximately $6 million.
Income tax expense will likely continue to remain volatile at current levels of income and each quarter can be impacted significantly not only by actual results, but also changes in our forecast, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. More importantly, we expect our cash tax payments for 2017 will approximate $35 million, excluding the impact of audits or settlements related to previous years.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. In the second quarter, our capital expenditures totaled $26 million. We are maintaining our full year guidance of $125 million to $130 million, which includes the anticipation of capital projects that would prepare certain jack-ups for visible demand in late 2017 and early 2018.
Our cash balance at quarter end was just under $1.2 billion and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. We extinguished approximately $36 million of debt in the second quarter, which brings our year-to-date total debt retirement to $163 million. We remain highly focused on our balance sheet and liquidity runway in what may prove to be a slow market recovery. We are exploring additional ways to reduce costs and adapt to the lower for longer oil price environment while maintaining our record of strong drilling performance. We recognize the challenges ahead, but we believe that our fleet quality and balance sheet position us well to endure the downturn and benefit from the prospective market recovery.
We are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

But those rigs are -- and we bid them in other parts of the world, but they're very good North Sea rigs. I'd tell you, the Gorilla is probably the rig that we'd more likely take other places. And we have a Super Gorilla working in the Arabian Gulf right now. Super Gorillas have worked in Canada, Angola, Gulf of Mexico. So Super Gorillas are more likely to work elsewhere. And they would have a -- they're a big rig with 5 cranes. So that they're more likely -- customers often like to put a bit more crew on them so they can get to use the full capabilities of the enormous sort of deck space, et cetera. So our OpEx on those rigs is often a bit higher than, say, a sort of standard Super 116E or a 240-C, but we can have a -- reduce the crew size on them and not use all the capabilities of the rig, the [ pick-ups ] , the [indiscernible] as well."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. 
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance and then I'll conclude with some thoughts on ARO Drilling before opening the call for questions. 
In the third quarter, we believe Permian crude oil prices continue to help the offshore rig market find the and even make some modest improvements in some categories and regions. Interest from our customers to resume exploration drilling seems to be increasing, however, the majority of the visible demand continues to be for shorter cycle activities and mature basins. While this dynamic is supported on a gradual recovery in jack-up activity, the Deepwater floater market is much more dependent on demand from exploration drilling. Though we've seen a general increase in tendering activity in the floater market over the past quarters, we still believe incremental contract fixtures will struggle to keep pace with the cadence of contracts from rolling off through the end of 2017 and well into 2018. Regardless of the market segment, as contracts that was signed before the downturn come to an end, we have already seen a strong trend for all the rigs to be replaced by modern, more capable rigs. We expect this trends to continue, especially in the floater market were there is a strong technical differentiation in the latest generation of rigs. 
As we approach the end of the year, crude oil prices will play a vital role in E&P budget and project approvals for 2018. Mark will go through more detail about our recent contract awards, utilization trends and our outlook for the Rowan fleet. This quarter end, we announced the launch of ARO Drilling as joint venture with Saudi Aramco. I'd like to thank a moment to thank and congratulate our employees on both the Saudi Aramco to work tirelessly to ensure successful startup to ARO Drilling. It's been almost a year since we announced the signing of this historic partnership with the largest jack-up customer in the world, and we're pleased to see it fully operating. I'll go into more detail about ARO Drilling following Stephen's comments. 
This morning, we reported a net loss of $0.17 per diluted share in the third quarter from a loss of [ 23 ]% per diluted share in the previous quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $99 million versus the consensus estimate of approximately $83 million. We are pleased that J.P. Bussell and Rowan Norway went back to work during the quarter, improving our total jack-up utilization of 78%. Our impressive operational efficiency continues in the third quarter with approximately 99% up-time fleet-wide and exhibited ongoing capital spending discipline and control of cost, which resulted in a cash balance at quarter end of approximately $1.2 billion and a cash balance today of over $1.3 billion. As we consider capital allocation opportunities, we're mindful of maintaining an attracted credit profile and a strong solid balance sheet. We recognize the value in preserving liquidity and when we examine opportunistic investments, we believe the transactions should be strategic, accretive and not [indiscernible] the asset quality of our fleet. 
Now for more detailed look at the market, I'll hand the call over to Mark."
300794,540730486,1328000,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we were pleased with the overall improvement in market cinema as well as the backlog additions for our jack-up fleet, most notably in Trinidad. As announced in our most recent fleet status",911,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we were pleased with the overall improvement in market cinema as well as the backlog additions for our jack-up fleet, most notably in Trinidad. As announced in our most recent fleet status report, we extended our current contracts with BPE on both the Joe Douglas and the EXL II. These commitments had approximately 1-year of work for each unit. Additionally, the Ralph Coffman also secured a contract extension, which will carry the rig through the end of the year. 
Our excellence and operational performance in the region continues to lead to repeat business with valued customers. 
Also this quarter, Shell contracted the Gorilla VI forge program in Trinidad. The jack-up were mobilized from the North Sea for 153-day drilling program that is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2018. There are 4 priced options following the initial program, which, if exercised, would keep the rig busy until early 2019. 
As a reminder, the Gorilla VI continues to receive day rate until early March as part of the termination agreement with ConocoPhillips. The worldwide demand for harsh environment jack-ups is showing signs of health and utilization is hovering around levels that are supportive for improved commercial terms. Although demand in this subsector is improving, I should note that around half of the projects for these more capable units originates from benign environment regions with operators being attracted to the generally higher levels of efficiency that these harsh environment rig provide. The overall jack-up demand appears to have bottomed. The supply-demand balance for benign environment jack-ups continues to be extremely challenging with day rates approximating operating costs in some region. 
With the plentiful supply of modern rigs that will warm our stack, combined with substantial queue of newbuilds, it is difficult to predict when the promotional environment will improve on a global basis. This appreciation for the distinction between harsh and benign environment jack-ups is supportive of Rowan's strategy and mission statement. To be recognized by our customers as a sufficient and capable provider of demand and contract drilling services. 85% of our marketed jack-ups are high-spec with most rigs also being ready for harsh environments. Today and historically, utilization levels are higher for this caliber of rig. 
Now looking at specific jack-up regions of the world. Middle East provides significant potential for increase in demand for 2018 considering outstanding tender requirements across the region. Incremental demand is anticipated from Saudi Aramco, National Drilling Company, Kuwait Oil Company and KJO, among other customers. EXL I and EXL IV currently tendered on multiple projects in the region, and we are hopeful to secure contracts for those units over the coming quarters. 
The Bob Palmer is currently contracted to Saudi Aramco til the end of the year. Discussions are ongoing about the possible extension for this high-spec jack-up to be leased into ARO and continue a successful track record of deep gas drilling. 
The North Sea. 5 of our 6 jack-ups are currently contracted as a role in Norway recently completed a project in the U.K. with Repsol Sinopec. We are looking at multiple opportunities for the Rowan Norway and the Gorilla VI, both in and out of the region for projects starting in 2018. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we secured a new contract with the offshore for the EXL III. But the region remains one of the weakest jack-up regions in the world. The conversations with customers have picked up slightly now that hurricane season is behind us, but continuous work may be a challenge in this market so the EXL III is also being tendered worldwide. 
Now turning to the floater market. I'd like to briefly mention recent news in Latin America before focusing on the ultra-deepwater market. We continue to actively participate in opportunities in Latin America and closely monitor the ongoing bid rounds. Last week, the high interest from and the Brazilian bidding rounds further strengthen our view that this region will have an increase in activity level in the coming years. 
In Mexico, the next round of watch will be in January of 2018, which should have closed to 30 deepwater blocks up for bid. In the broad floater market, we don't expect contracted demand to make a definitive turn til at least late 2018. There's a lack of near-term incremental projects in the face of significant continued contract run-offs in the coming months. Though fixtures are few and far between, recent contract awards support the well-equipped seventh-generation units are performed by customers, and we are actively pursuing approximately 10 to 12 prospects for our drillships. 
Programs range in link from 150 days to 3 years, and commencement dates are expected during the next 12 to 18 months. There are only 18 build stack, 1,250-ton capable units available before the end of 2018, so that niche market could tighten up well in advance of the total fleet. 
As I cautioned on the last call, continued commodity price strength for the remainder of the year will play a key role in a follow-through of plan 2018 and 2019 deepwater activity. Rowan is well positioned in the current stage of the market with high-performing shallow water assets and 4 the most capable ultra-deepwater drillships in the industry today. We are exhibiting operational excellence, acutely focused on adding backlog and strategically prepared for the recovery. 
This concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2017 results today, I'll provide you with updates on our cost and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2017 and provide preliminary guidance for 2018. Following my comments, I'll turn the call back over to Tom. 
As Tom mentioned, we are pleased with the recent launch of ARO Drilling. Shortly following the close of the third quarter, we received an $88 million cash distribution from arrow as part of the formation process, further bolstering our liquidity in this challenging market. Our cash balance is now over $1.3 billion. Together with our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, this liquidity positions us very well to both weather the storm and make opportunistic investments. 
Now for our quarterly results. This morning, we reported a net loss of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share in comparison to a net loss of $29 million or $0.23 per diluted share last quarter. Both quarters included minor impacts from the early extinguishment of debt with the third quarter including a $500,000 loss and the second quarter including a $2.4 million gain. 
The quarter-over-quarter reduction in our net loss per share was driven by an income tax benefit related to a lapse in the statute of limitations. 
Revenue for the third quarter was $289 million, excluding rebillable items, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter due to the declining deepwater revenue. Despite the overall reduction, we were pleased to see a $6 million improvement in jack-up revenue attributed to the start-up of the JC Brussel in the Middle East and the Rowan Norway in the U.K. 
Operating costs remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, so our adjusted EBITDA declined to $99 million from $131 million in the second quarter of 2017, while our EBITDA margins declined to 34%. While this is now well off recent peak levels, I would add that I'm pleased that we've been able to maintain an EBITDA margin 3 years into the cyclical downturn that is equal to our EBITDA margin from the first quarter of 2014. 
Our quarterly jack-up utilization increased to 78%, up 6% from the second quarter level though average day rates decreased slightly. Our third quarter deepwater utilization was 50%, considering the revenue producing days on the Rowan Reliance where we are recognizing deferred revenue related to the Cobalt prepayment and termination in 2016. Notably, our Rowan resolute ultra-deepwater drillship once again did not incur any unbillable downtime during this [ third ] quarter. A [indiscernible] has now accomplished for 5 consecutive quarters.  Our total operational downtime, including both the floaters and jack-up fleet, was only 1%. 
Now turning to expenses. Operating cost for the third quarter were $165 million, net for rebillable item, in line with low end of our guidance and flat with the second quarter level. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect operating costs to decline to $150 million to $160 million. The expected decline is largely due to the launch of ARO Drilling and the associated sale of assets to ARO. As a reminder, this guidance excludes rebillables as well as certain potential ARO Drilling pass-through cost that we expect to have an equal offset in revenue. 
SG&A expenses for the third quarter totaled $25 million, representing a slight increase from $22 million in the second quarter, but they were at the low end of our guidance. As we mentioned in our prior call, second quarter G&A expense benefited from a reduced stock price and its impact on certain compensation awards that are mark-to-market. We anticipate our fourth quarter SG&A expense will remain relatively flat with the third quarter level. 
For the third quarter, depreciation expense totaled $103 million, and we expect full year expense of slightly higher than $400 million, just above our previous guidance due to the delayed sale of rigs to ARO Drilling. Interest expense for the third quarter was $39 million and our 2017 estimate is $156 million. 
Our full year guidance for income tax expense has been reduced to the mid-$20 million range compared to our prior guidance of the low $40 million, primarily due to a tax benefit as a result of the resolution of our prior year tax contingency. Income tax expense will likely continue to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, and tax expense will be impacted not only by levels of pretax income, but also by the timing of contract awards, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. We continue to expect our cash tax payments during 2017 to total in the mid-$30 million range. 
Now let's discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. Capital expenditures totaled $21 million in the third quarter, $5 million below second quarter levels. We are reducing our full year guidance from $120 million to $130 million down to $120 million. We ended the quarter with just [ above ] $1.2 billion in cash before the ARO distribution. 
As previously stated, we retired $7 million of debt in the third quarter, which brings our year-to-date total debt retirement to $170 million. 
Next, I would like to provide full year guidance for 2018, keeping in mind that we are currently on our budget process, and these estimates will be refined on our next quarterly earnings call. As I mentioned last quarter, Rowan will be reimbursed by ARO Drilling for back office and operations support costs, which we will recognize as revenue as part of the transition services arrangement. 
For 2018, we expect transition services revenue to approximate $30 million, but to gradually decline thereafter over the next few years until there are no remaining transition services. Our 2018 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $600 million to $650 million. These estimates could change depending on the schedule of drilling units returning to work. 
SG&A expense for 2018 is estimated to range from $95 million to $105 million, [indiscernible] in mind with the 2017 level. 
Depreciation expense is expected to range from $370 million to $380 million and interest expense is forecast at $155 million in 2018. 
As most of our contributions to ARO were structured as shareholder loans, we also expect to generate approximately $10 million of interest income from ARO Drilling on top of interest income related to our cash balance. 
And finally, we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures will total less than $100 million in 2018. As a reminder, we are accounting for ARO Drilling under the equity method. However, we also intend to provide supplementary financial details in our earnings releases and periodic filings going forward. To assist you with your forecasting of ARO, we have disclosed the day rates on the initial 5 rigs, which ARO will collect as revenue and assume the operating costs forward. We've also disclosed the transition services cost for ARO to be paid to Rowan. 
Lastly, ARO Drilling has assumed the cost of our former Saudi Arabia shorebase. 
Now before opening the call for questions and answers, I'm going to hand the call back to Tom for some brief closing remarks."

The $88 million cash distribution we received in October, together with a second and larger distribution expected in late 2018 after we sell and the wells are examples of the immediate benefits created by this joint venture. 
However, we believe the most significant value creation from the JV is still ahead of us and will become more apparent was the newbuild rigs enter the ARO Drilling fleet. This morning, we published an appendix to our investor presentation outlawing the various components of ARO drilling. We hope this summary will help to clarify the structure and clearly illustrate the long-term value creation that we believe ARO Drilling will provide to Rowan. We believe the visible growth of ARO Drilling is a major differentiator for us in an industry that currently struggles to have much visibility and stability.

So with that said, what Rowan has said were as far as our perspective on M&A that we should definitely -- we look at all transaction as being a strategic accretive and to develop the asset quality of our fleet. That's our time line of how we think about individual asset transactions and how we think about our larger transactions. I would say that the other lines are to focus on that is our desire, a strong desire to improve the return on invested capital and make sure that from a capital allocation perspective, every dollar that we invest in new assets is well spent. So we are certainly focused on that. With respect to your specific question about the harsh environments jack-up market, clearly, the has been our focus for the last several years. We obviously have moved into the ultra-deepwater at the high end, but the Shire transactions that we did that we executed in 2010 was aligned with entering that market. I do think the harsh environment market is, as we think about the whole of the jack-up market, it is a bit of a big market, and the harsh environment market is a small part of it and it's definitely somewhere that Rowan need to be focused historically and something that we would definitely -- it's somewhere where we like. Now the problem is with those assets, there aren't that many compared to the large number of assets that are out there in the jack-up space. But there are some jack-ups harsh environment jack-ups in the Chinese shipyards as well. So there are some opportunities out there, but we continue to view that as an interesting market as we always have the last 5 or 6 years."

We look at everything around the world, but right now, they're some of these 10 to 12 prospects requiring multiple rigs. So we're obviously staying very close to what I was trying to get across from my comment was that we don't really see this market, the ultra-deepwater market, bottoming until sometime in the last part of '18. That's all certainly dependent on oil prices if they continue this upward track and move to a position where there's a 6 in front of that number. That's always going to have a profound effect on the ultra-deepwater markets. So right now, we like the way it's trending. We like the fact that we're in a strong commodity environment during the budget approval process right now. This can have a big impact on capital budgets for '18 and '19. So as you know, a lot of the majors. Theybudget out multiple years, so I think this is good timing. The last 2 years, we've had the reverse situation. So -- but right now, we're following 10 to 12 things that we feel that the rigs are definitely suited for and we're going after them. So our goal is to abstain try to get all 4 and contracted before the end of the year. And if things fall in place, that's certainly something we can do before the end of '18."

That the market is bottoming and the deepwater market is when you see the majors go out for multi-year contracts to try to lock up rigs at lower rates. You're seeing some of that now, but I think you'll continue to see that as we move into '18. But we are tracking 10 to 12 prospects for our ships. I think it's clear in our discussions with operators and have this demand that, that's the preferred ship. With day rates where they are, it just makes a lot of sense whether or not a lower spec ship could do it or not, but difference in cost to the operator.

So now having said that, there has been a lot of assets out there. Some of them are going to go away, we've seen that. And some of them will continue to go away. And our customers do have a strong track record from new rigs. And in our marketing operations, we were talking about opportunities. Like when we are marketing and the customers requiring new rigs and our customers will play anything. And more often than not, the answer is that they acquired that new rigs. Now as far as driving attrition, I don't think that M&A will necessarily drive attrition as far as people -- if people got the rig that's basically don't create value, and we believe there is value in these assets. I don't think M&A necessarily does that. What creates attrition is customers know longer wanting particular assets. Having said that, we have historically, we have some. It's hard to say, but I think it's really about good the [indiscernible] is and is fit in the global fleet or even in a particular drillers fleet.

Get the rig back to work, ramp it up, get everybody fully competent for a very short job and then have to lay everybody off. That is not number of reasons to doing that is because, first of all, it will probably will destroy more value from keeping them stacked. And also, we want to look into a bit more opportunity than that. Having said that, we wouldn't take short-term jobs and we believe a hot rig is more marketable than a one-stack rig, absolutely. And so we evaluated off each opportunity. And frankly, a lot of them is shorter-term jobs that are actually pretty attractive. As long as we figure something on the backend, which frankly today versus 6 months ago, there are more opportunities on the back end. But I think probably other drillers short-term jobs are actually pretty interesting because we feel that the market is going to improve, and therefore, it'd be sort of even better and have some of the best, but we would have some of the best rigs in the world and they would be hot as opposed to one [indiscernible]"

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. 
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. And then I'll conclude with some thoughts on ARO Drilling before opening the call to questions. 
In the third quarter, we believe Permian crude oil prices continue to help the offshore rig market find the bottom and even make some modest improvements in some categories and regions. Interest from our customers to resume exploration drilling seems to be increasing. However, the majority of the visible demand continues to be for shorter cycle activities and mature basins. While this dynamic is supported on a gradual recovery in jack-up activity, the Deepwater floater market is much more dependent on demand from exploration drilling. Though we've seen a general increase in tendering activity in the floater market over the past quarters, we still believe incremental contract fixtures will struggle to keep pace with the cadence of contracts from rolling off through the end of 2017 and well into 2018. Regardless of the market segment, as contracts that was signed before the downturn come to an end, we have already seen a strong trend for all the rigs to be replaced by modern, more capable rigs. We expect this trend to continue, especially in the floater market where there is a strong technical differentiation in the latest generation of rigs. 
As we approach the end of the year, crude oil prices will play a vital role in E&P budget and project approvals for 2018. Mark will go through in more detail about our recent contract awards, utilization trends and our outlook for the Rowan fleet. 
This quarter end, we announced the launch of ARO Drilling as joint venture with Saudi Aramco. I'd like to take a moment to thank and congratulate our employees on both the Saudi Aramco to work tirelessly to ensure successful startup to ARO Drilling. It's been almost a year since we announced the signing of this historic partnership with the largest jack-up customer in the world, and we're pleased to see it fully operating. I'll go into more detail about ARO Drilling following Stephen's comments. 
This morning, we reported a net loss of $0.17 per diluted share in the third quarter from a loss of 23% per diluted share in the previous quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $99 million versus the consensus estimate of approximately $83 million. We are pleased that J.P. Bussell and Rowan Norway went back to work during the quarter, improving our total jack-up utilization of 78%. 
Our impressive operational efficiency continues in the third quarter with approximately 99% up-time fleet-wide and exhibited ongoing capital spending discipline and control of cost, which resulted in a cash balance at quarter end of approximately $1.2 billion and a cash balance today of over $1.3 billion. As we consider capital allocation opportunities, we're mindful of maintaining an attractive credit profile and a strong solid balance sheet. We recognize the value in preserving liquidity. And when we examine opportunistic investments, we believe the transactions should be strategic, accretive and not pollute the asset quality of our fleet. 
Now for a more detailed look at the market, I'll hand the call over to Mark."
300794,540730486,1328289,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we were pleased with the overall improvement in market cinema as well as the backlog additions for our jack-up fleet, most notably in Trinidad. As announced in our most recent fleet status",910,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we were pleased with the overall improvement in market cinema as well as the backlog additions for our jack-up fleet, most notably in Trinidad. As announced in our most recent fleet status report, we extended our current contracts with BP on both the Joe Douglas and the EXL II. These commitments had approximately 1 year of work for each unit. Additionally, the Ralph Coffman also secured a contract extension, which will carry the rig through the end of the year. Our excellence in operational performance in the region continues to lead to repeat business with valued customers. 
Also this quarter, Shell contracted the Gorilla VI forge program in Trinidad. The jack-up were mobilized from the North Sea for 150-day drilling program that is scheduled to commence in the second quarter 2018. There are 4 priced options following the initial program, which, if exercised, would keep the rig busy until early 2019. 
As a reminder, the Gorilla VI continues to receive day rate until early March as part of the termination agreement with ConocoPhillips. The worldwide demand for harsh environment jack-ups is showing signs of health and utilization is hovering around levels that are supportive for improved commercial terms. Although demand in this subsector is improving, I should note that around half of the projects for these more capable units originates from benign environment regions with operators being attracted to the generally higher levels of efficiency that these harsh environment rig provide. The overall jack-up demand appears to have bottomed. The supply-demand balance for benign environment jack-ups continues to be extremely challenging with day rates approximating operating costs in some regions.
With the plentiful supply of modern rigs that will warm our hot stack, combined with substantial queue of newbuilds, it is difficult to predict when the promotional environment will improve on a global basis. This appreciation for the distinction between harsh and benign environment jack-ups is supportive of Rowan's strategy and mission statement: To be recognized by our customers as a sufficient and capable provider of demand and contract drilling services. 85% of our marketed jack-ups are high-spec with most rigs also being ready for harsh environments. Today and historically, utilization levels are higher for this caliber of rig. 
Now looking at specific jack-up regions of the world. Middle East provides significant potential for increase in demand for 2018 considering outstanding tender requirements across the region. Incremental demand is anticipated from Saudi Aramco, National Drilling Company, Kuwait Oil Co. and KJO, among other customers. EXL I and EXL IV currently tendered on multiple projects in the region, and we are hopeful to secure contract for those units over the coming quarters. 
The Bob Palmer is currently contracted to Saudi Aramco until the end of the year. Discussions are ongoing about a possible extension for this high-spec jack-up to be leased into ARO and continue its successful track record of deep gas drilling. 
The North Sea. 5 of our 6 jack-ups are currently contracted as Rowan Norway recently completed a project in the U.K. with Repsol Sinopec. We are looking at multiple opportunities for the Rowan Norway and the Gorilla VII, both in and out of the region for projects starting in 2018. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we secured a new contract with [indiscernible] Offshore for the EXL III. But the region remains one of the weakest jack-up regions in the world. The conversations with customers have picked up slightly now that hurricane season is behind us, but continuous work may be a challenge in this market so the EXL III is also being tendered worldwide. 
Now turning to the floater market. I'd like to briefly mention recent news in Latin America before focusing on the ultra-deepwater market. We continue to actively participate in opportunities in Latin America and closely monitor the ongoing bid rounds. Last week, the high interest from IOCs in the Brazilian bidding rounds further strengthened our view that this region will have an increase in activity level in the coming years. 
In Mexico, the next round of watch will be in January of 2018, which should have closed to 30 deepwater blocks up for bid. 
In the broad floater market, we don't expect contracted demand to make a definitive turn until at least late 2018. There's a lack of near-term incremental projects in the face of significant continued contract roll-offs in the coming months. 
Though fixtures are few and far between, recent contract awards support that well-equipped seventh-generation units are preferred by customers, and we are actively pursuing approximately 10 to 12 prospects for our drillships. 
Programs range in link from 150 days to 3 years, and commencement dates are expected during the next 12 to 18 months. There are only 18 build stack, 1,250-ton capable units available before the end of 2018, so that niche market could tighten up well in advance of the total fleet. 
As I cautioned on the last call, continued commodity price strength for the remainder of the year will play a key role in a follow-through of plan 2018 and 2019 deepwater activity. Rowan is well-positioned in the current stage of the market with high-performing shallow water assets and 4 the most capable ultra-deepwater drillships in the industry today. We are exhibiting operational excellence acutely focused on adding backlog and strategically prepared for the recovery. 
This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,540730486,1328289,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2017 results today, I'll provide you with updates on our cost and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2017 and provide preliminary guidance for 2018. Follow",1178,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2017 results today, I'll provide you with updates on our cost and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2017 and provide preliminary guidance for 2018. Following my comments, I'll turn the call back over to Tom. 
As Tom mentioned, we are pleased with the recent launch of ARO Drilling. Shortly following the close of the third quarter, we received an $88 million cash distribution from ARO as part of the formation process, further bolstering our liquidity in this challenging market. Our cash balance is now over $1.3 billion. Together with our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, this strong liquidity positions us very well to both weather the storm and make opportunistic investments. 
Now for our quarterly results. This morning, we reported a net loss of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share in comparison to a net loss of $29 million or $0.23 per diluted share last quarter. Both quarters included minor impacts from the early extinguishment of debt with the third quarter including a $500,000 loss and the second quarter including a $2.4 million gain. 
The quarter-over-quarter reduction in our net loss per share was driven by an income tax benefit related to a lapse in the statute of limitations. 
Revenue for the third quarter was $289 million, excluding rebillable items, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter due to the declining deepwater revenue. Despite the overall reduction, we were pleased to see a $6 million improvement in jack-up revenue attributed to the start-up of the J.P. Bussell in the Middle East and the Rowan Norway in the U.K. 
Operating costs remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, so our adjusted EBITDA declined to $99 million from $131 million in the second quarter of 2017, while our EBITDA margins declined to 34%. While this is now well off recent peak levels, I would add that I'm pleased that we've been able to maintain an EBITDA margin 3 years into the cyclical downturn that is equal to our EBITDA margin from the first quarter of 2014. 
Our quarterly jack-up utilization increased to 78%, up 6% from the second quarter level, though average day rates decreased slightly. Our third quarter deepwater utilization was 50%, considering the revenue-producing days on the Rowan Reliance, where we are recognizing deferred revenue related to the Cobalt prepayment and termination in 2016. Notably, our Rowan Resolute ultra-deepwater drillship, once again, did not incur any unbillable downtime during this third quarter. A [indiscernible] has now accomplished for 5 consecutive quarters. Our total operational downtime, including both the floater and jack-up fleet, was only 1%. 
Now turning to expenses. Operating costs for the third quarter were $165 million, net of rebillable item, in line with low end of our guidance and flat with the second quarter level. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect operating costs to decline to $150 million to $160 million. The expected decline is largely due to the launch of ARO Drilling and the associated sale of assets to ARO. As a reminder, this guidance excludes rebillables as well as certain potential ARO Drilling pass-through cost that we expect to have an equal offset in revenue. 
SG&A expenses for the third quarter totaled $25 million, representing a slight increase from $22 million in the second quarter, but they were at the low end of our guidance. As we mentioned in our prior call, second quarter G&A expense benefited from a reduced stock price and its impact on certain compensation awards that are mark-to-market. We anticipate our fourth quarter SG&A expense will remain relatively flat with the third quarter level. 
For the third quarter, depreciation expense totaled $103 million, and we expect full year expense of slightly higher than $400 million, just above our previous guidance due to the delayed sale of rigs to ARO Drilling. Interest expense for the third quarter was $39 million, and our 2017 estimate is $156 million. 
Our full year guidance for income tax expense has been reduced to the mid-$20 million range compared to our prior guidance of the low $40 million, primarily due to a tax benefit as a result of the resolution of our prior year tax contingency. Income tax expense will likely continue to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, and tax expense will be impacted not only by levels of pretax income, but also by the timing of contract awards, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. We continue to expect our cash tax payments during 2017 to total in the mid-$30 million range. 
Now let's discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. Capital expenditures totaled $21 million in the third quarter, $5 million below second quarter levels. We are reducing our full year guidance from $120 million to $130 million down to $120 million. We ended the quarter with just above $1.2 billion in cash before the ARO distribution. 
As previously stated, we retired $7 million of debt in the third quarter, which brings our year-to-date total debt retirement to $170 million. 
Next, I would like to provide full year guidance for 2018, keeping in mind that we are currently on our budget process, and these estimates will be refined on our next quarterly earnings call. As I mentioned last quarter, Rowan will be reimbursed by ARO Drilling for back office and operations support costs, which we will recognize as revenue as part of the transition services arrangement. 
For 2018, we expect transition services revenue to approximate $30 million, but to gradually decline thereafter over the next few years until there are no remaining transition services. Our 2018 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $600 million to $650 million. These estimates could change depending on the schedule of drilling units returning to work. 
SG&A expense for 2018 is estimated to range from $95 million to $105 million, fairly in line with the 2017 level. 
Depreciation expense is expected to range from $370 million to $380 million, and interest expense is forecast at $155 million in 2018. 
As most of our contributions to ARO were structured as shareholder loans, we also expect to generate approximately $10 million of interest income from ARO Drilling on top of interest income related to our cash balance. And finally, we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures will total less than $100 million in 2018. 
As a reminder, we are accounting for ARO Drilling under the equity method. However, we also intend to provide supplementary financial details in our earnings releases and periodic filings going forward. To assist you with your forecasting of ARO, we have disclosed the day rates on the initial 5 rigs, which ARO will collect as revenue and assume the operating costs forward. We have also disclosed the transition services cost for ARO to be paid to Rowan. 
Lastly, ARO Drilling has assumed the cost of our former Saudi Arabian shorebase. 
Now before opening the call for questions and answers, I'm going to hand the call back to Tom for some brief closing remarks."

The $88 million cash distribution we received in October, together with the second and larger distribution expected in late 2018 after we sell the Scooter Yeargain and the Hank Boswell, are examples of the immediate benefits created by this joint venture. 
However, we believe the most significant value creation from the JV is still ahead of us and will become more apparent once the newbuild rigs enter the ARO Drilling fleet. This morning, we published an appendix to our investor presentation outlining the various components of ARO drilling. We hope this summary will help to clarify the structure and clearly illustrate the long-term value creation that we believe ARO Drilling will provide to Rowan. We believe the visible growth of ARO Drilling is a major differentiator for us in an industry that currently struggles to have much visibility and stability.

I would say that one underlying sort of focus on that is our desire, our strong desire, to improve the return on invested capital and make sure that, from a capital allocation perspective, every dollar that we invest in new assets is well-spent. So we are certainly focused on them. With respect to your specific question about the harsh environments in the jack-up market, clearly, that has been our thing -- our focus for the last several years. We obviously have moved into the ultra-deepwater at the high end, but the Skeie transaction that we did in -- that we executed in 2010 was aligned with entering that market. I do think the harsh environment market is, as we think about the whole of jack-up market, it is a big market. And the harsh environment market is a small part of it, and it's definitely somewhere that Rowan need to be focused historically and something that we would -- definitely, it's somewhere where we like. Now the problem is with those assets, there aren't that many compared to the large number of assets that are out there in the jack-up space. But there are some jack-ups -- harsh environment jack-ups in the Chinese shipyards as well. So there are some opportunities out there, but we continue to view that as an interesting market, as we always have the last 5 or 6 years."

So as we look at ARO today, based on what you played down on the presentation, it looks like it's just kind of plug-and-play. The cash is just going to build up over time as you fund the newbuilds. Is there any way, just looking at the overall market in Saudi Arabia, where we could see opportunities for ARO to take advantage of where asset prices are today and maybe, I guess, accelerate their share?"

Obviously, we are -- we have some uncontracted assets, but not that many. And we do believe that if there is incremental demand in the Saudi Arabia as long as ARO is competitive on price and it has the right operational performance, we think that we have an opportunity to grow its fleet over the next several years, even before the newbuilds program starts in Saudi Arabia through the maritime JV that is just about up and running or is up and running right now."

Although nobody has a lot of seventh-generation assets. I would say as far as would we be -- do we think that having more ultra-deepwater is ultimately where we should be? Yes. But also, we have 3 out of 4 rigs uncontracted. We are less likely to go out and add to that number of uncontracted assets. And so I think we do agree with the thesis that we need to probably be a bit bigger in ultra-deepwater. But we definitely -- when you've got 3 uncontracted drillships, we need to -- you need to put those to work. And also, we wouldn't want to -- I think -- we think the quality of the fleet is very important. And the feedback we get from our customers is that they see a big distinction between the seventh-generation assets that we have and the earlier in the upcycled sixth-generation assets that a lot of others have. I would say that the financial community doesn't make that distinction. Or a lot in the financial community just think that a drillship built after 2009 is a drillship, but it's certainly not what we hear out of our customers who are more focused on the higher end. And I think you've heard that language out of some of the other drillers as well. I'd say on semis, yes, absolutely. It all comes to the quality of the asset and how market is volatile. I think there's a lot of good semis out there. We're certainly would want to make sure we stay with the assets that our customers are really focused on using and stay away from things that will be cold-stacked and perhaps take quite some time to come back.

What I was trying to get across from my comments was that we don't really see this market, the ultra-deepwater market, bottoming until some time in the last part of '18. They're -- that's all certainly dependent on oil prices. If they continue this upward track and move to a position where there's a 6 in front of that number, that's always going to have a profound effect on the ultra-deepwater market. So right now, we like the way it's trending. We like the fact that we're in a strong commodity environment during the budget approval process right now. That's going to have a big impact on capital budgets for '18 and '19. So as you know, a lot of the majors, they budget out multiple years. So I think this is good timing. The last 2 years, we've had the reverse situation. So -- but right now, we're -- Jud, we're following 10 to 12 things that we feel like our rigs are definitely suited for, and we're going after them.

And we get comfortable with that range because we think it encapsulates most of the reasonable utilization scenarios. Now deepwater utilization will have the largest impact.

And in our marketing operations we've seen, when we're talking about opportunities, they normally are marketing and the customers requiring new rigs, and our customers will [ face ] anything. And more often than not, the answer is that they require new rigs. Now so as far as driving attrition, I don't think that M&A will necessarily drive attrition as far as make it -- people -- if the people got a rig that's basically going to create value and it will lead those value in these assets, I don't think M&A necessarily does that. What creates attrition is customers no longer wanting particular assets. Having said that, we have -- historically, we have some. So it's a little hard to say. But I think it's really about how good the asset is. And does it fit in the global fleets or even in a particular driller's fleet. I know from Rowan's perspective, we've been very careful about when we screen selling rigs to either scrap them or sell them into motor mode. We've done for almost all of us.

But we do consider it in that portfolio. Certainly, the value creative in the first one, we put back to work of the 3 versus the third. We do think about that -- we do believe that will be different. I'd say on short-term jobs, we actually like the idea of short-term jobs, but we always are sort of cognizant of what is on the back of them. Is there an opportunity? So what we don't want to do is ramp up a drillship with all the crews, hire a number of people on the lower levels. We have enough on the senior levels already. Get the rig back to work. Ramp it up. Get everybody fully competent through a very short job and then have to lay everybody off. That is not -- there's a number of reasons not to doing that. It is because, first of all, that's probably -- it will destroy more value from keeping them stacked. And also, we want to -- we're looking for a bit more opportunity than that. Having said that, will we take short-term jobs? And do we believe a hot rig is more marketable than a one-stack rig? Absolutely. And so we evaluated off each opportunity. And frankly, a lot of the shorter-term jobs, they're actually pretty attractive. As long as we think there's something on the back end which, frankly, today versus 6 months ago, there are more opportunities on the back end. So I think for us and for the other drillers, short-term jobs are actually pretty interesting because we feel like the market is going to improve. And therefore, you'd be sort of in an even better -- you'd have some of the best -- you would have some of the best rigs in the world. And they would be hot as opposed to one-stacked."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. 
Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. And then I'll conclude with some thoughts on ARO Drilling before opening the call to questions. 
In the third quarter, we believe Permian crude oil prices continue to help the offshore rig market find the bottom and even make some modest improvements in some categories and regions. Interest from our customers to resume exploration drilling seems to be increasing. However, the majority of the visible demand continues to be for shorter cycle activities and mature basins. While this dynamic is supportive of a gradual recovery in jack-up activity, the Deepwater floater market is much more dependent on demand from exploration drilling. Though we've seen a general increase in tendering activity in the floater market over the past quarters, we still believe incremental contract fixtures will struggle to keep pace with the cadence of contracts rolling off through the end of 2017 and well into 2018. Regardless of the market segment, as contracts that were signed before the downturn come to an end, we have already seen a strong trend for all the rigs to be replaced by modern, more capable rigs. We expect this trend to continue, especially in the floater market where there is strong technical differentiation in the latest generation of rigs. 
As we approach the end of the year, crude oil prices will play a vital role in E&P budget and project approvals for 2018. Mark will go through in more detail about our recent contract awards, utilization trends and our outlook for the Rowan fleet. 
This quarter end, we announced the launch of ARO Drilling as joint venture with Saudi Aramco. I'd like to take a moment to thank and congratulate our employees and those of Saudi Aramco who work tirelessly to ensure a successful startup to ARO Drilling. It's been almost a year since we announced the signing of this historic partnership with the largest jack-up customer in the world, and we're pleased to see it fully operating. I'll go into more detail about ARO Drilling following Stephen's comments. 
This morning, we reported a net loss of $0.17 per diluted share in the third quarter from a loss of $0.23 per diluted share in the previous quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $99 million versus the consensus estimate of approximately $83 million. We are pleased that J.P. Bussell and Rowan Norway went back to work during the quarter, improving our total jack-up utilization to 78%. 
Our impressive operational efficiency continues in the third quarter with approximately 99% up-time fleet-wide and exhibited ongoing capital spending discipline and control of cost, which resulted in a cash balance at quarter end of approximately $1.2 billion and a cash balance today of over $1.3 billion. As we consider capital allocation opportunities, we're mindful of maintaining an attractive credit profile and a strong solid balance sheet. We recognize the value in preserving liquidity. And when we examine opportunistic investments, we believe the transactions should be strategic, accretive and not pollute the asset quality of our fleet. 
Now for a more detailed look at the market, I'll hand the call over to Mark."
300794,540730486,1328675,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we were pleased with the overall improvement in market [ cinema ] as well as the backlog additions to our jack-up fleet, most notably in Trinidad. As announced in our most recent fleet sta",916,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we were pleased with the overall improvement in market [ cinema ] as well as the backlog additions to our jack-up fleet, most notably in Trinidad. As announced in our most recent fleet status report, we extended our current contracts with BP on both the Joe Douglas and the EXL II. These commitments had approximately 1 year of work for each unit. Additionally, the Ralph Coffman also secured a contract extension, which will carry the rig through the end of the year. Our excellence in operational performance in the region continues to lead to repeat business with valued customers. 
Also this quarter, Shell contracted the Gorilla VI for its program in Trinidad. The jack-up were mobilized from the North Sea for 150-day drilling program that is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2018. There are 4 priced options following the initial program which, if exercised, would keep the rig busy until early 2019. 
As a reminder, the Gorilla VI continues to receive day rate until early March as part of the termination agreement with ConocoPhillips. The worldwide demand for harsh environment jack-ups is showing signs of health and utilization is hovering around levels that are supportive for improved commercial terms. Although demand in this subsector is improving, I should note that around half of the projects for these more capable units originates from benign environment regions with operators being attracted to the generally higher levels of efficiency that these harsh environment rigs provide. The overall jack-up demand appears to have bottomed. The supply-demand balance for benign environment jack-ups continues to be extremely challenging with day rates approximating operating costs in some regions.
With the plentiful supply of modern rigs that are warm or hot stack, combined with substantial queue of newbuilds, it is difficult to predict when the promotional environment will improve on a global basis. This appreciation for the distinction between harsh and benign environment jack-ups is supportive of Rowan's strategy and mission statement: To be recognized by our customers as a sufficient and capable provider of demanding contract drilling services. 85% of our marketed jack-ups are high-spec with most rigs also being rated for harsh environments. Today and historically, utilization levels are higher for this caliber of rig. 
Now looking at specific jack-up regions of the world. Middle East provides significant potential for increase in demand for 2018 considering outstanding tender requirements across the region. Incremental demand is anticipated from Saudi Aramco, National Drilling Company, Kuwait Oil Co. and KJO, among other customers. EXL I and EXL IV are currently tendered on multiple projects in the region, and we are hopeful to secure contract for those units over the coming quarters. 
The Bob Palmer is currently contracted to Saudi Aramco until the end of the year. Discussions are ongoing about a possible extension for this high-spec jack-up to be leased into ARO and continue its successful track record of deep gas drilling. 
The North Sea, 5 of our 6 jack-ups are currently contracted as the Rowan Norway recently completed a project in the U.K. with Repsol Sinopec. We are looking at multiple opportunities for the Rowan Norway and the Gorilla VII, both in and out of the region for projects starting in 2018. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we secured a new contract with W&T Offshore for the EXL III. But the region remains one of the weakest jack-up regions in the world. The conversations with customers have picked up slightly now that hurricane season is behind us, but continuous work may be a challenge in this market so the EXL III is also being tendered worldwide. 
Now turning to the floater market. I'd like to briefly mention recent news in Latin America before focusing on the ultra-deepwater market. We continue to actively participate in opportunities in Latin America and closely monitor the ongoing bid rounds. Last week, the high interest from IOCs in the Brazilian bidding rounds further strengthened our view that this region will have an increase in activity level in the coming years. 
In Mexico, the next round to watch will be in January 2018, which should have close to 30 deepwater blocks up for bid. 
In the broad floater market, we don't expect contracted demand to make a definitive turn until at least late 2018. There's a lack of near-term incremental projects in the face of significant continued contract roll-offs in the coming months. 
Though fixtures are few and far between, recent contract awards support that well-equipped seventh-generation units are preferred by customers, and we are actively pursuing approximately 10 to 12 prospects for our drillships. 
Programs range in link from 150 days to 3 years, and commencement dates are expected during the next 12 to 18 months. There are only 18 [ build stack ], 1,250-ton capable units available before the end of 2018, so that niche market could tighten up well in advance of the total fleet. 
As I cautioned on the last call, continued commodity price strength for the remainder of the year will play a key role in the follow-through of planned 2018 and 2019 deepwater activity. Rowan is well-positioned in the current stage of the market with high-performing shallow water assets and 4 the most capable ultra-deepwater drillships in the industry today. We are exhibiting operational excellence acutely focused on adding backlog and strategically prepared for the recovery. 
This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,540730486,1328675,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2017 results today, I'll provide you with updates on our cost and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2017 and provide preliminary guidance for 2018. Follow",1181,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2017 results today, I'll provide you with updates on our cost and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2017 and provide preliminary guidance for 2018. Following my comments, I'll turn the call back over to Tom. 
As Tom mentioned, we are pleased with the recent launch of ARO Drilling. Shortly following the close of the third quarter, we received an $88 million cash distribution from ARO as part of the formation process, further bolstering our liquidity in this challenging market. Our cash balance is now over $1.3 billion. Together with our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, this strong liquidity positions us very well to both weather the storm and make opportunistic investments. 
Now for our quarterly results. This morning, we reported a net loss of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share in comparison to a net loss of $29 million or $0.23 per diluted share last quarter. Both quarters included minor impacts from the early extinguishment of debt with the third quarter including a $500,000 loss and the second quarter including a $2.4 million gain. 
The quarter-over-quarter reduction in our net loss per share was driven by an income tax benefit related to a lapse in the statute of limitations. 
Revenue for the third quarter was $289 million, excluding rebillable items, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter due to the decline in deepwater revenue. Despite the overall reduction, we were pleased to see a $6 million improvement in jack-up revenue attributed to the start-up of the J.P. Bussell in the Middle East and the Rowan Norway in the U.K. 
Operating costs remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, so our adjusted EBITDA declined to $99 million from $131 million in the second quarter of 2017, while our EBITDA margins declined to 34%. While this is now well off recent peak levels, I would add that I'm pleased that we've been able to maintain an EBITDA margin 3 years into the cyclical downturn that is equal to our EBITDA margin from the first quarter of 2014. 
Our quarterly jack-up utilization increased to 78%, up 6% from the second quarter level, though average day rates decreased slightly. Our third quarter deepwater utilization was 50%, considering the revenue-producing days on the Rowan Reliance, where we are recognizing deferred revenue related to the Cobalt prepayment and termination in 2016. Notably, our Rowan Resolute ultra-deepwater drillship once again did not incur any unbillable downtime during this third quarter, a feat it has now accomplished for 5 consecutive quarters. Our total operational downtime, including both the floater and jack-up fleet, was only 1%. 
Now turning to expenses. Operating costs for the third quarter were $165 million, net of rebillable items, in line with the low end of our guidance and flat with the second quarter level. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect operating costs to decline to $150 million to $160 million. The expected decline is largely due to the launch of ARO Drilling and the associated sale of assets to ARO. As a reminder, this guidance excludes rebillables as well as certain potential ARO Drilling pass-through costs that we expect to have an equal offset in revenue. 
SG&A expenses for the third quarter totaled $25 million, representing a slight increase from $22 million in the second quarter, but they were at the low end of our guidance. As we mentioned in our prior call, second quarter G&A expense benefited from a reduced stock price and its impact on certain compensation awards that are mark-to-market. We anticipate our fourth quarter SG&A expense will remain relatively flat with the third quarter level. 
For the third quarter, depreciation expense totaled $103 million, and we expect full year expense of slightly higher than $400 million, just above our previous guidance, due to the delayed sale of rigs to ARO Drilling. Interest expense for the third quarter was $39 million, and our 2017 estimate is $156 million. 
Our full year guidance for income tax expense has been reduced to the mid-$20 million range compared to our prior guidance of the low $40 million, primarily due to a tax benefit as a result of the resolution of our prior year tax contingency. Income tax expense will likely continue to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, and tax expense will be impacted not only by levels of pretax income, but also by the timing of contract awards, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. We continue to expect our cash tax payments during 2017 to total in the mid-$30 million range. 
Now let's discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. Capital expenditures totaled $21 million in the third quarter, $5 million below second quarter levels. We are reducing our full year guidance from $120 million to $130 million down to $120 million. We ended the quarter with just above $1.2 billion in cash before the ARO distribution. 
As previously stated, we retired $7 million of debt in the third quarter, which brings our year-to-date total debt retirement to $170 million. 
Next, I would like to provide full year guidance for 2018, keeping in mind that we are currently on our budget process, and these estimates will be refined on our next quarterly earnings call. As I mentioned last quarter, Rowan will be reimbursed by ARO Drilling for back office and operations support costs, which we will recognize as revenue as part of a transition services arrangement. 
For 2018, we expect transition services revenue to approximate $30 million, but to gradually decline thereafter over the next few years until there are no remaining transition services. Our 2018 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $600 million to $650 million. These estimates could change depending on the schedule of drilling units returning to work. 
SG&A expense for 2018 is estimated to range from $95 million to $105 million, fairly in line with the 2017 level. 
Depreciation expense is expected to range from $370 million to $380 million, and interest expense is forecast at $155 million in 2018. 
As most of our contributions to ARO were structured as shareholder loans, we also expect to generate approximately $10 million of interest income from ARO Drilling on top of interest income related to our cash balance. And finally, we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures will total less than $100 million in 2018. 
As a reminder, we are accounting for ARO Drilling under the equity method. However, we also intend to provide supplementary financial details in our earnings releases and periodic filings going forward. To assist you with your forecasting of ARO, we have disclosed the day rates for the initial 5 rigs, which ARO will collect as revenue and assume the operating costs forward. We have also disclosed the transition services cost for ARO to be paid to Rowan.

In closing, we are excited about the launch of ARO Drilling and strongly believe that this venture will be a significant long-term growth driver for our company. The $88 million cash distribution we received in October, together with the second and larger distribution expected in late 2018 after we sell the Scooter Yeargain and the Hank Boswell, are examples of the immediate benefits created by this joint venture. 
However, we believe the most significant value creation from the JV is still ahead of us and will become more apparent once the newbuild rigs enter the ARO Drilling fleet. This morning, we published an appendix to our investor presentation outlining the various components of ARO drilling. We hope this summary will help to clarify the structure and clearly illustrate the long-term value creation that we believe ARO Drilling will provide to Rowan. We believe the visible growth of ARO Drilling is a major differentiator for us in an industry that currently struggles to have much visibility and stability. 
Operator, we're now ready to turn the call over for questions."

And that's been our -- sort of our tagline about how we think about individual asset transactions and how we think about our larger transactions. I would say that the underlying sort of focus on that is our desire -- our strong desire to improve the return on invested capital and make sure that, from a capital allocation perspective, every dollar that we invest in new assets is well-spent. So we are certainly focused on value. With respect to your specific question about the harsh environments in the jack-up market, clearly, that has been our thing -- our focus for the last several years. We obviously have moved into the ultra-deepwater at the high end, but the [ Skeie ] transaction that we did in -- that we executed in 2010 was aligned with entering that market. I do think the harsh environment market is, as we think about the whole of the jack-up market, it is a big market. And the harsh environment market is a small part of it, and it's definitely somewhere that Rowan need be focused historically and something that we would -- definitely, it's somewhere where we like. Now the problem is with those assets, there aren't that many compared to the large number of assets that are out there in the jack-up space. But there are some jack-ups -- harsh environment jack-ups in the Chinese shipyards as well. So there are some opportunities out there, but we continue to view that as an interesting market, as we always have the last 5 or 6 years."

Although nobody has a lot of seventh-generation assets. I would say as far as would we be -- do we think that having more ultra-deepwater is ultimately where we should be? Yes. But also, when we have 3 out of 4 rigs uncontracted, we are less likely to go out and add to that number of uncontracted assets.

And also, we wouldn't want to -- I think -- we think the quality of the fleet is very important. And the feedback we get from our customers is that they see a big distinction between the seventh-generation assets that we have and the earlier in the upcycled sixth-generation assets that a lot of others have. I would say that the financial community doesn't make that distinction.

That's going to have a big impact on capital budgets for '18 and '19. So as you know, a lot of the majors, they budget out multiple years. So I think this is good timing. The last 2 years, we've had the reverse situation. So -- but right now, we're -- Jud, we're following 10 to 12 things that we feel like our rigs are definitely suited for, and we're going after them. So our goal is to obviously try to get all 4 of them contracted before the end of the year. And I think if things fall in place, that's certainly something we can do before the end of '18."

But obviously, we have some good visibility for follow-on work on a number of rigs. Of course, there's a whole host of different scenarios that could put us within that range. And we get comfortable with that range because we think it encapsulates most of the reasonable utilization scenarios. Now deepwater utilization will have the largest impact. And of course, that won't surprise you given we're in November already, and a long lead time for work, that it's -- we're fairly likely to have significant idle time in the first half on the floaters. So I mean, again, given we don't really providing revenue guidance, it's probably about as much detail as I can give you on our forecast on revenue."

I mean, you're just seeing backlog erosion big time from the original contracts. But as I've said, though, Kurt, I mean, we're starting to see more tender activity, I think, is a sign that -- I personally think that a good sign that the market is bottoming. And the deepwater market is when you see the majors go out for multiyear contracts to try to lock up rigs at lower rates. You're seeing some of that now, but I think you'll continue to see that as we move into '18. And -- but we are tracking 10 to 12 prospects for our ships. I think it's clear in our discussions with operators that have this demand that, that's the preferred ship. With day rates where they are, it just makes a lot of sense whether or not a lower-spec ship could do it or not. But you look at the difference in cost to the operator, it just makes sense to pick up the higher-spec rig and having your fleet for multiple years."

And so we are going through a difficult period right now, which is sort of a necessary transition between old fleet in the '80s and the new fleet that was built in the sort of the 2005 to 2010 or -- and later. So I -- now having said that, there has been a -- there's a lot of assets out there. Some of them are going to go away, and we've seen that. And some of them will continue to go away. And our customers do -- have a strong preference for newer rigs. And in our marketing operations we've seen, when we're talking about opportunities, [ they normally are ] marketing and the customers requiring new rigs, and our customers will take anything. And more often than not, the answer is that they require new rigs. Now so as far as driving attrition, I don't think that M&A will necessarily drive attrition as far as make it -- people -- if the people got a rig that's basically going to create value and it will lead those value in these assets, I don't think M&A necessarily does that. What creates attrition is customers no longer wanting particular assets. Having said that, we have -- historically, we have some. So it's a little hard to say. But I think it's really about how good the asset is. And does it fit in the global fleets or even in a particular driller's fleet. I know from Rowan's perspective, we've been very careful about when we [ screen ] selling rigs to either scrap them or sell them into [indiscernible] mode. We've done for almost all of ours.

But we do consider it in that portfolio. Certainly, the value created in the first one, we put back to work of the 3 versus the third. We do think about that -- we do believe that will be different. I'd say on short-term jobs, we actually like the idea of short-term jobs, but we always are sort of cognizant of what is on the back of them. Is there an opportunity? So what we don't want to do is ramp up a drillship with all the crews, hire a number of people on the lower levels because [ we have enough on the ] senior levels already. Get the rig back to work. Ramp it up. Get everybody fully competent through a very short job and then have to lay everybody off. That is not -- there's a number of reasons not to doing that. It is because, first of all, that's probably -- it will destroy more value than keeping them stacked. And also, we want to -- we're looking for a bit more opportunity than that. Having said that, will we take short-term jobs? And do we believe a hot rig is more marketable than a [ one-stack ] rig? Absolutely. And so we evaluated off each opportunity. And frankly, a lot of the shorter-term jobs are actually pretty attractive. As long as we think there's something on the back end which, frankly, today versus 6 months ago, there are more opportunities on the back end. So I think for us and probably the other drillers, shorter-term jobs are actually pretty interesting because we feel like the market is going to improve. And therefore, you'd be sort of in an even better -- you'd have some of the best -- you would have some of the best rigs in the world. And they would be hot as opposed to one-stacked."

Following my prepared remarks, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and guidance. And then I'll conclude with some thoughts on ARO Drilling before opening the call to questions. 
In the third quarter, we believe Permian crude oil prices continue to help the offshore rig market find the bottom and even make some modest improvements in some categories and regions. Interest from our customers to resume exploration drilling seems to be increasing. However, the majority of the visible demand continues to be for shorter cycle activities and mature basins. While this dynamic is supportive of a gradual recovery in jack-up activity, the Deepwater floater market is much more dependent on demand from exploration drilling. Though we've seen a general increase in tendering activity in the floater market over the past quarters, we still believe incremental contract fixtures will struggle to keep pace with the cadence of contracts rolling off through the end of 2017 and well into 2018. Regardless of the market segment, as contracts that were signed before the downturn come to an end, we have already seen a strong trend for all the rigs to be replaced by modern, more capable rigs. We expect this trend to continue, especially in the floater market where there is strong technical differentiation in the latest generation of rigs. 
As we approach the end of the year, crude oil prices will play a vital role in E&P budget and project approvals for 2018. Mark will go through in more detail about our recent contract awards, utilization trends and our outlook for the Rowan fleet. 
This quarter end, we announced the launch of ARO Drilling as joint venture with Saudi Aramco. I'd like to take a moment to thank and congratulate our employees and those of Saudi Aramco who work tirelessly to ensure a successful startup to ARO Drilling. It's been almost a year since we announced the signing of this historic partnership with the largest jack-up customer in the world, and we're pleased to see it fully operating. I'll go into more detail about ARO Drilling following Stephen's comments. 
This morning, we reported a net loss of $0.17 per diluted share in the third quarter from a loss of $0.23 per diluted share in the previous quarter. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $99 million versus the consensus estimate of approximately $83 million. We are pleased that J.P. Bussell and Rowan Norway went back to work during the quarter, improving our total jack-up utilization to 78%. 
Our impressive operational efficiency continues in the third quarter with approximately 99% up-time fleet-wide and exhibited ongoing capital spending discipline and control of cost, which resulted in a cash balance at quarter end of approximately $1.2 billion and a cash balance today of over $1.3 billion. As we consider capital allocation opportunities, we're mindful of maintaining an attractive credit profile and a strong solid balance sheet. We recognize the value in preserving liquidity. And when we examine opportunistic investments, we believe the transactions should be strategic, accretive and not pollute the asset quality of our fleet. 
Now for a more detailed look at the market, I'll hand the call over to Mark."
300794,540730486,1331055,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we were pleased with the overall improvement in market [ cinema ] as well as the backlog additions to our jack-up fleet, most notably in Trinidad. As announced in our most recent fleet sta",916,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we were pleased with the overall improvement in market [ cinema ] as well as the backlog additions to our jack-up fleet, most notably in Trinidad. As announced in our most recent fleet status report, we extended our current contracts with BP on both the Joe Douglas and the EXL II. These commitments had approximately 1 year of work for each unit. Additionally, the Ralph Coffman also secured a contract extension, which will carry the rig through the end of the year. Our excellence in operational performance in the region continues to lead to repeat business with valued customers. 
Also this quarter, Shell contracted the Gorilla VI for its program in Trinidad. The jack-up were mobilized from the North Sea for 150-day drilling program that is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2018. There are 4 priced options following the initial program which, if exercised, would keep the rig busy until early 2019. 
As a reminder, the Gorilla VI continues to receive day rate until early March as part of the termination agreement with ConocoPhillips. The worldwide demand for harsh environment jack-ups is showing signs of health and utilization is hovering around levels that are supportive for improved commercial terms. Although demand in this subsector is improving, I should note that around half of the projects for these more capable units originates from benign environment regions with operators being attracted to the generally higher levels of efficiency that these harsh environment rigs provide. The overall jack-up demand appears to have bottomed. The supply-demand balance for benign environment jack-ups continues to be extremely challenging with day rates approximating operating costs in some regions.
With the plentiful supply of modern rigs that are warm or hot stack, combined with substantial queue of newbuilds, it is difficult to predict when the promotional environment will improve on a global basis. This appreciation for the distinction between harsh and benign environment jack-ups is supportive of Rowan's strategy and mission statement: To be recognized by our customers as a sufficient and capable provider of demanding contract drilling services. 85% of our marketed jack-ups are high-spec with most rigs also being rated for harsh environments. Today and historically, utilization levels are higher for this caliber of rig. 
Now looking at specific jack-up regions of the world. Middle East provides significant potential for increase in demand for 2018 considering outstanding tender requirements across the region. Incremental demand is anticipated from Saudi Aramco, National Drilling Company, Kuwait Oil Co. and KJO, among other customers. EXL I and EXL IV are currently tendered on multiple projects in the region, and we are hopeful to secure contract for those units over the coming quarters. 
The Bob Palmer is currently contracted to Saudi Aramco until the end of the year. Discussions are ongoing about a possible extension for this high-spec jack-up to be leased into ARO and continue its successful track record of deep gas drilling. 
The North Sea, 5 of our 6 jack-ups are currently contracted as the Rowan Norway recently completed a project in the U.K. with Repsol Sinopec. We are looking at multiple opportunities for the Rowan Norway and the Gorilla VII, both in and out of the region for projects starting in 2018. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we secured a new contract with W&T Offshore for the EXL III. But the region remains one of the weakest jack-up regions in the world. The conversations with customers have picked up slightly now that hurricane season is behind us, but continuous work may be a challenge in this market so the EXL III is also being tendered worldwide. 
Now turning to the floater market. I'd like to briefly mention recent news in Latin America before focusing on the ultra-deepwater market. We continue to actively participate in opportunities in Latin America and closely monitor the ongoing bid rounds. Last week, the high interest from IOCs in the Brazilian bidding rounds further strengthened our view that this region will have an increase in activity level in the coming years. 
In Mexico, the next round to watch will be in January 2018, which should have close to 30 deepwater blocks up for bid. 
In the broad floater market, we don't expect contracted demand to make a definitive turn until at least late 2018. There's a lack of near-term incremental projects in the face of significant continued contract roll-offs in the coming months. 
Though fixtures are few and far between, recent contract awards support that well-equipped seventh-generation units are preferred by customers, and we are actively pursuing approximately 10 to 12 prospects for our drillships. 
Programs range in link from 150 days to 3 years, and commencement dates are expected during the next 12 to 18 months. There are only 18 [ build stack ], 1,250-ton capable units available before the end of 2018, so that niche market could tighten up well in advance of the total fleet. 
As I cautioned on the last call, continued commodity price strength for the remainder of the year will play a key role in the follow-through of planned 2018 and 2019 deepwater activity. Rowan is well-positioned in the current stage of the market with high-performing shallow water assets and 4 the most capable ultra-deepwater drillships in the industry today. We are exhibiting operational excellence acutely focused on adding backlog and strategically prepared for the recovery. 
This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,540730486,1331055,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2017",2017-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2017 results today, I'll provide you with updates on our cost and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2017 and provide preliminary guidance for 2018. Follow",1181,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2017 results today, I'll provide you with updates on our cost and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2017 and provide preliminary guidance for 2018. Following my comments, I'll turn the call back over to Tom. 
As Tom mentioned, we are pleased with the recent launch of ARO Drilling. Shortly following the close of the third quarter, we received an $88 million cash distribution from ARO as part of the formation process, further bolstering our liquidity in this challenging market. Our cash balance is now over $1.3 billion. Together with our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, this strong liquidity positions us very well to both weather the storm and make opportunistic investments. 
Now for our quarterly results. This morning, we reported a net loss of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share in comparison to a net loss of $29 million or $0.23 per diluted share last quarter. Both quarters included minor impacts from the early extinguishment of debt with the third quarter including a $500,000 loss and the second quarter including a $2.4 million gain. 
The quarter-over-quarter reduction in our net loss per share was driven by an income tax benefit related to a lapse in the statute of limitations. 
Revenue for the third quarter was $289 million, excluding rebillable items, a decrease of 9% from the prior quarter due to the decline in deepwater revenue. Despite the overall reduction, we were pleased to see a $6 million improvement in jack-up revenue attributed to the start-up of the J.P. Bussell in the Middle East and the Rowan Norway in the U.K. 
Operating costs remained relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, so our adjusted EBITDA declined to $99 million from $131 million in the second quarter of 2017, while our EBITDA margins declined to 34%. While this is now well off recent peak levels, I would add that I'm pleased that we've been able to maintain an EBITDA margin 3 years into the cyclical downturn that is equal to our EBITDA margin from the first quarter of 2014. 
Our quarterly jack-up utilization increased to 78%, up 6% from the second quarter level, though average day rates decreased slightly. Our third quarter deepwater utilization was 50%, considering the revenue-producing days on the Rowan Reliance, where we are recognizing deferred revenue related to the Cobalt prepayment and termination in 2016. Notably, our Rowan Resolute ultra-deepwater drillship once again did not incur any unbillable downtime during this third quarter, a feat it has now accomplished for 5 consecutive quarters. Our total operational downtime, including both the floater and jack-up fleet, was only 1%. 
Now turning to expenses. Operating costs for the third quarter were $165 million, net of rebillable items, in line with the low end of our guidance and flat with the second quarter level. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect operating costs to decline to $150 million to $160 million. The expected decline is largely due to the launch of ARO Drilling and the associated sale of assets to ARO. As a reminder, this guidance excludes rebillables as well as certain potential ARO Drilling pass-through costs that we expect to have an equal offset in revenue. 
SG&A expenses for the third quarter totaled $25 million, representing a slight increase from $22 million in the second quarter, but they were at the low end of our guidance. As we mentioned in our prior call, second quarter G&A expense benefited from a reduced stock price and its impact on certain compensation awards that are mark-to-market. We anticipate our fourth quarter SG&A expense will remain relatively flat with the third quarter level. 
For the third quarter, depreciation expense totaled $103 million, and we expect full year expense of slightly higher than $400 million, just above our previous guidance, due to the delayed sale of rigs to ARO Drilling. Interest expense for the third quarter was $39 million, and our 2017 estimate is $156 million. 
Our full year guidance for income tax expense has been reduced to the mid-$20 million range compared to our prior guidance of the low $40 million, primarily due to a tax benefit as a result of the resolution of our prior year tax contingency. Income tax expense will likely continue to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, and tax expense will be impacted not only by levels of pretax income, but also by the timing of contract awards, changes in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and various other factors. We continue to expect our cash tax payments during 2017 to total in the mid-$30 million range. 
Now let's discuss our cash flow and balance sheet. Capital expenditures totaled $21 million in the third quarter, $5 million below second quarter levels. We are reducing our full year guidance from $120 million to $130 million down to $120 million. We ended the quarter with just above $1.2 billion in cash before the ARO distribution. 
As previously stated, we retired $7 million of debt in the third quarter, which brings our year-to-date total debt retirement to $170 million. 
Next, I would like to provide full year guidance for 2018, keeping in mind that we are currently on our budget process, and these estimates will be refined on our next quarterly earnings call. As I mentioned last quarter, Rowan will be reimbursed by ARO Drilling for back office and operations support costs, which we will recognize as revenue as part of a transition services arrangement. 
For 2018, we expect transition services revenue to approximate $30 million, but to gradually decline thereafter over the next few years until there are no remaining transition services. Our 2018 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $600 million to $650 million. These estimates could change depending on the schedule of drilling units returning to work. 
SG&A expense for 2018 is estimated to range from $95 million to $105 million, fairly in line with the 2017 level. 
Depreciation expense is expected to range from $370 million to $380 million, and interest expense is forecast at $155 million in 2018. 
As most of our contributions to ARO were structured as shareholder loans, we also expect to generate approximately $10 million of interest income from ARO Drilling on top of interest income related to our cash balance. And finally, we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures will total less than $100 million in 2018. 
As a reminder, we are accounting for ARO Drilling under the equity method. However, we also intend to provide supplementary financial details in our earnings releases and periodic filings going forward. To assist you with your forecasting of ARO, we have disclosed the day rates for the initial 5 rigs, which ARO will collect as revenue and assume the operating costs forward. We have also disclosed the transition services cost for ARO to be paid to Rowan. 
Lastly, ARO Drilling has assumed the cost of our former Saudi Arabian shorebase. 
Now before opening the call for questions and answers, I'm going to hand the call back to Tom for some brief closing remarks."

In closing, we are excited about the launch of ARO Drilling and strongly believe that this venture will be a significant long-term growth driver for our company. The $88 million cash distribution we received in October, together with the second and larger distribution expected in late 2018 after we sell the Scooter Yeargain and the Hank Boswell, are examples of the immediate benefits created by this joint venture. 
However, we believe the most significant value creation from the JV is still ahead of us and will become more apparent once the newbuild rigs enter the ARO Drilling fleet. This morning, we published an appendix to our investor presentation outlining the various components of ARO drilling. We hope this summary will help to clarify the structure and clearly illustrate the long-term value creation that we believe ARO Drilling will provide to Rowan. We believe the visible growth of ARO Drilling is a major differentiator for us in an industry that currently struggles to have much visibility and stability.

I would say that the underlying sort of focus on that is our desire -- our strong desire to improve the return on invested capital and make sure that, from a capital allocation perspective, every dollar that we invest in new assets is well-spent. So we are certainly focused on value. With respect to your specific question about the harsh environments in the jack-up market, clearly, that has been our thing -- our focus for the last several years. We obviously have moved into the ultra-deepwater at the high end, but the [ Skeie ] transaction that we did in -- that we executed in 2010 was aligned with entering that market. I do think the harsh environment market is, as we think about the whole of the jack-up market, it is a big market. And the harsh environment market is a small part of it, and it's definitely somewhere that Rowan need be focused historically and something that we would -- definitely, it's somewhere where we like. Now the problem is with those assets, there aren't that many compared to the large number of assets that are out there in the jack-up space. But there are some jack-ups -- harsh environment jack-ups in the Chinese shipyards as well. So there are some opportunities out there, but we continue to view that as an interesting market, as we always have the last 5 or 6 years."

Obviously, we are -- we have some uncontracted assets, but not that many. And we do believe that if there is incremental demand in the -- in Saudi Arabia as long as ARO is competitive on price and it has the right operational performance, we think that we have a good opportunity to grow its fleet over the next several years, even before the newbuilds program starts in Saudi Arabia through the maritime JV that is just about up and running or is up and running right now."

Although nobody has a lot of seventh-generation assets. I would say as far as would we be -- do we think that having more ultra-deepwater is ultimately where we should be? Yes. But also, when we have 3 out of 4 rigs uncontracted, we are less likely to go out and add to that number of uncontracted assets. And so I think we do agree with the thesis that we need to probably be a bit bigger in ultra-deepwater. But we definitely -- when you've got 3 uncontracted drillships, we need to put those to work. And also, we wouldn't want to -- I think -- we think the quality of the fleet is very important. And the feedback we get from our customers is that they see a big distinction between the seventh-generation assets that we have and the earlier in the upcycled sixth-generation assets that a lot of others have. I would say that the financial community doesn't make that distinction. Or a lot in the financial community just think a drillship built after 2009 is a drillship, but it's certainly not what we hear out of our customers who are more focused on the higher end. And I think you've heard that language out of some of the other drillers as well. I'd say on semis, yes, absolutely. It all comes to the quality of the asset and how marketable it is. I think there's a lot of good semis out there. We certainly would want to make sure we stay with the assets that our customers are really focused on using and stay away from things that will be cold-stacked and perhaps take quite some time to come back.

What I was trying to get across from my comments was that we don't really see this market, the ultra-deepwater market, bottoming until sometime in the last part of '18. They're -- that's all certainly dependent on oil prices. If they continue this upward track and move to a position where there's a 6 in front of that number, that's always going to have a profound effect on the ultra-deepwater market. So right now, we like the way it's trending. We like the fact that we're in a strong commodity environment during the budget approval process right now. That's going to have a big impact on capital budgets for '18 and '19. So as you know, a lot of the majors, they budget out multiple years. So I think this is good timing. The last 2 years, we've had the reverse situation. So -- but right now, we're -- Jud, we're following 10 to 12 things that we feel like our rigs are definitely suited for, and we're going after them.

What creates attrition is customers no longer wanting particular assets. Having said that, we have -- historically, we have some. So it's a little hard to say.

And we have pushed back. And it has probably hurt us in a couple of situations on some ultra-deepwater bids, but we're just not willing to bet the company on a 2- or 3-year contract. And it just doesn't make a lot of sense to lock the rigs up for multiple years at low day rates and taking a lot of risk. We're just not going to do that."

We don't know the contract terms other drillers have taken, so it is a little anecdotal. And customers, obviously, in a down cycle, we expect them to encourage a change in the risk allocation. So we don't know. But we certainly -- the contracting environment, it is becoming the coming tougher. And I think all of us are evaluating our traditional stances on risk allocation. I'd say that we are probably one of the more conservative companies. And though we're not the only one, [ I think I remember ] other drillers out there that view the world as [ saying ], although we really don't know. I would say that there's, obviously -- as you mentioned, there's the price and then there's how many priced options [ are there at the time ]. There's a lot of elements. And also the duration is one of [ the elements ]. So it's something that's sort of dynamic on the Rowan side, and we continue to evaluate it."

And so I'm curious, if you can get contract terms that are less onerous, right? If you assume that it's something you're totally comfortable with, you've seen some guys out there obviously come out and bring things for short-term jobs. As you're sitting there with the 3 -- with 3 idle drillships, is there a willingness, at least early on, because you don't want these things to sit idle longer, to maybe bring at least the first one out for a short-term job? I guess, I'm just trying to think. You hear some of your peers starting to talk about portfolio approach to this. Obviously, you don't want to lock in everything at low rates. Just a little bit more color on if, in fact, we continue to see the favorable trends we saw in the third quarter with more contracts, including more long term. So now you can effectively maybe pick, right? Short-term and long-term jobs, how you'll approach that. Again, assuming that these are contracts that you're willing -- that the risk is fine there."

We do sort of think of it from a little bit of a portfolio perspective, although our portfolio is -- the number of drillships that we have is a lot smaller than some of our competitors. So if you have 15 drillships, you're [ willing ] to put some. And then you can get the upside later on with the others. When you only have 4 and 1 of them is working, you definitely have to be. But we do consider it in that portfolio. Certainly, the value created in the first one, we put back to work of the 3 versus the third. We do think about that -- we do believe that will be different. I'd say on short-term jobs, we actually like the idea of short-term jobs, but we always are sort of cognizant of what is on the back of them. Is there an opportunity? So what we don't want to do is ramp up a drillship with all the crews, hire a number of people on the lower levels because [ we have enough on the ] senior levels already. Get the rig back to work. Ramp it up. Get everybody fully competent through a very short job and then have to lay everybody off. That is not -- there's a number of reasons not to doing that. It is because, first of all, that's probably -- it will destroy more value than keeping them stacked. And also, we want to -- we're looking for a bit more opportunity than that. Having said that, will we take short-term jobs? And do we believe a hot rig is more marketable than a [ one-stack ] rig? Absolutely. And so we evaluated off each opportunity. And frankly, a lot of the shorter-term jobs are actually pretty attractive. As long as we think there's something on the back end which, frankly, today versus 6 months ago, there are more opportunities on the back end. So I think for us and probably the other drillers, shorter-term jobs are actually pretty interesting because we feel like the market is going to improve. And therefore, you'd be sort of in an even better -- you'd have some of the best -- you would have some of the best rigs in the world. And they would be hot as opposed to one-stacked."
