Today's presentation and the earnings release that was issued earlier today can be found on our website at bhge.com.
As a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide predictions, forecasts and other forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. We advise you to review our SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
In addition, we believe that using additional non-GAAP financial measures on a combined business basis will enhance the evaluation of the profitability of the company and its ongoing operations. Also, reconciliations of operating income and other non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, GAAP results, can be found in our earnings release and on our website at bhge.com under the Investor Relations section.
Because this is the first quarter of operations following our merger, we have prepared financial statements on a combined business basis as if the merger have been completed on January 1, 2016. All prior year and quarter comparisons are to these combined business results.

Before we begin with the quarter results, I would like to thank our team for what we have achieved in our first 90 days as a combined company. As we said, this will be a journey. Our current focus is on understanding and improving our core operations as we integrate. I am particularly impressed with the progress and the speed of the integration since the creation of Baker Hughes, a GE Company on July 1. The combined business was fully operational on day 1. Thanks to the very detailed preparation and planning prior to closing. I am more convinced than ever that the creation of BHGE combine the right companies at the right time. Customer feedback continues to be very positive, and we are having constructive discussions about how our capabilities can improve project economics. 
In this sustained low commodity price environment, the need to drive productivity is critical for our customers. Our new company has taken its first steps, and our message of partnership along the value chain is clearly resonating. From upstream to downstream, we provide our customers a broad offering of solutions. We are also driving a culture of safety for our customers, our employees and everybody else involved in our operations. We have implemented the perfect [indiscernible] day process. As you know, in our first quarter as a combined company, we have already have to deal with a number of challenging environmental events, such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and others. Our thoughts go out to all of those who were affected by these events, including many of our employees. 
Turning to this morning's discussion, I will cover 3 topics. First, I'll give a brief overview of our operational results in the quarter. Second, I will share our perspective of the industry and the market dynamics in our key segments and highlight some of the key achievements of the quarter. Finally, I will give you some more detailed reports of the new company and integration. Brian will then review our financial results in more detail before we open the call for questions. 
In the first quarter, we delivered $5.7 billion in orders and $5.4 billion in revenues. We saw sequential revenue growth in our shorter cycle businesses and declines in our long cycle businesses, consistent with the view we have shared with you previously. Adjusted operating income was $240 million. We continue to see improved margin performance in our Oilfield Service business, partially offset by challenges in our longer cycle businesses, particularly in our Oilfield Equipment segment. Earnings per share were negative $0.24 and adjusted EPS was $0.05. While I am pleased with the positive orders results this quarter, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to improve operating margins and cash generation. 
Synergy execution is a critical component of that. Our synergy plans are fully in place now and the teams are executing on them. Further, in our first 90 days of operations, we have identified additional opportunities to improve productivity in the company and simplifying and reduce cost in our operating structure. We are positioning the company for higher growth and profitability. We now where we have to focus to deliver on our commitments. Now it's up to us to execute.  Brian will go through the details of the financial results, but I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace. 
In Oilfield Services segment, we continue to see growth, driven by our Well Construction business lines in North America. While North American rig count is more than 40% up year-to-date, we saw a deceleration in the quarter with the U.S. land rig count up 6% versus the second quarter. While customers in North America are generally quite positive about the outlook, we expect activity to stay flat through the end of the year until the market has better line of sight into 2018 budgets and operators production hedge positions. 
We continue to believe that our advanced drilling capabilities will differentiate us in the marketplace where industrial well construction practices and servicing intensity per well continues to increase. Our drilling services and drill bits businesses outpace rig count growth in North America in the third quarter. 
With our AutoTrak Curve high-build rotary steerable system, Talon high-efficiency PDC drill bits, tailored drilling fluids and enhanced solids removal techniques, we have helped operators reduce well cost and improve performance, particularly in the Marcellus and Utica. We delivered a total of 100 wells where more than a mile of footage was drilled in our 24 hour period. This speaks to how far we have raised the bar in the industrial well construction arena in North America, where our rates of penetration metrics and drilling can now be quoted in miles per day rather than in feet per hour. With the longer laterals now the norm in every basin and longer more complex laterals being planned by our customers, our Drilling Services business is positioned to grow in the coming quarters as these more challenging drilling horizons come into play. 
International activity in Oilfield Services remain muted with rig count flat year-to-date. However, we are seeing signs of activity increase, both in the volume and size of tenders for new work as customers feel more confident about their operating costs and commodity price stability. To that point, we were awarded a large multiyear integrated drilling contract with an important customer in the Middle East, as well as 2 critical deepwater completion contracts in Latin America offshore. 
In our Oilfield Equipment segment, the subsea market continues to be very challenging. Activity remains low and prices continue to be pressured. We expect 3 awards in 2017 to be 150 to 170, up significantly versus 2016, but still 70% below peak levels seen in 2013. As we previously communicated, we had a significant win in the quarter to support this old gasfield. The win is a result of a productivity initiative using our digital tools across our design and manufacturing process to deliver the most cost competitive products in the subsea market. Our cross-sell assets and ability to develop local content with critical in securing the awards and being part of Egypt's energy future. 
During the quarter, we also announced what is the first demonstration of our ability to generate value for our customers through our full stream offering. The agreement executed with Twinza Oil will provide support for an offshore development project in Papua New Guinea. This business model is an exciting development for the industry, where the combination of capability between our Oilfield Equipment, Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery segments can provide a unique, high productivity value proposition for our customers and commercial differentiation. 
Despite these successes in the quarter, we continue to expect the subsea markets to be very challenged in the short term with little sign of any significant recovery in 2018. 
In our Turbomachinery segment, the LNG market continues to be oversupplied in the near term and with gas prices pressured in most markets. The long-term value proposition for LNG remains positive and we have an industry-leading portfolio in this segment with unsurpassed manufacturing and services capabilities. Opportunities for growth in the short to midterm exists across the broader midstream and downstream segments in which we participate. These include gas to power projects, stranded gas monetization, pipeline and surface compression to name a few. Many of these applications require a range of Turbomachinery equipment that is fit for purpose in terms of both cost and function. 
To better serve this market, we have been expanding our NovaLT equipment application to serve anything from traditional oil and gas segments to the industrial sector. I am pleased to say that earlier this year, we secured a contract to supply a cogeneration power plant with a 16.5-megawatt NovaLT gas turbine generator. The plant will deliver electricity to our customer's facility in Malaysia and apply a weighty recovery process. This innovative approach will help increase energy efficiency and lower CO2 emissions by 54,000 tons per year. 
In refining, large complex refinery should gain an advantage in the more competitive, oversupplied landscape. However, costs and refining margins continue to move some projects to the right. In the quarter, we won a critical contract in the Middle East to provide 7 compression trains, enabling our refinery plants to produce cleaner energy. 
In petrochemicals, we see healthy end market demand. Cost advantage supply basis continue to drive projects forward, particularly in North America and the Middle East. Earlier this year, we won a deal to supply 3 large steam turbine driven compressors for an ethylene production plant in North America. 
In the Digital Solutions segment, we see end markets for measurement and control space portfolio slowly returning to growth. Nonoil and gas end markets continue to be robust, driven by aviation and industrials. Oil and gas end markets are beginning to stabilize, and we expect them to return to growth over the medium term. 
Our digital offerings in software and digital services continue to gain traction in the marketplace. And in the quarter, we secured our largest ever award of approximately $300 million from an important international customer. This long-term award includes a holistic asset performance management solution based on the GE Predix platform. 
In the third quarter, we went live with our planned operation advisory program with BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Our technology is performing 25 million calculations a day, and together with our customer, we are focused on reducing nonproductive time. Almost all of our customers are either evaluating or applying new solutions in this emerging space. And I believe we are uniquely positioned from a portfolio perspective to help them make step changes in productivity for their businesses. 
Lastly, on integration, we have made significant progress over the first quarter as a combined company. The organization is in place and all leadership positions have been staffed. We have trained over 15,000 employees on changes impacting and their roles in the new company. We had personal touch points with over 90% of our customers in the first 2 weeks after closing, and in early September, we went live with our fully integrated commercial platform. I have personally had opportunity to engage with many of our most important customers around the globe and continue to update them regularly. As you know, cost actions are underway as well. We are taking restructuring actions wherever it is necessary. We successfully consolidated over 20 facilities in the quarter and initiated an additional 40 for completion by the end of the year. 
Overall, I feel we've made an incredible amount of progress in the third quarter. I feel good about achieving the synergy targets we laid out. We are still in the early days and just recently had our 100-day anniversary. We are on track and what they see so far is highly encouraging. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian to go through our financial results."

Quarter-over-quarter, the increase in orders was driven by o",2145,"Thanks, Lorenzo. I'll start with total company results and then go into the segment details. We had a strong quarters quarter at $5.7 billion, which is up 2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, the increase in orders was driven by our shorter cycle segment, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions, as activity picked up in North America as well as in the Middle East. This increase was partially offset by headwinds in the our long cycle businesses with Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment down 11% and 5%, respectively. The declines in these businesses were driven by strong comparisons in the second quarter and continued delays in customer spending. Year-over-year, total orders grew 18%, albeit off a low base in the third quarter of 2016, and all of our segments showed growth. Backlog increased from $20.6 billion to $20.9 billion in the quarter. Both equipment and service backlog grew. Equipment backlog ended at $5.7 billion. The third quarter was the first quarter in over 6 quarters where our corporate backlog grew sequentially. Equipment booked to bill was 1 to 1, marking this is the second straight quarter with a positive book-to-bill ratio. Service backlog was $15.2 billion and increased 1% sequentially. Revenue for this quarter was $5.4 billion, which was down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year. 
Versus last quarter, our short cycle businesses, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions were up, driven both by activity increases in both North America and the Middle East. We saw sequential declines in our longer-cycle businesses, Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment as a result of lower 2016 order intake, which drove a lower opening backlog. 
Year-over-year, the revenue increases in Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery were offset by the significant decline in Oilfield Equipment. Operating loss in the quarter was $122 million. On an adjusted basis, we delivered $240 million of operating income. This excludes net restructuring and impairment and other charges of $203 million as well as merger and related costs of $159 million. 
Adjusted operating income was up 105% sequentially. As a reminder, when comparing our sequential results, we call out some nonrecurring charges in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we had higher amortization expenses due to the impact from purchase accounting. Even when adjusting for those items, operating income was up significantly, driven by strength in Oilfield Services, Digital Solutions and Turbomachinery, partially offset by continued softness in Oilfield Equipment. 
Included in our reported and adjusted operating income is a negative impact of approximately $15 million as a result of supply chain driven delays caused by Hurricane Harvey. We expect the majority of that to come back to us in the fourth quarter. 
Year-over-year, operating income was down 13%. The increase in Oilfield Services was more than offset by declines in the other segments. 
Next up, our taxes. Tax expense for the quarter was $93 million. While we were in an overall net loss position for the quarter, we generated income outside the U.S. and losses within the U.S., primarily due to the restructuring actions that we have taken. Our foreign income was taxed, but because we have been in a net loss position within the U.S. for a period of time, we were unable to deduct these losses, thus driving the overall higher tax expense. As we start to generate to earnings in the U.S. over time, we expect to benefit from the devaluation allowances built up, including the ones from this quarter. For 4Q, we expect taxes to follow a similar profile to this quarter. 
Loss per share for the third quarter was $0.24. On an adjusted basis, third quarter earnings per share were $0.05. Free cash flow in the quarter was a negative $405 million. While we had anticipated a significant outflow for merger and restructuring related activities, this quarter's performance was below our expectations. First, let me give you some details and then I will give you some insights into how we're going to run things differently going forward. 
As I said, merger and restructuring related items had a significant negative impact of approximately $400 million in the quarter. This was driven by accelerated incentive compensation payments, as well as a lease buyout that were both triggered by the merger. We had a significant amount of restructuring and severance payments as we execute to achieve our synergy targets. In addition, we have a negative impact of approximately $200 million from the continued reduction in our receivables back turn programs. 
Operationally, both accounts receivable and inventory performance were below our expectations and were mainly driven by our Oilfield Services business. While some of that miss might be attributable to distractions from integration, we are expecting significant better performance in the next quarters from the team. We have dedicated a senior leader to build out operational processes to deliver on our commitments of improved the cash conversion. In addition, we are integrating both reporting and operating mechanisms to drive more visibility into cash flow. 
We expect fourth quarter operational free cash flow generation to be markedly better than in the third quarter. 
Next, I'll walk to the segment results. In Oilfield Services, the market continues to improve in North America, though we saw a deceleration in growth versus the second quarter and the rig count flattening since the end of July. International activity remains muted in selected markets we are seeing some signs of activity increases, though. The Oilfield Services business delivered a solid quarter. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 4% sequentially. This quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by the well construction product lines, particularly in North America land and in the Middle East. The completions business delivered double-digit growth sequentially with solid gains in Saudi Arabia, the Permian and the Rockies. As Lorenzo mentioned, revenue growth for the drilling services and the drill bits business outpaced rig count growth in North America. Regionally, increased activity in North America and the Middle East were higher volume. Revenues for North America were $1 billion, up 5% sequentially, driven by the onshore well construction business. Drilling services, drill bits, wireline and completions all delivered double-digit sequential growth. 
Internationally, revenue was $1.6 billion, up 3% sequentially, driven by the Middle East as the well construction credit lines delivered solid growth in a flat rig count environment. Outside the Middle East, [indiscernible] growth in Asia driven by completions and artificial lift businesses, and growth in Europe was drilling services, drill bits and pressure pumping. These gains were partially offset by declines in both Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Operating income was $75 million, up $48 million sequentially and $115 million year-over-year. The operating income for the quarter includes approximately $35 million of additional amortization as a result the purchase accounting. Despite this, the business delivered a strong incremental margins. The increase in operating income is primarily driven by higher volume, cost out efforts, favorable mix, partially offset by Hurricane Harvey impact, which primarily was in the chemical and completions business. 
In the near term, we expect the business to continue to perform in line with the market in which we operate. We view current market dynamics favorable for our drilling services and the drill bits businesses as customers continue to drill complicated. And for our completions business, as North American operators begin to work down that drill bit uncompleted inventory. As we continue to ramp up our synergy programs, we expect to drive additional operating margin leverage in the business. 
Our OST business, despite top line orders growth, continues to operate in a very difficult environment. As Lorenzo mentioned, activity remains at low levels, with few signs of significant improvement in the short term. Orders in the quarter were $760 million, up 45% versus last year and the equipment book-to-bill was 1.4, primarily driven by [indiscernible] win. The team is building on the success from last quarter with [indiscernible] In addition, orders increased in our fixable pipe systems business, which showed continued strength in the Brazilian market. Services orders were also up 3% year-over-year, driven by increasing levels of activity in North America for the pressure control business through supporting its installed base. Niel and his  [indiscernible] team are focused on rebuilding the backlog. 
Revenue was $600 million, down 28% year-over-year. The decline in revenue was driven by lower Subsea Production Systems equipment project backlog, as well as continued market pressure in the rig drilling systems business. We expect the large deals one in 2017 to start generating revenue in 2018. Service revenues were up slightly, only partially offsetting the weakness on the equipment revenues. 
Operating loss was $43 million, which was unfavorable year-over-year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted operating income by approximately $30 million. This was mainly driven by the strengthening of the Brazilian real and British pound versus the U.S. dollar in the quarter. OFE has manufacturing basis in Brazil and the U.K. and is fulfilling long-term contracts with key customers in Sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil. We consider the $30 million impact operational in nature, but do not expect the FX impact to reoccur at the same level going forward. 
Even excluding the impact of FX, operating income was down year-over-year, driven by significant volume pressure and negative cost leverage. In addition, we continue to see pricing habits and the pressure control and flexible pipe systems businesses, which were only able to partially offset with productivity and cost out. Overall, we think the OFE business will continue to be challenged. We expect to build the backlog and compete for key deals. However, as you've seen, we're spending in large projects continue to push out. The team has been reducing cost and are prepared to operate in this environment. 
Now moving to Turbomachinery & Process Solutions, the team delivered solid orders growth of 16% versus the prior year, despite continued challenges across its primary market. Total orders were $1.4 billion in the third quarter and equipment orders were up 79% year-over-year as we signed several large deals for gas compression equipment in the quarter. The gas compression win rate remains strong and actually increased in the quarter. 
EPS also saw modest improvements in the offshore business as well as some wins in the onshore business, mainly in the Middle East. There were no FIDs for LNG projects in the quarter. Service orders were down 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by fewer upgrades as a result of lower customer spending and some softness in the downstream portion of the business. In addition, the transactional service business was also down year-over-year. 
Turbomachinery delivered revenues of $1.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Revenue from equipment was down slightly year-over-year as a result of lower order intake in 2016. Service revenues were up, contractual services, installations and transactional volume were up, partially offset by lower activity in our downstream related services. 
Operating income for Turbomachinery was $210 million, down 19% year-over-year. While service volume was up, lower margin rates in our equipment backlog more than offset the positive impact from higher service sales. As the business is executing through a lower margin equipment project mix, primarily downstream projects, we expect the equipment margins to continue to be at lower levels in the short term. 
Overall, we expect the TPS business to continue its technology leadership and capture market opportunities as they present themselves. 
In the short term, we expect the headwinds on service orders from customers spend delays and low LNG order to continue. Similar to prior years, we expect to see an increase in service volume in the fourth quarter and we are focused on winning more work on the downstream and industrial sides of the business to offset challenges in upstream. 
Next, on Digital Solutions. As reminder, this business operates in a few different end markets, across oil and gas, automotive, aerospace and power. While we see sustainable efficient and oil and gas and market, major project investments remained low. 
In the third quarter, the Digital Solutions business delivered orders of $970 million. This was up 43% year-over-year, driven by the large Predix deal with an important international customer that Lorenzo mentioned earlier. Excluding this deal, orders were down slightly year-over-year. The decline was mainly driven by the condition monitoring product lines, partially offset by growth in other businesses. 
Regionally, we continue to see a slowdown in large EPC projects in the Middle East and Europe, partially offset by strength in Latin America. Revenue for Digital Solutions was $629 million, down 2% year-over-year. We saw growth in our Inspection Technologies business, that was more than offset by Pipeline and Process Solutions. Operating income was $87 million, down 20% year-over-year, driven by lower margin in the pipeline and Process Solutions business as well as negative mix. Overall, we expect Digital Solutions to continue to grow in the fourth quarter, in line with the typical seasonality, but off a lower base than the fourth quarter of 2016. With that, Lorenzo, I turn it back over to you."

We remain very focused on what they control. If you look at the external environment, oil inventories are still 20% above their 5-year averages. When you look at the 3 pillars, let's take them one by one to begin with. On growth, you look at the performance during, the third quarter. You had drilling services and bit growing and outpace the recount growth in North America, we feel good about that. If you look at the orders performance, sequentially, it's the second quarter in a row where we've got positive orders. You look at the year-over-year performance, up 18%. On the book-to-bill, positive. Critical wins, you look at that, which is the key win in Egypt from a subsea perspective. Digital. So we see good traction on the growth side, it's early days. The market remains challenging. But with are definitely focused from a commercial standpoint and getting out there in meeting with the customers has been a key aspect of the first 100 days as you noted during the course of the first 2 weeks, we met over 90% of the customers. On margins, key focus here is on the synergies. As you look at integration, it's on track. I mentioned even in September that we're on track with what we've committed to for 2018 relative to the integration and the synergies. You look at the sequential margins performance from a business segment perspective, Brian walked you through that, and sequentially, 3 of the 4 businesses are showing positive performance. We've got weakness in the OFE segment, which, again, is part of the aspect of subsea and the industry continuing to be delayed in its recovery. If you look at the third pillar cash, as Brian mentioned, it's the key area of focus for us. During the course of the quarter, we had one-time deal related item and restructuring. However, from an operational perspective, it's an area that we need to continue to focus on. It's one of the key areas I have as a focus on inventory receivables. I would say, we didn't performed what we wanted to the third quarter, and it's something that we've addressed and we've got people acting upon it immediately. So when you look at it, early days, but definitely positive momentum, we've got the team rallied and focused on the key priorities.."

So we're going to take a balanced approach, and we want to make sure that we maintain this strong balance sheet as the industry continues to be volatile as we look at it going forward, it's a challenging environment.

We will continue to look at high payback for structuring only as we drive the synergies here. So I'd expect the restructuring costs to continue.

The majority of that will come back to us in the quarter. So that definitely should be helpful. If you look the lives of normal seasonality and the Digital Solutions business. So Digital Solutions is poised to grow here in the fourth quarter. As I walked through with Jim, we feel good about our position in OFS and expect to see growth in OFS if synergies come through. Then when you think some volume increases there. And then TPS is poised to grow in the fourth quarter as well as we look at the backlog of equipment as well as services. And we've got a lot of productivity lined up for that business as well. So those are the big drivers and then synergies will start to ramp up of the its off a lower base this quarter. We should see some improvement there in synergies."

So we feel good about the cost position. They are working hard to drive profitability as we rebuild the backlog. But I do think there will continue to be challenge. So I wouldn't pick FX item in the appreciable increase in margin rates here as we look for the next few quarters."

So in 2018, even though North America has decelerated, you should still see some momentum there. On OFE, we see that continuing to be pressured at this moment in time. We should have better order performance in 2018, but actually the revenue side continue to be pressured. TPS, we mentioned orders being positive in 2018. And also from a revenue perspective, we should start to see the offshore, onshore production in the downstream area. So if you look at FID activity picking up, but we should see revenues essentially improving there. And our [indiscernible] business, if you look at, again, improving there relative to the elements outside of also oil and gas from an aviation and industrial perspective.

Before we begin with the quarter results, I would like to thank our team for what we have achieved in our first 90 days as a combined company. As we said, this will be a journey. Our current focus is on understanding and improving our core operations as we integrate. I am particularly impressed with the progress and the speed of the integration since the creation of Baker Hughes, a GE company, on July 3rd. The combined business was fully operational on day 1, thanks to the very detailed preparation and planning prior to closing.I am more convinced than ever that the creation of BHGE combined the right companies at the right time. Customer feedback continues to be very positive, and we are having constructive discussions about how our capabilities can improve project economics. In this sustained low commodity price environment, the need to drive productivity is critical for our customers. Our new company has taken its first steps and our message of partnership along the value chain is clearly resonating. From upstream to downstream, we provide our customers a broad offering of solutions.We are also driving a culture of safety for our customers, our employees, and everybody else involved in our operations. We have implemented the Perfect HSE Day process. As you know, in our first quarter as a combined company, we have already had to deal with a number of challenging environmental events, such as Hurricane Harvey, Irma and others. Our thoughts go out to all those who were affected by these events, including many of our employees.Turning to this morning's discussion, I will cover three topics. First I will give a brief overview of our operational results in the quarter. Second, I will share our perspective of the industry and the market dynamics in our key segments, and highlight some of the key achievements of the quarter. Finally, I will give you some more detailed reports on the new company and the integration. Brian will then review our financial results in more detail before we open the call for questions.In the third quarter, we delivered $5.7 billion in orders, and $5.4 billion in revenues. We saw sequential revenue growth in our shorter-cycle businesses, and declines in our long-cycle businesses, consistent with the view we have shared with you previously. Adjusted operating income was $240 million. We continue to see improved margin performance in our oilfield service business, partially offset by challenges in our longer-cycle businesses, particularly in our oilfield equipment segment.Earnings per share were negative $0.24 and adjusted EPS was $0.05. While I am pleased with the positive orders results this quarter, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to improve operating margins and cash generation. Synergy execution is a critical component of that. Our synergy plans are fully in place now and the teams are executing on them. Further, in our first 90 days of operations, we have identified additional opportunities to improve productivity in the company and simplifying and reduce costs in our operating structure. We are positioning the company for higher growth and profitability. We know where we have to focus to deliver on our commitments. Now it's up to us to execute.Brian will go through the detail of the financial results, but I want to spend a few minutes on what we're seeing in the marketplace. In our oilfield services segment, we continue to see growth driven by our well construction business lines in North America. While North American rig count is more than 40% up year-to-date, we saw a deceleration in the quarter with the U.S. land rig count up 6% versus the second quarter.While customers in North America are generally quite positive about the outlook, we expect activity to stay flat through the end of the year until the market has better line of sight into 2018 budgets and operators production hedge positions. We continue to believe that our advanced drilling capabilities will differentiate us in the marketplace where industrial well construction practices and service intensity per well continue to increase.Our drilling services and drill bits businesses outpace rig count growth in North America in the third quarter. With our AutoTrak Curve, high build rotary steerable system, Talon high-efficiency PDC drill bits, [ Taylor ] drilling fluids and enhanced solids removal techniques, we have helped operators reduce well costs and improve performance, particularly in the Marcellus and Utica. We delivered a total of 100 wells where more than a mile of footage was drilled in a 24-hour period. This speaks to how far we have raised the bar in the industrial well construction arena in North America where our rates of penetration metrics in drilling can now be quoted in miles per day rather than in feet per hour.With the long laterals now the norm in every basin and longer more complex laterals being planned by our customers, our drilling services business is positioned for growth in the coming quarters as these more challenging drilling horizon come into play. International activity in oilfield services remains muted with rig count flat year-to-date. However, we are seeing signs of activity increase both in the volume and size of tenders for new work as customers feel more confident about their operating costs and commodity price stability. To that point we were awarded a large multi-year integrated drilling contract with an important customer in the Middle East as well as two critical deepwater completion contracts in Latin America offshore.In our oilfield equipment segment, the subsea market continues to be very challenging. Activity remains low and prices continue to be pressured. We expect three awards in 2017 to be 150 to a 170, up significantly versus 2016, but still 70% below peak level seen in 2013. As we previously communicated, we had a significant win in the quarter to support the Zohr Gas Field. The win is a result of a productivity initiative using our digital tools across our design and manufacturing process to deliver the most cost-competitive products in the subsea market.Our cost out efforts and ability to develop local content were critical in securing the award and being part of Egypt's energy future. During the quarter we also announced what is the first demonstration of our ability to generate value for our customers through a full stream offering. The agreement executed with Twinza Oil will provide support for an offshore development project in Papua New Guinea.This business model is an exciting development for the industry where the combination of capability between our oilfield equipment, oilfield services and turbo machinery segments can provide a unique high-productivity value proposition for our customers and commercial differentiation. Despite these successes in the quarter, we continue to expect the subsea market to be very challenging in the short term with little sign of any significant recovery in 2018.In our Turbomachinery segment, the LNG market continues to be oversupplied in the near term and with gas prices pressured in most markets. The long-term value proposition for LNG remains positive and we have an industry-leading portfolio in this segment with unsurpassed manufacturing and services capabilities. Opportunities for growth in the short to midterm exists across the broader midstream and downstream segments in which we participate. These include gas to power projects, stranded gas monetization, pipelines and surface compression to name a few. Many of these applications require a range of Turbomachinery equipment that is fit for purpose in terms of both cost and function.To better serve this market, we have been expanding our NovaLT equipment application to serve anything from traditional oil and gas segments to the industrial sector. I am pleased to say that earlier this year we secured a contract to supply a cogeneration power plant with our 16.5 megawatt NovaLT gas turbine generator. The plant will deliver electricity to our customer's facility in Malaysia and apply a waste heat recovery process. This innovative approach will help increase energy efficiency and lower CO2 emissions by 54,000 tons per year.In refining, large complex refineries should gain an advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape. However, costs and refining margins continue to move some projects [indiscernible]. In the quarter we won a critical contract in the Middle East to provide 7 compression trains enabling a refinery plant to produce cleaner energy.In petrochemicals we see healthy end-market demand. Cost advantage supply bases continue to drive projects forward particularly in North America and the Middle East. Earlier this year we won a deal to supply 3 large steam turbine-driven compressors for an ethylene production plant in North America.In the Digital Solutions segment, we see end markets for our measurement and controls based portfolio slowly returning to growth. Non-oil and gas end markets continue to be robust, driven by aviation and industrials. Oil and gas end markets are beginning to stabilize and we expect them to return to growth over the medium term.Our digital offerings in software and digital services continued to gain traction in the marketplace. And in the quarter we secured our largest ever award of approximately $300 million from an important international customer. This long-term award includes a holistic asset performance management solution based on the GE Predix platform.In the third quarter we went live with our plant operations advisory program with BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Our technology is performing 25 million calculations a day and together with our customer we're focused on reducing nonproductive time. Almost all of our customers are either evaluating or applying new solutions in this emerging digital space, and I believe we are uniquely positioned from a portfolio perspective help them make step changes in productivity for their businesses.Lastly on integration, we have made significant progress over the first quarter as a combined company. The organization is in place and all leadership positions have been [indiscernible]. We have trained over 15,000 employees on changes impacting and their roles in the new company. We had personal touch points with over 90% of our customers in the first 2 weeks after closing and in early September we went live with our fully-integrated commercial platform. I've personally had the opportunity to engage with many of our most important customers around the globe and continue to update them regularly.As you know, cost actions are underway as well. We are taking restructuring actions wherever it is necessary. We successfully consolidated over 20 facilities in the quarter and initiated an additional 40 for completion by the end of the year. Overall, I feel we've made an incredible amount of progress in the third quarter. I feel good about achieving the synergy targets we laid out. We are still in the early days and just recently had our 100-day anniversary. We are on track and what I have seen so far is highly encouraging.With that let me turn the call over to Brian to go through our financial results."

We had a strong orders quarter at $5.7 billion which is up 2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, the increase in orders was driven by our shorter-cycle segments, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions as activity picked up in North America as well as the Middle East. This increase was partially offset by headwinds in our long-cycle businesses with Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment down 11% and 5% respectively. The declines in these businesses were driven by strong comparisons in the second quarter and continued delays in customer spending.Year-over-year, total orders grew 18%, albeit off a low base in the third quarter of 2016, and all of our segments showed growth. Backlog increased from $20.6 billion to $20.9 billion in the quarter. Both equipment and service backlog grew. Equipment backlog ended at $5.7 billion. The third quarter was the first quarter in over 6 quarters where our equipment backlog grew sequentially. Equipment book-to-bill was 1.1, marking this as the second straight quarter with a positive book-to-bill ratio. Service backlog was $15.2 billion and increased 1% sequentially.Revenue for this quarter was $5.4 billion which was down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Versus last quarter, our short-cycle businesses, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions were up, driven by activity increases in both North America and the Middle East. We saw sequential declines in our longer-cycle businesses, Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment as a result of lower 2016 order intake which drove a lower opening backlog. Year-over-year, the revenue increases in Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery were offset by the significant decline in Oilfield Equipment.Operating loss in the quarter was $122 million. On an adjusted basis, we delivered $240 million of operating income. This excludes net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $203 million, as well as merger and related cost of $159 million. Adjusted operating income was up 105% sequentially. As a reminder, when comparing our sequential results, we called out for nonrecurring charges in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we had higher amortization expenses due to the impact from purchase accounting.Even when adjusting for those items, operating income was up significantly, driven by strength in Oilfield Services, Digital Solutions and Turbomachinery, partially offset by continued softness in Oilfield Equipment. Included in our reported and adjusted operating income is a negative impact of approximately $15 million as a result of supply chain driven delays caused by Hurricane Harvey. We expect the majority of that to come back to us in the fourth quarter.Year-over-year operating income was down 13%. The increase in Oilfield Services was more than offset by declines in the other segments.Next up over taxes. Tax expense for the quarter was $93 million. While we were in an overall net loss position for the quarter, we generated income outside the U.S. and losses within the U.S., primarily due to the restructuring actions that we have taken. Our foreign income was taxed, but because we have been in a net loss position within the U.S. for a period of time, we were unable to deduct these losses, thus driving the overall higher tax expense.As we start to generate earnings in the U.S. over time, we expect to benefit from the valuation allowances built up, including the ones in this quarter. For 4Q, we expect taxes to follow a similar profile to this quarter.Loss per share for the third quarter was $0.24. On an adjusted basis, third quarter earnings per share were $0.05. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $405 million. While we had anticipated a significant outflow from merger and restructuring-related activities, this quarter's performance was below our expectations.First, let me give you some details and then I will give you some insights into how we're going to run things differently going forward. As I said, merger and restructuring-related items had a significant negative impact of approximately $400 million in the quarter. This was driven by accelerated incentive compensation payment as well as a lease buyout that were both triggered by the merger. We had a significant amount of restructuring and severance payments as we execute to achieve our synergy targets. In addition, we have a negative impact of approximately $200 million from the continued reduction in our receivables factoring programs.Operationally, both accounts receivable and inventory performance were below our expectations and were mainly driven by our Oilfield Services business. While some of that miss might be attributable to distraction from the integration, we are expecting significantly better performance in the next quarters from the team. We have dedicated a senior leader to build out operational processes to deliver on our commitment of improved cash conversion. In addition, we are integrating both reporting and operating mechanisms to drive more visibility into cash flow. We expect fourth quarter operational free cash flow generation to be markedly better than in the third quarter.Next I walk to the segment results. In Oilfield Services, the market continues to improve in North America, though we saw a deceleration in growth versus the second quarter and the rig count flattening since the end of July. International activity remains muted. In selected markets we are seeing some signs of activity increases though. The Oilfield Services business delivered a solid quarter. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 4% sequentially. This quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by the well construction product lines, particularly in North America land and in the Middle East.The Completions business delivered double-digit growth sequentially with solid gains in Saudi Arabia, the Permian and the Rockies. As Lorenzo mentioned revenue growth for the drilling services and drill bits business outpaced rig count growth in North America.Regionally increased activity in North America and the Middle East are of higher volume. Revenues for North America were $1 billion, up 5% sequentially driven by the onshore well construction business. Drilling Services, drill bits, wire line and Completions all delivered double-digit sequential growth. Internationally revenue was $1.6 billion, up 3% sequentially driven by the Middle East as the well construction product lines delivered solid growth in a flat rig count environment. Outside the Middle East new growth in Asia driven by Completions and Artificial Lift businesses and growth in Europe with Drilling Services, drill bits and pressure pumping. These gains were partially offset by declines in both Latin America and sub-Sahara Africa.Operating income was $75 million, up $48 million sequentially and $150 million year-over-year. The operating income for the quarter includes approximately $35 million of additional amortization as a result of purchase accounting. Despite this, the business delivered strong incremental margin. The increase in operating income is primarily driven by higher volume; cost out efforts; a favorable mix partially offset by Hurricane Harvey impact which primarily was in the chemicals and Completions business.In the near term, we expect the business to continue to perform in line with the markets in which we operate. We view current market dynamics as favorable for our Drilling Services and drill bits businesses as customers continue to drill complicated laterals, and for our Completions business as North American operators begin to work down that drilled but uncompleted inventory. As we continue to ramp up our synergy programs, we expect to drive additional operating margin leverage in the business.Our OFE business, despite top line orders growth, continues to operate in a very difficult environment. As Lorenzo mentioned, activity remained at low levels with few signs of significant improvement in the short term. Orders in the quarter were $760 million, up 45% versus last year and the equipment book-to-bill was 1.4 primarily driven by the Zohr win. The team is building on the success from last quarter with the Eni Mozambique win. In addition, orders increased in our flexible pipe systems business which showed continued strength in the Brazilian market. Services orders were also up 3% year-over-year driven by increasing levels of activity in North America for the pressure control business through supporting its installed base.Neil and his OFE team are focused on rebuilding the backlog. Revenue was $600 million, down 28% year-over-year. The decline in revenue was driven by lower subsea production system equipment project backlog, as well as continued market pressure in the rig drilling systems business. We expect the large deals won in 2017 to start generating revenue in 2018.Service revenues were up slightly only partially offsetting the weakness on the equipment revenues. Operating loss was $43 million which was unfavorable year-over-year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted operating income by approximately $30 million. This was mainly driven by the strengthening of the Brazilian reais and the British pound versus the US dollar in the quarter.OFE has manufacturing bases in Brazil and the U.K. and is fulfilling long-term contracts with key customers in sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil. We consider the $30 million impact operational in nature, but do not expect the FX impact to reoccur at the same level going forward. Even excluding the impact of FX, operating income was down year-over-year driven by significant buying pressure and negative cost leverage. In addition, we continue to see pricing headwinds in the pressure control and flexible pipe systems businesses which we're only able to partially offset with productivity and cost out.Overall we think the OFE business will continue to be challenged. We expect to build backlog and compete for key deals. However, as you've seen customer spending in large projects continue to push out. The team has been reducing cost and are prepared to operate in this environment.Now moving to Turbomachinery and Process Solutions, the team delivered solid orders growth of 16% versus the prior year despite continued challenges across its primary markets. Total orders were $1.4 billion in the third quarter and equipment orders were up 79% year-over-year as we signed several large deals for gas compression equipment in the quarter. The gas compression win rate remained strong and actually increased in the quarter.TPS office saw a modest improvement in the offshore business as well as some wins in the onshore business mainly in the Middle East. There were no FIDs for LNG projects in the quarter. Service orders were down 10% year-over-year driven primarily by fewer upgrades as a result of lower customer spending and some softness in the downstream portion of the business. In addition the transactional service business was also down year-over-year.Turbomachinery delivered revenues of $1.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Revenue from equipment was down slightly year-over-year as a result of lower order intake in 2016. Service revenues were up, contractual services, installations and transactional volume were up partially offset by lower activity in our downstream related services. Operating income for Turbomachinery was $210 million, down 19% year-over-year.Our service volume was up. Lower margin rates in our equipment backlog more than offset the positive impact from higher service sales. As the business is executing through a lower margin equipment project mix primarily downstream projects, we expect equipment margins to continue to be at lower levels in the short term. Overall we expect the TPS business to continue its technology leadership and capture market opportunities as they present themselves. In the short term, we expect the headwinds on service orders from customers' spend delays and low LNG orders to continue. Similar to prior years, we expect to see an increase in service volume in the fourth quarter and we are focused on winning more work on the downstream and industrial sides of the business to offset challenges in upstream.Next on Digital Solutions, as a reminder this business operates in a few different end markets across oil and gas, automotive, aerospace and power. While we see some stabilization in the oil and gas end market, major project investments remain low. In the third quarter, the Digital Solutions business delivered orders of $917 million. This was up 43% year-over-year driven by the large Predix deal with an important international customer that Lorenzo mentioned earlier.Excluding this deal orders were down slightly year-over-year. The decline was mainly driven by the condition monitoring product lines, partially offset by growth in other businesses. Regionally we continue to see a slowdown in large EPC projects in the Middle East and Europe partially offset by strength in Latin America. Revenue for Digital Solutions was $629 million, down 2% year-over-year. We saw growth in our inspection technologies business that was more than offset by pipeline in Process Solutions.Operating income was $87 million, down 20% year-over-year, driven by lower margin in the pipeline and Process Solutions business as well as negative mix. Overall we expect Digital Solutions to continue to grow in the fourth quarter in line with the typical seasonality, but of a lower base than the fourth quarter of 2016.With that, Lorenzo, I'll turn it back over to you."

As",430,"Thanks, James, and thanks for recognizing we're just celebrating 100 days into this transaction that we feel is going very well. And maybe just as a backdrop relative to the 3 strategic pillars you mentioned, we remain very focused on what we control. As you look at the external environment, oil inventories are still 20% above their 5-year averages. When you look at the 3 pillars, let's take them one by one to begin with. On growth, you look at the performance during the course of the third quarter, you had drilling services and bits growing and outpaced the rig count growth in North America. We feel good about that. You look at the orders performance sequentially, it's the second quarter in a row where we've got positive orders. You look at a year-over-year performance up 18% on the book-to-bill positive. Critical wins, you look at Zohr which was a key win in Egypt from a subsea perspective, Digital. So we see good traction on the growth side. It's early days, the market remains challenging, but we have definitely focused from a commercial standpoint and getting out there and meeting with the customers has been a key aspect of the first 100 days. And as you noted during the course of the first 2 weeks, we met over 90% of the customers. On margins, key focus here is on the synergies. As you look at integration, it's on track. I mentioned even in September that we're on track with what we've committed to for 2018 relative to the integration and the synergies. You look at the sequential margins performance from a business segment perspective. Brian walked you through that and sequentially 3 of the 4 businesses are showing positive performance. We've got weakness in the OFE segment which again is part of the aspect of subsea and the industry continuing to be delayed in its recovery. You look at the third pillar, cash. As Brian mentioned, it's a area of focus for us. During the course of the quarter, we had one time deal-related items and restructuring. However, from an operational perspective it's an area that we need to continue to focus on. It's one of the key areas I have as a focus on inventory receivables. I'd say we didn't perform where we wanted to in the third quarter and it's something that we've addressed and we've got people acting upon it immediately. So when you look at it, early days, but definitely positive momentum. We've got the team rallied and focused on the key priorities, so thanks, James."

We took down our monetization program that impacted us by about $200 million. But as I said, working capital did come in under our expectations from a cash flow perspective, and that was primarily driven by receivables in the OFS business. We had a little bit of an inventory build as well. So if I look at that going forward, the deal-related cost should definitely be declining here in the fourth quarter and into next year will trail off. We will continue to look at high payback restructuring only as we drive the synergies here. So I'd expect the restructuring costs to continue. And as I mentioned earlier, we have mobilized a team to look at how we can build stronger operating processes to drive better collections, better visibility, not only in OFS, but across the portfolio. So I would definitely expect fourth quarter to be better operationally, some of that seasonality. Others are some of the process changes that we're making here and then less one time items."

As I look into the next couple of quarters, I would expect that to continue that negative mix based on where the backlog is today. But if you look we actually had a book-to-bill of 1 in the quarter, equipment backlog grew. So we're refilling that backlog and that should get better as we progress through the year. On top of that we have seen some headwinds in the transactional services business as operators are really conserving cash and OpEx, and based on what we see later in the year, next year that should turn as well."

If you look at those businesses that are really rig count-driven, drilling services, wire line, drill bit, all up are more than the rig count, strong performance in Completions as well. And if you look at the incrementals here in this quarter, we had really strong growth in drilling services and Completions, and that's where we have higher margins. As Lorenzo and I both mentioned, we see the market flattening and really I don't think in the fourth quarter and drilling services won't be as much as a tailwind, but we do see some pretty strong growth in other product areas where our margins are bit lower. And then we also will have some synergies that should be coming in, in the fourth quarter and then in the next year. So when I put all that together from a mix standpoint, from the market flattening a little bit, I would expect incrementals to be in line with historical averages, but it is something that we're focused on and as we've talked about gaining share here and positioning the products from a cost perspective to drive higher margins."

Lot of good conversations happening with the customers that will enable us -- as we look at the longer term on the gas side we see gas continuing to grow and also LNG returning.

Good morning everyone and welcome to the Baker Hughes, a GE company, Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Brian Worrell.Today's presentation and the earnings release that was issued earlier today can be found on our website at bhge.com. As a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide predictions, forecasts, and other forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. We advise you to review our SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, we believe that using additional non-GAAP financial measures on a combined business basis will enhance the evaluation of the profitability of the company and its ongoing operations. Also reconciliations of operating income and other non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures -- GAAP results can be found in our earnings release and on our website at bhge.com under the Investor Relations section.Because this is the first quarter of operation following our merger, we have prepared financial statements on a combined business basis as if the merger had been completed on January 1, 2016. All prior year and quarter comparisons are to these combined business results.With that I will turn the call over to Lorenzo."

Before we begin with the quarter results, I would like to thank our team for what we have achieved in our first 90 days as a combined company. As we said, this will be a journey. Our current focus is on understanding and improving our core operations as we integrate. I am particularly impressed with the progress and the speed of the integration since the creation of Baker Hughes, a GE company, on July 3rd. The combined business was fully operational on day 1, thanks to the very detailed preparation and planning prior to closing.I am more convinced than ever that the creation of BHGE combined the right companies at the right time. Customer feedback continues to be very positive, and we are having constructive discussions about how our capabilities can improve project economics. In this sustained low commodity price environment, the need to drive productivity is critical for our customers. Our new company has taken its first steps and our message of partnership along the value chain is clearly resonating. From upstream to downstream, we provide our customers a broad offering of solutions.We are also driving a culture of safety for our customers, our employees, and everybody else involved in our operations. We have implemented the Perfect HSE Day process. As you know, in our first quarter as a combined company, we have already had to deal with a number of challenging environmental events, such as Hurricane Harvey, Irma and others. Our thoughts go out to all those who were affected by these events, including many of our employees.Turning to this morning's discussion, I will cover three topics. First I will give a brief overview of our operational results in the quarter. Second, I will share our perspective of the industry and the market dynamics in our key segments, and highlight some of the key achievements of the quarter. Finally, I will give you some more detailed reports on the new company and the integration. Brian will then review our financial results in more detail before we open the call for questions.In the third quarter, we delivered $5.7 billion in orders, and $5.4 billion in revenues. We saw sequential revenue growth in our shorter-cycle businesses, and declines in our long-cycle businesses, consistent with the view we have shared with you previously. Adjusted operating income was $240 million. We continue to see improved margin performance in our oilfield service business, partially offset by challenges in our longer-cycle businesses, particularly in our oilfield equipment segment.Earnings per share were negative $0.24 and adjusted EPS was $0.05. While I am pleased with the positive orders results this quarter, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to improve operating margins and cash generation. Synergy execution is a critical component of that. Our synergy plans are fully in place now and the teams are executing on them. Further, in our first 90 days of operations, we have identified additional opportunities to improve productivity in the company and simplifying and reduce costs in our operating structure. We are positioning the company for higher growth and profitability. We know where we have to focus to deliver on our commitments. Now it's up to us to execute.Brian will go through the detail of the financial results, but I want to spend a few minutes on what we're seeing in the marketplace. In our oilfield services segment, we continue to see growth driven by our well construction business lines in North America. While North American rig count is more than 40% up year-to-date, we saw a deceleration in the quarter with the U.S. land rig count up 6% versus the second quarter.While customers in North America are generally quite positive about the outlook, we expect activity to stay flat through the end of the year until the market has better line of sight into 2018 budgets and operators production hedge positions. We continue to believe that our advanced drilling capabilities will differentiate us in the marketplace where industrial well construction practices and service intensity per well continue to increase.Our drilling services and drill bits businesses outpace rig count growth in North America in the third quarter. With our AutoTrak Curve, high build rotary steerable system, Talon high-efficiency PDC drill bits, [ Taylor ] drilling fluids and enhanced solids removal techniques, we have helped operators reduce well costs and improve performance, particularly in the Marcellus and Utica. We delivered a total of 100 wells where more than a mile of footage was drilled in a 24-hour period. This speaks to how far we have raised the bar in the industrial well construction arena in North America where our rates of penetration metrics in drilling can now be quoted in miles per day rather than in feet per hour.With the long laterals now the norm in every basin and longer more complex laterals being planned by our customers, our drilling services business is positioned for growth in the coming quarters as these more challenging drilling horizon come into play. International activity in oilfield services remains muted with rig count flat year-to-date. However, we are seeing signs of activity increase both in the volume and size of tenders for new work as customers feel more confident about their operating costs and commodity price stability. To that point we were awarded a large multi-year integrated drilling contract with an important customer in the Middle East as well as two critical deepwater completion contracts in Latin America offshore.In our oilfield equipment segment, the subsea market continues to be very challenging. Activity remains low and prices continue to be pressured. We expect three awards in 2017 to be 150 to a 170, up significantly versus 2016, but still 70% below peak level seen in 2013. As we previously communicated, we had a significant win in the quarter to support the Zohr Gas Field. The win is a result of a productivity initiative using our digital tools across our design and manufacturing process to deliver the most cost-competitive products in the subsea market.Our cost out efforts and ability to develop local content were critical in securing the award and being part of Egypt's energy future. During the quarter we also announced what is the first demonstration of our ability to generate value for our customers through a full stream offering. The agreement executed with Twinza Oil will provide support for an offshore development project in Papua New Guinea.This business model is an exciting development for the industry where the combination of capability between our oilfield equipment, oilfield services and turbo machinery segments can provide a unique high-productivity value proposition for our customers and commercial differentiation. Despite these successes in the quarter, we continue to expect the subsea market to be very challenging in the short term with little sign of any significant recovery in 2018.In our Turbomachinery segment, the LNG market continues to be oversupplied in the near term and with gas prices pressured in most markets. The long-term value proposition for LNG remains positive and we have an industry-leading portfolio in this segment with unsurpassed manufacturing and services capabilities. Opportunities for growth in the short to midterm exists across the broader midstream and downstream segments in which we participate. These include gas to power projects, stranded gas monetization, pipelines and surface compression to name a few. Many of these applications require a range of Turbomachinery equipment that is fit for purpose in terms of both cost and function.To better serve this market, we have been expanding our NovaLT equipment application to serve anything from traditional oil and gas segments to the industrial sector. I am pleased to say that earlier this year we secured a contract to supply a cogeneration power plant with our 16.5 megawatt NovaLT gas turbine generator. The plant will deliver electricity to our customer's facility in Malaysia and apply a waste heat recovery process. This innovative approach will help increase energy efficiency and lower CO2 emissions by 54,000 tons per year.In refining, large complex refineries should gain an advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape. However, costs and refining margins continue to move some projects [ to the right ]. In the quarter, we won a critical contract in the Middle East to provide 7 compression trains enabling a refinery plant to produce cleaner energy.In petrochemicals we see healthy end-market demand. Cost advantage supply bases continue to drive projects forward particularly in North America and the Middle East. Earlier this year we won a deal to supply 3 large steam turbine-driven compressors for an ethylene production plant in North America.In the Digital Solutions segment, we see end markets for our measurement and controls based portfolio slowly returning to growth. Non-oil and gas end markets continue to be robust, driven by aviation and industrials. Oil and gas end markets are beginning to stabilize and we expect them to return to growth over the medium term.Our digital offerings in software and digital services continued to gain traction in the marketplace. And in the quarter we secured our largest ever award of approximately $300 million from an important international customer. This long-term award includes a holistic asset performance management solution based on the GE Predix platform.In the third quarter we went live with our plant operations advisory program with BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Our technology is performing 25 million calculations a day and together with our customer we're focused on reducing nonproductive time. Almost all of our customers are either evaluating or applying new solutions in this emerging digital space, and I believe we are uniquely positioned from a portfolio perspective help them make step changes in productivity for their businesses.Lastly on integration, we have made significant progress over the first quarter as a combined company. The organization is in place and all leadership positions have been staffed. We have trained over 15,000 employees on changes impacting and their roles in the new company. We had personal touch points with over 90% of our customers in the first 2 weeks after closing and in early September we went live with our fully-integrated commercial platform. I've personally had the opportunity to engage with many of our most important customers around the globe and continue to update them regularly.As you know, cost actions are underway as well. We are taking restructuring actions wherever it is necessary. We successfully consolidated over 20 facilities in the quarter and initiated an additional 40 for completion by the end of the year. Overall, I feel we've made an incredible amount of progress in the third quarter. I feel good about achieving the synergy targets we laid out. We are still in the early days and just recently had our 100-day anniversary. We are on track and what I have seen so far is highly encouraging.With that let me turn the call over to Brian to go through our financial results."

We had a strong orders quarter at $5.7 billion which is up 2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, the increase in orders was driven by our shorter-cycle segments, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions as activity picked up in North America as well as the Middle East. This increase was partially offset by headwinds in our long-cycle businesses with Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment down 11% and 5% respectively. The declines in these businesses were driven by strong comparisons in the second quarter and continued delays in customer spending.Year-over-year, total orders grew 18%, albeit off a low base in the third quarter of 2016, and all of our segments showed growth. Backlog increased from $20.6 billion to $20.9 billion in the quarter. Both equipment and service backlog grew. Equipment backlog ended at $5.7 billion. The third quarter was the first quarter in over 6 quarters where our equipment backlog grew sequentially. Equipment book-to-bill was 1.1, marking this as the second straight quarter with a positive book-to-bill ratio. Service backlog was $15.2 billion and increased 1% sequentially.Revenue for this quarter was $5.4 billion which was down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Versus last quarter, our short-cycle businesses, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions were up, driven by activity increases in both North America and the Middle East. We saw sequential declines in our longer-cycle businesses, Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment as a result of lower 2016 order intake which drove a lower opening backlog. Year-over-year, the revenue increases in Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery were offset by the significant decline in Oilfield Equipment.Operating loss in the quarter was $122 million. On an adjusted basis, we delivered $240 million of operating income. This excludes net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $203 million, as well as merger and related cost of $159 million. Adjusted operating income was up 105% sequentially. As a reminder, when comparing our sequential results, we called out for nonrecurring charges in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we had higher amortization expenses due to the impact from purchase accounting.Even when adjusting for those items, operating income was up significantly, driven by strength in Oilfield Services, Digital Solutions and Turbomachinery, partially offset by continued softness in Oilfield Equipment. Included in our reported and adjusted operating income is a negative impact of approximately $15 million as a result of supply chain driven delays caused by Hurricane Harvey. We expect the majority of that to come back to us in the fourth quarter.Year-over-year operating income was down 13%. The increase in Oilfield Services was more than offset by declines in the other segments.Next up over taxes. Tax expense for the quarter was $93 million. While we were in an overall net loss position for the quarter, we generated income outside the U.S. and losses within the U.S., primarily due to the restructuring actions that we have taken. Our foreign income was taxed, but because we have been in a net loss position within the U.S. for a period of time, we were unable to deduct these losses, thus driving the overall higher tax expense.As we start to generate earnings in the U.S. over time, we expect to benefit from the valuation allowances built up, including the ones in this quarter. For 4Q, we expect taxes to follow a similar profile to this quarter.Loss per share for the third quarter was $0.24. On an adjusted basis, third quarter earnings per share were $0.05. Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $405 million. While we had anticipated a significant outflow from merger and restructuring-related activities, this quarter's performance was below our expectations.First, let me give you some details and then I will give you some insights into how we're going to run things differently going forward. As I said, merger and restructuring-related items had a significant negative impact of approximately $400 million in the quarter. This was driven by accelerated incentive compensation payment as well as a lease buyout that were both triggered by the merger. We had a significant amount of restructuring and severance payments as we execute to achieve our synergy targets. In addition, we have a negative impact of approximately $200 million from the continued reduction in our receivables factoring programs.Operationally, both accounts receivable and inventory performance were below our expectations and were mainly driven by our Oilfield Services business. While some of that miss might be attributable to distraction from the integration, we are expecting significantly better performance in the next quarters from the team. We have dedicated a senior leader to build out operational processes to deliver on our commitment of improved cash conversion. In addition, we are integrating both reporting and operating mechanisms to drive more visibility into cash flow. We expect fourth quarter operational free cash flow generation to be markedly better than in the third quarter.Next I walk to the segment results. In Oilfield Services, the market continues to improve in North America, though we saw a deceleration in growth versus the second quarter and the rig count flattening since the end of July. International activity remains muted. In selected markets we are seeing some signs of activity increases though. The Oilfield Services business delivered a solid quarter. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 4% sequentially. This quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by the well construction product lines, particularly in North America land and in the Middle East.The Completions business delivered double-digit growth sequentially with solid gains in Saudi Arabia, the Permian and the Rockies. As Lorenzo mentioned revenue growth for the drilling services and drill bits business outpaced rig count growth in North America.Regionally increased activity in North America and the Middle East are of higher volume. Revenues for North America were $1 billion, up 5% sequentially driven by the onshore well construction business. Drilling Services, drill bits, wire line and Completions all delivered double-digit sequential growth. Internationally revenue was $1.6 billion, up 3% sequentially driven by the Middle East as the well construction product lines delivered solid growth in a flat rig count environment. Outside the Middle East new growth in Asia driven by Completions and Artificial Lift businesses and growth in Europe with Drilling Services, drill bits and pressure pumping. These gains were partially offset by declines in both Latin America and sub-Sahara Africa.Operating income was $75 million, up $48 million sequentially and $150 million year-over-year. The operating income for the quarter includes approximately $35 million of additional amortization as a result of purchase accounting. Despite this, the business delivered strong incremental margin. The increase in operating income is primarily driven by higher volume; cost out efforts; a favorable mix partially offset by Hurricane Harvey impact which primarily was in the chemicals and Completions business.In the near term, we expect the business to continue to perform in line with the markets in which we operate. We view current market dynamics as favorable for our Drilling Services and drill bits businesses as customers continue to drill complicated laterals, and for our Completions business as North American operators begin to work down that drilled but uncompleted inventory. As we continue to ramp up our synergy programs, we expect to drive additional operating margin leverage in the business.Our OFE business, despite top line orders growth, continues to operate in a very difficult environment. As Lorenzo mentioned, activity remained at low levels with few signs of significant improvement in the short term. Orders in the quarter were $760 million, up 45% versus last year and the equipment book-to-bill was 1.4 primarily driven by the Zohr win. The team is building on the success from last quarter with the Eni Mozambique win. In addition, orders increased in our flexible pipe systems business which showed continued strength in the Brazilian market. Services orders were also up 3% year-over-year driven by increasing levels of activity in North America for the pressure control business through supporting its installed base.Neil and his OFE team are focused on rebuilding the backlog. Revenue was $600 million, down 28% year-over-year. The decline in revenue was driven by lower subsea production system equipment project backlog, as well as continued market pressure in the rig drilling systems business. We expect the large deals won in 2017 to start generating revenue in 2018.Service revenues were up slightly only partially offsetting the weakness on the equipment revenues. Operating loss was $43 million which was unfavorable year-over-year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted operating income by approximately $30 million. This was mainly driven by the strengthening of the Brazilian reais and the British pound versus the US dollar in the quarter.OFE has manufacturing bases in Brazil and the U.K. and is fulfilling long-term contracts with key customers in sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil. We consider the $30 million impact operational in nature, but do not expect the FX impact to reoccur at the same level going forward. Even excluding the impact of FX, operating income was down year-over-year driven by significant buying pressure and negative cost leverage. In addition, we continue to see pricing headwinds in the pressure control and flexible pipe systems businesses which we're only able to partially offset with productivity and cost out.Overall we think the OFE business will continue to be challenged. We expect to build backlog and compete for key deals. However, as you've seen customer spending in large projects continue to push out. The team has been reducing cost and are prepared to operate in this environment.Now moving to Turbomachinery and Process Solutions, the team delivered solid orders growth of 16% versus the prior year despite continued challenges across its primary markets. Total orders were $1.4 billion in the third quarter and equipment orders were up 79% year-over-year as we signed several large deals for gas compression equipment in the quarter. The gas compression win rate remained strong and actually increased in the quarter.TPS office saw a modest improvement in the offshore business as well as some wins in the onshore business mainly in the Middle East. There were no FIDs for LNG projects in the quarter. Service orders were down 10% year-over-year driven primarily by fewer upgrades as a result of lower customer spending and some softness in the downstream portion of the business. In addition the transactional service business was also down year-over-year.Turbomachinery delivered revenues of $1.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Revenue from equipment was down slightly year-over-year as a result of lower order intake in 2016. Service revenues were up, contractual services, installations and transactional volume were up partially offset by lower activity in our downstream related services. Operating income for Turbomachinery was $210 million, down 19% year-over-year.Our service volume was up. Lower margin rates in our equipment backlog more than offset the positive impact from higher service sales. As the business is executing through a lower margin equipment project mix primarily downstream projects, we expect equipment margins to continue to be at lower levels in the short term. Overall we expect the TPS business to continue its technology leadership and capture market opportunities as they present themselves. In the short term, we expect the headwinds on service orders from customers' spend delays and low LNG orders to continue. Similar to prior years, we expect to see an increase in service volume in the fourth quarter and we are focused on winning more work on the downstream and industrial sides of the business to offset challenges in upstream.Next on Digital Solutions, as a reminder this business operates in a few different end markets across oil and gas, automotive, aerospace and power. While we see some stabilization in the oil and gas end market, major project investments remain low. In the third quarter, the Digital Solutions business delivered orders of $917 million. This was up 43% year-over-year driven by the large Predix deal with an important international customer that Lorenzo mentioned earlier.Excluding this deal orders were down slightly year-over-year. The decline was mainly driven by the condition monitoring product lines, partially offset by growth in other businesses. Regionally we continue to see a slowdown in large EPC projects in the Middle East and Europe partially offset by strength in Latin America. Revenue for Digital Solutions was $629 million, down 2% year-over-year. We saw growth in our inspection technologies business that was more than offset by pipeline in Process Solutions.Operating income was $87 million, down 20% year-over-year, driven by lower margin in the pipeline and Process Solutions business as well as negative mix. Overall we expect Digital Solutions to continue to grow in the fourth quarter in line with the typical seasonality, but of a lower base than the fourth quarter of 2016.With that, Lorenzo, I'll turn it back over to you."

And maybe just as a backdrop relative to the 3 strategic pillars you mentioned, we remain very focused on what we control. As you look at the external environment, oil inventories are still 20% above their 5-year averages. When you look at the 3 pillars, let's take them one by one to begin with. On growth, you look at the performance during the course of the third quarter, you had drilling services and bits growing and outpaced the rig count growth in North America. We feel good about that. You look at the orders performance sequentially, it's the second quarter in a row where we've got positive orders. You look at a year-over-year performance up 18% on the book-to-bill positive. Critical wins, you look at Zohr which was a key win in Egypt from a subsea perspective, Digital. So we see good traction on the growth side. It's early days, the market remains challenging, but we have definitely focused from a commercial standpoint and getting out there and meeting with the customers has been a key aspect of the first 100 days. And as you noted during the course of the first 2 weeks, we met over 90% of the customers. On margins, key focus here is on the synergies. As you look at integration, it's on track. I mentioned even in September that we're on track with what we've committed to for 2018 relative to the integration and the synergies. You look at the sequential margins performance from a business segment perspective. Brian walked you through that and sequentially 3 of the 4 businesses are showing positive performance. We've got weakness in the OFE segment which again is part of the aspect of subsea and the industry continuing to be delayed in its recovery. You look at the third pillar, cash. As Brian mentioned, it's a area of focus for us. During the course of the quarter, we had one time deal-related items and restructuring. However, from an operational perspective it's an area that we need to continue to focus on. It's one of the key areas I have as a focus on inventory receivables. I'd say we didn't perform where we wanted to in the third quarter and it's something that we've addressed and we've got people acting upon it immediately. So when you look at it, early days, but definitely positive momentum. We've got the team rallied and focused on the key priorities, so thanks, James."

Could you, for example, get without any improvement in subsea [indiscernible]? Could you get the equipment business into a profitable state as you think in the -- if you could run through some of the initiatives?

We took down our monetization program that impacted us by about $200 million. But as I said, working capital did come in under our expectations from a cash flow perspective, and that was primarily driven by receivables in the OFS business. We had a little bit of an inventory build as well. So if I look at that going forward, the deal-related cost should definitely be declining here in the fourth quarter and into next year will trail off. We will continue to look at high payback restructuring only as we drive the synergies here. So I'd expect the restructuring costs to continue. And as I mentioned earlier, we have mobilized a team to look at how we can build stronger operating processes to drive better collections, better visibility, not only in OFS, but across the portfolio. So I would definitely expect fourth quarter to be better operationally, some of that seasonality. Others are some of the process changes that we're making here and then less one time items."

And then TPS is poised to grow in the fourth quarter as well as we look at the backlog of equipment as well as services. And we've got a lot of productivity lined up for that business as well. So those are the big drivers and then synergies will start to ramp albeit off of a lower base this quarter, we should see some improvements there in synergies."

Calling a bottom, Neil and the team have really been focused on going after deals that make sense for us, and they've been taking a lot of cost out to deal with this volume decline. So we feel good about the cost position. They're working hard to drive profitability as we rebuild the backlog, but I do think they'll continue to be challenged. So I wouldn't expect other than this FX item any appreciable increase in margin rates here as we look for the next few quarters."

As we look at the OFS business, we continue to see activity ramping up in North America and the Middle East along with some recovery in the other international markets when you look at also the North Sea, Latin America. So in 2018 even though North America has decelerated, you should still see some momentum there. On OFE, we see that continuing to be pressured at this moment in time. We should have better orders performance in 2018, but actually the revenue side continuing to be pressured. TPS, we mentioned orders being positive in 2018 and also from a revenues perspective, we should start to see the offshore onshore production, the downstream area. So if you look at FID, activity picking up, but we should see revenues essentially improving there and our D.S. business, you look at again improving there relative to the elements outside of also oil and gas from an aviation and industrial perspective. So really 3 out the 4 business segments seeing an opportunity here from revenue which help us in 2018 and that's sort of the landscape when you break it down by business segment."

Before we begin with the quarter results, I would like to thank our team for what we have achieved in our first 90 days as a combined company. As we said, this will be a journey. Our current focus is on understanding and improving our core operations as we integrate. I am particularly impressed with the progress and the speed of the integration since the creation of Baker Hughes, a GE Company on July 3. The combined business was fully operational on day 1. Thanks to the very detailed preparation and planning prior to closing. I am more convinced than ever that the creation of BHGE combined the right companies at the right time. Customer feedback continues to be very positive, and we are having constructive discussions about how our capabilities can improve project economics.
In this sustained low commodity price environment, the need to drive productivity is critical for our customers. Our new company has taken its first steps, and our message of partnership along the value chain is clearly resonating. From upstream to downstream, we provide our customers a broad offering of solutions. We are also driving a culture of safety for our customers, our employees and everybody else involved in our operations. We have implemented the Perfect HSE Day process. As you know, in our first quarter, as a combined company, we have already have to deal with a number of challenging environmental events such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and others. Our thoughts go out to all those who were affected by these events, including many of our employees.
Turning to this morning's discussion, I will cover 3 topics. First, I will give a brief overview of our operational results in the quarter. Second, I will share our perspective of the industry and the market dynamics in our key segments and highlight some of the key achievements of the quarter. Finally, I will give you some more detailed reports of the new company and the integration. Brian will then review our financial results in more detail before we open the call for questions.
In the first quarter, we delivered $5.7 billion in orders and $5.4 billion in revenues. We saw a sequential revenue growth in our shorter-cycle businesses and declines in our longer-cycle businesses, consistent with the view we have shared with you previously. Adjusted operating income was $240 million. We continue to see improved margin performance in our Oilfield Service business, partially offset by challenges in our longer-cycle businesses, particularly in our Oilfield Equipment segment. Earnings per share were negative $0.24 and adjusted EPS was $0.05.
While I am pleased with the positive orders results this quarter, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to improve operating margins and cash generation. Synergy execution is a critical component of that. Our synergy plans are fully in place now and the teams are executing on them. Further, in our first 90 days of operations, we have identified additional opportunities to improve productivity in the company and simplifying and reduced costs in our operating structure.
We are positioning the company for higher growth and profitability. We know where we have to focus to deliver on our commitments. Now it's up to us to execute. Brian will go through the detail of the financial results, but I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace.
In our Oilfield Services segment, we continue to see growth driven by our well construction business lines in North America. While North American rig count is more than 40% up year-to-date, we saw a deceleration in the quarter with the U.S. land rig count up 6% versus the second quarter. While customers in North America are generally quite positive about the outlook, we expect activity to stay flat through the end of the year until the market has better line of sight into 2018 budgets and operators production hedge positions.
We continue to believe that our advanced drilling capabilities will differentiate us in the marketplace, where industrial well construction practices and servicing intensity per well continue to increase. Our drilling services and drill bits businesses outpaced rig count growth in North America in the third quarter.
With our AutoTrak Curve high-build rotary steerable system, Talon high-efficiency PDC drill bits, tailored drilling fluids and enhanced solids removal techniques, we have helped operators reduce well costs and improve performance, particularly in the Marcellus and Utica. We delivered a total of 100 wells, where more than a mile of footage was drilled in a 24-hour period. This speaks to how far we have raised the bar in the industrial well construction arena in North America, where our rates of penetration metrics in drilling can now be quoted in miles per day rather than in feet per hour. With the long laterals now the norm in every basin and longer more complex laterals being planned by our customers, our Drilling Services business is positioned for grow in the coming quarters as these more challenging drilling horizons come into play.
International activity in Oilfield Services remains muted with rig count flat year-to-date. However, we are seeing signs of activity increase, both in the volume and size of tenders for new work as customers feel more confident about their operating costs and commodity price stability. To that point, we were awarded a large multiyear integrated drilling contract with an important customer in the Middle East as well as 2 critical deepwater completion contracts in Latin America Offshore.
In our Oilfield Equipment segment, the subsea market continues to be very challenging. Activity remains low and prices continue to be pressured. We expect 3 awards in 2017 to be 150 to 170, up significantly versus 2016, but still 70% below peak levels seen in 2013. As we previously communicated, we had a significant win in the quarter to support this Zohr Gas Field. The win is a result of a productivity initiative using our digital tools across our design and manufacturing process to deliver the most cost-competitive products in the subsea market. Our cross-sell assets and ability to develop local content were critical in securing the award and being part of Egypt's energy future.
During the quarter, we also announced what is the first demonstration of our ability to generate value for our customers through our fullstream offering. The agreement executed with Twinza Oil will provide support for an offshore development project in Papua New Guinea. This business model is an exciting development for the industry, where the combination of capability between our Oilfield Equipment, Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery segments can provide a unique, high-productivity value proposition for our customers and commercial differentiation.
Despite these successes in the quarter, we continue to expect the subsea market to be very challenged in the short term with little sign of any significant recovery in 2018.
In our Turbomachinery segment, the LNG market continues to be oversupplied in the near term and with gas prices pressured in most markets. The long-term value proposition for LNG remains positive, and we have an industry-leading portfolio in this segment with unsurpassed manufacturing and services capabilities. Opportunities for growth in the short to midterm exists across the broader midstream and downstream segments in which we participate. These include gas to power projects, stranded gas monetization, pipeline and surface compression to name a few. Many of these applications require a range of turbomachinery equipment that is fit for purpose in terms of both cost and function.
To better serve this market, we have been expanding our NovaLT equipment application to serve anything from traditional oil and gas segments to the industrial sector. I am pleased to say that earlier this year, we secured a contract to supply a cogeneration power plant with our 16.5-megawatt NovaLT gas turbine generator. The plant will deliver electricity to our customers' facility in Malaysia and apply a [ waste ] recovery process. This innovative approach will help increase energy efficiency and lower CO2 emissions by 54,000 tons per year.
In refining, large complex refinery should gain an advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape. However, costs and refining margins continue to move some projects to the right. In the quarter, we won a critical contract in the Middle East to provide 7 compression trains, enabling our refinery plants to produce cleaner energy.
In petrochemicals, we see healthy end-market demand. Cost advantaged supply bases continue to drive projects forward, particularly in North America and the Middle East. Earlier this year, we won a deal to supply 3 large steam turbine-driven compressors for an ethylene production plant in North America.
In the Digital Solutions segment, we see end markets for our measurement and controls-based portfolio slowly returning to growth. Nonoil and gas end markets continue to be robust, driven by aviation and industrials. Oil and gas end markets are beginning to stabilize, and we expect them to return to growth over the medium term.
Our digital offerings in software and digital services continue to gain traction in the marketplace. And in the quarter, we secured our largest ever award of approximately $300 million from an important international customer. This long-term award includes a holistic asset performance management solution based on the GE Predix platform.
In the third quarter, we went live with our plant operations advisory program with BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Our technology is performing 25 million calculations a day. And together with our customer, we're focused on reducing nonproductive time. Almost all of our customers are either evaluating or applying new solutions in this emerging digital space. And I believe we are uniquely positioned from a portfolio perspective to help them make step changes in productivity for their businesses.
Lastly on integration, we have made significant progress over the first quarter as a combined company. The organization is in place and all leadership positions have been staffed. We have trained over 15,000 employees on changes impacting and their roles in the new company. We had personal touchpoints with over 90% of our customers in the first 2 weeks after closing. And in early September, we went live with our fully integrated commercial platform. I've personally had the opportunity to engage with many of our most important customers around the globe and continue to update them regularly. As you know, cost actions are underway as well. We are taking restructuring actions wherever it is necessary. We successfully consolidated over 20 facilities in the quarter and initiated an additional 40 for completion by the end of the year.
Overall, I feel we've made an incredible amount of progress in the third quarter. I feel good about achieving the synergy targets we laid out. We are still in the early days and just recently had our 100th-day anniversary. We are on track and what I have seen so far is highly encouraging.
With that, let me turn the call over to Brian to go through our financial results."

We had a strong orders quarter at $5.7 billion, which is up 2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, the increase in orders was driven by our shorter-cycle segments, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions, as activity picked up in North America as well as the Middle East. This increase was partially offset by headwinds in our long-cycle businesses with Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment down 11% and 5%, respectively. The declines in these businesses were driven by strong comparisons in the second quarter and continued delays in customer spending. Year-over-year, total orders grew 18%, albeit off a low base in the third quarter of 2016, and all of our segments showed growth.
Backlog increased from $20.6 billion to $20.9 billion in the quarter. Both equipment and service backlog grew. Equipment backlog ended at $5.7 billion. The third quarter was the first quarter in over 6 quarters where our equipment backlog grew sequentially. Equipment book-to-bill was 1.1, marking this as the second straight quarter with a positive book-to-bill ratio. Service backlog was $15.2 billion and increased 1% sequentially.
Revenue for this quarter was $5.4 billion, which was down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Versus last quarter, our short-cycle businesses, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions were up, driven by activity increases in both North America and the Middle East. We saw sequential declines in our longer-cycle businesses, Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment as a result of lower 2016 order intake, which drove a lower opening backlog. Year-over-year, the revenue increases in Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery were offset by the significant decline in Oilfield Equipment.
Operating loss in the quarter was $122 million. On an adjusted basis, we delivered $240 million of operating income. This excludes net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $203 million as well as merger and related costs of $159 million. Adjusted operating income was up 105% sequentially. As a reminder, when comparing our sequential results, we called out some nonrecurring charges in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we had higher amortization expenses due to the impact from purchase accounting. Even when adjusting for those items, operating income was up significantly, driven by strength in Oilfield Services, Digital Solutions and Turbomachinery, partially offset by continued softness in Oilfield Equipment. Included in our reported and adjusted operating income is a negative impact of approximately $15 million as a result of supply chain-driven delays caused by Hurricane Harvey. We expect the majority of that to come back to us in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, operating income was down 13%. The increase in Oilfield Services was more than offset by declines in the other segments.
Next up, our taxes. Tax expense for the quarter was $93 million. While we were in an overall net loss position for the quarter, we generated income outside the U.S. and losses within the U.S. primarily due to the restructuring actions that we have taken. Our foreign income was taxed, but because we have been in a net loss position within the U.S. for a period of time, we were unable to deduct these losses, thus driving the overall higher tax expense. As we start to generate to earnings in the U.S. over time, we expect to benefit from the valuation allowances built up, including the ones from this quarter. For 4Q, we expect taxes to follow a similar profile to this quarter.
Loss per share for the third quarter was $0.24. On an adjusted basis, third quarter earnings per share were $0.05.
Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $405 million. While we had anticipated a significant outflow for merger and restructuring-related activities, this quarter's performance was below our expectations.
First, let me give you some details and then I will give you some insights into how we're going to run things differently going forward. As I said, merger and restructuring-related items had a significant negative impact of approximately $400 million in the quarter. This was driven by accelerated incentive compensation payments as well as a lease buyout that were both triggered by the merger. We had a significant amount of restructuring and severance payments as we execute to achieve our synergy targets. In addition, we have a negative impact of approximately $200 million from the continued reduction in our receivables factoring programs.
Operationally, both accounts receivable and inventory performance were below our expectations and were mainly driven by our Oilfield Services business. While some of that miss might be attributable to distraction from the integration, we are expecting significantly better performance in the next quarters from the team. We've dedicated a senior leader to build out operational processes to deliver on our commitment of improved cash conversion. In addition, we are integrating both reporting and operating mechanisms to drive more visibility into cash flow. We expect fourth quarter operational free cash flow generation to be markedly better than in the third quarter.
Next, I'll walk to the segment results. In Oilfield Services, the market continues to improve in North America, though we saw a deceleration in growth versus the second quarter and the rig count flattening since the end of July. International activity remains muted. In selected markets, we are seeing some signs of activity increases though. The Oilfield Services business delivered a solid quarter. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 4% sequentially. This quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by the well construction product lines, particularly in North America land and in the Middle East. The Completions business delivered double-digit growth sequentially with solid gains in Saudi Arabia, the Permian and the Rockies. As Lorenzo mentioned, revenue growth for the drilling services and the drill bits business outpaced rig count growth in North America. Regionally, increased activity in North America and the Middle East drove higher volume. Revenues for North America were $1 billion, up 5% sequentially, driven by the onshore well construction business. Drilling Services, drill bits, wireline and Completions all delivered double-digit sequential growth.
Internationally, revenue was $1.6 billion, up 3% sequentially, driven by the Middle East as the well construction credit lines delivered solid growth in a flat rig count environment. Outside the Middle East, we saw revenue growth in Asia driven by Completions and Artificial Lift businesses and growth in Europe with Drilling Services, drill bits and pressure pumping. These gains were partially offset by declines in both Latin America and Sub-Sahara Africa. Operating income was $75 million, up $48 million sequentially and $115 million year-over-year. The operating income for the quarter includes approximately $35 million of additional amortization as a result of purchase accounting. Despite this, the business delivered strong incremental margins. The increase in operating income is primarily driven by higher volume, cost-out efforts, favorable mix partially offset by Hurricane Harvey impact, which primarily was in the chemicals and Completions business.
In the near term, we expect the business to continue to perform in line with the markets in which we operate. We view current market dynamics is favorable for our Drilling Services and the drill bits businesses as customers continue to drill complicated laterals. And for our Completions businesses, North American operators begin to work down that drill bit uncompleted inventory. As we continue to ramp up our synergy programs, we expect to drive additional operating margin leverage in the business.
Our OFE business, despite top line orders growth, continues to operate in a very difficult environment. As Lorenzo mentioned, activity remains at low levels, with few signs of significant improvement in the short term. Orders in the quarter were $760 million, up 45% versus last year and the equipment book-to-bill was 1.4, primarily driven by Zohr win. The team is building on the success from last quarter with the Eni, Mozambique win. In addition, orders increased in our flexible pipe systems business, which showed continued strength in the Brazilian market. Services orders were also up 3% year-over-year, driven by increasing levels of activity in North America for the pressure control business through supporting its installed base. Neil and his OFE team are focused on rebuilding the backlog.
Revenue was $600 million, down 28% year-over-year. The decline in revenue was driven by lower Subsea Production System equipment project backlog, as well as continued market pressure in the rig drilling systems business. We expect the large deals won in 2017 to start generating revenue in 2018. Service revenues were up slightly, only partially offsetting the weakness on the equipment revenues. Operating loss was $43 million, which was unfavorable year-over-year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted operating income by approximately $30 million. This was mainly driven by the strengthening of the Brazilian reais and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar in the quarter. OFE has manufacturing bases in Brazil and the U.K. and is fulfilling long-term contracts with key customers in Sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil. We consider the $30 million impact operational in nature, but do not expect the FX impact to reoccur at the same level going forward. Even excluding the impact of FX, operating income was down year-over-year, driven by significant volume pressure and negative cost leverage. In addition, we continue to see pricing headwinds in the pressure control and flexible pipe systems businesses, which were only able to partially offset with productivity and cost out.
Overall, we think the OFE business will continue to be challenged. We expect to build backlog and compete for key deals. However, as you've seen, customer spending in large projects continue to push out. The team has been reducing costs and are prepared to operate in this environment.
Now moving to Turbomachinery & Process Solutions, the team delivered solid orders growth of 16% versus the prior year, despite continued challenges across its primary markets. Total orders were $1.4 billion in the third quarter and equipment orders were up 79% year-over-year as we signed several large deals for gas compression equipment in the quarter. The gas compression win rate remains strong and actually increased in the quarter. TPS also saw modest improvements in the offshore business as well as some wins in the onshore business mainly in the Middle East. There were no FIDs for LNG projects in the quarter. Service orders were down 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by fewer upgrades as a result of lower customer spending and some softness in the downstream portion of the business. In addition, the transactional service business was also down year-over-year.
Turbomachinery delivered revenues of $1.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Revenue from equipment was down slightly year-over-year as a result of lower order intake in 2016. Service revenues were up. Contractual services, installations and transactional volume were up partially offset by lower activity in our downstream-related services. Operating income for Turbomachinery was $210 million, down 19% year-over-year. While service volume was up, lower margin rates in our equipment backlog more than offset the positive impact from higher service sales. As the business is executing through a lower margin equipment project mix, primarily downstream projects, we expect equipment margins to continue to be at lower levels in the short term. Overall, we expect the TPS business to continue its technology leadership and capture market opportunities as they present themselves. In the short term, we expect the headwinds on service orders from customers spend delays and low LNG orders to continue. Similar to prior years, we expect to see an increase in service volume in the fourth quarter, and we are focused on winning more work on the downstream and industrial sides of the business to offset challenges in upstream.
Next on Digital Solutions. As reminder, this business operates in a few different end markets, across oil and gas, automotive, aerospace and power. While we see some stabilization in the oil and gas end market, major project investments remain low. In the third quarter, the Digital Solutions business delivered orders of $917 million. This was up 43% year-over-year, driven by the large Predix deal with an important international customer that Lorenzo mentioned earlier. Excluding this deal, orders were down slightly year-over-year. The decline was mainly driven by the condition monitoring product lines partially offset by growth in other businesses.
Regionally, we continue to see a slowdown in large EPC projects in the Middle East and Europe, partially offset by strength in Latin America. Revenue for Digital Solutions was $629 million, down 2% year-over-year. We saw growth in our Inspection Technologies business, that was more than offset by Pipeline and Process Solutions. Operating income was $87 million, down 20% year-over-year, driven by lower margin in the Pipeline and Process Solutions business as well as negative mix. Overall, we expect Digital Solutions to continue to grow in the fourth quarter, in line with the typical seasonality, but off a lower base than the fourth quarter of 2016.
With that, Lorenzo, I'll turn it back over to you."

We're just celebrating our 100 days into this transaction that we feel is going very well and maybe just as a backdrop relative to the 3 strategic pillars you mentioned. We remain very focused on what we control. As you look at the external environment, oil inventories are still 20% above their 5-year averages. When you look at the 3 pillars, let's take them one by one to begin with. On growth, you look at the performance during the quarter, the third quarter. You had drilling services and bits growing and outpace the rig count growth in North America, we feel good about that. You look at the orders performance sequentially, it's the second quarter in a row where we've got positive orders. You look at the year-over-year performance, up 18%. On the book-to-bill, positive. Critical wins, you look at the Zohr, which is a key win in Egypt from a subsea perspective. Digital. So we see good traction on the growth side, it's early days. The market remains challenging. But we've definitely focused from a commercial standpoint and getting out there and meeting with the customers has been a key aspect of the first 100 days and as you noted, during the course of the first 2 weeks, we met over 90% of the customers. On margins, key focus here is on the synergies. As you look at integration, it's on track. I mentioned even in September that we're on track with what we've committed to for 2018 relative to the integration and the synergies. You look at the sequential margins performance from a business segment perspective, Brian walked you through that and sequentially, 3 of the 4 businesses are showing positive performance. We've got weakness in the OFE segment, which, again, is part of the aspect of subsea and the industry continuing to be delayed in its recovery. You look at the third pillar, cash, as Brian mentioned, it's a key area of focus for us. During the course of the quarter, we had one-time deal-related items and restructuring. However, from an operational perspective, it's an area that we need to continue to focus on. It's one of the key areas I have as a focus on inventory receivables. I'd say, we didn't perform where we wanted to in the third quarter, and it's something that we've addressed and we've got people acting upon it immediately. So when you look at it, early days, but definitely a positive momentum. We've got the team rallied and focused on the key priorities. So thanks, James."

Could you, for example, get without any improvement in subsea which daily will come? Could you get the equipment business into a profitable state as you think?

We took down our monetization program that impacted us by about $200 million. But as I said, working capital did come in under our expectations from a cash flow perspective, and that was primarily driven by receivables in the OFS business. We had a little bit of an inventory build as well. So if I look at that going forward, the deal-related costs should definitely be declining here in the fourth quarter and into next year, we'll trail off. We will continue to look at high payback restructuring only as we drive the synergies here. So I'd expect the restructuring costs to continue. And as I mentioned earlier, we have mobilized the team to look at how we can build stronger operating processes to drive better collections, better visibility, not only in OFS, but across the portfolio. So I would definitely expect fourth quarter to be better operationally, some of that seasonality, others are some of the process changes that we're making here and then less one-time items."

If you take a look dynamics right now in TPS, revenues are up in the quarter 2% and operating is down 19% and service mix was good and was certainly a tailwind, but it was more than offset by margins in equipment as we work through our backlog, which has got some negative mix, primarily driven by the downstream segment, which is not as profitable. As I look into the next couple of quarters, I can -- I would expect that to continue that negative mix based on where the backlog is today. But if you look, we actually had a book-to-bill of 1 in the quarter, equipment backlog grew. So we're refilling that backlog and that should get better as we progress through the year. On top of that, we have seen some headwinds in the transactional services business as operators are really conserving cash and OpEx. And based on what we see, later in the year next year, that should turn as well."

We don't have pressure pumping, and we do have the chemicals business, which is not directly related, obviously, to rig count and what's going on in North America land. If you look at those businesses that are really rig count-driven, drilling services, wireline, drill bits, all up more than the rig count. Strong performance in Completions as well. And if you look at the incremental figure in this quarter, we had really strong growth in Drilling Services and Completions, and that's where we have higher margins. As Lorenzo and I both mentioned, we see the market flattening, and really I don't think, in the fourth quarter, and Drilling Services won't be as much of a tailwind, but we do see some pretty strong growth in other product areas, where our margins are a bit lower. And then we also will have some synergies that should be coming in, in the fourth quarter and then into next year. So when I put all that together, from a mix standpoint, from the market flattening a little bit, I would expect incrementals to be in line with historical averages. But it is something that we're focused on. And as we've talked about gaining share here and positioning the products from a cost perspective to drive higher margins."

So the synergies will come through on the revenue side. We've already indicated that by 2020, there's $400 million of EBITDA revenue synergies. We feel good about those. A lot of good conversations happening with the customers that will enable us. As we look at the longer term, on the gas side, we see gas continuing to grow and also LNG returning. And so when you think about our TPS business, that returning, again, mentioned previously, orders being growing again in 2018. And you look at also the other segments, when you think about the downstream, the refinery, the petrochemicals, the pipelines, and then our Digital Solutions business. As you think about the segment that's outside of also oil and gas, which is more aviation, industrial that continuing to pace with GDP.

We should have better orders performance in 2018, but actually the revenue side continuing to be pressured. TPS, we mentioned orders being positive in 2018. And also from a revenues perspective, we should start to see the offshore, onshore production, the downstream area.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Baker Hughes, a GE Company Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me today are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Brian Worrell. Today's presentation and the earnings release that was issued earlier today can be found on our website at bhge.com.
As a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide predictions, forecasts and other forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. We advise you to review our SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
In addition, we believe that using additional non-GAAP financial measures on a combined business basis will enhance the evaluation of the profitability of the company and its ongoing operations. Also, reconciliations of operating income and other non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, GAAP results, can be found in our earnings release and on our website at bhge.com under the Investor Relations section.
Because this is the first quarter of operations following our merger, we have prepared financial statements on a combined business basis as if the merger had been completed on January 1, 2016. All prior year and quarter comparisons are to these combined business results.
With that, I will turn the call over to Lorenzo."

Before we begin with the quarter results, I would like to thank our team for what we have achieved in our first 90 days as a combined company. As we said, this will be a journey. Our current focus is on understanding and improving our core operations as we integrate. I am particularly impressed with the progress and the speed of the integration since the creation of Baker Hughes, a GE Company on July 3. The combined business was fully operational on day 1. Thanks to the very detailed preparation and planning prior to closing. I am more convinced than ever that the creation of BHGE combined the right companies at the right time. Customer feedback continues to be very positive, and we are having constructive discussions about how our capabilities can improve project economics.
In this sustained, low commodity price environment, the need to drive productivity is critical for our customers. Our new company has taken its first steps, and our message of partnership along the value chain is clearly resonating. From upstream to downstream, we provide our customers a broad offering of solutions. We are also driving a culture of safety for our customers, our employees and everybody else involved in our operations. We have implemented the Perfect HSE Day process. As you know, in our first quarter, as a combined company, we have already have to deal with a number of challenging environmental events such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and others. Our thoughts go out to all those who were affected by these events, including many of our employees.
Turning to this morning's discussion, I will cover 3 topics. First, I will give a brief overview of our operational results in the quarter. Second, I will share our perspective of the industry and the market dynamics in our key segments and highlight some of the key achievements of the quarter. Finally, I will give you some more detailed reports of the new company and the integration. Brian will then review our financial results in more detail before we open the call for questions.
In the first quarter, we delivered $5.7 billion in orders and $5.4 billion in revenues. We saw a sequential revenue growth in our shorter-cycle businesses and declines in our longer-cycle businesses, consistent with the view we have shared with you previously. Adjusted operating income was $240 million. We continue to see improved margin performance in our Oilfield Service business, partially offset by challenges in our longer-cycle businesses, particularly in our Oilfield Equipment segment. Earnings per share were negative $0.24 and adjusted EPS was $0.05.
While I am pleased with the positive orders results this quarter, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to improve operating margins and cash generation. Synergy execution is a critical component of that. Our synergy plans are fully in place now and the teams are executing on them. Further, in our first 90 days of operations, we have identified additional opportunities to improve productivity in the company and simplifying and reduced costs in our operating structure.
We are positioning the company for higher growth and profitability. We know where we have to focus to deliver on our commitments. Now it's up to us to execute. Brian will go through the detail of the financial results, but I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace.
In our Oilfield Services segment, we continue to see growth driven by our well construction business lines in North America. While North American rig count is more than 40% up year-to-date, we saw a deceleration in the quarter with the U.S. land rig count up 6% versus the second quarter. While customers in North America are generally quite positive about the outlook, we expect activity to stay flat through the end of the year until the market has better line of sight into 2018 budgets and operators production hedge positions.
We continue to believe that our advanced drilling capabilities will differentiate us in the marketplace, where industrial well construction practices and servicing intensity per well continue to increase. Our drilling services and drill bits businesses outpaced rig count growth in North America in the third quarter.
With our AutoTrak Curve high-build rotary steerable system, Talon high-efficiency PDC drill bits, tailored drilling fluids and enhanced solids removal techniques, we have helped operators reduce well costs and improve performance, particularly in the Marcellus and Utica. We delivered a total of 100 wells, where more than a mile of footage was drilled in a 24-hour period. This speaks to how far we have raised the bar in the industrial well construction arena in North America, where our rates of penetration metrics in drilling can now be quoted in miles per day rather than in feet per hour. With the long laterals now the norm in every basin and longer more complex laterals being planned by our customers, our Drilling Services business is positioned for grow in the coming quarters as these more challenging drilling horizons come into play.
International activity in Oilfield Services remains muted with rig count flat year-to-date. However, we are seeing signs of activity increase, both in the volume and size of tenders for new work as customers feel more confident about their operating costs and commodity price stability. To that point, we were awarded a large multiyear integrated drilling contract with an important customer in the Middle East as well as 2 critical deepwater completion contracts in Latin America Offshore.
In our Oilfield Equipment segment, the subsea market continues to be very challenging. Activity remains low and prices continue to be pressured. We expect 3 awards in 2017 to be 150 to 170, up significantly versus 2016, but still 70% below peak levels seen in 2013. As we previously communicated, we had a significant win in the quarter to support this Zohr Gas Field. The win is a result of a productivity initiative using our digital tools across our design and manufacturing process to deliver the most cost-competitive products in the subsea market. Our cross-sell assets and ability to develop local content were critical in securing the award and being part of Egypt's energy future.
During the quarter, we also announced what is the first demonstration of our ability to generate value for our customers through our fullstream offering. The agreement executed with Twinza Oil will provide support for an offshore development project in Papua New Guinea. This business model is an exciting development for the industry, where the combination of capability between our Oilfield Equipment, Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery segments can provide a unique, high-productivity value proposition for our customers and commercial differentiation.
Despite these successes in the quarter, we continue to expect the subsea market to be very challenged in the short term with little sign of any significant recovery in 2018.
In our Turbomachinery segment, the LNG market continues to be oversupplied in the near term and with gas prices pressured in most markets. The long-term value proposition for LNG remains positive, and we have an industry-leading portfolio in this segment with unsurpassed manufacturing and services capabilities. Opportunities for growth in the short to midterm exists across the broader midstream and downstream segments in which we participate. These include gas to power projects, stranded gas monetization, pipeline and surface compression to name a few. Many of these applications require a range of turbomachinery equipment that is fit for purpose in terms of both cost and function.
To better serve this market, we have been expanding our NovaLT equipment application to serve anything from traditional oil and gas segments to the industrial sector. I am pleased to say that earlier this year, we secured a contract to supply a cogeneration power plant with our 16.5-megawatt NovaLT gas turbine generator. The plant will deliver electricity to our customers' facility in Malaysia and apply a waste recovery process. This innovative approach will help increase energy efficiency and lower CO2 emissions by 54,000 tons per year.
In refining, large complex refinery should gain an advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape. However, costs and refining margins continue to move some projects to the right. In the quarter, we won a critical contract in the Middle East to provide 7 compression trains, enabling our refinery plants to produce cleaner energy.
In petrochemicals, we see healthy end-market demand. Cost advantaged supply bases continue to drive projects forward, particularly in North America and the Middle East. Earlier this year, we won a deal to supply 3 large steam turbine-driven compressors for an ethylene production plant in North America.
In the Digital Solutions segment, we see end markets for our measurement and controls-based portfolio slowly returning to growth. Nonoil and gas end markets continue to be robust, driven by aviation and industrials. Oil and gas end markets are beginning to stabilize, and we expect them to return to growth over the medium term.
Our digital offerings in software and digital services continue to gain traction in the marketplace. In end of quarter, we secured our largest ever award of approximately $300 million from an important international customer. This long-term award includes a holistic asset performance management solution based on the GE Predix platform.
In the third quarter, we went live with our plant operations advisory program with BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Our technology is performing 25 million calculations a day. And together with our customer, we're focused on reducing nonproductive time. Almost all of our customers are either evaluating or applying new solutions in this emerging digital space. And I believe we are uniquely positioned from a portfolio perspective to help them make step changes in productivity for their businesses.
Lastly on integration, we have made significant progress over the first quarter as a combined company. The organization is in place and all leadership positions have been staffed. We have trained over 15,000 employees on changes impacting and their roles in the new company. We had personal touchpoints with over 90% of our customers in the first 2 weeks after closing. And in early September, we went live with our fully integrated commercial platform. I've personally had the opportunity to engage with many of our most important customers around the globe and continue to update them regularly. As you know, cost actions are underway as well. We are taking restructuring actions wherever it is necessary. We successfully consolidated over 20 facilities in the quarter and initiated an additional 40 for completion by the end of the year.
Overall, I feel we've made an incredible amount of progress in the third quarter. I feel good about achieving the synergy targets we laid out. We are still in the early days and just recently had our 100th-day anniversary. We are on track and what I have seen so far is highly encouraging.
With that, let me turn the call over to Brian to go through our financial results."
425005479,537859692,1316953,"Baker Hughes, a GE company, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2017",2017-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Company","Executives","Thanks, Lorenzo.

Quarter-over-quarter, the increase in orders was driven by",2132,"Thanks, Lorenzo. I'll start with the total company results and then go into the segment details. We had a strong orders quarter at $5.7 billion, which is up 2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, the increase in orders was driven by our shorter-cycle segments, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions, as activity picked up in North America as well as the Middle East. This increase was partially offset by headwinds in our long-cycle businesses with Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment down 11% and 5%, respectively. The declines in these businesses were driven by strong comparisons in the second quarter and continued delays in customer spending. Year-over-year, total orders grew 18%, albeit off a low base in the third quarter of 2016, and all of our segments showed growth.
Backlog increased from $20.6 billion to $20.9 billion in the quarter. Both equipment and service backlog grew. Equipment backlog ended at $5.7 billion. The third quarter was the first quarter in over 6 quarters where our equipment backlog grew sequentially. Equipment book-to-bill was 1.1, marking this as the second straight quarter with a positive book-to-bill ratio. Service backlog was $15.2 billion and increased 1% sequentially.
Revenue for this quarter was $5.4 billion, which was down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Versus last quarter, our short-cycle businesses, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions were up, driven by activity increases in both North America and the Middle East. We saw sequential declines in our longer-cycle businesses, Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment as a result of lower 2016 order intake, which drove a lower opening backlog. Year-over-year, the revenue increases in Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery were offset by the significant decline in Oilfield Equipment.
Operating loss in the quarter was $122 million. On an adjusted basis, we delivered $240 million of operating income. This excludes net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $203 million as well as merger and related costs of $159 million. Adjusted operating income was up 105% sequentially. As a reminder, when comparing our sequential results, we called out some nonrecurring charges in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we had higher amortization expenses due to the impact from purchase accounting. Even when adjusting for those items, operating income was up significantly, driven by strength in Oilfield Services, Digital Solutions and Turbomachinery, partially offset by continued softness in Oilfield Equipment. Included in our reported and adjusted operating income is a negative impact of approximately $15 million as a result of supply chain-driven delays caused by Hurricane Harvey. We expect the majority of that to come back to us in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, operating income was down 13%. The increase in Oilfield Services was more than offset by declines in the other segments.
Next up, our taxes. Tax expense for the quarter was $93 million. While we were in an overall net loss position for the quarter, we generated income outside the U.S. and losses within the U.S. primarily due to the restructuring actions that we have taken. Our foreign income was taxed, but because we have been in a net loss position within the U.S. for a period of time, we were unable to deduct these losses, thus driving the overall higher tax expense. As we start to generate to earnings in the U.S. over time, we expect to benefit from the valuation allowances built up, including the ones from this quarter. For 4Q, we expect taxes to follow a similar profile to this quarter.
Loss per share for the third quarter was $0.24. On an adjusted basis, third quarter earnings per share were $0.05.
Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $405 million. While we had anticipated a significant outflow for merger and restructuring-related activities, this quarter's performance was below our expectations.
First, let me give you some details and then I will give you some insights into how we're going to run things differently going forward. As I said, merger and restructuring-related items had a significant negative impact of approximately $400 million in the quarter. This was driven by accelerated incentive compensation payments as well as a lease buyout that were both triggered by the merger. We had a significant amount of restructuring and severance payments as we execute to achieve our synergy targets. In addition, we had a negative impact of approximately $200 million from the continued reduction in our receivables factoring programs.
Operationally, both accounts receivable and inventory performance were below our expectations and were mainly driven by our Oilfield Services business. While some of that miss might be attributable to distraction from the integration, we are expecting significantly better performance in the next quarters from the team. We've dedicated a senior leader to build out operational processes to deliver on our commitment of improved cash conversion. In addition, we are integrating both reporting and operating mechanisms to drive more visibility into cash flow. We expect fourth quarter operational free cash flow generation to be markedly better than in the third quarter.
Next, I'll walk through the segment results. In Oilfield Services, the market continues to improve in North America, though we saw a deceleration in growth versus the second quarter and the rig count flattening since the end of July. International activity remains muted. In selected markets, we are seeing some signs of activity increases though. The Oilfield Services business delivered a solid quarter. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 4% sequentially. This quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by the well construction product lines, particularly in North America land and in the Middle East. The Completions business delivered double-digit growth sequentially with solid gains in Saudi Arabia, the Permian and the Rockies. As Lorenzo mentioned, revenue growth for the drilling services and the drill bits business outpaced rig count growth in North America. Regionally, increased activity in North America and the Middle East drove higher volume. Revenues for North America were $1 billion, up 5% sequentially, driven by the onshore well construction business. Drilling Services, drill bits, wireline and Completions all delivered double-digit sequential growth.
Internationally, revenue was $1.6 billion, up 3% sequentially, driven by the Middle East as the well construction credit lines delivered solid growth in a flat rig count environment. Outside the Middle East, we saw revenue growth in Asia driven by Completions and Artificial Lift businesses and growth in Europe with Drilling Services, drill bits and pressure pumping. These gains were partially offset by declines in both Latin America and Sub-Sahara Africa. Operating income was $75 million, up $48 million sequentially and $115 million year-over-year. The operating income for the quarter includes approximately $35 million of additional amortization as a result of purchase accounting. Despite this, the business delivered strong incremental margins. The increase in operating income is primarily driven by higher volume, cost-out efforts, favorable mix partially offset by Hurricane Harvey impact, which primarily was in the chemicals and Completions business.
In the near term, we expect the business to continue to perform in line with the markets in which we operate. We view current market dynamics is favorable for our Drilling Services and the drill bits businesses as customers continue to drill complicated laterals. And for our Completions businesses, North American operators begin to work down that drill bit uncompleted inventory. As we continue to ramp up our synergy programs, we expect to drive additional operating margin leverage in the business.
Our OFE business, despite top line orders growth, continues to operate in a very difficult environment. As Lorenzo mentioned, activity remains at low levels, with few signs of significant improvement in the short term. Orders in the quarter were $760 million, up 45% versus last year and the equipment book-to-bill was 1.4, primarily driven by Zohr win. The team is building on the success from last quarter with the Eni, Mozambique win. In addition, orders increased in our flexible pipe systems business, which showed continued strength in the Brazilian market. Services orders were also up 3% year-over-year, driven by increasing levels of activity in North America for the pressure control business through supporting its installed base. Neil and his OFE team are focused on rebuilding the backlog.
Revenue was $600 million, down 28% year-over-year. The decline in revenue was driven by lower Subsea Production System equipment project backlog, as well as continued market pressure in the rig drilling systems business. We expect the large deals won in 2017 to start generating revenue in 2018. Service revenues were up slightly, only partially offsetting the weakness on the equipment revenues. Operating loss was $43 million, which was unfavorable year-over-year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted operating income by approximately $30 million. This was mainly driven by the strengthening of the Brazilian reais and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar in the quarter. OFE has manufacturing bases in Brazil and the U.K. and is fulfilling long-term contracts with key customers in Sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil. We consider the $30 million impact operational in nature, but do not expect the FX impact to reoccur at the same level going forward. Even excluding the impact of FX, operating income was down year-over-year, driven by significant volume pressure and negative cost leverage. In addition, we continue to see pricing headwinds in the pressure control and flexible pipe systems businesses, which were only able to partially offset with productivity and cost out.
Overall, we think the OFE business will continue to be challenged. We expect to build backlog and compete for key deals. However, as you've seen, customer spending in large projects continue to push out. The team has been reducing costs and are prepared to operate in this environment.
Now moving to Turbomachinery & Process Solutions, the team delivered solid orders growth of 16% versus the prior year, despite continued challenges across its primary markets. Total orders were $1.4 billion in the third quarter and equipment orders were up 79% year-over-year as we signed several large deals for gas compression equipment in the quarter. The gas compression win rate remains strong and actually increased in the quarter. TPS also saw modest improvements in the offshore business as well as some wins in the onshore business mainly in the Middle East. There were no FIDs for LNG projects in the quarter. Service orders were down 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by fewer upgrades as a result of lower customer spending and some softness in the downstream portion of the business. In addition, the transactional service business was also down year-over-year.
Turbomachinery delivered revenues of $1.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Revenue from equipment was down slightly year-over-year as a result of lower order intake in 2016. Service revenues were up. Contractual services, installations and transactional volume were up partially offset by lower activity in our downstream-related services. Operating income for Turbomachinery was $210 million, down 19% year-over-year. While service volume was up, lower margin rates in our equipment backlog more than offset the positive impact from higher service sales. As the business is executing through a lower margin equipment project mix, primarily downstream projects, we expect equipment margins to continue to be at lower levels in the short term. Overall, we expect the TPS business to continue its technology leadership and capture market opportunities as they present themselves. In the short term, we expect the headwinds on service orders from customers spend delays and low LNG orders to continue. Similar to prior years, we expect to see an increase in service volume in the fourth quarter, and we are focused on winning more work on the downstream and industrial sides of the business to offset challenges in upstream.
Next on Digital Solutions. As reminder, this business operates in a few different end markets, across oil and gas, automotive, aerospace and power. While we see some stabilization in the oil and gas end market, major project investments remain low. In the third quarter, the Digital Solutions business delivered orders of $917 million. This was up 43% year-over-year, driven by the large Predix deal with an important international customer that Lorenzo mentioned earlier. Excluding this deal, orders were down slightly year-over-year. The decline was mainly driven by the condition monitoring product lines partially offset by growth in other businesses.
Regionally, we continue to see a slowdown in large EPC projects in the Middle East and Europe, partially offset by strength in Latin America. Revenue for Digital Solutions was $629 million, down 2% year-over-year. We saw growth in our Inspection Technologies business, that was more than offset by Pipeline and Process Solutions. Operating income was $87 million, down 20% year-over-year, driven by lower margin in the Pipeline and Process Solutions business as well as negative mix. Overall, we expect Digital Solutions to continue to grow in the fourth quarter, in line with the typical seasonality, but off a lower base than the fourth quarter of 2016.
With that, Lorenzo, I'll turn it back over to you."

We're just celebrating our 100 days into this transaction that we feel is going very well and maybe just as a backdrop relative to the 3 strategic pillars you mentioned. We remain very focused on what we control. As you look at the external environment, oil inventories are still 20% above their 5-year averages. When you look at the 3 pillars, let's take them one by one to begin with. On growth, you look at the performance during the quarter, the third quarter. You had drilling services and bits growing and outpace the rig count growth in North America, we feel good about that. You look at the orders performance sequentially, it's the second quarter in a row where we've got positive orders. You look at the year-over-year performance, up 18%. On the book-to-bill, positive. Critical wins, you look at the Zohr, which is a key win in Egypt from a subsea perspective. Digital. So we see good traction on the growth side, it's early days. The market remains challenging. But we're definitely focused from a commercial standpoint and getting out there and meeting with the customers has been a key aspect of the first 100 days and as you noted, during the course of the first 2 weeks, we met over 90% of the customers. On margins, key focus here is on the synergies. As you look at integration, it's on track. I mentioned even in September that we're on track with what we've committed to for 2018 relative to the integration and the synergies. You look at the sequential margins performance from a business segment perspective, Brian walked you through that and sequentially, 3 of the 4 businesses are showing positive performance. We've got weakness in the OFE segment, which, again, it's part of the aspect of subsea and the industry continuing to be delayed in its recovery. You look at the third pillar, cash, as Brian mentioned, it's a key area of focus for us. During the course of the quarter, we had one-time deal-related items and restructuring. However, from an operational perspective, it's an area that we need to continue to focus on. It's one of the key areas I have as a focus on inventory receivables. I'd say, we didn't perform where we wanted to in the third quarter, and it's something that we've addressed and we've got people acting upon it immediately. So when you look at it, early days, but definitely a positive momentum. We've got the team rallied and focused on the key priorities. So thanks, James."

So we're going to take a balanced approach, and we want to make sure that we maintain the strong balance sheet as the industry continues to be volatile as we look at it going forward. It's a challenging environment. We did, as you know, in the third quarter, announce a dividend of $0.17 per share. And we are reviewing that as we go forward with our team and also the board.

Well, I think, we all believe there will be one. What is your current view on normalized margins for these businesses? Could you, for example, get without any improvement in subsea which daily will come? Could you get the equipment business into a profitable state as you think? And if you could run through some of the initiatives, I know you have a huge focus going on, on CRM, for example, in Baker Hughes, in trying to implement some of the GE systems there. So could you give us a little bit of an update there on your updated view on margins?"

We took down our monetization program that impacted us by about $200 million. But as I said, working capital did come in under our expectations from a cash flow perspective, and that was primarily driven by receivables in the OFS business. We had a little bit of an inventory build as well. So if I look at that going forward, the deal-related costs should definitely be declining here in the fourth quarter and into next year, we'll trail off. We will continue to look at high payback restructuring only as we drive the synergies here. So I'd expect the restructuring costs to continue. And as I mentioned earlier, we have mobilized the team to look at how we can build stronger operating processes to drive better collections, better visibility, not only in OFS, but across the portfolio. So I would definitely expect fourth quarter to be better operationally, some of that seasonality, others are some of the process changes that we're making here and then less one-time items."

You did point out Harvey, the majority of that will come back to us in the quarter. So that definitely should be helpful. If you look, we have some normal seasonality in the Digital Solutions business. So Digital Solutions is poised to grow here in the fourth quarter. As I walked through with Jim, we feel good about our position in OFS and expect to see growth in OFS, as synergies come through, and we think we'll have some volume increases there. And then TPS is poised to grow in the fourth quarter as well as we look at the backlog of equipment as well as services. And we've got a lot of productivity lined up for that business as well. So those are the big drivers and then synergies will start to ramp albeit, off of a lower base this quarter, we should see some improvements there in synergies."

As we look at the OFS business, we continue to see activity ramping up in North America and the Middle East, along with some recovery in the other international markets when you look at also the North Sea, Latin America. So in 2018, even though North America has decelerated, you should still see some momentum there. On OFE, we see that continuing to be pressured at this moment in time. We should have better orders performance in 2018, but actually the revenue side continuing to be pressured. TPS, we mentioned orders being positive in 2018. And also from a revenues perspective, we should start to see the offshore, onshore production, the downstream area. So if you look at FID, activity picking up, but we should see revenues essentially improving there. And our DS business, you look at, again, improving there relative to the elements outside of also oil and gas from an aviation and industrial perspective. So really 3 out of the 4 business segments seeing an opportunity here from revenue, which help us in 2018. And that's sort of the landscape when you break it down by business segment."

Before we begin with the quarter results, I would like to thank our team for what we have achieved in our first 90 days as a combined company. As we said, this will be a journey. Our current focus is on understanding and improving our core operations as we integrate. I am particularly impressed with the progress and the speed of the integration since the creation of Baker Hughes, a GE Company on July 3. The combined business was fully operational on day 1. Thanks to the very detailed preparation and planning prior to closing. I am more convinced than ever that the creation of BHGE combined the right companies at the right time. Customer feedback continues to be very positive, and we are having constructive discussions about how our capabilities can improve project economics.
In this sustained, low commodity price environment, the need to drive productivity is critical for our customers. Our new company has taken its first steps, and our message of partnership along the value chain is clearly resonating. From upstream to downstream, we provide our customers a broad offering of solutions. We are also driving a culture of safety for our customers, our employees and everybody else involved in our operations. We have implemented the Perfect HSE Day process. As you know, in our first quarter, as a combined company, we have already have to deal with a number of challenging environmental events such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and others. Our thoughts go out to all those who were affected by these events, including many of our employees.
Turning to this morning's discussion, I will cover 3 topics. First, I will give a brief overview of our operational results in the quarter. Second, I will share our perspective of the industry and the market dynamics in our key segments and highlight some of the key achievements of the quarter. Finally, I will give you some more detailed reports of the new company and the integration. Brian will then review our financial results in more detail before we open the call for questions.
In the first quarter, we delivered $5.7 billion in orders and $5.4 billion in revenues. We saw a sequential revenue growth in our shorter-cycle businesses and declines in our longer-cycle businesses, consistent with the view we have shared with you previously. Adjusted operating income was $240 million. We continue to see improved margin performance in our Oilfield Service business, partially offset by challenges in our longer-cycle businesses, particularly in our Oilfield Equipment segment. Earnings per share were negative $0.24 and adjusted EPS was $0.05.
While I am pleased with the positive orders results this quarter, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to improve operating margins and cash generation. Synergy execution is a critical component of that. Our synergy plans are fully in place now and the teams are executing on them. Further, in our first 90 days of operations, we have identified additional opportunities to improve productivity in the company and simplifying and reduced costs in our operating structure.
We are positioning the company for higher growth and profitability. We know where we have to focus to deliver on our commitments. Now it's up to us to execute. Brian will go through the detail of the financial results, but I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace.
In our Oilfield Services segment, we continue to see growth driven by our well construction business lines in North America. While North American rig count is more than 40% up year-to-date, we saw a deceleration in the quarter with the U.S. land rig count up 6% versus the second quarter. While customers in North America are generally quite positive about the outlook, we expect activity to stay flat through the end of the year until the market has better line of sight into 2018 budgets and operators production hedge positions.
We continue to believe that our advanced drilling capabilities will differentiate us in the marketplace, where industrial well construction practices and servicing intensity per well continue to increase. Our drilling services and drill bits businesses outpaced rig count growth in North America in the third quarter.
With our AutoTrak Curve high-build rotary steerable system, Talon high-efficiency PDC drill bits, tailored drilling fluids and enhanced solids removal techniques, we have helped operators reduce well costs and improve performance, particularly in the Marcellus and Utica. We delivered a total of 100 wells, where more than a mile of footage was drilled in a 24-hour period. This speaks to how far we have raised the bar in the industrial well construction arena in North America, where our rates of penetration metrics in drilling can now be quoted in miles per day rather than in feet per hour. With the long laterals now the norm in every basin and longer more complex laterals being planned by our customers, our Drilling Services business is positioned for grow in the coming quarters as these more challenging drilling horizons come into play.
International activity in Oilfield Services remains muted with rig count flat year-to-date. However, we are seeing signs of activity increase, both in the volume and size of tenders for new work as customers feel more confident about their operating costs and commodity price stability. To that point, we were awarded a large multiyear integrated drilling contract with an important customer in the Middle East as well as 2 critical deepwater completion contracts in Latin America Offshore.
In our Oilfield Equipment segment, the subsea market continues to be very challenging. Activity remains low and prices continue to be pressured. We expect 3 awards in 2017 to be 150 to 170, up significantly versus 2016, but still 70% below peak levels seen in 2013. As we previously communicated, we had a significant win in the quarter to support this Zohr Gas Field. The win is a result of a productivity initiative using our digital tools across our design and manufacturing process to deliver the most cost-competitive products in the subsea market. Our cross-sell assets and ability to develop local content were critical in securing the award and being part of Egypt's energy future.
During the quarter, we also announced what is the first demonstration of our ability to generate value for our customers through our full stream offering. The agreement executed with Twinza Oil will provide support for an offshore development project in Papua New Guinea. This business model is an exciting development for the industry, where the combination of capability between our Oilfield Equipment, Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery segments can provide a unique, high-productivity value proposition for our customers and commercial differentiation.
Despite these successes in the quarter, we continue to expect the subsea market to be very challenged in the short term with little sign of any significant recovery in 2018.
In our Turbomachinery segment, the LNG market continues to be oversupplied in the near term and with gas prices pressured in most markets. The long-term value proposition for LNG remains positive, and we have an industry-leading portfolio in this segment with unsurpassed manufacturing and services capabilities. Opportunities for growth in the short to midterm exists across the broader midstream and downstream segments in which we participate. These include gas to power projects, stranded gas monetization, pipeline and surface compression to name a few. Many of these applications require a range of turbomachinery equipment that is fit for purpose in terms of both cost and function.
To better serve this market, we have been expanding our NovaLT equipment application to serve anything from traditional oil and gas segments to the industrial sector. I am pleased to say that earlier this year, we secured a contract to supply a cogeneration power plant with our 16.5-megawatt NovaLT gas turbine generator. The plant will deliver electricity to our customers' facility in Malaysia and apply a waste recovery process. This innovative approach will help increase energy efficiency and lower CO2 emissions by 54,000 tons per year.
In refining, large complex refinery should gain an advantage in a more competitive, oversupplied landscape. However, costs and refining margins continue to move some projects to the right. In the quarter, we won a critical contract in the Middle East to provide 7 compression trains, enabling our refinery plants to produce cleaner energy.
In petrochemicals, we see healthy end-market demand. Cost advantaged supply bases continue to drive projects forward, particularly in North America and the Middle East. Earlier this year, we won a deal to supply 3 large steam turbine-driven compressors for an ethylene production plant in North America.
In the Digital Solutions segment, we see end markets for our measurement and controls-based portfolio slowly returning to growth. Nonoil and gas end markets continue to be robust, driven by aviation and industrials. Oil and gas end markets are beginning to stabilize, and we expect them to return to growth over the medium term.
Our digital offerings in software and digital services continue to gain traction in the marketplace. In end of quarter, we secured our largest ever award of approximately $300 million from an important international customer. This long-term award includes a holistic asset performance management solution based on the GE Predix platform.
In the third quarter, we went live with our plant operations advisory program with BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Our technology is performing 25 million calculations a day. And together with our customer, we're focused on reducing nonproductive time. Almost all of our customers are either evaluating or applying new solutions in this emerging digital space. And I believe we are uniquely positioned from a portfolio perspective to help them make step changes in productivity for their businesses.
Lastly on integration, we have made significant progress over the first quarter as a combined company. The organization is in place and all leadership positions have been staffed. We have trained over 15,000 employees on changes impacting and their roles in the new company. We had personal touchpoints with over 90% of our customers in the first 2 weeks after closing. And in early September, we went live with our fully integrated commercial platform. I've personally had the opportunity to engage with many of our most important customers around the globe and continue to update them regularly. As you know, cost actions are underway as well. We are taking restructuring actions wherever it is necessary. We successfully consolidated over 20 facilities in the quarter and initiated an additional 40 for completion by the end of the year.
Overall, I feel we've made an incredible amount of progress in the third quarter. I feel good about achieving the synergy targets we laid out. We are still in the early days and just recently had our 100th-day anniversary. We are on track and what I have seen so far is highly encouraging.
With that, let me turn the call over to Brian to go through our financial results."

We had a strong orders quarter at $5.7 billion, which is up 2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, the increase in orders was driven by our shorter-cycle segments, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions, as activity picked up in North America as well as the Middle East. This increase was partially offset by headwinds in our long-cycle businesses with Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment down 11% and 5%, respectively. The declines in these businesses were driven by strong comparisons in the second quarter and continued delays in customer spending. Year-over-year, total orders grew 18%, albeit off a low base in the third quarter of 2016, and all of our segments showed growth.
Backlog increased from $20.6 billion to $20.9 billion in the quarter. Both equipment and service backlog grew. Equipment backlog ended at $5.7 billion. The third quarter was the first quarter in over 6 quarters where our equipment backlog grew sequentially. Equipment book-to-bill was 1.1, marking this as the second straight quarter with a positive book-to-bill ratio. Service backlog was $15.2 billion and increased 1% sequentially.
Revenue for this quarter was $5.4 billion, which was down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Versus last quarter, our short-cycle businesses, Oilfield Services and Digital Solutions were up, driven by activity increases in both North America and the Middle East. We saw sequential declines in our longer-cycle businesses, Turbomachinery and Oilfield Equipment as a result of lower 2016 order intake, which drove a lower opening backlog. Year-over-year, the revenue increases in Oilfield Services and Turbomachinery were offset by the significant decline in Oilfield Equipment.
Operating loss in the quarter was $122 million. On an adjusted basis, we delivered $240 million of operating income. This excludes net restructuring, impairment and other charges of $203 million as well as merger and related costs of $159 million. Adjusted operating income was up 105% sequentially. As a reminder, when comparing our sequential results, we called out some nonrecurring charges in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we had higher amortization expenses due to the impact from purchase accounting. Even when adjusting for those items, operating income was up significantly, driven by strength in Oilfield Services, Digital Solutions and Turbomachinery, partially offset by continued softness in Oilfield Equipment. Included in our reported and adjusted operating income is a negative impact of approximately $15 million as a result of supply chain-driven delays caused by Hurricane Harvey. We expect the majority of that to come back to us in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, operating income was down 13%. The increase in Oilfield Services was more than offset by declines in the other segments.
Next up, our taxes. Tax expense for the quarter was $93 million. While we were in an overall net loss position for the quarter, we generated income outside the U.S. and losses within the U.S. primarily due to the restructuring actions that we have taken. Our foreign income was taxed, but because we have been in a net loss position within the U.S. for a period of time, we were unable to deduct these losses, thus driving the overall higher tax expense. As we start to generate to earnings in the U.S. over time, we expect to benefit from the valuation allowances built up, including the ones from this quarter. For 4Q, we expect taxes to follow a similar profile to this quarter.
Loss per share for the third quarter was $0.24. On an adjusted basis, third quarter earnings per share were $0.05.
Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $405 million. While we had anticipated a significant outflow for merger and restructuring-related activities, this quarter's performance was below our expectations.
First, let me give you some details and then I will give you some insights into how we're going to run things differently going forward. As I said, merger and restructuring-related items had a significant negative impact of approximately $400 million in the quarter. This was driven by accelerated incentive compensation payments as well as a lease buyout that were both triggered by the merger. We had a significant amount of restructuring and severance payments as we execute to achieve our synergy targets. In addition, we had a negative impact of approximately $200 million from the continued reduction in our receivables factoring programs.
Operationally, both accounts receivable and inventory performance were below our expectations and were mainly driven by our Oilfield Services business. While some of that miss might be attributable to distraction from the integration, we are expecting significantly better performance in the next quarters from the team. We've dedicated a senior leader to build out operational processes to deliver on our commitment of improved cash conversion. In addition, we are integrating both reporting and operating mechanisms to drive more visibility into cash flow. We expect fourth quarter operational free cash flow generation to be markedly better than in the third quarter.
Next, I'll walk through the segment results. In Oilfield Services, the market continues to improve in North America, though we saw a deceleration in growth versus the second quarter and the rig count flattening since the end of July. International activity remains muted. In selected markets, we are seeing some signs of activity increases though. The Oilfield Services business delivered a solid quarter. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 4% sequentially. This quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven by the well construction product lines, particularly in North America land and in the Middle East. The Completions business delivered double-digit growth sequentially with solid gains in Saudi Arabia, the Permian and the Rockies. As Lorenzo mentioned, revenue growth for the drilling services and the drill bits business outpaced rig count growth in North America. Regionally, increased activity in North America and the Middle East drove higher volume. Revenues for North America were $1 billion, up 5% sequentially, driven by the onshore well construction business. Drilling Services, drill bits, wireline and Completions all delivered double-digit sequential growth.
Internationally, revenue was $1.6 billion, up 3% sequentially, driven by the Middle East as the well construction credit lines delivered solid growth in a flat rig count environment. Outside the Middle East, we saw revenue growth in Asia driven by Completions and Artificial Lift businesses and growth in Europe with Drilling Services, drill bits and pressure pumping. These gains were partially offset by declines in both Latin America and Sub-Sahara Africa. Operating income was $75 million, up $48 million sequentially and $115 million year-over-year. The operating income for the quarter includes approximately $35 million of additional amortization as a result of purchase accounting. Despite this, the business delivered strong incremental margins. The increase in operating income is primarily driven by higher volume, cost-out efforts, favorable mix partially offset by Hurricane Harvey impact, which primarily was in the chemicals and Completions business.
In the near term, we expect the business to continue to perform in line with the markets in which we operate. We view current market dynamics is favorable for our Drilling Services and the drill bits businesses as customers continue to drill complicated laterals. And for our Completions businesses, North American operators begin to work down that drill bit uncompleted inventory. As we continue to ramp up our synergy programs, we expect to drive additional operating margin leverage in the business.
Our OFE business, despite top line orders growth, continues to operate in a very difficult environment. As Lorenzo mentioned, activity remains at low levels, with few signs of significant improvement in the short term. Orders in the quarter were $760 million, up 45% versus last year and the equipment book-to-bill was 1.4, primarily driven by Zohr win. The team is building on the success from last quarter with the Eni, Mozambique win. In addition, orders increased in our flexible pipe systems business, which showed continued strength in the Brazilian market. Services orders were also up 3% year-over-year, driven by increasing levels of activity in North America for the pressure control business through supporting its installed base. Neil and his OFE team are focused on rebuilding the backlog.
Revenue was $600 million, down 28% year-over-year. The decline in revenue was driven by lower Subsea Production System equipment project backlog, as well as continued market pressure in the rig drilling systems business. We expect the large deals won in 2017 to start generating revenue in 2018. Service revenues were up slightly, only partially offsetting the weakness on the equipment revenues. Operating loss was $43 million, which was unfavorable year-over-year. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted operating income by approximately $30 million. This was mainly driven by the strengthening of the Brazilian reais and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar in the quarter. OFE has manufacturing bases in Brazil and the U.K. and is fulfilling long-term contracts with key customers in Sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil. We consider the $30 million impact operational in nature, but do not expect the FX impact to reoccur at the same level going forward. Even excluding the impact of FX, operating income was down year-over-year, driven by significant volume pressure and negative cost leverage. In addition, we continue to see pricing headwinds in the pressure control and flexible pipe systems businesses, which were only able to partially offset with productivity and cost out.
Overall, we think the OFE business will continue to be challenged. We expect to build backlog and compete for key deals. However, as you've seen, customer spending in large projects continue to push out. The team has been reducing costs and are prepared to operate in this environment.
Now moving to Turbomachinery & Process Solutions, the team delivered solid orders growth of 16% versus the prior year, despite continued challenges across its primary markets. Total orders were $1.4 billion in the third quarter and equipment orders were up 79% year-over-year as we signed several large deals for gas compression equipment in the quarter. The gas compression win rate remains strong and actually increased in the quarter. TPS also saw modest improvements in the offshore business as well as some wins in the onshore business mainly in the Middle East. There were no FIDs for LNG projects in the quarter. Service orders were down 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by fewer upgrades as a result of lower customer spending and some softness in the downstream portion of the business. In addition, the transactional service business was also down year-over-year.
Turbomachinery delivered revenues of $1.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Revenue from equipment was down slightly year-over-year as a result of lower order intake in 2016. Service revenues were up. Contractual services, installations and transactional volume were up partially offset by lower activity in our downstream-related services. Operating income for Turbomachinery was $210 million, down 19% year-over-year. While service volume was up, lower margin rates in our equipment backlog more than offset the positive impact from higher service sales. As the business is executing through a lower margin equipment project mix, primarily downstream projects, we expect equipment margins to continue to be at lower levels in the short term. Overall, we expect the TPS business to continue its technology leadership and capture market opportunities as they present themselves. In the short term, we expect the headwinds on service orders from customers spend delays and low LNG orders to continue. Similar to prior years, we expect to see an increase in service volume in the fourth quarter, and we are focused on winning more work on the downstream and industrial sides of the business to offset challenges in upstream.
Next on Digital Solutions. As reminder, this business operates in a few different end markets, across oil and gas, automotive, aerospace and power. While we see some stabilization in the oil and gas end market, major project investments remain low. In the third quarter, the Digital Solutions business delivered orders of $917 million. This was up 43% year-over-year, driven by the large Predix deal with an important international customer that Lorenzo mentioned earlier. Excluding this deal, orders were down slightly year-over-year. The decline was mainly driven by the condition monitoring product lines partially offset by growth in other businesses.
Regionally, we continue to see a slowdown in large EPC projects in the Middle East and Europe, partially offset by strength in Latin America. Revenue for Digital Solutions was $629 million, down 2% year-over-year. We saw growth in our Inspection Technologies business, that was more than offset by Pipeline and Process Solutions. Operating income was $87 million, down 20% year-over-year, driven by lower margin in the Pipeline and Process Solutions business as well as negative mix. Overall, we expect Digital Solutions to continue to grow in the fourth quarter, in line with the typical seasonality, but off a lower base than the fourth quarter of 2016.
With that, Lorenzo, I'll turn it back over to you."

We're just celebrating our 100 days into this transaction that we feel is going very well and maybe just as a backdrop relative to the 3 strategic pillars you mentioned. We remain very focused on what we control. As you look at the external environment, oil inventories are still 20% above their 5-year averages. When you look at the 3 pillars, let's take them one by one to begin with. On growth, you look at the performance during the quarter, the third quarter. You had drilling services and bits growing and outpace the rig count growth in North America, we feel good about that. You look at the orders performance sequentially, it's the second quarter in a row where we've got positive orders. You look at the year-over-year performance, up 18%. On the book-to-bill, positive. Critical wins, you look at the Zohr, which is a key win in Egypt from a subsea perspective. Digital. So we see good traction on the growth side, it's early days. The market remains challenging. But we're definitely focused from a commercial standpoint and getting out there and meeting with the customers has been a key aspect of the first 100 days and as you noted, during the course of the first 2 weeks, we met over 90% of the customers. On margins, key focus here is on the synergies. As you look at integration, it's on track. I mentioned even in September that we're on track with what we've committed to for 2018 relative to the integration and the synergies. You look at the sequential margins performance from a business segment perspective, Brian walked you through that and sequentially, 3 of the 4 businesses are showing positive performance. We've got weakness in the OFE segment, which, again, it's part of the aspect of subsea and the industry continuing to be delayed in its recovery. You look at the third pillar, cash, as Brian mentioned, it's a key area of focus for us. During the course of the quarter, we had one-time deal-related items and restructuring. However, from an operational perspective, it's an area that we need to continue to focus on. It's one of the key areas I have as a focus on inventory receivables. I'd say, we didn't perform where we wanted to in the third quarter, and it's something that we've addressed and we've got people acting upon it immediately. So when you look at it, early days, but definitely a positive momentum. We've got the team rallied and focused on the key priorities. So thanks, James."

We took down our monetization program that impacted us by about $200 million. But as I said, working capital did come in under our expectations from a cash flow perspective, and that was primarily driven by receivables in the OFS business. We had a little bit of an inventory build as well. So if I look at that going forward, the deal-related costs should definitely be declining here in the fourth quarter and into next year, we'll trail off. We will continue to look at high payback restructuring only as we drive the synergies here. So I'd expect the restructuring costs to continue. And as I mentioned earlier, we have mobilized the team to look at how we can build stronger operating processes to drive better collections, better visibility, not only in OFS, but across the portfolio. So I would definitely expect fourth quarter to be better operationally, some of that seasonality, others are some of the process changes that we're making here and then less one-time items."

If you take a look dynamics right now in TPS, our revenues are up in the quarter 2% and operating income is down 19% and service mix was good and was certainly a tailwind, but it was more than offset by margins in equipment as we work through our backlog, which has got some negative mix, primarily driven by the downstream segment, which is not as profitable. As I look into the next couple of quarters, I can -- I would expect that to continue that negative mix based on where the backlog is today. But if you look, we actually had a book-to-bill of 1 in the quarter, equipment backlog grew. So we're refilling that backlog and that should get better as we progress through the year. On top of that, we have seen some headwinds in the transactional services business as operators are really conserving cash and OpEx. And based on what we see, later in the year next year, that should turn as well."

If you look at those businesses that are really rig count-driven, drilling services, wireline, drill bits, all up more than the rig count. Strong performance in Completions as well. And if you look at the incrementals here in this quarter, we had really strong growth in Drilling Services and Completions, and that's where we have higher margins. As Lorenzo and I both mentioned, we see the market flattening, and really I don't think, in the fourth quarter, and Drilling Services won't be as much of a tailwind, but we do see some pretty strong growth in other product areas, where our margins are a bit lower. And then we also will have some synergies that should be coming in, end of the fourth quarter and then into next year. So when I put all that together, from a mix standpoint, from the market flattening a little bit, I would expect incrementals to be in line with historical averages.

A lot of good conversations happening with the customers that will enable us. As we look at the longer term, on the gas side, we see gas continuing to grow and also LNG returning.

And you look at also the other segments, when you think about the downstream, the refinery, the petrochemicals, the pipelines, and then our Digital Solutions business.

We should have better orders performance in 2018, but actually the revenue side continuing to be pressured. TPS, we mentioned orders being positive in 2018.
