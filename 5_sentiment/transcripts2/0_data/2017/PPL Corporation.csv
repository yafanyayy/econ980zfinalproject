We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. Starting with Slide 2. Ou",2020,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Starting with Slide 2. Our agenda this morning includes an overview of our 2016 earnings results along with an operational update. Following that, I'm going to address our 2017 earnings forecast and review our projections for long-term earnings growth. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. 
Before I get started, I did want to highlight a few key points of our presentation this morning. We have delivered strong 2016 ongoing earnings, achieving 11% year-over-year growth. We've also raised our dividend by 4% in 2017 with our continued commitment to grow that by 4% annually through 2020. We've also taken steps to further de-risk our 2017 through 2020 plan by significantly reducing our foreign currency risk and reducing our load growth forecast from 0.5% to no load growth. Finally, we also believe that we are well positioned to manage the potential impacts of tax reform. 
Turning to Slide 3. Today, we announced 2016 reported earnings of $2.79 per share compared with $1.01 per share in 2015. Adjusting for special items our 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, up 11% from 2015 results, which puts us at the high end of our forecast range. For the fourth quarter of 2016, reported earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.60 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.43 a year ago. 
The key drivers of our 11% growth were strong performance across our regulated businesses and a positive tax adjustment of $0.05 per share related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. 
2016 marks seven conservative years that PPL has exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast. As our track record shows, we take great pride in delivering on the commitments we made to our share owners. 
Turning to Slide 4. Backed by the continued strong performance of our utilities, today, we announced we're increasing our common stock dividend on an annualized basis from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share, or a 4% increase. The quarterly dividend of $0.395 per share will be payable April 1 to share owners of record as of March 10. This marks PPL's 15th dividend increase in the last 16 years. 
Let's move to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations. In Kentucky, our rate review continues to proceed as expected before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. This comes after Kentucky Utilities filed a request in late November of last year to increase revenue by a combined $210 million. That includes revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million, respectively, at Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric through adjustments to annual base electricity rates. 
In addition, it includes a revenue increase of $14 million for LG&E during adjustment to annual base rates -- gas base rates. The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. We've included a schedule for the rate review process in the appendix to today's slides. If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect on July 1, 2017. The company's continuation of the customer experience initiative has resulted in another J.D. Power award in Kentucky. LG&E and KU ranked first and second among midsized utilities in the Midwest region in 2016 calendar year Electric Utility Business Customer Service Satisfaction study. This brings the total number of J.D. Power awards earned by PPL subsidiaries to 42. 
In Pennsylvania, we remainfocused on transmission and distribution system improvements with an eye towards reliability and resiliency. We continue to make substantial progress in these areas in 2016. 
As a result of the investments we've made, PPL Electric Utilities today has one of the most robust and advanced distribution automation systems in the country. That system, which was bolstered by the addition of more than 700 smart grid devices last year, avoided more than 100,000 customer interruptions throughout the year. And as a result of investments we've made to modernize and expand our transmission system, sustain transmission outages have dropped by nearly 75% over the last 5 years. PPL Electric Utilities' reliability performance is among the nation's best. We're intent on keeping it that way as we execute our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
In the U.K., we received the final RIIO-ED1 results for the 2015-2016 regulatory year, achieving the highest incentive revenues among the U.K.'s distribution network operators. And customers have rated as the best electricity network in the U.K. with an average customer satisfaction rating of 89%. 
Meanwhile, we remain on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016/2017 regulatory year incentive targets. Details on our projected 2016/2017 incentive revenues is included in the appendix on Pages 24 and 25. 
Turning to Slide 6. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15. 
Moving to Slide 7. We show a walk of the drivers from our 2016 ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast.  I should point out that included in our 2017 forecast is $0.05 of hedge restrikes to move value from 2017 to 2019. Without the restrikes, our EPS forecast would have been $2.20 per share. 
Our 2017 guidance is lower than 26 (sic) [ 2016 ] earnings primarily from a lower foreign currency hedge exchange rate, dilution from issuing additional equity of $250 million per year and tax benefits recorded in 2016 that are not expected to repeat in 2017. 
We've increased our equity issuances in the plan from $100 million to $350 million per year to support the funding of incremental capital spending and to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. This will help us maintain strong credit metrics and also lowers future holding company debt balances, which reduces the potential impact of tax reform as we'll discuss in a moment. 
Moving to Slide 8. PPL continues to invest responsibly in the future. It's that investment, coupled with timely rate recovery in the constructive jurisdictions we operate in, that's driving our 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. Our capital plan of about $3 billion per year is expected to produce compound annual rate base growth of 5.3% from 2017 through 2020 with our rate base growing to $29 billion. We expect to receive near time -- realtime -- rather near realtime recovery for about 80% of the $13 billion infrastructure investment we expect to make during that time. As you can see, our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth objectives. 
Slide 9 highlights the key drivers and assumptions in our business plan. As mentioned earlier, that plan assumes $350 million per year in equity issuances and targets additional dividend growth of about 4% annually through 2020. We expect 4% to 6% growth in our domestic utilities from 2017 through 2020. This reflects several things: higher gross margins from additional capital investments in Kentucky; increased transmission spending in Pennsylvania; partially offset by higher depreciation and interest, and the dilution from equity issuance, as I just mentioned. Domestic net income is expected to grow 5% to 7% over the forecast period. 
Meanwhile, we're expecting U.K. earnings growth of 6% to 8%, reflecting the hedges we put in place and our ability to achieve our $1.30 per pound budgeted rate through 2020. In addition to effects of currency, the growth in our U.K. segment is driven by higher gross margins driven by annual price increases and higher pension income due to higher returns on higher pension asset balances, which more than offset the effects of any dilution. 
We continue managing our currency risk proactively, taking steps to improve the risk reward profile and the certainty we will achieve our growth objectives. We can meet 5% EPS growth through 2020 even as the pound drops to $1.13 per pound and we can meet to that growth through 2019 at $0.90 per pound. This is a very significant improvement in our risk reward profile. Vince will provide a detailed update on our foreign currency hedging in his remarks. We're expecting net income for the U.K. segment to now grow in the 8% to 10% range for the forecast period. 
Overall, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver on our projected 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 through 2020. Further, we expect to achieve a very competitive total annual share and a return of 9% to 10% as we execute our plans for growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 10. We know the investment community has a keen interest in the topic of U.S. tax reform, including how any changes may impact PPL and other utilities. For PPL, the 2 primary effects we're tracking are the deductibility of interest expense on our domestic holding company debt and a net effect on rate base at our utilities from the extension of 100% bonus depreciation offset, of course, by a lower tax rate. 
I want to highlight 2 very important points that differentiates PPL from its peers. First, since about half of our business resides in the U.K., we have minimal exposure to tax reform for half of our earnings. 
Second, we have the flexibility to raise capital in the U.K., thereby retaining the ability to deduct interest. 
We support efforts to simplify the U.S. tax code and to lower the federal corporate tax rate to a level that is more competitively -- competitive globally, but speculating on the impact of tax reform is extremely difficult given the lack of detail on current proposals that have been set forth today. 
Our industry has a good track record of working with policymakers to shape meaningful tax-related legislation that minimizes negative impacts to our customers and to our companies. This was true during the last comprehensive tax reform in 1986 as well as during the debate on -- later on taxes related to dividends and capital gains. Our base assumption is that any benefits from the reduction of the tax rate will be passed through to our customers. Therefore, the only real impact on our utilities is the impact on rate base. 
As we think about tax reform, it's important to keep in mind that we have several opportunities in PPL's case to offset potential impacts. We can use the dry powder created by our hedging strategy, we could shift some of holding company debt financings to the U.K. and we have the ability to increase capital spending. 
Of course, the details of any tax reform plan are very hard to predict at this point. But to help frame this up for PPL, I wanted to address a few possible scenarios. First, as it relates to rate base at our domestic utilities, if we're required to adopt 100% expensing of capital, our breakeven tax rate for rate base would be about 20%. 
Regarding deductibility of interest, if the tax rate is reduced to 20% and we retain the ability to deduct interest expense on all debt or if non-deductability of interest is only applied to new debt, we would see about a $0.05 per share impact to earnings, which we believe we can fully mitigate with the strategies I just talked about. 
If non-deductability of interest applies to all existing debt, we would see about a $0.10 per share impact to earnings, which we also believe we can largely mitigate through these strategies, especially if the pound stays around $1.20 or above as it is today. 
I'm confident the U.S. tax reform, as it's currently being discussed, is a manageable event for PPL and not a barrier in our ability to meet our stated goal of growing EPS by 5% to 6% through 2020. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed look at our earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 12 for a review of segment earnings. Full year 2016 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2015 earnings of $2.21 per share to $2.45 per share, exceeding the m",1399,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 12 for a review of segment earnings. 
Full year 2016 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2015 earnings of $2.21 per share to $2.45 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.07, placing us at the high end of the forecast range. Each of our operating segments delivered strong growth compared to the prior year. 
The Pennsylvania Regulated segment contributed $0.13 of growth for the year, the Kentucky Regulated segment contributed $0.07 and the U.K. Regulated segment contributed $0.05. Corporate and other remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. 
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact weather had on our results to the full year. Weather really did not have a significant impact on our 2016 earnings performance as it was flat compared to 2015 and it was $0.01 worse than budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2016 segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in 2016, a $0.13 increase compared to 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins as a result of higher distribution base electricity rates effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins from additional capital investments. Higher margins were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset addition.
Moving to Slide 14. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.58 per share in 2016, a $0.07 increase from 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins, which is the net effect of electricity and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and returns on additional environmental capital investments and lower operation and maintenance expense, including the reduction of cost associated with the 2015 coal plant retirements. These net positive results were partially offset by higher financing cost related to the September 2015 debt issuances. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.49 per share in 2016, a $0.05 improvement compared to 2015. Positive factors driving earnings results include higher gross margins primarily driven by an April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by 4 months of lower prices from the April 1, 2015, price decrease. A decrease in O&M primarily from local pension expense and lower U.S. income taxes primarily from the benefit reported in Q4 2016 for the expected utilization of foreign tax credit resulting from our updated business plan. These positive factors were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from asset additions, higher financing cost due to 2015 debt issuances and lower average exchange rates in 2016 compared to 2015. The average rate for 2016 was $1.45 per pound compared to $1.57 per pound for 2015. 
Moving to Slide 16. We've updated our hedging disclosures and made great progress in de-risking our plan related to foreign currency exposure. The chart at the top of the page highlights our contractual hedge levels. And as you can see, we started to layer in hedges for 2019 with 50% already hedged. As Bill mentioned, embedded in the midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.15 per share is about $0.05 of hedge restrikes. We achieved the 50% hedge level for 2019 as of today by executing 4 of the $0.05 of planned restrikes as well as entering into forward contracts for 2019 at rates that were near our budgeted rate of $1.30. As you can see on the slide, the average rate for the 19 hedges is $1.34 per pound compared to our budgeted rate of $1.30. It's important to note that we achieved this 50% hedge level above our budgeted rate without reducing the hedge levels for 2018. 2018 is still hedged at an average rate of $1.42 per pound, well above our budgeted rate, enabling us to still restrike value from 2018 into 2019 and '20. 
Through the strength of our business plan and with the hedges in place for half of 2019, we continue to de-risk '19 and '20 as illustrated in the lower table. This table lays out our ability to hedge 2017 through 2020 at various GBP rate to maintain at least the low end of our earnings growth range of 5% to 6%. 
Effectively, we have no exposure through 2019. The pound could fall as low as $0.90 per pound, and we could still achieve a 5% EPS growth rate through '19. And at a $1.13 per pound, we can achieve that growth through 2020. The additional hedging we have done significantly mitigates our foreign currency exposure related to our U.K. operations. And we believe we have skewed that exposure to the upside with the actions we've taken to date. 
I should also note that tax reform will likely improve this picture even further since we gross up our hedges to cover the current 35% tax rate. If the tax rate is lowered to 20%, we would be 100% hedged for 2018 and about 70% hedged for 2019. 
Also the sensitivities in the bottom table would improve for 2020 as well, with the breakeven rate going from $1.13 per pound down to $1.07. 
Moving to Slide 17. Our planned capital expenditures for 2017 through 2021 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $16 billion over the period. We continue to invest about $1 billion annually in each of our business lines, which includes our previously announced initiatives as well as $1 billion of incremental capital identified for '17 through '20 compared to the prior plan. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, our investment is focused on delivering a sustainable energy future by expanding and modernizing the grid, adding smart grid technology and automation and strengthening physical and cybersecurity. We are also connecting more renewable energy and expanding solar offerings to our customers. 
In Kentucky, we are investing an additional $525 million over the next 4 years despite lower environmental spending of $345 million due to updated scope and timing changes for ELGs and CCR projects. This additional capital includes $320 million through installed advanced meters and $550 million to improve the reliability of electric and gas infrastructure in Kentucky. 
In Pennsylvania, we are investing an additional $310 million in transmission, driven primarily by increased or accelerated project activity, such as line rebuilds, new substations and security. Distribution spending levels in Pennsylvania remain relatively flat. 
We currently project our capital investment to decrease slightly in the outer years as our advanced metering projects are completed in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and our environmental spend in Kentucky ramps down. Consistent with last year's plan, our capital plan is based on identified projects only across the portfolio, and it does not include unidentified growth projects. However, we continually find new capital projects in support of reliability, safety and security. We have a robust pipeline of capital projects, and I believe as we continue to work on the system and develop our future plans, including responding to tax reform, we will identify additional capital spend for the back-end of the plan. 
Moving to Slide 18. Here, we're providing an update to our review of domestic cash flows reflecting 2016 actual results and providing the 2017 projection. 2016's excess cash position of $702 million includes the $310 million of net proceeds received last year from the monetization of the 2017 and '18 earnings hedges following the Brexit referendum. Cash available for distribution is expected to be lower in '17 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower cash inflows from our currency hedges, higher domestic maintenance capital as we continue to invest in the utilities and the lower dividend coming from the U.K. Overall, though, we still expect cash available for distribution to be either breakeven or positive over the forecast period even assuming the dividend grows at 4% per year. 
And finally, turning to Slide 19. We show our updated RPI forecast assumptions using the January 2017 HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy. Our business plan assumptions are in line with these current RPI forecasts. Our sensitivity for a half a percent [ph] movement in 2016, '17 RPI now results in a $0.01 impact out in 2019. As a reminder, this past November, we set our 2018-'19 tariffs based on the forecasted RPI at that time, and that is consistent with Ofgem's guidance. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A. Bill?"

At the outset of the year, we established our earnings forecasts. In the end, we delivered achieving the high end of that forecast range. As 2016 began, we said we would begin to grow our dividend more meaningfully in 2017. Today, we have delivered, announcing a 4% dividend increase. 
We established also a plan to invest more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2016. Again, we delivered. It's what we do, we deliver. And looking ahead, we are very well positioned to continue to deliver on the commitments we've made to our share owners and customers.

We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. Starting with Slide 2. Ou",2021,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Starting with Slide 2. Our agenda this morning includes an overview of our 2016 earnings results along with an operational update. Following that, I'm going to address our 2017 earnings forecast and review our projections for long-term earnings growth. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. 
Before I get started, I did want to highlight a few key points of our presentation this morning. We have delivered strong 2016 ongoing earnings, achieving 11% year-over-year growth. We've also raised our dividend by 4% in 2017 with our continued commitment to grow that by 4% annually through 2020. We've also taken steps to further de-risk our 2017 through 2020 plan by significantly reducing our foreign currency risk and reducing our load growth forecast from 0.5% to no load growth. Finally, we also believe that we are well positioned to manage the potential impacts of tax reform. 
Turning to Slide 3. Today, we announced 2016 reported earnings of $2.79 per share compared with $1.01 per share in 2015. Adjusting for special items our 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, up 11% from 2015 results, which puts us at the high end of our forecast range. For the fourth quarter of 2016, reported earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.60 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.43 a year ago. 
The key drivers of our 11% growth were strong performance across our regulated businesses and a positive tax adjustment of $0.05 per share related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. 
2016 marks seven conservative years that PPL has exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast. As our track record shows, we take great pride in delivering on the commitments we made to our share owners. 
Turning to Slide 4. Backed by the continued strong performance of our utilities, today, we announced we're increasing our common stock dividend on an annualized basis from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share, or a 4% increase. The quarterly dividend of $0.395 per share will be payable April 1 to share owners of record as of March 10. This marks PPL's 15th dividend increase in the last 16 years. 
Let's move to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations. In Kentucky, our rate review continues to proceed as expected before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. This comes after Kentucky Utilities filed a request in late November of last year to increase revenue by a combined $210 million. That includes revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million, respectively, at Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric through adjustments to annual base electricity rates. 
In addition, it includes a revenue increase of $14 million for LG&E during adjustment to annual base rates -- gas base rates. The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. We've included a schedule for the rate review process in the appendix to today's slides. If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect on July 1, 2017. The company's continuation of the customer experience initiative has resulted in another J.D. Power award in Kentucky. LG&E and KU ranked first and second among midsized utilities in the Midwest region in 2016 calendar year Electric Utility Business Customer Service Satisfaction study. This brings the total number of J.D. Power awards earned by PPL subsidiaries to 42. 
In Pennsylvania, we remain focused on transmission and distribution system improvements with an eye towards reliability and resiliency. We continue to make substantial progress in these areas in 2016. 
As a result of the investments we've made, PPL Electric Utilities today has one of the most robust and advanced distribution automation systems in the country. That system, which was bolstered by the addition of more than 700 smart grid devices last year, avoided more than 100,000 customer interruptions throughout the year. And as a result of investments we've made to modernize and expand our transmission system, sustain transmission outages have dropped by nearly 75% over the last 5 years. PPL Electric Utilities' reliability performance is among the nation's best. We're intent on keeping it that way as we execute our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
In the U.K., we received the final RIIO-ED1 results for the 2015-2016 regulatory year, achieving the highest incentive revenues among the U.K.'s distribution network operators. And customers have rated as the best electricity network in the U.K. with an average customer satisfaction rating of 89%. 
Meanwhile, we remain on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016/2017 regulatory year incentive targets. Details on our projected 2016/2017 incentive revenues is included in the appendix on Pages 24 and 25. 
Turning to Slide 6. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15. 
Moving to Slide 7. We show a walk of the drivers from our 2016 ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast.  I should point out that included in our 2017 forecast is $0.05 of hedge restrikes to move value from 2017 to 2019. Without the restrikes, our EPS forecast would have been $2.20 per share. 
Our 2017 guidance is lower than 26 (sic) [ 2016 ] earnings primarily from a lower foreign currency hedge exchange rate, dilution from issuing additional equity of $250 million per year and tax benefits recorded in 2016 that are not expected to repeat in 2017. 
We've increased our equity issuances in the plan from $100 million to $350 million per year to support the funding of incremental capital spending and to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. This will help us maintain strong credit metrics and also lowers future holding company debt balances, which reduces the potential impact of tax reform as we'll discuss in a moment. 
Moving to Slide 8. PPL continues to invest responsibly in the future. It's that investment, coupled with timely rate recovery in the constructive jurisdictions we operate in, that's driving our 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. Our capital plan of about $3 billion per year is expected to produce compound annual rate base growth of 5.3% from 2017 through 2020 with our rate base growing to $29 billion. We expect to receive near time -- realtime -- rather near realtime recovery for about 80% of the $13 billion infrastructure investment we expect to make during that time. As you can see, our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth objectives. 
Slide 9 highlights the key drivers and assumptions in our business plan. As mentioned earlier, that plan assumes $350 million per year in equity issuances and targets additional dividend growth of about 4% annually through 2020. We expect 4% to 6% growth in our domestic utilities from 2017 through 2020. This reflects several things: higher gross margins from additional capital investments in Kentucky; increased transmission spending in Pennsylvania; partially offset by higher depreciation and interest, and the dilution from equity issuance, as I just mentioned. Domestic net income is expected to grow 5% to 7% over the forecast period. 
Meanwhile, we're expecting U.K. earnings growth of 6% to 8%, reflecting the hedges we put in place and our ability to achieve our $1.30 per pound budgeted rate through 2020. In addition to effects of currency, the growth in our U.K. segment is driven by higher gross margins driven by annual price increases and higher pension income due to higher returns on higher pension asset balances, which more than offset the effects of any dilution. 
We continue managing our currency risk proactively, taking steps to improve the risk reward profile and the certainty we will achieve our growth objectives. We can meet 5% EPS growth through 2020 even as the pound drops to $1.13 per pound and we can meet to that growth through 2019 at $0.90 per pound. This is a very significant improvement in our risk reward profile. Vince will provide a detailed update on our foreign currency hedging in his remarks. We're expecting net income for the U.K. segment to now grow in the 8% to 10% range for the forecast period. 
Overall, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver on our projected 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 through 2020. Further, we expect to achieve a very competitive total annual share and a return of 9% to 10% as we execute our plans for growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 10. We know the investment community has a keen interest in the topic of U.S. tax reform, including how any changes may impact PPL and other utilities. For PPL, the 2 primary effects we're tracking are the deductibility of interest expense on our domestic holding company debt and a net effect on rate base at our utilities from the extension of 100% bonus depreciation offset, of course, by a lower tax rate. 
I want to highlight 2 very important points that differentiates PPL from its peers. First, since about half of our business resides in the U.K., we have minimal exposure to tax reform for half of our earnings. 
Second, we have the flexibility to raise capital in the U.K., thereby retaining the ability to deduct interest. 
We support efforts to simplify the U.S. tax code and to lower the federal corporate tax rate to a level that is more competitively -- competitive globally, but speculating on the impact of tax reform is extremely difficult given the lack of detail on current proposals that have been set forth today. 
Our industry has a good track record of working with policymakers to shape meaningful tax-related legislation that minimizes negative impacts to our customers and to our companies. This was true during the last comprehensive tax reform in 1986 as well as during the debate on -- later on taxes related to dividends and capital gains. Our base assumption is that any benefits from the reduction of the tax rate will be passed through to our customers. Therefore, the only real impact on our utilities is the impact on rate base. 
As we think about tax reform, it's important to keep in mind that we have several opportunities in PPL's case to offset potential impacts. We can use the dry powder created by our hedging strategy, we could shift some of holding company debt financings to the U.K. and we have the ability to increase capital spending. 
Of course, the details of any tax reform plan are very hard to predict at this point. But to help frame this up for PPL, I wanted to address a few possible scenarios. First, as it relates to rate base at our domestic utilities, if we're required to adopt 100% expensing of capital, our breakeven tax rate for rate base would be about 20%. 
Regarding deductibility of interest, if the tax rate is reduced to 20% and we retain the ability to deduct interest expense on all debt or if non-deductibility of interest is only applied to new debt, we would see about a $0.05 per share impact to earnings, which we believe we can fully mitigate with the strategies I just talked about. 
If non-deductibility of interest applies to all existing debt, we would see about a $0.10 per share impact to earnings, which we also believe we can largely mitigate through these strategies, especially if the pound stays around $1.20 or above as it is today. 
I'm confident the U.S. tax reform, as it's currently being discussed, is a manageable event for PPL and not a barrier in our ability to meet our stated goal of growing EPS by 5% to 6% through 2020. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed look at our earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 12 for a review of segment earnings. Full year 2016 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2015 earnings of $2.21 per share to $2.45 per share, exceeding the m",1396,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 12 for a review of segment earnings. 
Full year 2016 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2015 earnings of $2.21 per share to $2.45 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.07, placing us at the high end of the forecast range. Each of our operating segments delivered strong growth compared to the prior year. 
The Pennsylvania Regulated segment contributed $0.13 of growth for the year, the Kentucky Regulated segment contributed $0.07 and the U.K. Regulated segment contributed $0.05. Corporate and other remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. 
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact weather had on our results to the full year. Weather really did not have a significant impact on our 2016 earnings performance as it was flat compared to 2015 and it was $0.01 worse than budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2016 segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in 2016, a $0.13 increase compared to 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins as a result of higher distribution base electricity rates effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins from additional capital investments. Higher margins were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset addition.
Moving to Slide 14. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.58 per share in 2016, a $0.07 increase from 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins, which is the net effect of electricity and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and returns on additional environmental capital investments and lower operation and maintenance expense, including the reduction of cost associated with the 2015 coal plant retirements. These net positive results were partially offset by higher financing cost related to the September 2015 debt issuances. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.49 per share in 2016, a $0.05 improvement compared to 2015. Positive factors driving earnings results include higher gross margins primarily driven by an April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by 4 months of lower prices from the April 1, 2015, price decrease. A decrease in O&M primarily from local pension expense and lower U.S. income taxes primarily from the benefit reported in Q4 2016 for the expected utilization of foreign tax credit resulting from our updated business plan. These positive factors were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from asset additions, higher financing cost due to 2015 debt issuances and lower average exchange rates in 2016 compared to 2015. The average rate for 2016 was $1.45 per pound compared to $1.57 per pound for 2015. 
Moving to Slide 16. We've updated our hedging disclosures and made great progress in de-risking our plan related to foreign currency exposure. The chart at the top of the page highlights our contractual hedge levels. And as you can see, we started to layer in hedges for 2019 with 50% already hedged. As Bill mentioned, embedded in the midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.15 per share is about $0.05 of hedge restrikes. We achieved the 50% hedge level for 2019 as of today by executing 4 of the $0.05 of planned restrikes as well as entering into forward contracts for 2019 at rates that were near our budgeted rate of $1.30. As you can see on the slide, the average rate for the 19 hedges is $1.34 per pound compared to our budgeted rate of $1.30. It's important to note that we achieved this 50% hedge level above our budgeted rate without reducing the hedge levels for 2018. 2018 is still hedged at an average rate of $1.42 per pound, well above our budgeted rate, enabling us to still restrike value from 2018 into 2019 and '20. 
Through the strength of our business plan and with the hedges in place for half of 2019, we continue to de-risk '19 and '20 as illustrated in the lower table. This table lays out our ability to hedge 2017 through 2020 at various GBP rate to maintain at least the low end of our earnings growth range of 5% to 6%. 
Effectively, we have no exposure through 2019. The pound could fall as low as $0.90 per pound, and we could still achieve a 5% EPS growth rate through '19. And at a $1.13 per pound, we can achieve that growth through 2020. The additional hedging we have done significantly mitigates our foreign currency exposure related to our U.K. operations. And we believe we have skewed that exposure to the upside with the actions we've taken to date. 
I should also note that tax reform will likely improve this picture even further since we gross up our hedges to cover the current 35% tax rate. If the tax rate is lowered to 20%, we would be 100% hedged for 2018 and about 70% hedged for 2019. 
Also the sensitivities in the bottom table would improve for 2020 as well, with the breakeven rate going from $1.13 per pound down to $1.07. 
Moving to Slide 17. Our planned capital expenditures for 2017 through 2021 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $16 billion over the period. We continue to invest about $1 billion annually in each of our business lines, which includes our previously announced initiatives as well as $1 billion of incremental capital identified for '17 through '20 compared to the prior plan. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, our investment is focused on delivering a sustainable energy future by expanding and modernizing the grid, adding smart grid technology and automation and strengthening physical and cybersecurity. We are also connecting more renewable energy and expanding solar offerings to our customers. 
In Kentucky, we are investing an additional $525 million over the next 4 years despite lower environmental spending of $345 million due to updated scope and timing changes for ELGs and CCR projects. This additional capital includes $320 million through installed advanced meters and $550 million to improve the reliability of electric and gas infrastructure in Kentucky. 
In Pennsylvania, we are investing an additional $310 million in transmission, driven primarily by increased or accelerated project activity, such as line rebuilds, new substations and security. Distribution spending levels in Pennsylvania remain relatively flat. 
We currently project our capital investment to decrease slightly in the outer years as our advanced metering projects are completed in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and our environmental spend in Kentucky ramps down. Consistent with last year's plan, our capital plan is based on identified projects only across the portfolio, and it does not include unidentified growth projects. However, we continually find new capital projects in support of reliability, safety and security. We have a robust pipeline of capital projects, and I believe as we continue to work on the system and develop our future plans, including responding to tax reform, we will identify additional capital spend for the back-end of the plan. 
Moving to Slide 18. Here, we're providing an update to our review of domestic cash flows reflecting 2016 actual results and providing the 2017 projection. 2016's excess cash position of $702 million includes the $310 million of net proceeds received last year from the monetization of the 2017 and '18 earnings hedges following the Brexit referendum. Cash available for distribution is expected to be lower in '17 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower cash inflows from our currency hedges, higher domestic maintenance capital as we continue to invest in the utilities and the lower dividend coming from the U.K. Overall, though, we still expect cash available for distribution to be either breakeven or positive over the forecast period even assuming the dividend grows at 4% per year. 
And finally, turning to Slide 19. We show our updated RPI forecast assumptions using the January 2017 HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy. Our business plan assumptions are in line with these current RPI forecasts. Our sensitivity for a 0.5% movement in 2016, '17 RPI now results in a $0.01 impact out in 2019. As a reminder, this past November, we set our 2018-'19 tariffs based on the forecasted RPI at that time, and that is consistent with Ofgem's guidance. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A. Bill?"

It's pensions actually came in better than we were projecting. If you recall back on the second quarter call when we rebased the earnings post Brexit, we took a very conservative approach on pensions, so they came in stronger than we were expected. And then through income tax planning, we're also seeing some improvement there. And so that created about $0.10 in total of earnings. Half of that went to increasing the growth rate of U.K. and half of it went to create the dry powder that you're seeing on Slide 16.

Starting with Slide 2. Ou",2020,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Starting with Slide 2. Our agenda this morning includes an overview of our 2016 earnings results along with an operational update. Following that, I'm going to address our 2017 earnings forecast and review our projections for long-term earnings growth. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. 
Before I get started, I did want to highlight a few key points of our presentation this morning. We have delivered strong 2016 ongoing earnings, achieving 11% year-over-year growth. We've also raised our dividend by 4% in 2017 with our continued commitment to grow that by 4% annually through 2020. We've also taken steps to further de-risk our 2017 through 2020 plan by significantly reducing our foreign currency risk and reducing our load growth forecast from 0.5% to no load growth. Finally, we also believe that we are well positioned to manage the potential impacts of tax reform. 
Turning to Slide 3. Today, we announced 2016 reported earnings of $2.79 per share compared with $1.01 per share in 2015. Adjusting for special items, our 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, up 11% from 2015 results, which puts us at the high end of our forecast range. For the fourth quarter of 2016, reported earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.60 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.43 a year ago. 
The key drivers of our 11% growth were strong performance across our regulated businesses and a positive tax adjustment of $0.05 per share related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. 
2016 marks seven conservative years that PPL has exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast. As our track record shows, we take great pride in delivering on the commitments we make to our share owners. 
Turning to Slide 4. Backed by the continued strong performance of our utilities, today, we announced we're increasing our common stock dividend on an annualized basis from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share, or a 4% increase. The quarterly dividend of $0.395 per share will be payable April 1 to share owners of record as of March 10. This marks PPL's 15th dividend increase in the last 16 years. 
Let's move to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations. In Kentucky, our rate review continues to proceed as expected before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. This comes after Kentucky Utilities filed a request in late November of last year to increase revenue by a combined $210 million. That includes revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million, respectively, at Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric through adjustments to annual base electricity rates. 
In addition, it includes a revenue increase of $14 million for LG&E through an adjustment to annual base rates -- gas base rates. The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. We've included a schedule for the rate review process in the appendix to today's slides. If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect on July 1, 2017. The company's continuation of the customer experience initiative has resulted in another J.D. Power award in Kentucky. LG&E and KU ranked first and second among midsized utilities in the Midwest region in 2016 calendar year Electric Utility Business Customer Service Satisfaction study. This brings the total number of J.D. Power awards earned by PPL subsidiaries to 42. 
In Pennsylvania, we remain focused on transmission and distribution system improvements with an eye towards reliability and resiliency. We continued to make substantial progress in these areas in 2016. 
As a result of the investments we've made, PPL Electric Utilities today has one of the most robust and advanced distribution automation systems in the country. That system, which was bolstered by the addition of more than 700 smart grid devices last year, avoided more than 100,000 customer interruptions throughout the year. And as a result of investments we've made to modernize and expand our transmission system, sustained transmission outages have dropped by nearly 75% over the last 5 years. PPL Electric Utilities' reliability performance is among the nation's best. We're intent on keeping it that way as we execute our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
In the U.K., we received the final RIIO-ED1 results for the 2015-2016 regulatory year, achieving the highest incentive revenues among the U.K.'s distribution network operators. And customers have rated us the best electricity network in the U.K. with an average customer satisfaction rating of 89%. 
Meanwhile, we remain on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016/2017 regulatory year incentive targets. Details on our projected 2016/2017 incentive revenues is included in the appendix on Pages 24 and 25. 
Turning to Slide 6. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15. 
Moving to Slide 7. We show a walk of the drivers from our 2016 ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast.  I should point out that included in our 2017 forecast is $0.05 of hedge restrikes that move value from 2017 to 2019. Without the restrikes, our EPS forecast would have been $2.20 per share. 
Our 2017 guidance is lower than 26 (sic) [ 2016 ] earnings primarily from a lower foreign currency hedge exchange rate, dilution from issuing additional equity of $250 million per year and tax benefits recorded in 2016 that are not expected to repeat in 2017. 
We've increased our equity issuances in the plan from $100 million to $350 million per year to support the funding of incremental capital spending and to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. This will help us maintain strong credit metrics and also lowers future holding company debt balances, which reduces the potential impact of tax reform as we'll discuss in a moment. 
Moving to Slide 8. PPL continues to invest responsibly in the future. It's that investment, coupled with timely rate recovery in the constructive jurisdictions we operate in, that's driving our 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. Our capital plan of about $3 billion per year is expected to produce compound annual rate base growth of 5.3% from 2017 through 2020 with our rate base growing to $29 billion. We expect to receive near time -- real-time -- rather near real-time recovery for about 80% of the $13 billion infrastructure investment we expect to make during that time. As you can see, our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth objectives. 
Slide 9 highlights the key drivers and assumptions in our business plan. As mentioned earlier, that plan assumes $350 million per year in equity issuances and targets additional dividend growth of about 4% annually through 2020. We expect 4% to 6% growth in our domestic utilities from 2017 through 2020. This reflects several things: higher gross margins from additional capital investments in Kentucky; increased transmission spending in Pennsylvania; partially offset by higher depreciation and interest, and the dilution from equity issuance, as I just mentioned. Domestic net income is expected to grow 5% to 7% over the forecast period. 
Meanwhile, we're expecting U.K. earnings growth of 6% to 8%, reflecting the hedges we put in place and our ability to achieve our $1.30 per pound budgeted rate through 2020. In addition to effects of currency, the growth in our U.K. segment is driven by higher gross margins driven by annual price increases and higher pension income due to higher returns on higher pension asset balances, which more than offset the effects of any dilution. 
We continue managing our currency risk proactively, taking steps to improve the risk/reward profile and the certainty we will achieve our growth objectives. We can meet 5% EPS growth through 2020 even if the pound drops to $1.13 per pound and we can meet to that growth through 2019 at $0.90 per pound. This is a very significant improvement in our risk/reward profile. Vince will provide a detailed update on our foreign currency hedging in his remarks. We're expecting net income for the U.K. segment to now grow in the 8% to 10% range for the forecast period. 
Overall, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver on our projected 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 through 2020. Further, we expect to achieve a very competitive total annual share and a return of 9% to 10% as we execute our plans for growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 10. We know the investment community has a keen interest in the topic of U.S. tax reform, including how any changes may impact PPL and other utilities. For PPL, the 2 primary effects we're tracking are the deductibility of interest expense on our domestic holding company debt and the net effect on rate base at our utilities from the extension of 100% bonus depreciation offset, of course, by a lower tax rate. 
I want to highlight 2 very important points that differentiates PPL from its peers. First, since about half of our business resides in the U.K., we have minimal exposure to tax reform for half of our earnings. 
Second, we have the flexibility to raise capital in the U.K., thereby retaining the ability to deduct interest. 
We support efforts to simplify the U.S. tax code and to lower the federal corporate tax rate to a level that is more competitively -- competitive globally, but speculating on the impact of tax reform is extremely difficult given the lack of detail on current proposals that have been set forth today. 
Our industry has a good track record of working with policymakers to shape meaningful tax-related legislation that minimizes negative impacts to our customers and to our companies. This was true during the last comprehensive tax reform in 1986 as well as during the debate on -- later on taxes related to dividends and capital gains. Our base assumption is that any benefits from the reduction of the tax rate will be passed through to our customers. Therefore, the only real impact on our utilities is the impact on rate base. 
As we think about tax reform, it's important to keep in mind that we have several opportunities in PPL's case to offset potential impacts. We can use the dry powder created by our hedging strategy, we could shift some of holding company debt financings to the U.K. and we have the ability to increase capital spending. 
Of course, the details of any tax reform plan are very hard to predict at this point. But to help frame this up for PPL, I wanted to address a few possible scenarios. First, as it relates to rate base at our domestic utilities, if we're required to adopt 100% expensing of capital, our breakeven tax rate for rate base would be about 20%. 
Regarding deductibility of interest, if the tax rate is reduced to 20% and we retain the ability to deduct interest expense on all debt or if non-deductibility of interest is only applied to new debt, we would see about a $0.05 per share impact to earnings, which we believe we can fully mitigate with the strategies I just talked about. 
If non-deductibility of interest applies to all existing debt, we would see about a $0.10 per share impact to earnings, which we also believe we can largely mitigate through these strategies, especially if the pound stays around $1.20 or above as it is today. 
I'm confident that U.S. tax reform as it's currently being discussed is a manageable event for PPL and not a barrier in our ability to meet our stated goal of growing EPS by 5% to 6% through 2020. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed look at our earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 12 for a review of segment earnings. Full year 2016 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2015 earnings of $2.21 per share to $2.45 per share, exceeding the m",1395,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 12 for a review of segment earnings. 
Full year 2016 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2015 earnings of $2.21 per share to $2.45 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.07, placing us at the high end of the forecast range. Each of our operating segments delivered strong growth compared to the prior year. 
The Pennsylvania Regulated segment contributed $0.13 of growth for the year, the Kentucky Regulated segment contributed $0.07 and the U.K. Regulated segment contributed $0.05. Corporate and other remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. 
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact weather had on our results for the full year. Weather really did not have a significant impact on our 2016 earnings performance as it was flat compared to 2015 and it was $0.01 worse than budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2016 segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in 2016, a $0.13 increase compared to 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins as a result of higher distribution base electricity rates effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins from additional capital investments. Higher margins were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Moving to Slide 14. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.58 per share in 2016, a $0.07 increase from 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins, which is the net effect of electricity and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and returns on additional environmental capital investments and lower operation and maintenance expense, including the reduction of cost associated with the 2015 coal plant retirements. These net positive results were partially offset by higher financing costs related to the September 2015 debt issuances. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.49 per share in 2016, a $0.05 improvement compared to 2015. Positive factors driving earnings results include higher gross margins primarily driven by an April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by 4 months of lower prices from the April 1, 2015, price decrease, a decrease in O&M primarily from lower pension expense and lower U.S. income taxes primarily from the benefit reported in Q4 2016 for the expected utilization of foreign tax credits resulting from our updated business plan. These positive factors were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from asset additions, higher financing cost due to 2015 debt issuances and lower average exchange rates in 2016 compared to 2015. The average rate for 2016 was $1.45 per pound compared to $1.57 per pound for 2015. 
Moving to Slide 16. We've updated our hedging disclosures and made great progress in de-risking our plan related to foreign currency exposure. The chart at the top of the page highlights our contractual hedge levels. And as you can see, we started to layer in hedges for 2019 with 50% already hedged. As Bill mentioned, embedded in the midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.15 per share is about $0.05 of hedge restrikes. We achieved a 50% hedge level for 2019 as of today by executing $0.04 of the $0.05 of planned restrikes as well as entering into forward contracts for 2019 at rates that were near our budgeted rate of $1.30. As you can see on the slide, the average rate for the 19 hedges is $1.34 per pound compared to our budgeted rate of $1.30. It's important to note that we achieved this 50% hedge level above our budgeted rate without reducing the hedge levels for 2018. 2018 is still hedged at an average rate of $1.42 per pound, well above our budgeted rate, enabling us to still restrike value from 2018 into 2019 and '20. 
Through the strength of our business plan and with the hedges in place for half of 2019, we continue to de-risk '19 and '20 as illustrated in the lower table. This table lays out our ability to hedge 2017 through 2020 at various GBP rate to maintain at least the low end of our earnings growth range of 5% to 6%. 
Effectively, we have no exposure through 2019. The pound could fall as low as $0.90 per pound and we could still achieve a 5% EPS growth rate through '19. And at a $1.13 per pound, we can achieve that growth through 2020. The additional hedging we have done significantly mitigates our foreign currency exposure related to our U.K. operations. And we believe we have skewed that exposure to the upside with the actions we've taken to date. 
I should also note that tax reform will likely improve this picture even further since we gross up our hedges to cover the current 35% tax rate. If the tax rate is lowered to 20%, we would be 100% hedged for 2018 and about 70% hedged for 2019. 
Also the sensitivities in the bottom table would improve for 2020 as well, with the breakeven rate going from $1.13 per pound down to $1.07. 
Moving to Slide 17. Our planned capital expenditures for 2017 through 2021 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $16 billion over the period. We continue to invest about $1 billion annually in each of our business lines, which includes our previously announced initiatives as well as $1 billion of incremental capital identified for '17 through '20 compared to the prior plan. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, our investments focus on delivering a sustainable energy future by expanding and modernizing the grid, adding smart grid technology and automation and strengthening physical and cybersecurity. We are also connecting more renewable energy and expanding solar offerings to our customers. 
In Kentucky, we are investing an additional $525 million over the next 4 years despite lower environmental spending of $345 million due to updated scope and timing changes for ELGs and CCR projects. This additional capital includes $320 million to installed advanced meters and $550 million to improve the reliability of electric and gas infrastructure in Kentucky. 
In Pennsylvania, we are investing an additional $310 million in transmission, driven primarily by increased or accelerated project activity such as line rebuilds, new substations and security. Distribution spending levels in Pennsylvania remain relatively flat. 
We currently project our capital investment to decrease slightly in the outer years as our advanced metering projects are completed in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and our environmental spend in Kentucky ramps down. Consistent with last year's plan, our capital plan is based on identified projects only across the portfolio, and it does not include unidentified growth projects. However, we continually find new capital projects in support of reliability, safety and security. We have a robust pipeline of capital projects, and I believe as we continue to work on the system and develop our future plans, including responding to tax reform, we will identify additional capital spend for the back-end of the plan. 
Moving to Slide 18. Here, we're providing an update to our view of domestic cash flows reflecting 2016 actual results and providing the 2017 projection. 2016's excess cash position of $702 million includes the $310 million of net proceeds received last year from the monetization of the 2017 and '18 earnings hedges following the Brexit referendum. Cash available for distribution is expected to be lower in '17 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower cash inflows from our currency hedges, higher domestic maintenance capital as we continue to invest in the utilities and the lower dividend coming from the U.K. Overall, though, we still expect cash available for distribution to be either breakeven or positive over the forecast period even assuming the dividend grows at 4% per year. 
And finally, turning to Slide 19. We show our updated RPI forecast assumptions using the January 2017 HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy. Our business plan assumptions are in line with these current RPI forecasts. Our sensitivity for a 0.5% movement in 2016, '17 RPI now results in a $0.01 impact out in 2019. As a reminder, this past November, we set our 2018-'19 tariffs based on the forecasted RPI at that time, and that is consistent with Ofgem's guidance. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A. Bill?"

And I'm equally excited about our future as we continue to advance a smarter, cleaner and more reliable energy infrastructure. 
At the outset of the year, we established our earnings forecasts. In the end, we delivered, achieving the high end of that forecast range. As 2016 began, we said we would begin to grow our dividend more meaningfully in 2017. Today, we have delivered, announcing a 4% dividend increase. 
We established also a plan to invest more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2016. Again, we delivered. It's what we do, we deliver. And looking ahead, we are very well positioned to continue to deliver on the commitments we've made to our share owners and customers. 
PPL is uniquely advantaged with operations in the U.K., with only half of our earnings subject to potential U.S. tax reform and our ability to optimize the capital structure relative to interest deductibility. And as Vince noted in his remarks, we believe we're now positively positioned with the company's exposure to the British pound given our hedging activity to date, which could also be used to mitigate any potential negative impacts of U.S. tax reform.

And then through income tax planning, we're also seeing some improvement there. And so that created about $0.10 in total of earnings.

Starting with Slide 2. Ou",2020,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Starting with Slide 2. Our agenda this morning includes an overview of our 2016 earnings results along with an operational update. Following that, I'm going to address our 2017 earnings forecast and review our projections for long-term earnings growth. Following my remarks, Vince will review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial overview. 
Before I get started, I did want to highlight a few key points of our presentation this morning. We have delivered strong 2016 ongoing earnings, achieving 11% year-over-year growth. We've also raised our dividend by 4% in 2017 with our continued commitment to grow that by 4% annually through 2020. We've also taken steps to further de-risk our 2017 through 2020 plan by significantly reducing our foreign currency risk and reducing our load growth forecast from 0.5% to no load growth. Finally, we also believe that we are well positioned to manage the potential impacts of tax reform. 
Turning to Slide 3. Today, we announced 2016 reported earnings of $2.79 per share compared with $1.01 per share in 2015. Adjusting for special items, our 2016 earnings from ongoing operations were $2.45 per share, up 11% from 2015 results, which puts us at the high end of our forecast range. For the fourth quarter of 2016, reported earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.59 per share a year ago. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $0.60 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.43 a year ago. 
The key drivers of our 11% growth were strong performance across our regulated businesses and a positive tax adjustment of $0.05 per share related to the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. 
2016 marks seven conservative years that PPL has exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast. As our track record shows, we take great pride in delivering on the commitments we make to our share owners. 
Turning to Slide 4. Backed by the continued strong performance of our utilities, today, we announced we're increasing our common stock dividend on an annualized basis from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share, or a 4% increase. The quarterly dividend of $0.395 per share will be payable April 1 to share owners of record as of March 10. This marks PPL's 15th dividend increase in the last 16 years. 
Let's move to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations. In Kentucky, our rate review continues to proceed as expected before the Kentucky Public Service Commission. This comes after Kentucky Utilities filed a request in late November of last year to increase revenue by a combined $210 million. That includes revenue increases of $103 million and $93 million, respectively, at Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric through adjustments to annual base electricity rates. 
In addition, it includes a revenue increase of $14 million for LG&E through an adjustment to annual base rates -- gas base rates. The requested increases are driven by additional capital investments to make the grid smarter, more reliable and more resilient. We've included a schedule for the rate review process in the appendix to today's slides. If approved by the commission, the increases would take effect on July 1, 2017. The company's continuation of the customer experience initiative has resulted in another J.D. Power award in Kentucky. LG&E and KU ranked first and second among midsized utilities in the Midwest region in 2016 calendar year Electric Utility Business Customer Service Satisfaction study. This brings the total number of J.D. Power awards earned by PPL subsidiaries to 42. 
In Pennsylvania, we remain focused on transmission and distribution system improvements with an eye towards reliability and resiliency. We continued to make substantial progress in these areas in 2016. 
As a result of the investments we've made, PPL Electric Utilities today has one of the most robust and advanced distribution automation systems in the country. That system, which was bolstered by the addition of more than 700 smart grid devices last year, avoided more than 100,000 customer interruptions throughout the year. And as a result of investments we've made to modernize and expand our transmission system, sustained transmission outages have dropped by nearly 75% over the last 5 years. PPL Electric Utilities' reliability performance is among the nation's best. We're intent on keeping it that way as we execute our plans for 2017 and beyond. 
In the U.K., we received the final RIIO-ED1 results for the 2015-2016 regulatory year, achieving the highest incentive revenues among the U.K.'s distribution network operators. And customers have rated us the best electricity network in the U.K. with an average customer satisfaction rating of 89%. 
Meanwhile, we remain on pace to achieve our projected performance against the 2016/2017 regulatory year incentive targets. Details on our projected 2016/2017 incentive revenues is included in the appendix on Pages 24 and 25. 
Turning to Slide 6. We are reaffirming our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15. 
Moving to Slide 7. We show a walk of the drivers from our 2016 ongoing earnings of $2.45 per share to the $2.15 per share midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast.  I should point out that included in our 2017 forecast is $0.05 of hedge restrikes that move value from 2017 to 2019. Without the restrikes, our EPS forecast would have been $2.20 per share. 
Our 2017 guidance is lower than 26 (sic) [ 2016 ] earnings primarily from a lower foreign currency hedge exchange rate, dilution from issuing additional equity of $250 million per year and tax benefits recorded in 2016 that are not expected to repeat in 2017. 
We've increased our equity issuances in the plan from $100 million to $350 million per year to support the funding of incremental capital spending and to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. This will help us maintain strong credit metrics and also lowers future holding company debt balances, which reduces the potential impact of tax reform as we'll discuss in a moment. 
Moving to Slide 8. PPL continues to invest responsibly in the future. It's that investment, coupled with timely rate recovery in the constructive jurisdictions we operate in, that's driving our 5% to 6% earnings per share growth. Our capital plan of about $3 billion per year is expected to produce compound annual rate base growth of 5.3% from 2017 through 2020 with our rate base growing to $29 billion. We expect to receive near time -- real-time -- rather near real-time recovery for about 80% of the $13 billion infrastructure investment we expect to make during that time. As you can see, our core business is growing in support of our longer-term growth objectives. 
Slide 9 highlights the key drivers and assumptions in our business plan. As mentioned earlier, that plan assumes $350 million per year in equity issuances and targets additional dividend growth of about 4% annually through 2020. We expect 4% to 6% growth in our domestic utilities from 2017 through 2020. This reflects several things: higher gross margins from additional capital investments in Kentucky; increased transmission spending in Pennsylvania; partially offset by higher depreciation and interest, and the dilution from equity issuance, as I just mentioned. Domestic net income is expected to grow 5% to 7% over the forecast period. 
Meanwhile, we're expecting U.K. earnings growth of 6% to 8%, reflecting the hedges we put in place and our ability to achieve our $1.30 per pound budgeted rate through 2020. In addition to effects of currency, the growth in our U.K. segment is driven by higher gross margins driven by annual price increases and higher pension income due to higher returns on higher pension asset balances, which more than offset the effects of any dilution. 
We continue managing our currency risk proactively, taking steps to improve the risk/reward profile and the certainty we will achieve our growth objectives. We can meet 5% EPS growth through 2020 even if the pound drops to $1.13 per pound and we can meet to that growth through 2019 at $0.90 per pound. This is a very significant improvement in our risk/reward profile. Vince will provide a detailed update on our foreign currency hedging in his remarks. We're expecting net income for the U.K. segment to now grow in the 8% to 10% range for the forecast period. 
Overall, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver on our projected 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 through 2020. Further, we expect to achieve a very competitive total annual share and a return of 9% to 10% as we execute our plans for growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 10. We know the investment community has a keen interest in the topic of U.S. tax reform, including how any changes may impact PPL and other utilities. For PPL, the 2 primary effects we're tracking are the deductibility of interest expense on our domestic holding company debt and the net effect on rate base at our utilities from the extension of 100% bonus depreciation offset, of course, by a lower tax rate. 
I want to highlight 2 very important points that differentiates PPL from its peers. First, since about half of our business resides in the U.K., we have minimal exposure to tax reform for half of our earnings. 
Second, we have the flexibility to raise capital in the U.K., thereby retaining the ability to deduct interest. 
We support efforts to simplify the U.S. tax code and to lower the federal corporate tax rate to a level that is more competitively -- competitive globally, but speculating on the impact of tax reform is extremely difficult given the lack of detail on current proposals that have been set forth today. 
Our industry has a good track record of working with policymakers to shape meaningful tax-related legislation that minimizes negative impacts to our customers and to our companies. This was true during the last comprehensive tax reform in 1986 as well as during the debate on -- later on taxes related to dividends and capital gains. Our base assumption is that any benefits from the reduction of the tax rate will be passed through to our customers. Therefore, the only real impact on our utilities is the impact on rate base. 
As we think about tax reform, it's important to keep in mind that we have several opportunities in PPL's case to offset potential impacts. We can use the dry powder created by our hedging strategy, we could shift some of holding company debt financings to the U.K. and we have the ability to increase capital spending. 
Of course, the details of any tax reform plan are very hard to predict at this point. But to help frame this up for PPL, I wanted to address a few possible scenarios. First, as it relates to rate base at our domestic utilities, if we're required to adopt 100% expensing of capital, our breakeven tax rate for rate base would be about 20%. 
Regarding deductibility of interest, if the tax rate is reduced to 20% and we retain the ability to deduct interest expense on all debt or if non-deductibility of interest is only applied to new debt, we would see about a $0.05 per share impact to earnings, which we believe we can fully mitigate with the strategies I just talked about. 
If non-deductibility of interest applies to all existing debt, we would see about a $0.10 per share impact to earnings, which we also believe we can largely mitigate through these strategies, especially if the pound stays around $1.20 or above as it is today. 
I'm confident that U.S. tax reform as it's currently being discussed is a manageable event for PPL and not a barrier in our ability to meet our stated goal of growing EPS by 5% to 6% through 2020. 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed look at our earnings. Vince?"
185508,417105823,1121569,"PPL Corporation, 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2017",2017-02-01,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 12 for a review of segment earnings. Full year 2016 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2015 earnings of $2.21 per share to $2.45 per share, exceeding the m",1395,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 12 for a review of segment earnings. 
Full year 2016 earnings from ongoing operations increased over the prior year from 2015 earnings of $2.21 per share to $2.45 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.07, placing us at the high end of the forecast range. Each of our operating segments delivered strong growth compared to the prior year. 
The Pennsylvania Regulated segment contributed $0.13 of growth for the year, the Kentucky Regulated segment contributed $0.07 and the U.K. Regulated segment contributed $0.05. Corporate and other remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. 
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact weather had on our results for the full year. Weather really did not have a significant impact on our 2016 earnings performance as it was flat compared to 2015 and it was $0.01 worse than budget. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2016 segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 13. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.50 per share in 2016, a $0.13 increase compared to 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins as a result of higher distribution base electricity rates effective January 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins from additional capital investments. Higher margins were partially offset by higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Moving to Slide 14. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.58 per share in 2016, a $0.07 increase from 2015. This increase was due to higher gross margins, which is the net effect of electricity and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and returns on additional environmental capital investments and lower operation and maintenance expense, including the reduction of cost associated with the 2015 coal plant retirements. These net positive results were partially offset by higher financing costs related to the September 2015 debt issuances. 
Moving to Slide 15. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.49 per share in 2016, a $0.05 improvement compared to 2015. Positive factors driving earnings results include higher gross margins primarily driven by an April 1, 2016, price increase, partially offset by 4 months of lower prices from the April 1, 2015, price decrease, a decrease in O&M primarily from lower pension expense and lower U.S. income taxes primarily from the benefit reported in Q4 2016 for the expected utilization of foreign tax credits resulting from our updated business plan. These positive factors were partially offset by increased depreciation expense from asset additions, higher financing cost due to 2015 debt issuances and lower average exchange rates in 2016 compared to 2015. The average rate for 2016 was $1.45 per pound compared to $1.57 per pound for 2015. 
Moving to Slide 16. We've updated our hedging disclosures and made great progress in de-risking our plan related to foreign currency exposure. The chart at the top of the page highlights our contractual hedge levels. And as you can see, we started to layer in hedges for 2019 with 50% already hedged. As Bill mentioned, embedded in the midpoint of our 2017 earnings forecast of $2.15 per share is about $0.05 of hedge restrikes. We achieved a 50% hedge level for 2019 as of today by executing $0.04 of the $0.05 of planned restrikes as well as entering into forward contracts for 2019 at rates that were near our budgeted rate of $1.30. As you can see on the slide, the average rate for the 19 hedges is $1.34 per pound compared to our budgeted rate of $1.30. It's important to note that we achieved this 50% hedge level above our budgeted rate without reducing the hedge levels for 2018. 2018 is still hedged at an average rate of $1.42 per pound, well above our budgeted rate, enabling us to still restrike value from 2018 into 2019 and '20. 
Through the strength of our business plan and with the hedges in place for half of 2019, we continue to de-risk '19 and '20 as illustrated in the lower table. This table lays out our ability to hedge 2017 through 2020 at various GBP rate to maintain at least the low end of our earnings growth range of 5% to 6%. 
Effectively, we have no exposure through 2019. The pound could fall as low as $0.90 per pound and we could still achieve a 5% EPS growth rate through '19. And at a $1.13 per pound, we can achieve that growth through 2020. The additional hedging we have done significantly mitigates our foreign currency exposure related to our U.K. operations. And we believe we have skewed that exposure to the upside with the actions we've taken to date. 
I should also note that tax reform will likely improve this picture even further since we gross up our hedges to cover the current 35% tax rate. If the tax rate is lowered to 20%, we would be 100% hedged for 2018 and about 70% hedged for 2019. 
Also the sensitivities in the bottom table would improve for 2020 as well, with the breakeven rate going from $1.13 per pound down to $1.07. 
Moving to Slide 17. Our planned capital expenditures for 2017 through 2021 are detailed on this slide, with infrastructure investment totaling $16 billion over the period. We continue to invest about $1 billion annually in each of our business lines, which includes our previously announced initiatives as well as $1 billion of incremental capital identified for '17 through '20 compared to the prior plan. 
As Bill mentioned earlier, our investments focus on delivering a sustainable energy future by expanding and modernizing the grid, adding smart grid technology and automation and strengthening physical and cybersecurity. We are also connecting more renewable energy and expanding solar offerings to our customers. 
In Kentucky, we are investing an additional $525 million over the next 4 years despite lower environmental spending of $345 million due to updated scope and timing changes for ELGs and CCR projects. This additional capital includes $320 million to installed advanced meters and $550 million to improve the reliability of electric and gas infrastructure in Kentucky. 
In Pennsylvania, we are investing an additional $310 million in transmission, driven primarily by increased or accelerated project activity such as line rebuilds, new substations and security. Distribution spending levels in Pennsylvania remain relatively flat. 
We currently project our capital investment to decrease slightly in the outer years as our advanced metering projects are completed in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and our environmental spend in Kentucky ramps down. Consistent with last year's plan, our capital plan is based on identified projects only across the portfolio, and it does not include unidentified growth projects. However, we continually find new capital projects in support of reliability, safety and security. We have a robust pipeline of capital projects, and I believe as we continue to work on the system and develop our future plans, including responding to tax reform, we will identify additional capital spend for the back-end of the plan. 
Moving to Slide 18. Here, we're providing an update to our view of domestic cash flows reflecting 2016 actual results and providing the 2017 projection. 2016's excess cash position of $702 million includes the $310 million of net proceeds received last year from the monetization of the 2017 and '18 earnings hedges following the Brexit referendum. Cash available for distribution is expected to be lower in '17 compared to 2016, primarily due to lower cash inflows from our currency hedges, higher domestic maintenance capital as we continue to invest in the utilities and the lower dividend coming from the U.K. Overall, though, we still expect cash available for distribution to be either breakeven or positive over the forecast period even assuming the dividend grows at 4% per year. 
And finally, turning to Slide 19. We show our updated RPI forecast assumptions using the January 2017 HM Treasury forecast of the U.K. economy. Our business plan assumptions are in line with these current RPI forecasts. Our sensitivity for a 0.5% movement in 2016, '17 RPI now results in a $0.01 impact out in 2019. As a reminder, this past November, we set our 2018-'19 tariffs based on the forecasted RPI at that time, and that is consistent with Ofgem's guidance. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call over to Bill for the Q&A. Bill?"

At the outset of the year, we established our earnings forecasts. In the end, we delivered, achieving the high end of that forecast range. As 2016 began, we said we would begin to grow our dividend more meaningfully in 2017. Today, we have delivered, announcing a 4% dividend increase. 
We established also a plan to invest more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2016. Again, we delivered. It's what we do, we deliver. And looking ahead, we are very well positioned to continue to deliver on the commitments we've made to our share owners and customers. 
PPL is uniquely advantaged with operations in the U.K., with only half of our earnings subject to potential U.S. tax reform and our ability to optimize the capital structure relative to interest deductibility. And as Vince noted in his remarks, we believe we're now positively positioned with the company's exposure to the British pound given our hedging activity to date, which could also be used to mitigate any potential negative impacts of U.S. tax reform.

So I think in the third quarter, we talked about the property taxes coming way down from what we were originally expected -- sorry, expecting. We did not take credit for that, as you recall, on third quarter because we wanted to wait till the plan was completed. And so there's really 3 main items that are driving the dry powder that we created to get to these much lower rates that you're seeing on Slide 16. It's the property taxes. It's pensions actually came in better than we were projecting. If you recall back on the second quarter call when we rebased the earnings post Brexit, we took a very conservative approach on pensions, so they came in stronger than we were expected. And then through income tax planning, we're also seeing some improvement there. And so that created about $0.10 in total of earnings. Half of that went to increasing the growth rate of the U.K. and half of it went to create the dry powder that you're seeing on Slide 16. So maybe just to append to your earlier question on what happens if the pound goes up, well, if we don't need all that dry powder, I would suspect earnings would be up $0.05 a year going through the period."

We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.Moving to Slide 2, our agenda",1060,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Moving to Slide 2, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our first quarter 2017 earnings results, a discussion of our 2017 earnings forecast and a brief operational overview. 
Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary will provide an update on our U.K. incentive performance. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review, then we will take your questions.
Turning to Slide 3, today, we announced first quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.59 per share, compared with $0.71 per share from our first quarter 2016 results.
Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.62 per share, compared with $0.67 per share a year ago.  This reduction in earnings was driven primarily by lower foreign currency exchange rates, as expected, partially offset by an April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K. An unusually mild winter in Kentucky also negatively impacted earnings. The State of Kentucky, in fact, experienced its warmest February on record.
I'm pleased with our first quarter results, and despite the abnormally warm winter, we are off to a strong start to the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance.
Let's move to Slide 4, which highlights our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast.
Today, we are affirming -- reaffirming our 2017 forecast of earnings from ongoing operations of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share.
Looking beyond 2017, we remain confident in our ability to deliver overall compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020.
As we have highlighted on the year-end call, we expect 4% to 6% compound annual growth in our U.S. utilities from 2017 through 2020, and 6% to 8% growth in the U.K.
The drivers of these growth are summarized in the appendix on Slide 21 and are consistent with the growth drivers discussed on the year-end call.
We have significantly reduced our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates through our ongoing hedging program, as we've increased our hedge levels even further during the first quarter.
While the British government formally began its exit from the European Union, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term growth, even if exchange rates were to fall well below today's current levels. However, the pound-to-dollar exchange rate has been very stable since the U.K. officially began the Brexit process on March 29. In fact, the exchange rate has actually strengthened some, with current rates around $1.29 per pound.
Vince will provide you with an update to our hedge status during his remarks, but I will highlight now that with the additional hedging we did since year-end, we can achieve at least the low end of our 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth range, even if the pound falls to $1.05.
Delivering on our commitments really comes down to execution, and that is something that we have demonstrated over the years, which is a clear strength for PPL.
As we've discussed in the past, we have a very straightforward business plan, which we believe is low risk. And as noted on the slide, we continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year from 2017 through 2020, having delivered on that commitment earlier this year by increasing the annualized dividend in February from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share.
Overall, we continue to maintain one of the strongest dividend yields in our sector, while maintaining our investment-grade credit metrics.
Now let's move to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations.
In Kentucky, our rate review before the Kentucky Public Service Commission continues to move forward as we reach settlement agreements in April with all of the parties involved. The settlements are subject to approval by the Kentucky Commission. If approved, it will result in a total annual revenue increase of $122 million for our Kentucky utilities. The settlement also includes other adjustments that relate to the timing of cost recovery, such as depreciation rates.
The settlements provide for the ability to invest in intelligent control equipment that will enhance reliability and enable faster restoration of service. It also will give Louisville Gas and Electric the ability to improve natural gas safety and reliability by replacing the aging natural gas service -- field service lines, with new plastic lines that run from the street to our customers' homes.
As part of the proposed agreement, the companies have agreed to withdraw the current request for a full deployment of advanced meters, and we will establish a collaborative with the interested party to address issues raised with that proposal. This will result in the removal or deferral of just over $300 million in total capital expenditures from the 2017 through 2019 capital plan.
The settlement proposal includes an authorized 9.75% return on equity using our filed capital structure. The agreement gives us the ability to enhance our reliability and continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers.
A public hearing on the rate review is scheduled to begin on May 9. An order in the case from the Kentucky Public Service Commission is still expected on or around June 30, with new rates going into effect on July 1 of this year.
In Pennsylvania, PPL reached a new 5-year labor agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1600. The agreement ratified by bargaining unit members in March will take effect May 22. It continues our long-standing practice of providing competitive wages and benefits for our employees. We believe it is also in the best interest of PPL shareowners and our customers.
In the U.K., as I mentioned earlier, Article 50 was invoked on March 29, which formally began the process of the U.K. exiting the European Union. That process is expected to take up to 2 years to complete.
As we've discussed in the past, we expect no changes to our U.K. operations as a result of the exit.
I will now turn the call over to Robert Symons to provide an update on WPD's performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets. Robert?"

Leading to Slide 6, March 31, 2017 marked the completion of second regulatory year under RIIO-ED1. And on the next 2 slides, I'll provide an update on our full year performance on interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction.
Let me start by saying WPD has had another successful year in achieving its outputs. We focused on delivering excellent customer service. And once again, have been ranked the top 4 distribution network operators in customer satisfaction.
We also continue to focus on restoring power promptly as interruptions occur. Clear management attention on supply restoration and commitment by staff at all levels, has led to significant performance improvements.
Network reliability is a high priority for WPD. Over the 8-year RIIO-ED1 period, we've committed to reducing the number of power cuts that customers experience by 16% compared to 2013, '14 levels, restoring supply 23% quicker when power cuts occur and ensuring that a minimum of 85% of customers have their power restored within an hour of an HV fault occurring.
As a result of our efforts, our performance for the regulatory year 2016, '17, is estimated to result in $95 million of incentive revenues for the interruption incentive revenues for and the broad measure of customer Satisfaction, which is slightly better than the midpoint of our prior guidance.
Now turning to Slide 7. On this slide, you will find the detail of our full year results against performance targets set by Ofgem. Our strong performance this year will result in receiving 82% of the maximum payout.
This year, our operational efforts contributing to this success included an unwavering staff effort at all levels on a speedy supply restoration; a thorough inspection of maintenance work program; several major asset replacement project; and increased investment in network automation and improved network sensing.
As it relates to the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction, we are proud to have maintained our top 4 positions for customer service and stakeholder engagement, and we are committed to continuing this level of service over the course of RIIO-ED1.
As shown back on Slide 6, we've increased our calendar year 2018 incentive potential from between $80 million and $100 million to between $95 million and $105 million. This increase is driven by our 2016, '17 performance and now includes about $6 million for the Time to Connect incentive. 
The time to connect incentive is intended to encourage distribution network operators to reduce the overall time to connect smaller low voltage connections to the network. These amounts are internal estimates and to the final determination is received from Ofgem in November 2017.
Overall, we have performed in line with our expectations.
And as we began the new regulatory year, we expect performance closely in line with the prior year and project $95 million to $115 million in calendar year 2019, with a similar expectation for 2020.
Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at segment earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 9 for a more detailed review of our first quarter earnings.First quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.05 over the prior year, driven by lower earnings from the Pennsy",974,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 9 for a more detailed review of our first quarter earnings.
First quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.05 over the prior year, driven by lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment of $0.02 and $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segment. 
Corporate and other was lower by $0.07, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes. For those in the call that are well versed in tax accounting, this is just the result of the quarterly APV 28 adjustment, which will reverse over the remainder of the year.
This lower earnings were partially offset by an improvement in the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.06. 
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact domestic weather had on our results compared to last year and compared to our plan.
Compared to last year, mild temperatures during the first quarter of 2017 had an unfavorable $0.02 impact for our Kentucky segment, with heating degree days about 27% lower than normal in the quarter.
The impacts of weather in Pennsylvania were relatively flat, year-over-year. Compared to our plan, domestic weather had a negative $0.03 impact. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2017 segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 10.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. This result was due to higher operation and maintenance expense in primarily to timing and higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Higher transmission margins from additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission systems demand in 2017. However, transmission margins for the full year are still forecasted to be in line with our original expectation.
Moving to Slide 11, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was due to lower gross margins as a result of lower sales volumes due to the unfavorable weather that I talked about earlier.
Moving to Slide 12, our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.45 per share in 2017, a $0.06 improvement compared to a year ago. This was primarily due to higher gross margins, driven mostly by the April 1, 2016 price increase. In addition, lower results from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 were offset by a decrease in O&M, primarily from lower pension expense and the timing of network maintenance expense and lower income taxes as a result of pre-funding pension contributions into our various U.K. pension plan.
Part of the reason for the pre-funding of the plans was to take advantage of tax deductions at the higher statutory rate of 20%, which was effective to March 31, versus 19% which became effective April 1. This positive tax results enabled us to restrike $0.04 of 2017 earnings in the first quarter, adding additional U.K. earnings hedges in 2019 without impacting the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.15 per share.
Moving to Slide 13, since our year-end call, we continued to layer on additional hedges. We are now contractually hedged 100% for 2017 at an average rate of $1.21 per pound, and we are 99% hedged toward '18 and '19 at average rates of $1.41 and $1.32 per pound, respectively.
As a reminder, every penny in the FX rate above our budgeted rate of $1.30 represents about $0.01 in earnings per share.
So just for 2018 and '19, we have about $0.13 of additional hedge value above our budgeted rate.
The additional hedge value that gives us so much confidence in our ability to meet our earnings guidance target even to 2020 is still contractually unhedged. And just to reiterate what this bottom table shows, if we were to use all the additional hedge value, we could still achieve our minimum 5% growth rate through 2020, even if market rates drop to $1.05 per pound.
However, at current exchange rates, we would not need to use all of these value to achieve our earnings growth targets. And in fact, the EPS growth rate would be at the high end of our 5% to 6% growth range and the additional hedge value would be available for other purposes. 
The hedge program we've developed was designed to protect us against downside risk of the pound losing value, so it also provides us with a lot of upside opportunity if the pound remains at current levels or even strengthens.
Based on the current hedge levels, our view is that this risk reward proposition is now skewed much more to the upside than to the downside.
Moving to Slide 14, we provided an illustration of the high, medium and low currency forecast from up to 17 financial institutions. These forecast do not represent PPL's internal forecast or our planning assumption.
But you can see from the chart, even the various view is around $1.40 per pound for 2020 and the Polish case is much higher. And as I said, to the extent exchange rates remain at current levels or move consistent with these estimates, the additional value created in our plan will not be needed in 2020 and could be used for a variety of purposes, including mitigating potential tax reform or hedging future years beyond 2020.
And finally, turning to Slide 15. We continue -- we show our updated RPI forecast in recent months, we have seen RPI rates strengthen above our business plan assumptions. We believe RPI now represents some upside potential to the plan, but as you can see from the sensitivity table, it's not likely to be too significant. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Moving to Slide 2, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our first quarter 2017 earnings results, a discussion of our 2017 earnings forecast and a brief operational overview. 
Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary will provide an update on our U.K. incentive performance. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review, then we will take your questions.
Turning to Slide 3, today, we announced first quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.59 per share, compared with $0.71 per share from our first quarter 2016 results.
Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.62 per share, compared with $0.67 per share a year ago.  This reduction in earnings was driven primarily by lower foreign currency exchange rates, as expected, partially offset by an April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K. An unusually mild winter in Kentucky also negatively impacted earnings. The State of Kentucky, in fact, experienced its warmest February on record.
I'm pleased with our first quarter results, and despite the abnormally warm winter, we are off to a strong start to the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance.
Let's move to Slide 4, which highlights our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast.
Today, we are affirming -- reaffirming our 2017 forecast of earnings from ongoing operations of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share.
Looking beyond 2017, we remain confident in our ability to deliver overall compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020.
As we have highlighted on the year-end call, we expect 4% to 6% compound annual growth in our U.S. utilities from 2017 through 2020, and 6% to 8% growth in the U.K.
The drivers of these growth are summarized in the appendix on Slide 21 and are consistent with the growth drivers discussed on the year-end call.
We have significantly reduced our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates through our ongoing hedging program, as we've increased our hedge levels even further during the first quarter.
While the British government formally began its exit from the European Union, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term growth, even if exchange rates were to fall well below today's current levels. However, the pound-to-dollar exchange rate has been very stable since the U.K. officially began the Brexit process on March 29. In fact, the exchange rate has actually strengthened some, with current rates around $1.29 per pound.
Vince will provide you with an update to our hedge status during his remarks, but I will highlight now that with the additional hedging we did since year-end, we can achieve at least the low end of our 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth range, even if the pound falls to $1.05.
Delivering on our commitments really comes down to execution, and that is something that we have demonstrated over the years, which is a clear strength for PPL.
As we've discussed in the past, we have a very straightforward business plan, which we believe is low risk. And as noted on the slide, we continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year from 2017 through 2020, having delivered on that commitment earlier this year by increasing the annualized dividend in February from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share.
Overall, we continue to maintain one of the strongest dividend yields in our sector, while maintaining our investment-grade credit metrics.
Now let's move to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations.
In Kentucky, our rate review before the Kentucky Public Service Commission continues to move forward as we reach settlement agreements in April with all of the parties involved. The settlements are subject to approval by the Kentucky Commission. If approved, it will result in a total annual revenue increase of $122 million for our Kentucky utilities. The settlement also includes other adjustments that relate to the timing of cost recovery, such as depreciation rates.
The settlements provide for the ability to invest in intelligent control equipment that will enhance reliability and enable faster restoration of service. It also will give Louisville Gas and Electric the ability to improve natural gas safety and reliability by replacing the aging natural gas service -- field service lines, with new plastic lines that run from the street to our customers' homes.
As part of the proposed agreement, the companies have agreed to withdraw the current request for a full deployment of advanced meters, and we will establish a collaborative with the interested party to address issues raised with that proposal. This will result in the removal or deferral of just over $300 million in total capital expenditures from the 2017 through 2019 capital plan.
The settlement proposal includes an authorized 9.75% return on equity using our filed capital structure. The agreement gives us the ability to enhance our reliability and continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers.
A public hearing on the rate review is scheduled to begin on May 9. An order in the case from the Kentucky Public Service Commission is still expected on or around June 30, with new rates going into effect on July 1 of this year.
In Pennsylvania, PPL reached a new 5-year labor agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1600. The agreement ratified by bargaining unit members in March will take effect May 22. It continues our long-standing practice of providing competitive wages and benefits for our employees. We believe it is also in the best interest of PPL shareowners and our customers.
In the U.K., as I mentioned earlier, Article 50 was invoked on March 29, which formally began the process of the U.K. exiting the European Union. That process is expected to take up to 2 years to complete.
As we've discussed in the past, we expect no changes to our U.K. operations as a result of the exit.
I will now turn the call over to Robert Symons to provide an update on WPD's performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets. Robert?"

Leading to Slide 6, March 31, 2017 marked the completion of second regulatory year under RIIO-ED1. And on the next 2 slides, I'll provide an update on our full year performance on interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction.
Let me start by saying WPD has had another successful year in achieving its outputs. We focused on delivering excellent customer service. And once again, have been ranked the top 4 distribution network operators in customer satisfaction.
We also continue to focus on restoring power promptly as interruptions occur. Clear management attention on supply restoration and commitment by staff at all levels, has led to significant performance improvements.
Network reliability is a high priority for WPD. Over the 8-year RIIO-ED1 period, we've committed to reducing the number of power cuts that customers experience by 16% compared to 2013, '14 levels, restoring supply 23% quicker when power cuts occur and ensuring that a minimum of 85% of customers have their power restored within an hour of an HV fault occurring.
As a result of our efforts, our performance for the regulatory year 2016, '17, is estimated to result in $95 million of incentive revenues for the interruption incentive revenues for and the broad measure of customer Satisfaction, which is slightly better than the midpoint of our prior guidance.
Now turning to Slide 7. On this slide, you will find the detail of our full year results against performance targets set by Ofgem. Our strong performance this year will result in receiving 82% of the maximum payout.
This year, our operational efforts contributing to this success included an unwavering staff effort at all levels on a speedy supply restoration; a thorough inspection of maintenance work program; several major asset replacement project; and increased investment in network automation and improved network sensing.
As it relates to the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction, we are proud to have maintained our top 4 positions for customer service and stakeholder engagement, and we are committed to continuing this level of service over the course of RIIO-ED1.
As shown back on Slide 6, we've increased our calendar year 2018 incentive potential from between $80 million and $100 million to between $95 million and $105 million. This increase is driven by our 2016, '17 performance and now includes about $6 million for the Time to Connect incentive. 
The Time to Connect incentive is intended to encourage distribution network operators to reduce the overall time to connect smaller low-voltage connections to the network. These amounts are internal estimates until final determination is received from Ofgem in November 2017.
Overall, we have performed in line with our expectations.
And as we begin the new regulatory year, we expect performance closely in line with the prior year and project $95 million to $115 million in calendar year 2019, with a similar expectation for 2020.
Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at segment earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 9 for a more detailed review of our first quarter earnings.
First quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.05 over the prior year, driven by lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment of $0.02 and $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segment. 
Corporate and other was lower by $0.07, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes. For those on the call that are well-versed in tax accounting, this is just the result of the quarterly APV 28 adjustment, which will reverse over the remainder of the year.
These lower earnings were partially offset by an improvement in the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.06. 
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact domestic weather had on our results compared to last year and compared to our plan.
Compared to last year, mild temperatures during the first quarter of 2017 had an unfavorable $0.02 impact for our Kentucky segment, with heating degree days about 27% lower than normal in the quarter. The impacts of weather in Pennsylvania were relatively flat, year-over-year. Compared to our plan, domestic weather had a negative $0.03 impact. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2017 segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 10.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. This result was due to higher operation and maintenance expense due primarily to timing and higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Higher transmission margins from additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission system demand in 2017. However, transmission margins for the full year are still forecasted to be in line with our original expectation.
Moving to Slide 11, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was due to lower gross margins as a result of lower sales volumes due to the unfavorable weather that I talked about earlier.
Moving to Slide 12, our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.45 per share in 2017, a $0.06 improvement compared to a year ago. This was primarily due to higher gross margins, driven mostly by the April 1, 2016 price increase. In addition, lower results from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 were offset by a decrease in O&M, primarily from lower pension expense and the timing of network maintenance expense and lower income taxes as a result of pre-funding pension contributions into our various U.K. pension plans.
Part of the reason for the pre-funding of the plans was to take advantage of tax deductions at the higher statutory rate of 20%, which was effective to March 31, versus 19% which became effective April 1. These positive tax results enabled us to restrike $0.04 of 2017 earnings in the first quarter, adding additional U.K. earnings hedges in 2019 without impacting the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.15 per share.
Moving to Slide 13, since our year-end call, we continue to layer on additional hedges. We are now contractually hedged 100% for 2017 at an average rate of $1.21 per pound, and we are 99% hedged through '18 and '19 at average rates of $1.41 and $1.32 per pound, respectively.
As a reminder, every $0.01 in the FX rate above our budgeted rate of $1.30 represents about $0.01 in earnings per share. So just for 2018 and '19, we have about $0.13 of additional hedge value above our budgeted rate.
The Fed additional hedge value that gives us so much confidence in our ability to meet our earnings guidance targets even though 2020 is still contractually unhedged. And just to reiterate what this bottom table shows, if we were to use all the additional hedge value, we could still achieve our minimum 5% growth rate through 2020, even if market rates drop to $1.05 per pound.
However, at current exchange rates, we would not need to use all of these value to achieve our earnings growth targets. And in fact, the EPS growth rate would be at the high end of our 5% to 6% growth range and the additional hedge value would be available for other purposes. 
The hedge program we've developed was designed to protect us against the downside risk of the pound losing value, but it also provides us with a lot of upside opportunity if the pound remains at current levels or even strengthens.
Based on the current hedge levels, our view is that this risk reward proposition is now skewed much more to the upside than to the downside.
Moving to Slide 14, we've provided an illustration of the high-, medium- and low-currency forecast from up to 17 financial institutions. These forecast do not represent PPL's internal forecast or our planning assumption. But you can see from the chart, even the various view is around $1.40 per pound for 2020, in the Polish case it's much higher. And as I said, to the extent exchange rates remain at current levels or move consistent with these estimates, the additional value created in our plan will not be needed in 2020 and could be used for a variety of purposes, including mitigating potential tax reform or hedging future years beyond 2020.
And finally, turning to Slide 15. We continue -- sorry, we show our updated RPI forecast. In recent months, we have seen RPI rates strengthen above our business plan assumptions. We believe RPI now represents some upside potential to the plan, but as you can see from the sensitivity table, it's not likely to be too significant. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Moving to Slide 2, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our first quarter 2017 earnings results, a discussion of our 2017 earnings forecast and a brief operational overview. 
Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary will provide an update on our U.K. incentive performance. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review, then we will take your questions.
Turning to Slide 3, today, we announced first quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.59 per share, compared with $0.71 per share from our first quarter 2016 results.
Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.62 per share, compared with $0.67 per share a year ago.  This reduction in earnings was driven primarily by lower foreign currency exchange rates, as expected, partially offset by an April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K. An unusually mild winter in Kentucky also negatively impacted earnings. The State of Kentucky, in fact, experienced its warmest February on record.
I'm pleased with our first quarter results, and despite the abnormally warm winter, we are off to a strong start to the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance.
Let's move to Slide 4, which highlights our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast.
Today, we are affirming -- reaffirming our 2017 forecast of earnings from ongoing operations of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share.
Looking beyond 2017, we remain confident in our ability to deliver overall compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020.
As we have highlighted on the year-end call, we expect 4% to 6% compound annual growth in our U.S. utilities from 2017 through 2020, and 6% to 8% growth in the U.K.
The drivers of this growth are summarized in the appendix on Slide 21 and are consistent with the growth drivers discussed on the year-end call.
We have significantly reduced our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates through our ongoing hedging program, as we've increased our hedge levels even further during the first quarter.
While the British government formally began its exit from the European Union, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term growth, even if exchange rates were to fall well below today's current levels. However, the pound-to-dollar exchange rate has been very stable since the U.K. officially began the Brexit process on March 29. In fact, the exchange rate has actually strengthened some, with current rates around $1.29 per pound.
Vince will provide you with an update to our hedge status during his remarks, but I will highlight now that with the additional hedging we did since year-end, we can achieve at least the low end of our 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth range, even if the pound falls to $1.05.
Delivering on our commitments really comes down to execution, and that is something that we have demonstrated over the years, which is a clear strength for PPL.
As we've discussed in the past, we have a very straightforward business plan, which we believe is low risk. And as noted on the slide, we continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year from 2017 through 2020, having delivered on that commitment earlier this year by increasing the annualized dividend in February from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share.
Overall, we continue to maintain one of the strongest dividend yields in our sector, while maintaining our investment-grade credit metrics.
Now let's move to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations.
In Kentucky, our rate review before the Kentucky Public Service Commission continues to move forward as we reach settlement agreements in April with all of the parties involved. The settlements are subject to approval by the Kentucky Commission. If approved, it will result in a total annual revenue increase of $122 million for our Kentucky utilities. The settlement also includes other adjustments that relate to the timing of cost recovery, such as depreciation rates.
The settlements provide for the ability to invest in intelligent control equipment that will enhance reliability and enable faster restoration of service. It also will give Louisville Gas and Electric the ability to improve natural gas safety and reliability by replacing the aging natural gas service -- field service lines, with new plastic lines that run from the street to our customers' homes.
As part of the proposed agreement, the companies have agreed to withdraw the current request for a full deployment of advanced meters, and we will establish a collaborative with the interested party to address issues raised with that proposal. This will result in the removal or deferral of just over $300 million in total capital expenditures from the 2017 through 2019 capital plan.
The settlement proposal includes an authorized 9.75% return on equity using our filed capital structure. The agreement gives us the ability to enhance our reliability and continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers.
A public hearing on the rate review is scheduled to begin on May 9. An order in the case from the Kentucky Public Service Commission is still expected on or around June 30, with new rates going into effect on July 1 of this year.
In Pennsylvania, PPL reached a new 5-year labor agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1600. The agreement ratified by bargaining unit members in March will take effect May 22. It continues our long-standing practice of providing competitive wages and benefits for our employees. We believe it is also in the best interest of PPL shareowners and our customers.
In the U.K., as I mentioned earlier, Article 50 was invoked on March 29, which formally began the process of the U.K. exiting the European Union. That process is expected to take up to 2 years to complete.
As we've discussed in the past, we expect no changes to our U.K. operations as a result of the exit.
I will now turn the call over to Robert Symons to provide an update on WPD's performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets. Robert?"

Leading to Slide 6, March 31, 2017 marked the completion of second regulatory year under RIIO-ED1. And on the next 2 slides, I'll provide an update on our full year performance on interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction.
Let me start by saying WPD has had another successful year in achieving its outputs. We focused on delivering excellent customer service. And once again, have been ranked the top 4 distribution network operators in customer satisfaction.
We also continue to focus on restoring power promptly as interruptions occur. Clear management attention on supply restoration and commitment by staff at all levels, has led to significant performance improvements.
Network reliability is a high priority for WPD. Over the 8-year RIIO-ED1 period, we've committed to reducing the number of power cuts that customers experience by 16% compared to 2013, '14 levels, restoring supply 23% quicker when power cuts occur and ensuring that a minimum of 85% of customers have their power restored within an hour of an HV fault occurring.
As a result of our efforts, our performance for the regulatory year 2016, '17, is estimated to result in $95 million of incentive revenues for the interruption incentive revenues for and the broad measure of customer Satisfaction, which is slightly better than the midpoint of our prior guidance.
Now turning to Slide 7. On this slide, you will find the detail of our full year results against performance targets set by Ofgem. Our strong performance this year will result in receiving 82% of the maximum payout.
This year, our operational efforts contributing to this success included an unwavering staff effort at all levels on a speedy supply restoration; a thorough inspection of maintenance work program; several major asset replacement projects; and increased investment in network automation and improved network sensing.
As it relates to the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction, we are proud to have maintained our top 4 positions for customer service and stakeholder engagement, and we are committed to continuing this level of service over the course of RIIO-ED1.
As shown back on Slide 6, we've increased our calendar year 2018 incentive potential from between $80 million and $100 million to between $95 million and $105 million. This increase is driven by our 2016, '17 performance and now includes about $6 million for the Time to Connect incentive. 
The Time to Connect incentive is intended to encourage distribution network operators to reduce the overall time to connect smaller low-voltage connections to the network. These amounts are internal estimates until final determination is received from Ofgem in November 2017.
Overall, we have performed in line with our expectations.
And as we begin the new regulatory year, we expect performance closely in line with the prior year and project $95 million to $115 million in calendar year 2019, with a similar expectation for 2020.
Vince will now walk you through a more detailed look at segment earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 9 for a more detailed review of our first quarter earnings.
First quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.05 over the prior year, driven by lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment of $0.02 and $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segment. 
Corporate and other was lower by $0.07, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes. For those on the call that are well-versed in tax accounting, this is just the result of the quarterly APV 28 adjustment, which will reverse over the remainder of the year.
These lower earnings were partially offset by an improvement in the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.06. 
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact domestic weather had on our results compared to last year and compared to our plan.
Compared to last year, mild temperatures during the first quarter of 2017 had an unfavorable $0.02 impact for our Kentucky segment, with heating degree days about 27% lower than normal in the quarter. The impacts of weather in Pennsylvania were relatively flat, year-over-year. Compared to our plan, domestic weather had a negative $0.03 impact. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2017 segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 10.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. This result was due to higher operation and maintenance expense due primarily to timing and higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Higher transmission margins from additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission system demand in 2017. However, transmission margins for the full year are still forecasted to be in line with our original expectation.
Moving to Slide 11, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was due to lower gross margins as a result of lower sales volumes due to the unfavorable weather that I talked about earlier.
Moving to Slide 12, our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.45 per share in 2017, a $0.06 improvement compared to a year ago. This was primarily due to higher gross margins, driven mostly by the April 1, 2016 price increase. In addition, lower results from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 were offset by a decrease in O&M, primarily from lower pension expense and the timing of network maintenance expense and lower income taxes as a result of pre-funding pension contributions into our various U.K. pension plans.
Part of the reason for the pre-funding of the plans was to take advantage of tax deductions at the higher statutory rate of 20%, which was effective through March 31, versus 19% which became effective April 1. These positive tax results enabled us to restrike $0.04 of 2017 earnings in the first quarter, adding additional U.K. earnings hedges in 2019 without impacting the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.15 per share.
Moving to Slide 13, since our year-end call, we continue to layer on additional hedges. We are now contractually hedged 100% for 2017 at an average rate of $1.21 per pound, and we are 99% hedged through '18 and '19 at average rates of $1.41 and $1.32 per pound, respectively.
As a reminder, every $0.01 in the FX rate above our budgeted rate of $1.30 represents about $0.01 in earnings per share. So just for 2018 and '19, we have about $0.13 of additional hedge value above our budgeted rate.
It's that additional hedge value that gives us so much confidence in our ability to meet our earnings guidance targets even though 2020 is still contractually unhedged. And just to reiterate what this bottom table shows, if we were to use all the additional hedge value, we could still achieve our minimum 5% growth rate through 2020, even if market rates drop to $1.05 per pound.
However, at current exchange rates, we would not need to use all of this value to achieve our earnings growth targets. And in fact, the EPS growth rate would be at the high end of our 5% to 6% growth range and the additional hedge value would be available for other purposes. 
The hedge program we've developed was designed to protect us against the downside risk of the pound losing value, but it also provides us with a lot of upside opportunity if the pound remains at current levels or even strengthens.
Based on the current hedge levels, our view is that this risk reward proposition is now skewed much more to the upside than to the downside.
Moving to Slide 14, we've provided an illustration of the high-, medium- and low-currency forecast from up to 17 financial institutions. These forecast do not represent PPL's internal forecast or our planning assumption. But you can see from the chart, even the fairest view is around $1.40 per pound for 2020, in the bullish case is much higher. And as I said, to the extent exchange rates remain at current levels or move consistent with these estimates, the additional value created in our plan will not be needed in 2020 and could be used for a variety of purposes, including mitigating potential tax reform or hedging future years beyond 2020.
And finally, turning to Slide 15. We continue -- sorry, we show our updated RPI forecast. In recent months, we have seen RPI rates strengthen above our business plan assumptions. We believe RPI now represents some upside potential to the plan, but as you can see from the sensitivity table, it's not likely to be too significant. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

I think, we're happy with the organic growth opportunities we have in the U.S., and so we're focused on growing our U.S. businesses through deployment of capital. And as you're aware right now, we're essentially spending about $3 billion a year in capital. $2 billion of the $3 billion is in the U.S., and $1 billion in the U.K. So over time, even though the U.K., EPS-wise, is growing faster, we are deploying more rate base on the U.S. business side. Relative to other opportunities, we've obviously, been very focused on making sure that we protect against the currency fluctuation. So that has been a major focus of making sure that we meet our 5% to 6% EPS growth. Then as we indicated, we're very pleased with where we sit right now."

Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; and the presidents of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Moving to Slide 2, our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our first quarter 2017 earnings results, a discussion of our 2017 earnings forecast and a brief operational overview. 
Following my remarks, Robert Symons, Chief Executive of our Western Power Distribution subsidiary will provide an update on our U.K. incentive performance. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review, then we will take your questions.
Turning to Slide 3, today, we announced first quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.59 per share, compared with $0.71 per share from our first quarter 2016 results.
Adjusting for special items, first quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.62 per share, compared with $0.67 per share a year ago.  This reduction in earnings was driven primarily by lower foreign currency exchange rates, as expected, partially offset by an April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K. An unusually mild winter in Kentucky also negatively impacted earnings. The State of Kentucky, in fact, experienced its warmest February on record.
I'm pleased with our first quarter results, and despite the abnormally warm winter, we are off to a strong start to the year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2017 earnings guidance.
Let's move to Slide 4, which highlights our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast.
Today, we are affirming -- reaffirming our 2017 forecast of earnings from ongoing operations of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share.
Looking beyond 2017, we remain confident in our ability to deliver overall compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020.
As we have highlighted on the year-end call, we expect 4% to 6% compound annual growth in our U.S. utilities from 2017 through 2020, and 6% to 8% growth in the U.K.
The drivers of this growth are summarized in the appendix on Slide 21 and are consistent with the growth drivers discussed on the year-end call.
We have significantly reduced our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates through our ongoing hedging program, as we've increased our hedge levels even further during the first quarter.
While the British government formally began its exit from the European Union, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term growth, even if exchange rates were to fall well below today's current levels. However, the pound-to-dollar exchange rate has been very stable since the U.K. officially began the Brexit process on March 29. In fact, the exchange rate has actually strengthened some, with current rates around $1.29 per pound.
Vince will provide you with an update to our hedge status during his remarks, but I will highlight now that with the additional hedging we did since year-end, we can achieve at least the low end of our 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth range, even if the pound falls to $1.05.
Delivering on our commitments really comes down to execution, and that is something that we have demonstrated over the years, which is a clear strength for PPL.
As we've discussed in the past, we have a very straightforward business plan, which we believe is low risk. And as noted on the slide, we continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year from 2017 through 2020, having delivered on that commitment earlier this year by increasing the annualized dividend in February from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share.
Overall, we continue to maintain one of the strongest dividend yields in our sector, while maintaining our investment-grade credit metrics.
Now let's move to Slide 5 for an update on our utility operations.
In Kentucky, our rate review before the Kentucky Public Service Commission continues to move forward as we reach settlement agreements in April with all of the parties involved. The settlements are subject to approval by the Kentucky Commission. If approved, it will result in a total annual revenue increase of $122 million for our Kentucky utilities. The settlement also includes other adjustments that relate to the timing of cost recovery, such as depreciation rates.
The settlements provide for the ability to invest in intelligent control equipment that will enhance reliability and enable faster restoration of service. It also will give Louisville Gas and Electric the ability to improve natural gas safety and reliability by replacing the aging natural gas service -- field service lines, with new plastic lines that run from the street to our customers' homes.
As part of the proposed agreement, the companies have agreed to withdraw the current request for a full deployment of advanced meters, and we will establish a collaborative with the interested party to address issues raised with that proposal. This will result in the removal or deferral of just over $300 million in total capital expenditures from the 2017 through 2019 capital plan.
The settlement proposal includes an authorized 9.75% return on equity using our filed capital structure. The agreement gives us the ability to enhance our reliability and continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers.
A public hearing on the rate review is scheduled to begin on May 9. An order in the case from the Kentucky Public Service Commission is still expected on or around June 30, with new rates going into effect on July 1 of this year.
In Pennsylvania, PPL reached a new 5-year labor agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1600. The agreement ratified by bargaining unit members in March will take effect May 22. It continues our long-standing practice of providing competitive wages and benefits for our employees. We believe it is also in the best interest of PPL shareowners and our customers.
In the U.K., as I mentioned earlier, Article 50 was invoked on March 29, which formally began the process of the U.K. exiting the European Union. That process is expected to take up to 2 years to complete.
As we've discussed in the past, we expect no changes to our U.K. operations as a result of the exit.
I will now turn the call over to Robert Symons to provide an update on WPD's performance against our RIIO-ED1 incentive targets. Robert?"

Leading to Slide 6, March 31, 2017 marked the completion of second regulatory year under RIIO-ED1. And on the next 2 slides, I'll provide an update on our full year performance on interruption incentive schemes and the broad measure of customer satisfaction.
Let me start by saying WPD has had another successful year in achieving its outputs. We focused on delivering excellent customer service. And once again, have been ranked the top 4 distribution network operators in customer satisfaction.
We also continue to focus on restoring power promptly as interruptions occur. Clear management attention on supply restoration and commitment by staff at all levels, has led to significant performance improvements.
Network reliability is a high priority for WPD. Over the 8-year RIIO-ED1 period, we've committed to reducing the number of power cuts that customers experience by 16% compared to 2013, '14 levels, restoring supply 23% quicker when power cuts occur and ensuring that a minimum of 85% of customers have their power restored within an hour of an HV fault occurring.
As a result of our efforts, our performance for the regulatory year 2016, '17, is estimated to result in $95 million of incentive revenues for the interruption incentive revenues for and the broad measure of customer Satisfaction, which is slightly better than the midpoint of our prior guidance.
Now turning to Slide 7. On this slide, you will find the detail of our full year results against performance targets set by Ofgem. Our strong performance this year will result in receiving 82% of the maximum payout.
This year, our operational efforts contributing to this success included an unwavering staff effort at all levels on a speedy supply restoration; a thorough inspection of maintenance work program; several major asset replacement projects; and increased investment in network automation and improved network sensing.
As it relates to the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction, we are proud to have maintained our top 4 positions for customer service and stakeholder engagement, and we are committed to continuing this level of service over the course of RIIO-ED1.
As shown back on Slide 6, we've increased our calendar year 2018 incentive potential from between $80 million and $100 million to between $95 million and $105 million. This increase is driven by our 2016, '17 performance and now includes about $6 million for the Time to Connect incentive. 
The Time to Connect incentive is intended to encourage distribution network operators to reduce the overall time to connect smaller low-voltage connections to the network. These amounts are internal estimates until final determination is received from Ofgem in November 2017.
Overall, we have performed in line with our expectations.
And as we begin the new regulatory year, we expect performance closely in line with the prior year and project $95 million to $115 million in calendar year 2019, with a similar expectation for 2020.

Let's move to Slide 9 for a more detailed review of our first quarter earnings.First quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.05 over the prior year, driven by lower earnings from the Pennsy",975,"Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 9 for a more detailed review of our first quarter earnings.
First quarter earnings from ongoing operations decreased by $0.05 over the prior year, driven by lower earnings from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment of $0.02 and $0.02 from the Kentucky Regulated segment. 
Corporate and other was lower by $0.07, primarily due to the timing impact of recording annual estimated taxes. For those on the call that are well-versed in tax accounting, this is just the result of the quarterly APV 28 adjustment, which will reverse over the remainder of the year.
These lower earnings were partially offset by an improvement in the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.06. 
Before I get into the segment details, let's briefly discuss the impact domestic weather had on our results compared to last year and compared to our plan.
Compared to last year, mild temperatures during the first quarter of 2017 had an unfavorable $0.02 impact for our Kentucky segment, with heating degree days about 27% lower than normal in the quarter. The impacts of weather in Pennsylvania were relatively flat, year-over-year. Compared to our plan, domestic weather had a negative $0.03 impact. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the 2017 segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 10.
Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. This result was due to higher operation and maintenance expense due primarily to timing and higher depreciation due to asset additions.
Higher transmission margins from additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission system demand in 2017. However, transmission margins for the full year are still forecasted to be in line with our original expectation.
Moving to Slide 11, our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2017, a $0.02 decrease compared to the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was due to lower gross margins as a result of lower sales volumes due to the unfavorable weather that I talked about earlier.
Moving to Slide 12, our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.45 per share in 2017, a $0.06 improvement compared to a year ago. This was primarily due to higher gross margins, driven mostly by the April 1, 2016 price increase. In addition, lower results from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 were offset by a decrease in O&M, primarily from lower pension expense and the timing of network maintenance expense and lower income taxes as a result of pre-funding pension contributions into our various U.K. pension plans.
Part of the reason for the pre-funding of the plans was to take advantage of tax deductions at the higher statutory rate of 20%, which was effective through March 31, versus 19% which became effective April 1. These positive tax results enabled us to restrike $0.04 of 2017 earnings in the first quarter, adding additional U.K. earnings hedges in 2019 without impacting the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.15 per share.
Moving to Slide 13, since our year-end call, we continue to layer on additional hedges. We are now contractually hedged 100% for 2017 at an average rate of $1.21 per pound, and we are 99% hedged through '18 and '19 at average rates of $1.41 and $1.32 per pound, respectively.
As a reminder, every $0.01 in the FX rate above our budgeted rate of $1.30 represents about $0.01 in earnings per share. So just for 2018 and '19, we have about $0.13 of additional hedge value above our budgeted rate.
It's that additional hedge value that gives us so much confidence in our ability to meet our earnings guidance targets even though 2020 is still contractually unhedged. And just to reiterate what this bottom table shows, if we were to use all the additional hedge value, we could still achieve our minimum 5% growth rate through 2020, even if market rates drop to $1.05 per pound.
However, at current exchange rates, we would not need to use all of this value to achieve our earnings growth targets. And in fact, the EPS growth rate would be at the high end of our 5% to 6% growth range and the additional hedge value would be available for other purposes. 
The hedge program we've developed was designed to protect us against the downside risk of the pound losing value, but it also provides us with a lot of upside opportunity if the pound remains at current levels or even strengthens.
Based on the current hedge levels, our view is that this risk reward proposition is now skewed much more to the upside than to the downside.
Moving to Slide 14, we've provided an illustration of the high-, medium- and low-currency forecast from up to 17 financial institutions. These forecast do not represent PPL's internal forecast or our planning assumption. But you can see from the chart, even the fairest view is around $1.40 per pound for 2020, in the bullish case is much higher. And as I said, to the extent exchange rates remain at current levels or move consistent with these estimates, the additional value created in our plan will not be needed in 2020 and could be used for a variety of purposes, including mitigating potential tax reform or hedging future years beyond 2020.
And finally, turning to Slide 15. We continue -- sorry, we show our updated RPI forecast. In recent months, we have seen RPI rates strengthen above our business plan assumptions. We believe RPI now represents some upside potential to the plan, but as you can see from the sensitivity table, it's not likely to be too significant. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our U.S. and U.K. utility business. 
Moving over to Slide 2. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and our year-to-date 2017 earnings results. We'll provide an update to our full 2017 year earnings guidance as well as the brief -- a brief operational overview, including an overview of off chance to RIIO-2 process. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed review. As always, we leave time to answer your questions. 
Turning to Slide 3. PPL had another strong quarter with very solid results to the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2017. PPL's earnings for the quarter and year-to-date are lower compared to 2016, as expected, primarily driven by lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. 
Today, we announced second quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.43 per share compared with $0.71 per share a year ago. Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.01 per share compared to $1.41 per share through the first half of 2016. 
Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share compared with $0.56 per share a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations by $0.07 per share compared to 2016. The remaining quarterly increase in earnings from ongoing operations of $0.03 per share was due to lower operating and maintenance expenses in Kentucky and in the U.K. 
Through the first 6 months of 2017, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.14 per share. This compares wI think $1.23 per share through the same period a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2017 year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations for the amount of $0.17 per share compared with last year. The remaining increase in year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations of $0.08 per share was primarily due to the April 1, 2016 annual price increase in the U.K., partially offset by unfavorable weather in Kentucky. Vince will go on to greater detail on second quarter results later in the call. 
Moving now to Slide 4. Today, we're reaffirming our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with the midpoint of $2.15 per share and are providing an updated segment breakdown. We've revised our Kentucky segment ongoing earnings projection for 2017 to $0.56 for the year compared primarily as a result of lower electricity sales volumes due to unfavorable weather. At the same time, the earnings for the U.K. Regulated segment are expected to come in stronger for the year. We're now projecting $1.20 per share in the U.K. due to lower operating and maintenance expenses and lower income taxes. Looking beyond 2017, we continue to expect 5  to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020 as we execute our business plans, including more than $13 billion in infrastructure investment through 2020. As we look forward, we also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for an update on our Kentucky Utility operations. In June, the Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized a combined rate increase of $116 million for Kentucky Utilities and Gas and Electric with new rates taking effect on July 1. The commission authorized a 9.7% return on equity. Consistent with the base rate case, the commission also lowered the ROE on our environmental cost recovery mechanisms from 10% and 9.8% to 9.7%. We've incorporated the final outcome of the Kentucky rate cases into our earnings forecast, including the lower ROE and the deferred advance to meter capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. We remain confident that we will solidly within the 5% to 6% compound annual growth range that we projected through 2020. The revenue increase approved by the commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity and natural gas service. 
Also in Kentucky, LG&E recently completed its 540-mile 20-year gas main replacement, which strengthens the safety and reliability of gas service and renewable. The project to replace wrought-iron and bare steel natural gas pipeline with durable plastic pipelines. LG&E's project began 15 years before stringent federal regulations were adopted requiring such placements. Many utilities only only began making these types of upgrades within the last 5 years. 
Last but not least, our domestic utilities continue to lead the way in customer satisfaction in their regions according to JD power. Kentucky Utilities are ranked the highest among midsized electric utilities in the Midwest, with Gas and Electric coming in 2nd. 
Turning to Slide 6 for Pennsylvania operational update. Just as we recognized -- we were recognized for superior customer service in our Kentucky Utilities, PPL Electric Utilities ranked the highest among large utilities in the East. In all PPL's U.S. Utilities have one and combined 45 JD Power awards among the Best Utility Companies in the nation. 
In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities continues to enhance Smart Grid capabilities. Prior to this spring, the company already one of the nation's of most advanced distribution automation systems in the country. We've added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to prevent power outages and make our system even more resilient. 
Similar improvements made in 2016 prevented more than 100,000 customer interruptions last year. We expect our latest enhancements to yield additional benefits for our Pennsylvania customers as we move forward. 
PPL Electric Utilities also continues to make good progress on its $471 million advanced meter replacement project. This includes the replacement of all 1.4 million meters and our Pennsylvania service territory. Approximately 280,000 meters have been replaced to date and we expect that number to rise of to more than 520,000 by the end of the year. 
Moving to Slide 7. In the U.K, our U.K. regulator Ofgem issued a letter of feedback the stakeholders as it begins to process it's constructing a framework for RIIO-2. This is a standard course for Ofgem. Responses to the open letter are due September 4 and will help guide the proposed RIIO-2 consultation process to begin in the first quarter of 2018. We are very early on in the process and as you know, any changes for WPD would not take effect until RIIO-ED2 begins in April 2023. 
We view our transaction as a positive investment and we will have the opportunity to participate constructively in shaping the per framework associated with the RIIO-2. We've worked well with Ofgem and the pass and delivered positive results for WPD and we have no reason to believe that we would not continued to benefit from the consultation process and the final framework of RIIO-2. The purpose of this review is to build on lessons learned from the current price control and the gas transmission and distribution businesses and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving U.K. Energy sector. 
To continue with Slide 8. Any changes to the RIIO framework are expected to focus on giving customers a stronger voice steady output and assessing business plans, providing fair returns for share owners and good value for consumers, properly reflecting business risks and prevailing market conditions while incentivizing companies to drive value, innovation and efficiency. To mention a few of the specifics, Ofgem indicated they will consider the length of the price control, which for WPD is currently 8 years, potentially aligning the price controls for gas, transmission and distribution in terms of timing and the engagement process. And the process for how it sets cost of capital given the change in market conditions that could occur over a price control period. As a reminder, the current price control period for WPD RIIO-ED1 runs through March of 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consulting process. 
Ofgem has a long history of constructive regulatory frameworks and we believe the consultation process will result in a fair outcome. We have been successful in the pass of navigating new price controls and we believe there is ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2. You may recall that we are very successful at mitigating a revenue reset to a sharp decline in our U.K. segment of the start of RIIO-ED1 back in 2015. And in fact, we accomplished earnings growth compared to 2014. Given how early Ofgem is starting the review process for RIIO-2, we have time to plan for potential changes for the framework. 
Our strategy for RIIO-2 will be to provide comments on the open letter, have a high level of engagement during the formal consultation process, which begins next year and construct well-justified business plan that appropriately balance the needs of all of our stakeholders, including our U.K. customers, and of course, our PPL shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 9. Ofgem also initiated the process of assessing the need for a mid-year review for RIIO-ED1. As previously determined by Ofgem, the scope of any midyear review -- mid-period review will be to look at any changes to WPD's expenditures due to a change in government policy or new outputs required by customers since the start of RIIO-ED1. There have been no government policy changes or changes to outputs that was a result the changes to WPD if a mid-period review is conducted. 
At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Vince for more detailed look at our quarterly related segment. Vince?"

Weather was not a significant factor to the quarter compared to both budget for in prior year. However, domestic weather has negatively impacted our year-to-date results by about $0.03 compared to bulk budget in the prior year primarily in Kentucky. 
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. This result was due to higher transition margins of a penny offset by higher depreciation of the penny. 
Higher transmission margins resulted from additional capital investments but were partially offset by a lower peak load billing factor. 
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This result was driven by lower operational and maintenance expense due to timing and scope of planned outages and lower plant operating cost. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.05 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower result was from lower foreign currency exchange rate in 2017 compared to 2016 of $0.07, partially offset by a decrease in O&M primarily from lower pension expense. 
Gross margins in the U.K. were flat for the quarter primarily due to the April 1, 2017 price reset, which includes lower revenues from mechanisms primarily related to lower cost debt recovery, offset by the normal price increase in-based demand revenues. The April price increase and the lower revenues from the tuneup mechanisms were all incorporated in our original 2017 earnings per share guidance. 
Moving to Slide 15. As we mentioned on prior calls, we have incremental hedge value in 2018 and 2019 above our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound and we have sent that as hedges for 2020 that are above budget. For us to be able to use this value to protect the henge's potential volatility and the exchange rate during the Brexit negotiation. During the second quarter, we started moving some of the 2018 hedge value into 2019 while maintaining the same level of incremental value overall. 
The 2020 hedges were done by using about a penny of 2017 restrikes and enabled us to hedge 7% of our 2020 expected U.K. earnings and an average rate of $1.48 per pound, significantly above our budgeted rate of $1.30. 
Now that we've begun to layer on hedges for 2020, we can achieve the low-end of our 5% to 6% EPS of growth rate even if the pound has parallelled with the dollar. 
Moving to Slide 16. We've refreshed our currency forecast Slide and have included the forward curve as well. The forecast have not moved significantly since last quarter and the still around 2020 and -- $1.40 for 2020. And as you can see, the forward curve, which is indicative of the rates with which we can actually hedge is above our budget assumption of $1.30 per pound with the current spot rating from $1.31. The current stay at this level, it can provide us for the opportunity to layer on additional 2020 hedges above our budgeted rate while retaining the incremental Hedger value that we were able to create. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

That definitely improves the long-term intrinsic value of the company for your growing rate base, which is the engine that generates return. However, many of our peers were in the 70% -- even somewhere in the low 60%. So that's an item that is returns that, for some reason, to be impacted, then maybe we will have that down that backup to measure with our peers that would were doing with RIIO-ED1.

So the Pennsylvania PUC is kind of looking at a broad set of looking at the energy environment as it's pretty dynamic at the moment, what changes to their policies and practices might make sense for the utilities that they regulate.

Moving to Slide 2. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and our year-to-date 2017 earnings results. We'll provide an update to our full 2017 year earnings guidance as well as the brief -- a brief operational overview, including an overview of off-chance RIIO-2 process. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 3. PPL had another strong quarter with very solid results to the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2017. PPL's earnings for the quarter and year-to-date are lower compared to 2016, as expected, primarily driven by lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017.
Today, we announced second quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.43 per share compared with $0.71 per share a year ago. Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.01 per share compared to $1.41 per share through the first half of 2016.
Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share compared with $0.56 per share a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations by $0.07 per share compared to 2016. The remaining quarterly increase in earnings from ongoing operations of $0.03 per share was due to lower operating and maintenance expenses in Kentucky and in the U.K.
Through the first 6 months of 2017, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.14 per share. This compares with $1.23 per share through the same period a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2017 year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations for the amount of $0.17 per share compared with last year. The remaining increase in year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations of $0.08 per share was primarily due to the April 1, 2016 annual price increase in the U.K., partially offset by unfavorable weather in Kentucky. Vince will go on to greater detail on second quarter results later in the call.
Moving now to Slide 4. Today, we're reaffirming our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with the midpoint of $2.15 per share and are providing an updated segment breakdown. We've revised our Kentucky segment ongoing earnings projection for 2017 to $0.56 for the year compared primarily as a result of lower electricity sales volumes due to unfavorable weather. At the same time, the earnings for the U.K. Regulated segment are expected to come in stronger for the year. We are now projecting $1.20 per share in the U.K. due to lower operating and maintenance expenses and lower income taxes. Looking beyond 2017, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020 as we execute our business plans, including more than $13 billion in infrastructure investment through 2020. As we look forward, we also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for an update on our Kentucky utility operations. In June, the Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized a combined rate increase of $116 million for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric with new rates taking effect on July 1. The commission authorized a 9.7% return on equity. Consistent with the base rate case, the commission also lowered the ROE on our environmental cost recovery mechanisms from 10% and 9.8% to 9.7%. We've incorporated the final outcome of the Kentucky rate cases into our earnings forecast, including the lower ROE and the deferred advanced meter capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. We remain confident that we will be solidly within the 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth range that we projected through 2020. The revenue increase approved by the commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity and natural gas service.
Also in Kentucky, LG&E recently completed its 540-mile 20-year gas main replacement, which strengthens the safety and reliability of gas service in Louisville. The project to replace wrought-iron and bare steel natural gas pipelines with durable plastic pipelines. LG&E's project began 15 years before stringent federal regulations were adopted requiring such placements. Many utilities only began making these types of upgrades within the last 5 years.
Last but not least, our domestic utilities continue to lead the way in customer satisfaction in their regions according to J.D. Power. Kentucky Utilities ranked the highest among midsized electric utilities in the Midwest, with Louisville Gas and Electric coming in 2nd.
Turning to Slide 6 for our Pennsylvania operational update. Just as we recognized -- we were recognized for superior customer service in our Kentucky Utilities, PPL Electric Utilities ranked highest among large utilities in the east. In all PPL's U.S. utilities have one and combined 45 J.D. Power awards among the best utility companies in the nation. 
In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities continues to enhance its Smart Grid capabilities. Prior to this spring, the company already had one of the nation's most advanced distribution automation systems in the country. We've added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to prevent power outages and make our system even more resilient.
Similar improvements made in 2016 prevented more than 100,000 customer interruptions last year. We expect our latest enhancements to yield additional benefits for our Pennsylvania customers as we move forward.
PPL Electric Utilities also continues to make good progress on its $471 million advanced meter replacement project. This includes the replacement of all 1.4 million meters in our Pennsylvania service territory. Approximately 280,000 meters have been replaced to date and we expect that number to rise to more than 520,000 by the end of the year.
Moving to Slide 7. In the U.K., our U.K. regulator, Ofgem, issued an open letter seeking feedback from stakeholders as it begins the process of constructing a framework for RIIO-2. This is a standard course for Ofgem. Responses to the open letter are due September 4 and will help guide the proposed RIIO-2 consultation process to begin in the first quarter of 2018. We are very early on in the process and as you know, any changes for WPD would not take effect until RIIO-ED2 begins in April 2023. 
We view off transaction as a positive development and that we will have the opportunity to participate constructively in shaping the framework associated with RIIO-2. We've worked well with Ofgem in the past and delivered positive results for WPD and we have no reason to believe that we would not continue to benefit from the consultation process and the final framework of RIIO-2. The purpose of this review is to build on lessons learned from the current price controls in the gas, transmission and distribution businesses and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving U.K. energy sector. 
To continue with Slide 8. Any changes to the RIIO framework are expected to focus on giving customers a stronger voice in setting outputs and assessing business plans, providing fair returns for share owners and good value for consumers, properly reflecting business risks and prevailing market conditions, while incentivizing companies to drive value, innovation and efficiency. To mention a few of the specifics, Ofgem indicated they will consider the length of the price control, which for WPD is currently 8 years, potentially aligning the price controls for gas, transmission and distribution in terms of timing and the engagement process. And the process for how it sets cost of capital given the change in market conditions that could occur over a price control period. As a reminder, the current price control period for WPD RIIO-ED1 runs through March of 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consultative process. 
Ofgem has a long history of constructive regulatory frameworks and we believe the consultation process will result in a fair outcome. We have been successful in the past navigating through new price controls and we believe there is ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2. You may recall that we were very successful at mitigating a revenue reset to obviate a sharp decline in our U.K. segment earnings at the start of RIIO-ED1 back in 2015. And in fact, we accomplished earnings growth compared to 2014. Given how early Ofgem is starting the review process for RIIO-2, we have time to plan for potential changes for the framework.
Our strategy for RIIO-2 will be to provide comments on the open letter, have a high level of engagement during the formal consultation process, which begins next year and construct well-justified business plans that appropriately balance the needs of all of our stakeholders, including our U.K. customers, and of course, our PPL share owners.
Moving to Slide 9. Ofgem also initiated the process of assessing the need for a midyear review for RIIO-ED1. As previously determined by Ofgem, the scope of any midyear review -- mid-period review would be to look at any necessary changes to WPD's expenditures due to a change in government policy or new outputs required by customers since the start of RIIO-ED1. There have been no government policy changes or changes to outputs that was a result in changes to WPD if a mid-period review is conducted.
At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed look at our quarterly segment earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.04 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.05, partially offset by $0.01 in the Kentucky Regulated segment.
The Pennsylvania Regulated segment and Corporate and Other results remained flat compared to a year ago. Weather was not a significant factor for the quarter compared to bulk budget or in prior year. However, domestic weather has negatively impacted our year-to-date results by about $0.03 compared to bulk budget in the prior year primarily in Kentucky.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. This result was due to higher transmission margins of $0.01 offset by higher depreciation of $0.01.
Higher transmission margins resulted from additional capital investments but were partially offset by a lower peak load billing factor.
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This result was driven by lower operation and maintenance expense due to timing and the scope of planned outages and lower plant operating costs. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.05 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower result was from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 of $0.07, partially offset by a decrease in O&M primarily from lower pension expense.
Gross margins in the U.K. were flat for the quarter primarily due to the April 1, 2017 price reset, which includes lower revenues from true-up mechanisms primarily related to lower cost of debt recovery, offset by the normal price increase in base demand revenues. The April price increase and the lower revenues from the true-up mechanisms were all incorporated in our original 2017 earnings per share guidance. 
Moving to Slide 15. As we mentioned on prior calls, we have incremental hedge value in 2018 and 2019 above our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound, and we've since added hedges in 2020 that are above budget. So we're able to use this value to protect against potential volatility in the exchange rate during the Brexit negotiations. During the second quarter, we started moving some of the 2018 hedge value into 2019 while maintaining the same level of incremental value overall.
The 2020 hedges were done by using about a penny of 2017 restrikes and enabled us to hedge 7% of our 2020 expected U.K. earnings and an average rate of $1.48 per pound, significantly above our budgeted rate of $1.30. 
Now that we've begun to layer on hedges for 2020, we can achieve the low end of our 5% to 6% EPS growth rate even if the pound hits parity with the dollar. 
Moving to Slide 16. We've refreshed our currency forecast slide and have included the forward curve as well. The forecast have not moved significantly since last quarter and the variance SKU is still around $1.40 for 2020. And as you can see, the forward curve, which is indicative of the rates at which we can actually hedge is above our budget assumption of $1.30 per pound with the current spot rating for the pound around $1.31. The forward curve stay at this level, it could provide us further opportunity to layer on additional 2020 hedges above our budgeted rate while retaining the incremental hedge value that we've been able to create.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

And that's -- you may recall that the U.K. cost recovery structure is called tow tax. It's not capital and OEM. It's just total expenditures. And then, within the business plans, each distribution company can determine how much you want of that tow tax to go towards rate base growth and how much you want in current period recovery. WPD was at the high end of the slow pot ratio under RIIO-ED1 at 80%, basically going to the rate base growth and 20% going through the current P&L. That definitely improves the long-term intrinsic value of the company for your growing rate base, which is the engine that generates return. However, many of our peers were in the 70% -- even somewhere in the low 60%. So that's an item that if returns were, for some reason, to be impacted, maybe we would have to dial that back commensurate with what our peers were doing through RIIO-ED1. But it would be something that we would have to look at in totality. The business plans are put together understanding the rules for the new price control and totality. And so I wouldn't sit here today and say we were going to do that, but really it -- it is the lever that we could potentially pull going to RIIO-2."

So the Pennsylvania PUC is kind of looking at a broad set of looking at the energy environment as it's pretty dynamic at the moment, what changes to their policies and practices might make sense for the utilities that they regulate.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Moving to Slide 2. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and our year-to-date 2017 earnings results. We'll provide an update to our full 2017 year earnings guidance as well as the brief -- a brief operational overview, including an overview of off-chance RIIO-2 process. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 3. PPL had another strong quarter with very solid results to the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2017. PPL's earnings for the quarter and year-to-date are lower compared to 2016, as expected, primarily driven by lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017.
Today, we announced second quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.43 per share compared with $0.71 per share a year ago. Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.01 per share compared to $1.41 per share through the first half of 2016.
Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share compared with $0.56 per share a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations by $0.07 per share compared to 2016. The remaining quarterly increase in earnings from ongoing operations of $0.03 per share was due to lower operating and maintenance expenses in Kentucky and in the U.K.
Through the first 6 months of 2017, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.14 per share. This compares with $1.23 per share through the same period a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2017 year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations by the amount of $0.17 per share compared with last year. The remaining increase in year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations of $0.08 per share was primarily due to the April 1, 2016 annual price increase in the U.K., partially offset by unfavorable weather in Kentucky. Vince will go on to greater detail on second quarter results later in the call.
Moving now to Slide 4. Today, we're reaffirming our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15 per share and are providing an updated segment breakdown. We've revised our Kentucky segment ongoing earnings projection for 2017 to $0.56 for the year compared primarily as a result of lower electricity sales volumes due to unfavorable weather. At the same time, the earnings for the U.K. Regulated segment are expected to come in stronger for the year. We are now projecting $1.20 per share in the U.K. due to lower operating and maintenance expenses and lower income taxes. Looking beyond 2017, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020 as we execute our business plans, including more than $13 billion in infrastructure investment through 2020. As we look forward, we also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for an update on our Kentucky utility operations. In June, the Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized a combined rate increase of $116 million for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric, with new rates taking effect on July 1. The commission authorized a 9.7% return on equity. Consistent with the base rate case, the commission also lowered the ROE on our environmental cost recovery mechanisms from 10% and 9.8% to 9.7%. We've incorporated the final outcome of the Kentucky rate cases into our earnings forecasts, including the lower ROE and the deferred advanced meter capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. We remain confident that we will be solidly within the 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth range that we projected through 2020. The revenue increase approved by the commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity and natural gas service.
Also in Kentucky, LG&E recently completed its 540-mile 20-year gas main replacement, which strengthens the safety and reliability of gas service in Louisville. The project replaced wrought-iron and bare steel natural gas pipelines with durable plastic pipelines. LG&E's project began 15 years before stringent federal regulations were adopted requiring such placements. Many utilities only began making these types of upgrades within the last 5 years.
Last but not least, our domestic utilities continue to lead the way in customer satisfaction in their regions, according to J.D. Power. Kentucky Utilities ranked the highest among midsized electric utilities in the Midwest, with Louisville Gas and Electric coming in 2nd.
Turning to Slide 6 for a Pennsylvania operational update. Just as we recognized -- we were recognized for superior customer service in our Kentucky Utilities, PPL Electric Utilities ranked highest among large utilities in the East. In all PPL's U.S. utilities have one and combined 45 J.D. Power awards among the best utility companies in the nation. 
In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities continues to enhance its Smart Grid capabilities. Prior to this spring, the company already had one of the nation's most advanced distribution automation systems in the country. We've added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to prevent power outages and make our system even more resilient.
Similar improvements made in 2016 prevented more than 100,000 customer interruptions last year. We expect our latest enhancements to yield additional benefits for our Pennsylvania customers as we move forward.
PPL Electric Utilities also continues to make good progress on its $471 million advanced meter replacement project. This includes the replacement of all 1.4 million meters in our Pennsylvania service territory. Approximately 280,000 meters have been replaced to date and we expect that number to rise to more than 520,000 by the end of the year.
Moving to Slide 7 and the U.K. Our U.K. regulator, Ofgem, issued an open letter seeking feedback from stakeholders as it begins the process of constructing a framework for RIIO-2. This is a standard course for Ofgem. Responses to the open letter are due September 4 and will help guide the proposed RIIO-2 consultation process to begin in the first quarter of 2018. We are very early on in the process and as you know, any changes for WPD would not take effect until RIIO-ED2 begins in April 2023. 
We view Ofgem's action as a positive development in that we will have the opportunity to participate constructively in shaping the framework associated with RIIO-2. We've worked well with Ofgem in the past and delivered positive results for WPD and we have no reason to believe that we would not continue to benefit from the consultation process and the final framework of RIIO-2. The purpose of this review is to build on lessons learned from the current price controls in the gas, transmission and distribution businesses and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving U.K. energy sector. 
To continue with Slide 8. Any changes to the RIIO framework are expected to focus on giving customers a stronger voice in setting outputs and assessing business plans, providing fair returns for share owners and good value for consumers, properly reflecting business risks and prevailing market conditions, while incentivizing companies to drive value, innovation and efficiency. To mention a few of the specifics, Ofgem indicated they will consider the length of the price control, which for WPD is currently 8 years, potentially aligning the price controls for gas transmission and distribution in terms of timing and the engagement process. And the process for how it sets cost of capital given the change in market conditions that could occur over a price control period. As a reminder, the current price control period for WPD RIIO-ED1 runs through March of 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consultative process. 
Ofgem has a long history of constructive regulatory frameworks and we believe the consultation process will result in a fair outcome. We have been successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and we believe there is ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2. You may recall that we were very successful at mitigating a revenue reset to obviate a sharp decline in our U.K. segment earnings at the start of RIIO-ED1 back in 2015. And in fact, we accomplished earnings growth compared to 2014. Given how early Ofgem is starting the review process for RIIO-2, we have time to plan for potential changes for the framework.
Our strategy for RIIO-2 will be to provide comments on the open letter, have a high level of engagement during the formal consultation process, which begins next year and construct well-justified business plans that appropriately balance the needs of all of our stakeholders, including our U.K. customers, and of course, our PPL share owners.
Moving to Slide 9. Ofgem also initiated the process of assessing the need for a midyear review for RIIO-ED1. As previously determined by Ofgem, the scope of any midyear review -- mid-period review would be to look at any necessary changes to WPD's expenditures due to a change in government policy or new outputs required by customers since the start of RIIO-ED1. There have been no government policy changes or changes to outputs that would result in changes to WPD if a mid-period review is conducted.
At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed look at our quarterly segment earnings. Vince?"
185508,531459092,1265017,"PPL Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2017",2017-08-03,"Earnings Calls","PPL Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.04 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.05, partially offset by $0.01 in the K",637,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. 
Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.04 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.05, partially offset by $0.01 in the Kentucky Regulated segment.
The Pennsylvania Regulated segment and Corporate and Other results remained flat compared to a year ago. Weather was not a significant factor for the quarter compared to bulk budget for prior year. However, domestic weather has negatively impacted our year-to-date results by about $0.03 compared to bulk budget in the prior year, primarily in Kentucky.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. This result was due to higher transmission margins of $0.01 offset by higher depreciation of $0.01.
Higher transmission margins resulted from additional capital investments but were partially offset by a lower peak load billing factor.
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This result was driven by lower operation and maintenance expense due to timing and the scope of planned outages and lower plant operating costs. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.05 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower results were from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 of $0.07, partially offset by a decrease in O&M primarily from lower pension expense.
Gross margins in the U.K. were flat for the quarter primarily due to the April 1, 2017 price reset, which includes lower revenues from true-up mechanisms primarily related to lower cost of debt recovery offset by the normal price increase in base demand revenues. The April price increase and the lower revenues from the true-up mechanisms were all incorporated in our original 2017 earnings per share guidance. 
Moving to Slide 15. As we've mentioned on prior calls, we have incremental hedge value in 2018 and 2019 above our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound, and we've since added hedges in 2020 that are above budget. So we're able to use this value to protect against potential volatility in the exchange rate during the Brexit negotiations. During the second quarter, we started moving some of the 2018 hedge value into 2019 while maintaining the same level of incremental value overall.
The 2020 hedges were done by using about $0.01 of 2017 restrikes and enabled us to hedge 7% of our 2020 expected U.K. earnings and an average rate of $1.48 per pound, significantly above our budgeted rate of $1.30. 
Now that we've begun to layer on hedges for 2020, we can achieve the low end of our 5% to 6% EPS growth rate even if the pound hits parity with the dollar. 
Moving to Slide 16. We've refreshed our currency forecast slide and have included the forward curve as well. The forecasts have not moved significantly since last quarter and the variance SKU is still around $1.40 for 2020. And as you can see, the forward curve, which is indicative of the rates at which we can actually hedge, is above our budget assumption of $1.30 per pound, with the current spot rating for the pound around $1.31. If forward curves stay at this level, they could provide us further opportunity to layer on additional 2020 hedges above our budgeted rate while retaining the incremental hedge value that we've been able to create.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the question-and-answer period. Bill?"

And that's -- you may recall that the U.K. cost recovery structure is called tow tax. It's not capital and OEM. It's just total expenditures. And then, within the business plans, each distribution company can determine how much you want of that tow tax to go towards rate base growth and how much you want in current period recovery. WPD was at the high end of the slow pot ratio under RIIO-ED1 at 80%, basically going to the rate base growth and 20% going through the current P&L. That definitely improves the long-term intrinsic value of the company because you're growing rate base, which is the engine that generates return. However, many of our peers were in the 70%. Even some were in the low 60%. So that's an item that if returns were, for some reason, to be impacted, maybe we would have to dial that back commensurate with what our peers were doing through RIIO-ED1. But it would be something that we would have to look at in totality. The business plans are put together understanding the rules for the new price control in totality. And so I wouldn't sit here today and say we were going to do that, but really it -- it is the lever that we could potentially pull down into RIIO-2."

Also, when you think about the future, you also would consider what's happening in the U.K., and that's a move towards electrification of vehicles. And Michael Gove announced a couple of weeks ago that from 2040, there will be no more petrol and diesel vehicles produced in the U.K. And that, from a national group point of view, their estimate is that generation will have to go up by 50%. Its impact on distribution businesses will be quite massive. And so maybe CapEx plans will be much larger, looking at RIIO-ED2 than they have been in RIIO-ED1."

So the Pennsylvania PUC is kind of looking at a broad set of -- looking at the energy environment as it's pretty dynamic at the moment, what changes to their policies and practices might make sense for the utilities that they regulate.

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Moving to Slide 2. Our agenda this morning starts with an overview of our quarterly and our year-to-date 2017 earnings results. We'll provide an update to our full 2017 year earnings guidance as well as the brief -- a brief operational overview, including an overview of off-chance RIIO-2 process. Vince will then review our segment results and provide a more detailed financial review. As always, we'll leave time to answer your questions.
Turning to Slide 3. PPL had another strong quarter with very solid results to the first half of the year, and we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2017. PPL's earnings for the quarter and year-to-date are lower compared to 2016, as expected, primarily driven by lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017.
Today, we announced second quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.43 per share compared with $0.71 per share a year ago. Year-to-date through the second quarter, reported earnings were $1.01 per share compared to $1.41 per share through the first half of 2016.
Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share compared with $0.56 per share a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations by $0.07 per share compared to 2016. The remaining quarterly increase in earnings from ongoing operations of $0.03 per share was due to lower operating and maintenance expenses in Kentucky and in the U.K.
Through the first 6 months of 2017, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.14 per share. This compares with $1.23 per share through the same period a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2017 year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations by the amount of $0.17 per share compared with last year. The remaining increase in year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations of $0.08 per share was primarily due to the April 1, 2016 annual price increase in the U.K., partially offset by unfavorable weather in Kentucky. Vince will go on to greater detail on second quarter results later in the call.
Moving now to Slide 4. Today, we're reaffirming our 2017 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15 per share and are providing an updated segment breakdown. We've revised our Kentucky segment ongoing earnings projection for 2017 to $0.56 for the year compared primarily as a result of lower electricity sales volumes due to unfavorable weather. At the same time, the earnings for the U.K. Regulated segment are expected to come in stronger for the year. We are now projecting $1.20 per share in the U.K. due to lower operating and maintenance expenses and lower income taxes. Looking beyond 2017, we continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020 as we execute our business plans, including more than $13 billion in infrastructure investment through 2020. As we look forward, we also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5 for an update on our Kentucky utility operations. In June, the Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized a combined rate increase of $116 million for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric, with new rates taking effect on July 1. The commission authorized a 9.7% return on equity. Consistent with the base rate case, the commission also lowered the ROE on our environmental cost recovery mechanisms from 10% and 9.8% to 9.7%. We've incorporated the final outcome of the Kentucky rate cases into our earnings forecasts, including the lower ROE and the deferred advanced meter capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. We remain confident that we will be solidly within the 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth range that we projected through 2020. The revenue increase approved by the commission will support continued investments in safe, reliable electricity and natural gas service.
Also in Kentucky, LG&E recently completed its 540-mile 20-year gas main replacement, which strengthens the safety and reliability of gas service in Louisville. The project replaced wrought-iron and bare steel natural gas pipelines with durable plastic pipelines. LG&E's project began 15 years before stringent federal regulations were adopted requiring such placements. Many utilities only began making these types of upgrades within the last 5 years.
Last but not least, our domestic utilities continue to lead the way in customer satisfaction in their regions, according to J.D. Power. Kentucky Utilities ranked the highest among midsized electric utilities in the Midwest, with Louisville Gas and Electric coming in 2nd.
Turning to Slide 6 for a Pennsylvania operational update. Just as we recognized -- we were recognized for superior customer service in our Kentucky Utilities, PPL Electric Utilities ranked highest among large utilities in the East. In all PPL's U.S. utilities have one and combined 45 J.D. Power awards among the best utility companies in the nation. 
In other highlights, PPL Electric Utilities continues to enhance its Smart Grid capabilities. Prior to this spring, the company already had one of the nation's most advanced distribution automation systems in the country. We've added hundreds of additional Smart Grid devices to prevent power outages and make our system even more resilient.
Similar improvements made in 2016 prevented more than 100,000 customer interruptions last year. We expect our latest enhancements to yield additional benefits for our Pennsylvania customers as we move forward.
PPL Electric Utilities also continues to make good progress on its $471 million advanced meter replacement project. This includes the replacement of all 1.4 million meters in our Pennsylvania service territory. Approximately 280,000 meters have been replaced to date and we expect that number to rise to more than 520,000 by the end of the year.
Moving to Slide 7 and the U.K. Our U.K. regulator, Ofgem, issued an open letter seeking feedback from stakeholders as it begins the process of constructing a framework for RIIO-2. This is a standard course for Ofgem. Responses to the open letter are due September 4 and will help guide the proposed RIIO-2 consultation process to begin in the first quarter of 2018. We are very early on in the process and as you know, any changes for WPD would not take effect until RIIO-ED2 begins in April 2023. 
We view Ofgem's action as a positive development in that we will have the opportunity to participate constructively in shaping the framework associated with RIIO-2. We've worked well with Ofgem in the past and delivered positive results for WPD and we have no reason to believe that we would not continue to benefit from the consultation process and the final framework of RIIO-2. The purpose of this review is to build on lessons learned from the current price controls in the gas, transmission and distribution businesses and to develop a framework that will be adaptable to meeting the needs of an evolving U.K. energy sector. 
To continue with Slide 8. Any changes to the RIIO framework are expected to focus on giving customers a stronger voice in setting outputs and assessing business plans, providing fair returns for share owners and good value for consumers, properly reflecting business risks and prevailing market conditions, while incentivizing companies to drive value, innovation and efficiency. To mention a few of the specifics, Ofgem indicated they will consider the length of the price control, which for WPD is currently 8 years, potentially aligning the price controls for gas transmission and distribution in terms of timing and the engagement process. And the process for how it sets cost of capital given the change in market conditions that could occur over a price control period. As a reminder, the current price control period for WPD RIIO-ED1 runs through March of 2023 and will not be impacted by this RIIO-2 consultative process. 
Ofgem has a long history of constructive regulatory frameworks and we believe the consultation process will result in a fair outcome. We have been successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and we believe there is ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2. You may recall that we were very successful at mitigating a revenue reset to obviate a sharp decline in our U.K. segment earnings at the start of RIIO-ED1 back in 2015. And in fact, we accomplished earnings growth compared to 2014. Given how early Ofgem is starting the review process for RIIO-2, we have time to plan for potential changes for the framework.
Our strategy for RIIO-2 will be to provide comments on the open letter, have a high level of engagement during the formal consultation process, which begins next year and construct well-justified business plans that appropriately balance the needs of all of our stakeholders, including our U.K. customers, and of course, our PPL share owners.
Moving to Slide 9. Ofgem also initiated the process of assessing the need for a midyear review for RIIO-ED1. As previously determined by Ofgem, the scope of any midyear review -- mid-period review would be to look at any necessary changes to WPD's expenditures due to a change in government policy or new outputs required by customers since the start of RIIO-ED1. There have been no government policy changes or changes to outputs that would result in changes to WPD if a mid-period review is conducted.
At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Vince for a more detailed look at our quarterly segment earnings. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 11. Our second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.04 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.05, partially offset by $0.01 in the Kentucky Regulated segment.
The Pennsylvania Regulated segment and Corporate and Other results remained flat compared to a year ago. Weather was not a significant factor for the quarter compared to bulk budget for prior year. However, domestic weather has negatively impacted our year-to-date results by about $0.03 compared to bulk budget in the prior year, primarily in Kentucky.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 12. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.11 per share in the second quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. This result was due to higher transmission margins of $0.01 offset by higher depreciation of $0.01.
Higher transmission margins resulted from additional capital investments but were partially offset by a lower peak load billing factor.
Moving to Slide 13. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.01 increase compared to a year ago. This result was driven by lower operation and maintenance expense due to timing and the scope of planned outages and lower plant operating costs. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.31 per share in the second quarter of 2017, a $0.05 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower results were from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to 2016 of $0.07, partially offset by a decrease in O&M primarily from lower pension expense.
Gross margins in the U.K. were flat for the quarter primarily due to the April 1, 2017 price reset, which includes lower revenues from true-up mechanisms primarily related to lower cost of debt recovery offset by the normal price increase in base demand revenues. The April price increase and the lower revenues from the true-up mechanisms were all incorporated in our original 2017 earnings per share guidance. 
Moving to Slide 15. As we've mentioned on prior calls, we have incremental hedge value in 2018 and 2019 above our budgeted rate of $1.30 per pound, and we've since added hedges in 2020 that are above budget. So we're able to use this value to protect against potential volatility in the exchange rate during the Brexit negotiations. During the second quarter, we started moving some of the 2018 hedge value into 2019 while maintaining the same level of incremental value overall.
The 2020 hedges were done by using about $0.01 of 2017 restrikes and enabled us to hedge 7% of our 2020 expected U.K. earnings and an average rate of $1.48 per pound, significantly above our budgeted rate of $1.30. 
Now that we've begun to layer on hedges for 2020, we can achieve the low end of our 5% to 6% EPS growth rate even if the pound hits parity with the dollar. 
Moving to Slide 16. We've refreshed our currency forecast slide and have included the forward curve as well. The forecasts have not moved significantly since last quarter and the variance SKU is still around $1.40 for 2020. And as you can see, the forward curve, which is indicative of the rates at which we can actually hedge, is above our budget assumption of $1.30 per pound, with the current spot rating for the pound around $1.31. If forward curves stay at this level, they could provide us further opportunity to layer on additional 2020 hedges above our budgeted rate while retaining the incremental hedge value that we've been able to create.

And that's -- you may recall that the U.K. cost recovery structure is called tow tax. It's not capital and OEM. It's just total expenditures. And then, within the business plans, each distribution company can determine how much you want of that tow tax to go towards rate base growth and how much you want in current period recovery. WPD was at the high end of the slow pot ratio under RIIO-ED1 at 80%, basically going to the rate base growth and 20% going through the current P&L. That definitely improves the long-term intrinsic value of the company because you're growing rate base, which is the engine that generates return. However, many of our peers were in the 70%. Even some were in the low 60%. So that's an item that if returns were, for some reason, to be impacted, maybe we would have to dial that back commensurate with what our peers were doing through RIIO-ED1. But it would be something that we would have to look at in totality. The business plans are put together understanding the rules for the new price control in totality. And so I wouldn't sit here today and say we were going to do that, but really it -- it is the lever that we could potentially pull down into RIIO-2."

Also, when you think about the future, you also would consider what's happening in the U.K., and that's a move towards electrification of vehicles. And Michael Gove announced a couple of weeks ago that from 2040, there will be no more petrol and diesel vehicles produced in the U.K. And that, from a national group point of view, their estimate is that generation will have to go up by 50%. Its impact on distribution businesses will be quite massive. And so maybe CapEx plans will be much larger, looking at RIIO-ED2 than they have been in RIIO-ED1."

With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the heads of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses. 
Since we will see many of you at EEI next week and considering the number of earnings calls being held this week, we plan to keep our remarks brief and move quickly to the Q&A. Moving to Slide 2. Our agenda this morning starts with an update to our 2017 full year earnings guidance, which we are increasing today, and a brief description of our longer term growth trajectory. 
Vince will then provide an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings results, along with the more detailed financial review. Then we'll get right your questions.
Turning to Slide 3. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we're raising the midpoint of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance, despite the unfavorable effects of weather in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. We're updating our 2017 forecast range from the previous $2.05 to $2.25 per share to $2.10 to $2.25 per share, increasing the midpoint of our forecast from $2.15 to $2.18 per share. 
Strong year-to-date earnings in the U.K. Regulated segment give us the confidence to raise the low end of our guidance. Drivers behind of the strong U.K. performance include higher sales performance, primarily from weather, lower operating and maintenance expense and lower income taxes.
As a result, we updated the segment forecast since the second quarter call by increasing the U.K. Regulated segment by $0.04 and by lowering the Kentucky Regulated segment $0.01 due to the continued impacts of unfavorable weather, which Vince will comment later in his remarks. 
The Pennsylvania segment and corporate and other are expected to deliver in line with the second quarter earnings focused. We continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020, measured against the original 2017 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.15 per share. 
We're in the process of updating our business plans now and we will provide edits guidance for 2018 and an update to our longer term growth rate on the year-end call.
Our current plan includes investing more than $16 billion in infrastructure from 2017 through 2021 and achieving essentially real-time recovery for more than 3 quarters of that investment. Our investments are focused on expanding and modernizing the grid, adding smart grid technology and automation as well as strengthening physical and cyber security. We also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020.
And as I've indicated in the past, the strength of our growth plan is built on the loan is the nature of our business plan and is supported by the strength of our hedging program and our stable stream of futility earnings and cash flows. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Vince to cover the financial highlights. Vince?"

Today, we announced third quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.51 per share compared with $0.69 per share a year ago. 
Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $1.53 per share compared to $2.11 per share through the first 9 months of 2016. Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.63 per share a year ago.
The $0.07 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.11 per share, primarily due to $0.07 from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. 
Corporate and other was positive by $0.04 per share due to the partial reversal of the timing impact, creating a first quarter related to recording our annual estimated income taxes.
I'll cover the quarterly segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment. 
Moving to the bottom table, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.17 per share through the first 9 months of 2017 compared with $1.86 per share through the same period a year ago. Our year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.16 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.10, lower earnings from our Kentucky and Pennsylvania segments $0.02 each, and an unfavorable variance for corporate and other of $0.02, again, due to the timing impact created in the first quarter related to recording annual estimated income tax. 
Expected lower foreign currency exchange rates resulted in $0.24 per share of lower earnings in '17 compared to '16. We've included to the right additional drivers contributing to our year-to-date earnings.
The April 1, 2016 price increase in U.K., the base rate increases in Kentucky, and additional transmission margins in Pennsylvania partially offset the negative effects of the lower foreign currency exchange rate, lower sales volumes and higher depreciation and interest expense resulting from continued capital investment. 
Before getting into the segment details, let me just highlight the impact of weather for both the quarter and year-to-date.
For the quarter, mild domestic weather resulted in at $0.03 negative impact compared to the prior year and a $0.01 a negative impacts compared to budget. In on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather negatively impacted our results compared to prior year by $0.05 and $0.04 compared to budget. In the U.K., on a year-to-date basis, weather was favorable by $0.02 compared to budget and flat compared to 2016.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 6. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. These results were due to higher transmission margins resulting from additional capital investments and lower operational and maintenance expense. These favorable drivers were primary offset by lower distribution margins due to mild weather and higher depreciation expense.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2017, also flat compared to a year ago. These results were driven by higher base electricity and gas at rates that were effective July 1 of '17. These were offset by lower sales volumes due to unfavorable weather of $0.02 and higher depreciation expense.
Turning to Slide 8. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.24 per share in the third quarter of '17 and $0.11 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower results were primarily from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to '16 of $0.07, which was expected, lower gross margin resulting from lower sales volumes, higher financing cost due to higher interest expense on next months of debt and higher income taxes. These results were, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense primarily from pensions.
Moving to slide 9, for a hedging update. We fully hedged our U.K. earnings through 2019 at rates above the $1.30 per pound rates in our EPS growth targets. Since the second quarter call, we continue to reposition our hedge value for 2018 and 2019 and have further hedged 2020, which is no 15% hedged at an average rate $1.47 per pound. 
With hedges above our budgeted rate in 2018, 2019 and 2020, we have incremental hedge value of about $0.14 across the 3 years. Our current plan is to maintain this incremental hedge value to protect against potential depreciation in the exchange rate during Brexit negotiations or any other geopolitical event that could resulted a negative currency impact. We have the hedges in place to be our business plan, providing is a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve the 5% to 6% EPS growth rate for 2020.
And as you know, we have a dynamic hedging program that we evaluate regularly, which really enables us to be responsive to changing market conditions and risks. 
Moving to slide 10. We have refreshed the foreign currency forecast through September 30. The view for 2020 remains around $1.40 per pound, in the bullish case, much higher. You can see by the green line, the forward curve is still above our budgeted rate for 2020. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering on additional hedges and limit future earnings volatility and provide transparent adding stability to our shareholders. If the pound continues to trade at levels above our budgeted rate, we would expect to be able to achieve the high end of our guidance growth rate. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for"

Just so focus on the where I think in the U.K., there's been a lot of concern on behalf of some consumer advocates, in particular, about the total affect of electricity and natural gas prices in the U.K. and the focus has been predominantly on the suppliers.

So there is a lot of focus on the volatility and the overall cost associated with the supply competent of the bill. So obviously, the distribution component is much lower, supply being typically about 70% of the bill.

Specifically, for the electric companies, the responses were due on September 4. We didn't see anything at the responses that concerned us in the stakeholder comments that we read. The purpose of the framework review is really to build on the lessons learned from the current price control review and develop a framework that would be adaptable to meeting the needs of the kind of the evolving U.K. energy sector. As you are aware, we've been successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and feel there is ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2, which is the next step process we get into. We're very early in that process, and as I mentioned, no changes would take effect until 2023, April of 2023. So again, we've got a lot of opportunity to participate constructively and shape the framework associated with RIIO-ED2 to have an outcome that we think is fair to shareowners as well as stakeholders in the U.K."

So again, we feel there is no justification at this time for any adjustment. As far as when the clarity comes, we do have a slide in the deck, I think, it's slide 22, that shows the indicative timetable.

Now politically, someone could propose legislation and either change that process. So that it's not independent as it is today. But again, that would take significant movement in Parliament on both sides. So even if the Labour Party were to come to power in an election and start to change things, it still got to go through a process, a fairly lengthy process. Given that that's going to be a lengthy process and given that we've seen changes in the political landscape, significant ones, just in the last 5 years and we are -- we still got 6 years to run on the current time frame till we get to 2023. So I guess, my view is a lot of things are likely to change between now and 2023. It's going to be a long, and I think a difficult process to put that toothpaste back in the tube, as I describe it, after a very long and successful kind of run with the framework. So that's kind of our opinion on it. Obviously, we continue to monitor it. And I think once we know what the outcome might be in any kind of new political regime, will then begin to reach out and make sure that all those on the political side are aware of the positive track record and what this really means, if they were to move in a different direction."

If, for example, one of the other companies is significantly under spending, I believe there was already an adjustment made on the transmission side because there is a very large transmission project that's not going to go forward.

I think in our case, first, as I mentioned earlier, we are the only companies to be fast tracked, meaning that we had a very well justified business plan. And therefore, we don't see any justification for an adjustment based on the roles that are set forth today. If one of our peers on the distribution side were to if you will, and adjust to the revenues downward, we have to look at their circumstance.

We're pleased that you joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the heads of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Since we will see many of you at EEI next week and considering the number of earnings calls being held this week, we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief and move quickly to the Q&A.
Moving to Slide 2. Our agenda this morning starts with an update to our 2017 full year earnings guidance, which we are increasing today, and a brief discussion of our longer term growth trajectory.
Vince will then provide an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings results along with the more detailed financial review. Then we'll get ready to your questions.
Turning to Slide 3. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we're raising the midpoint of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance, despite the unfavorable effects of weather in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. We're updating our 2017 forecast range from the previous $2.05 to $2.25 per share to $2.10 to $2.25 per share, increasing the midpoint of our forecast from $2.15 to $2.18 per share.
Strong year-to-date earnings in the U.K. Regulated segment give us the confidence to raise the low end of our guidance. Drivers behind the strong U.K. performance include higher sales volumes, primarily from weather, lower operating and maintenance expense and lower income taxes. As a result, we updated the segment forecast since the second quarter call by increasing the U.K. Regulated segment by $0.04 and by lowering the Kentucky Regulated segment a $0.01 due to the continued impacts of unfavorable weather, which Vince will comment on later in his remarks.
The Pennsylvania segment and Corporate and Other are expected to deliver in line with the second quarter earnings forecast. We continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020, measured against the original 2017 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.15 per share. We are in the process of updating our business plans now, and we will provide earnings guidance for 2018 and an update to our longer term growth rate on the year-end call.
Our current plan includes investing more than $16 billion in infrastructure from 2017 through 2021 and achieving essentially real-time recovery for more than 3 quarters of that investment. Our investments are focused on expanding and modernizing the grid, adding Smart Grid technology and automation as well as strengthening physical and cybersecurity. We also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020.
And as I've indicated in the past, the strength of our growth plan is built on the low-risk nature of our business plans and is supported by the strength of our hedging program and our stable stream of utility earnings and cash flows.
Now I'll turn the call over to Vince to cover the financial highlights. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for a review of our financial results. Today, we announced third quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.51 per share compared with $0.69 per share a year ago.
Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $1.53 per share compared to $2.11 per share through the first 9 months of 2016. Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.63 per share a year ago. The $0.07 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.11 per share, primarily due to $0.07 from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017.
Corporate and Other was positive by $0.04 per share due to the partial reversal of the timing impact created in the first quarter related to recording our annual estimated income taxes.
I'll cover the quarterly segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment.
Moving to the bottom table. Earnings from ongoing operations were $1.70 per share through the first 9 months of 2017 compared with $1.86 per share through the same period a year ago. Our year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.16 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.10, lower earnings from our Kentucky and Pennsylvania segments $0.02 each, and an unfavorable variance for Corporate and Other of $0.02, again due to the timing impact created in the first quarter related to recording annual estimated income taxes.
Expected lower foreign currency exchange rates resulted in $0.24 per share of lower earnings in '17 compared to '16. We've included to the right additional drivers contributing to our year-to-date earnings values.
The April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K., the base rate increases in Kentucky and additional transmission margins in Pennsylvania partially offset the negative effects of the lower foreign currency exchange rate, lower sales volumes and higher depreciation and interest expense resulting from continued capital investment.
Before getting into the segment details, let me just highlight the impact of weather for both the quarter and year-to-date.
For the quarter, mild domestic weather resulted in a $0.03 negative impact compared to the prior year and a $0.01 negative impact compared to budget. And on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather negatively impacted our results compared to prior year by $0.05 and $0.04 compared to budget. In the U.K., on a year-to-date basis, weather was favorable by $0.02 compared to budget and flat compared to 2016.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 6. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. These results were due to higher transmission margins resulting from additional capital investments and lower operation and maintenance expense. These favorable drivers were primary offset by lower distribution margins due to mild weather of a $0.01 and higher depreciation expense.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2017, also flat compared to a year ago. These results were driven by higher base electricity and gas rates that were effective July 1 of '17. These were offset by lower sales volumes due to unfavorable weather of $0.02 and higher depreciation expense.
Turning to Slide 8. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.24 per share in the third quarter of '17, and a $0.11 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower results were primarily from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to '16 of $0.07, which was expected, lower gross margins resulting from lower sales volumes, higher financing cost due to higher interest expense on index-linked debt and higher income taxes. These results were partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense primarily from pensions.
Moving to slide 9 for a hedging update. We fully hedged our U.K. earnings through 2019 at rates above the $1.30 per pound budgeted rate in our EPS growth targets. Since the second quarter call, we continue to reposition our hedge value for 2018 and '19 and have further hedged 2020, which is now 15% hedged at an average rate of $1.47 per pound.
With hedges above our budgeted rate in 2018, '19 and '20, we have incremental hedge value of about $0.14 across the 3 years. Our current plan is to maintain this incremental hedge value to protect against potential depreciation in the exchange rate during Brexit negotiations or any other geopolitical event that could resulted in a negative currency impact. We have the hedges in place to derisk our business plan, providing us a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve the 5% to 6% EPS growth rate for 2020.
And as you know, we have a dynamic hedging program that we evaluate regularly, which really enables us to be responsive to changing market conditions and risks.
Moving to slide 10. We have refreshed the foreign currency forecast through September 30. The bearish view for 2020 remains around $1.40 per pound and the bullish case much higher. You can see by the green line, the forward curve is still above our budgeted rate through 2020. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering on additional hedges and limit future earnings volatility and provide transparent earnings stability to our shareholders. If the pound continues to trade at levels above our budgeted rate, we would expect to be able to achieve the high end of our guided growth range.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period."

So -- just so focus on the color where I think in the U.K., there's been a lot of concern on behalf of some consumer advocates, in particular, about the total affect of electricity and natural gas prices in the U.K. and the focus has been predominantly on the suppliers. So in the U.K., every consumer has to pick an independent gas or electric supply source. Most of those come from fairly good-size marketer. So there has been a lot of focus on the volatility and the overall cost associated with the supply component of the bill. So obviously, the distribution component is much lower, supply being typically about 70% of the bill. So thus far, we still feel confident, as you described, Julien, not only because the focus has predominantly been on the suppliers, but also because there's a great track record with Ofgem and the value that their process, regulatory framework has provided to the ultimate consumers. That value is measured directly and very openly and transparently to consumers through things like customer service metrics, reliability metrics and the overall very reasonable cost to deliver power to the customers. So again, we feel confident that the overall framework, regulatory framework will remain intact. And as you know, we're really setup for continuing to deliver on the approved plans through 2023. So we have a long runway yet on the current process and the new process for beyond 2023 is just now kicking off."

Responses to that letter, which essentially ask for comments on how various stakeholders felt about the current processes, not only for the electric companies, but also for the gas companies. Specifically, for the electric companies, the responses were due on September 4. We didn't see anything at the responses that concerned us in the stakeholder comments that we read. The purpose of the framework review is really to build on the lessons learned from the current price control review and develop a framework that would be adaptable to meeting the needs of kind of the evolving U.K. energy sector. As you're aware, we've been successful in the past at navigating through new price controls, and feel there's ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2, which is the next step process we get into. We're very early in that process. And as I mentioned, no changes would take effect until 2023, April of 2023. So again, we've got a lot of opportunity to participate constructively and shape the framework associated with RIIO-2 to have an outcome that we think is fair to shareowners as well as stakeholders in the U.K."

So it's not surprising. I think that in the end, the Ofgem is an independent regulatory body. So they're going to be the ones making the decision, whether the framework gets changed or not. Now politically, someone could propose legislation and either change that process. So that is not independent as it is today. But again, that would take significant movement in Parliament on both sides. So even if the Labour Party were to come to power in an election and start to change things, it still got to go through a process, a fairly lengthy process. Given that that's going to be a lengthy process and given that we've seen changes in the political landscape, significant ones just in the last 5 years, and we are -- we've still got 6 years to run on the current time frame till we get to 2023, so I guess, my view is, a lot of things are likely to change between now and 2023. It's going to be a long and, I think, a difficult process to put that toothpaste back in the tube, as I describe it, after a very long and successful kind of run with the framework. So that's kind of our opinion on it. Obviously, we continue to monitor it.

If, for example, one of the other companies is significantly underspending, I believe there was already an adjustment made on the transmission side because there was a very large transmission project that's not going to go forward that was included in the transmission revenue construct. So a major project like that may be the arm-twisting, as you put it, could be effective. I think in our case, first, as I mentioned earlier, we're the only companies to be fast tracked, meaning that we had a very well justified business plan. And therefore, we don't see any justification for an adjustment based on the roles that are set forth today. If one of our peers on the distribution side were to acquiesce, if you will, and adjust the revenues downward, we have to look at their circumstance. I think if you look at what we're delivering compared to the business plan we put forth, we're right on track, if not slightly ahead.

We're pleased that you joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the heads of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Since we will see many of you at EEI next week and considering the number of earnings calls being held this week, we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief and move quickly to the Q&A.
Moving to Slide 2. Our agenda this morning starts with an update to our 2017 full year earnings guidance, which we are increasing today, and a brief discussion of our longer term growth trajectory.
Vince will then provide an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings results along with the more detailed financial review. Then we'll get right to your questions.
Turning to Slide 3. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we're raising the midpoint of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance, despite the unfavorable effects of weather in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. We're updating our 2017 forecast range from the previous $2.05 to $2.25 per share to $2.10 to $2.25 per share, increasing the midpoint of our forecast from $2.15 to $2.18 per share.
Strong year-to-date earnings in the U.K. Regulated segment give us the confidence to raise the low end of our guidance. Drivers behind the strong U.K. performance include higher sales volumes, primarily from weather, lower operating and maintenance expense and lower income taxes. As a result, we updated the segment forecasts since the second quarter call by increasing the U.K. Regulated segment by $0.04 and by lowering the Kentucky Regulated segment a $0.01 due to the continued impacts of unfavorable weather, which Vince will comment on later in his remarks.
The Pennsylvania segment and Corporate and Other are expected to deliver in line with the second quarter earnings forecast. We continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020, measured against the original 2017 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.15 per share. We are in the process of updating our business plans now, and we will provide earnings guidance for 2018 and an update to our longer term growth rate on the year-end call.
Our current plan includes investing more than $16 billion in infrastructure from 2017 through 2021 and achieving essentially real-time recovery for more than 3 quarters of that investment. Our investments are focused on expanding and modernizing the grid, adding Smart Grid technology and automation as well as strengthening physical and cybersecurity. We also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020.
And as I've indicated in the past, the strength of our growth plan is built on the low-risk nature of our business plans and is supported by the strength of our hedging program and our stable stream of utility earnings and cash flows.
Now I'll turn the call over to Vince to cover the financial highlights. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for a review of our financial results. Today, we announced third quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.51 per share compared with $0.69 per share a year ago.
Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $1.53 per share compared to $2.11 per share through the first 9 months of 2016. Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.63 per share a year ago. The $0.07 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.11 per share, primarily due to $0.07 from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017.
Corporate and Other was positive by $0.04 per share due to the partial reversal of the timing impact created in the first quarter related to recording our annual estimated income taxes.
I'll cover the quarterly segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment.
Moving to the bottom table. Earnings from ongoing operations were $1.70 per share through the first 9 months of 2017 compared with $1.86 per share through the same period a year ago. Our year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.16 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.10, lower earnings from our Kentucky and Pennsylvania segments, $0.02 each, and an unfavorable variance for Corporate and Other of $0.02, again due to the timing impact created in the first quarter related to recording annual estimated income taxes.
Expected lower foreign currency exchange rates resulted in $0.24 per share of lower earnings in '17 compared to '16. We've included to the right additional drivers contributing to our year-to-date earnings variance.
The April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K., the base rate increases in Kentucky and additional transmission margins in Pennsylvania partially offset the negative effects of the lower foreign currency exchange rate, lower sales volumes and higher depreciation and interest expense resulting from continued capital investment.
Before getting into the segment details, let me just highlight the impact of weather for both the quarter and year-to-date.
For the quarter, mild domestic weather resulted in a $0.03 negative impact compared to the prior year and a $0.01 negative impact compared to budget. And on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather negatively impacted our results compared to prior year by $0.05 and $0.04 compared to budget. In the U.K., on a year-to-date basis, weather was favorable by $0.02 compared to budget and flat compared to 2016.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 6. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. These results were due to higher transmission margins resulting from additional capital investments and lower operation and maintenance expense. These favorable drivers were primary offset by lower distribution margins due to mild weather of a $0.01 and higher depreciation expense.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2017, also flat compared to a year ago. These results were driven by higher base electricity and gas rates that were effective July 1 of '17. These were offset by lower sales volumes due to unfavorable weather of $0.02 and higher depreciation expense.
Turning to Slide 8. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.24 per share in the third quarter of '17, an $0.11 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower results were primarily from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to '16 of $0.07, which was expected, lower gross margins resulting from lower sales volumes, higher financing cost due to higher interest expense on index-linked debt and higher income taxes. These results were partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense primarily from pensions.
Moving to slide 9 for a hedging update. We fully hedged our U.K. earnings through 2019 at rates above the $1.30 per pound budgeted rate in our EPS growth targets. Since the second quarter call, we've continued to reposition our hedge value for 2018 and '19 and have further hedged 2020, which is now 15% hedged at an average rate of $1.47 per pound.
With hedges above our budgeted rate in 2018, '19 and '20, we have incremental hedge value of about $0.14 across the 3 years. Our current plan is to maintain this incremental hedge value to protect against potential depreciation in the exchange rate during Brexit negotiations or any other geopolitical event that could result in a negative currency impact. We have the hedges in place to derisk our business plan, providing us a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve the 5% to 6% EPS growth rate through 2020.
And as you know, we have a dynamic hedging program that we evaluate regularly, which really enables us to be responsive to changing market conditions and risks.
Moving to slide 10. We have refreshed the foreign currency forecast through September 30. The bearish view for 2020 remains around $1.40 per pound and the bullish case much higher. You can see by the green line, the forward curve is still above our budgeted rate through 2020. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering on additional hedges to limit future earnings volatility and provide transparent earnings stability to our shareholders. If the pound continues to trade at levels above our budgeted rate, we would expect to be able to achieve the high end of our guided growth range.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period."

So -- just so folks on the call a aware, I think in the U.K. there's been a lot of concern on behalf of some consumer advocates, in particular, about the total effect of electricity and natural gas prices in the U.K. and the focus has been predominantly on the suppliers. So in the U.K., every consumer has to pick an independent gas or electric supply source. Most of those come from fairly good-size marketers. So there has been a lot of focus on the volatility and the overall cost associated with the supply component of the bill. So obviously, the distribution component is much lower, supply being typically about 70% of the bill. So thus far, we still feel confident, as you describe, Julien, not only because the focus has predominantly been on the suppliers, but also because there's a great track record with Ofgem and the value that their process, regulatory framework, has provided to the ultimate consumers. That value is measured directly and very openly and transparently to consumers through things like customer service metrics, reliability metrics and the overall very reasonable cost to deliver power to the customer. So again, we feel confident that the overall framework, regulatory framework will remain intact. And as you know, we're really set up for continuing to deliver on the approved plan through 2023. So we have a long runway yet on the current process and the new process for beyond 2023 is just now kicking off."

So the stakeholder responses to the first element, if you will, of the process was an open letter that Ofgem published back in the late summer. Responses to that letter, which essentially asked for comments on how various stakeholders felt about the current processes, not only for the electric companies, but also for the gas companies. Specifically, for the electric companies, the responses were due on September 4. We didn't see anything in the responses that concerned us in the stakeholder comments that we read. The purpose of the framework review is really to build on the lessons learned from the current price control review and develop a framework that would be adaptable to meeting the needs of kind of the evolving U.K. energy sector. As you're aware, we've been successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and feel there's ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2, which is the next process we get into. We're very early in that process and as I mentioned, no changes would take effect until 2023, it would be April of 2023.

Now politically, someone could propose legislation and either change that process so that is not independent as it is today. But again, that would take significant movement in Parliament on both sides. So even if the Labour Party were to come to power in an election and start to change things, it's still got to go through a process, a fairly lengthy process. Given that that's going to be a lengthy process and given that we've seen changes in the political landscape, significant ones just in the last 5 years, and we are -- we've still got 6 years to run on the current time frame until we get to 2023, so I guess my view is a lot of things are likely to change between now and 2023. It's going to be a long and, I think, a difficult process to put that toothpaste back in the tube, as I describe it, after a very long and successful kind of run with the framework. So that's kind of our opinion on it. Obviously, we continue to monitor it. And I think once we know what the outcome might be in any kind of new political regime, we'll then begin to reach out and make sure that all those on the political side are aware of the positive track record and what this really means if they were to move in a different direction."

If, for example, one of the other companies is significantly underspending, I believe there was already an adjustment made on the transmission side because there was a very large transmission project that's not going to go forward that was included in the transmission revenue construct. So a major project like that, maybe that arm-twisting as you put it, could be effective. I think in our case, first, as I mentioned earlier, we're the only companies to be fast tracked, meaning that we had a very well justified business plan. And therefore, we don't see any justification for an adjustment based on the roles that are set forth today. If one of our peers on the distribution side were to acquiesce, if you will, and adjust the revenues downward, we have to look at their circumstance. I think if you look at what we're delivering compared to the business plan we put forth, we're right on track; if not, slightly ahead.

We're pleased that you joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the heads of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Since we will see many of you at EEI next week and considering the number of earnings calls being held this week, we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief and move quickly to the Q&A.
Moving to Slide 2. Our agenda this morning starts with an update to our 2017 full year earnings guidance, which we are increasing today, and a brief discussion of our longer term growth trajectory.
Vince will then provide an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings results along with the more detailed financial review. Then we'll get right to your questions.
Turning to Slide 3. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we're raising the midpoint of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance, despite the unfavorable effects of weather in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. We're updating our 2017 forecast range from the previous $2.05 to $2.25 per share to $2.10 to $2.25 per share, increasing the midpoint of our forecast from $2.15 to $2.18 per share.
Strong year-to-date earnings in the U.K. Regulated segment give us the confidence to raise the low end of our guidance. Drivers behind the strong U.K. performance include higher sales volumes, primarily from weather, lower operating and maintenance expense and lower income taxes. As a result, we updated the segment forecasts since the second quarter call by increasing the U.K. Regulated segment by $0.04 and by lowering the Kentucky Regulated segment a $0.01 due to the continued impacts of unfavorable weather, which Vince will comment on later in his remarks.
The Pennsylvania segment and Corporate and Other are expected to deliver in line with the second quarter earnings forecast. We continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020, measured against the original 2017 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.15 per share. We are in the process of updating our business plans now, and we will provide earnings guidance for 2018 and an update to our longer term growth rate on the year-end call.
Our current plan includes investing more than $16 billion in infrastructure from 2017 through 2021 and achieving essentially real-time recovery for more than 3 quarters of that investment. Our investments are focused on expanding and modernizing the grid, adding Smart Grid technology and automation as well as strengthening physical and cybersecurity. We also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020.
And as I've indicated in the past, the strength of our growth plan is built on the low-risk nature of our business plans and is supported by the strength of our hedging program and our stable stream of utility earnings and cash flows.
Now I'll turn the call over to Vince to cover the financial highlights. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for a review of our financial results. Today, we announced third quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.51 per share compared with $0.69 per share a year ago.
Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $1.53 per share compared to $2.11 per share through the first 9 months of 2016. Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.63 per share a year ago. The $0.07 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.11 per share, primarily due to $0.07 from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017.
Corporate and Other was positive by $0.04 per share due to the partial reversal of the timing impact created in the first quarter related to recording our annual estimated income taxes.
I'll cover the quarterly segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment.
Moving to the bottom table. Earnings from ongoing operations were $1.70 per share through the first 9 months of 2017 compared with $1.86 per share through the same period a year ago. Our year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.16 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.10, lower earnings from our Kentucky and Pennsylvania segments, $0.02 each, and an unfavorable variance for Corporate and Other of $0.02, again due to the timing impact created in the first quarter related to recording annual estimated income taxes.
Expected lower foreign currency exchange rates resulted in $0.24 per share of lower earnings in '17 compared to '16. We've included to the right additional drivers contributing to our year-to-date earnings variance.
The April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K., the base rate increases in Kentucky and additional transmission margins in Pennsylvania partially offset the negative effects of the lower foreign currency exchange rate, lower sales volumes and higher depreciation and interest expense resulting from continued capital investment.
Before getting into the segment details, let me just highlight the impact of weather for both the quarter and year-to-date.
For the quarter, mild domestic weather resulted in a $0.03 negative impact compared to the prior year and a $0.01 negative impact compared to budget. And on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather negatively impacted our results compared to prior year by $0.05 and $0.04 compared to budget. In the U.K., on a year-to-date basis, weather was favorable by $0.02 compared to budget and flat compared to 2016.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 6. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. These results were due to higher transmission margins resulting from additional capital investments and lower operation and maintenance expense. These favorable drivers were primary offset by lower distribution margins due to mild weather of a $0.01 and higher depreciation expense.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2017, also flat compared to a year ago. These results were driven by higher base electricity and gas rates that were effective July 1 of '17. These were offset by lower sales volumes due to unfavorable weather of $0.02 and higher depreciation expense.
Turning to Slide 8. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.24 per share in the third quarter of '17, an $0.11 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower results were primarily from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to '16 of $0.07, which was expected, lower gross margins resulting from lower sales volumes, higher financing cost due to higher interest expense on index-linked debt and higher income taxes. These results were partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense primarily from pensions.
Moving to slide 9 for a hedging update. We fully hedged our U.K. earnings through 2019 at rates above the $1.30 per pound budgeted rate in our EPS growth targets. Since the second quarter call, we've continued to reposition our hedge value for 2018 and '19 and have further hedged 2020, which is now 15% hedged at an average rate of $1.47 per pound.
With hedges above our budgeted rate in 2018, '19 and '20, we have incremental hedge value of about $0.14 across the 3 years. Our current plan is to maintain this incremental hedge value to protect against potential depreciation in the exchange rate during Brexit negotiations or any other geopolitical event that could result in a negative currency impact. We have the hedges in place to derisk our business plan, providing us a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve the 5% to 6% EPS growth rate through 2020.
And as you know, we have a dynamic hedging program that we evaluate regularly, which really enables us to be responsive to changing market conditions and risks.
Moving to slide 10. We have refreshed the foreign currency forecast through September 30. The bearish view for 2020 remains around $1.40 per pound and the bullish case much higher. You can see by the green line, the forward curve is still above our budgeted rate through 2020. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering on additional hedges to limit future earnings volatility and provide transparent earnings stability to our shareholders. If the pound continues to trade at levels above our budgeted rate, we would expect to be able to achieve the high end of our guided growth range.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period."

So -- just so folks on the call a aware, I think in the U.K. there's been a lot of concern on behalf of some consumer advocates, in particular, about the total effect of electricity and natural gas prices in the U.K. and the focus has been predominantly on the suppliers. So in the U.K., every consumer has to pick an independent gas or electric supply source. Most of those come from fairly good-size marketers. So there has been a lot of focus on the volatility and the overall cost associated with the supply component of the bill. So obviously, the distribution component is much lower, supply being typically about 70% of the bill. So thus far, we still feel confident, as you describe, Julien, not only because the focus has predominantly been on the suppliers, but also because there's a great track record with Ofgem and the value that their process, regulatory framework, has provided to the ultimate consumers. That value is measured directly and very openly and transparently to consumers through things like customer service metrics, reliability metrics and the overall very reasonable cost to deliver power to the customer. So again, we feel confident that the overall framework, regulatory framework will remain intact. And as you know, we're really set up for continuing to deliver on the approved plan through 2023.

So the stakeholder responses to the first element, if you will, of the process was an open letter that Ofgem published back in the late summer. Responses to that letter, which essentially asked for comments on how various stakeholders felt about the current processes, not only for the electric companies, but also for the gas companies. Specifically, for the electric companies, the responses were due on September 4. We didn't see anything in the responses that concerned us in the stakeholder comments that we read. The purpose of the framework review is really to build on the lessons learned from the current price control review and develop a framework that would be adaptable to meeting the needs of kind of the evolving U.K. energy sector. As you're aware, we've been successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and feel there's ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2, which is the next process we get into. We're very early in that process and as I mentioned, no changes would take effect until 2023, it would be April of 2023. So again, we've got a lot of opportunity to participate constructively and shape the framework associated with RIIO-2 to have an outcome that we think is fair to shareowners as well as stakeholders in the U.K."

I would also point out that we were fast tracked, the only companies to be fast tracked in the U.K. and that basically was because we had fully justified, very sound business plans. So again, we feel there is no justification at this time for any adjustment. As far as when the clarity comes, we do have a slide in the deck, I think it's Slide 22, that shows the indicative timetable.

I think that in the end, the Ofgem is an independent regulatory body. So they're going to be the ones making a decision whether the framework gets changed from that. Now politically, someone could propose legislation and either change that process so that is not independent as it is today. But again, that would take significant movement in Parliament on both sides. So even if the Labour Party were to come to power in an election and start to change things, it's still got to go through a process, a fairly lengthy process. Given that that's going to be a lengthy process and given that we've seen changes in the political landscape, significant ones just in the last 5 years, and we are -- we've still got 6 years to run on the current time frame until we get to 2023, so I guess my view is a lot of things are likely to change between now and 2023. It's going to be a long and, I think, a difficult process to put that toothpaste back in the tube, as I describe it, after a very long and successful kind of run with the framework. So that's kind of our opinion on it. Obviously, we continue to monitor it. And I think once we know what the outcome might be in any kind of new political regime, we'll then begin to reach out and make sure that all those on the political side are aware of the positive track record and what this really means if they were to move in a different direction."

If, for example, one of the other companies is significantly underspending, I believe there was already an adjustment made on the transmission side because there was a very large transmission project that's not going to go forward that was included in the transmission revenue construct. So a major project like that, maybe that arm-twisting as you put it, could be effective. I think in our case, first, as I mentioned earlier, we're the only companies to be fast tracked, meaning that we had a very well justified business plan. And therefore, we don't see any justification for an adjustment based on the roles that are set forth today. If one of our peers on the distribution side were to acquiesce, if you will, and adjust the revenues downward, we have to look at their circumstance.

We're pleased that you joined us this morning. With me on the call today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's Chief Financial Officer and the heads of our U.S. and U.K. utility businesses.
Since we will see many of you at EEI next week and considering the number of earnings calls being held this week, we plan to keep our prepared remarks brief and move quickly to the Q&A.
Moving to Slide 2. Our agenda this morning starts with an update to our 2017 full year earnings guidance, which we are increasing today, and a brief discussion of our longer term growth trajectory.
Vince will then provide an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings results along with the more detailed financial review. Then we'll get right to your questions.
Turning to Slide 3. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we're raising the midpoint of our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance, despite the unfavorable effects of weather in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. We're updating our 2017 forecast range from the previous $2.05 to $2.25 per share to $2.10 to $2.25 per share, increasing the midpoint of our forecast from $2.15 to $2.18 per share.
Strong year-to-date earnings in the U.K. Regulated segment give us the confidence to raise the low end of our guidance. Drivers behind the strong U.K. performance include higher sales volumes, primarily from weather, lower operating and maintenance expense and lower income taxes. As a result, we updated the segment forecasts since the second quarter call by increasing the U.K. Regulated segment by $0.04 and by lowering the Kentucky Regulated segment a $0.01 due to the continued impacts of unfavorable weather, which Vince will comment on later in his remarks.
The Pennsylvania segment and Corporate and Other are expected to deliver in line with the second quarter earnings forecast. We continue to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020, measured against the original 2017 ongoing earnings forecast midpoint of $2.15 per share. We are in the process of updating our business plans now, and we will provide earnings guidance for 2018 and an update to our longer term growth rate on the year-end call.
Our current plan includes investing more than $16 billion in infrastructure from 2017 through 2021 and achieving essentially real-time recovery for more than 3 quarters of that investment. Our investments are focused on expanding and modernizing the grid, adding Smart Grid technology and automation as well as strengthening physical and cybersecurity. We also continue to target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020.
And as I've indicated in the past, the strength of our growth plan is built on the low-risk nature of our business plans and is supported by the strength of our hedging program and our stable stream of utility earnings and cash flows.
Now I'll turn the call over to Vince to cover the financial highlights. Vince?"

Let's move to Slide 5 for a review of our financial results. Today, we announced third quarter 2017 reported earnings of $0.51 per share compared with $0.69 per share a year ago.
Year-to-date through the third quarter, reported earnings were $1.53 per share compared to $2.11 per share through the first 9 months of 2016. Adjusting for special items, third quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.56 per share compared with $0.63 per share a year ago. The $0.07 per share decrease was driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.11 per share, primarily due to $0.07 from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017.
Corporate and Other was positive by $0.04 per share due to the partial reversal of the timing impact created in the first quarter related to recording our annual estimated income taxes.
I'll cover the quarterly segment earnings drivers in more detail in a moment.
Moving to the bottom table. Earnings from ongoing operations were $1.70 per share through the first 9 months of 2017 compared with $1.86 per share through the same period a year ago. Our year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations were lower by $0.16 per share, driven by lower earnings from the U.K. Regulated segment of $0.10, lower earnings from our Kentucky and Pennsylvania segments, $0.02 each, and an unfavorable variance for Corporate and Other of $0.02, again due to the timing impact created in the first quarter related to recording annual estimated income taxes.
Expected lower foreign currency exchange rates resulted in $0.24 per share of lower earnings in '17 compared to '16. We've included to the right additional drivers contributing to our year-to-date earnings variance.
The April 1, 2016, price increase in the U.K., the base rate increases in Kentucky and additional transmission margins in Pennsylvania partially offset the negative effects of the lower foreign currency exchange rate, lower sales volumes and higher depreciation and interest expense resulting from continued capital investment.
Before getting into the segment details, let me just highlight the impact of weather for both the quarter and year-to-date.
For the quarter, mild domestic weather resulted in a $0.03 negative impact compared to the prior year and a $0.01 negative impact compared to budget. And on a year-to-date basis, domestic weather negatively impacted our results compared to prior year by $0.05 and $0.04 compared to budget. In the U.K., on a year-to-date basis, weather was favorable by $0.02 compared to budget and flat compared to 2016.
Let's move to a more detailed review of the second quarter segment earnings drivers, starting with the Pennsylvania results on Slide 6. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.13 per share in the third quarter of 2017, flat compared to the same period last year. These results were due to higher transmission margins resulting from additional capital investments and lower operation and maintenance expense. These favorable drivers were primary offset by lower distribution margins due to mild weather of a $0.01 and higher depreciation expense.
Moving to Slide 7. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earned $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2017, also flat compared to a year ago. These results were driven by higher base electricity and gas rates that were effective July 1 of '17. These were offset by lower sales volumes due to unfavorable weather of $0.02 and higher depreciation expense.
Turning to Slide 8. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.24 per share in the third quarter of '17, an $0.11 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The lower results were primarily from lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017 compared to '16 of $0.07, which was expected, lower gross margins resulting from lower sales volumes, higher financing cost due to higher interest expense on index-linked debt and higher income taxes. These results were partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense primarily from pensions.
Moving to slide 9 for a hedging update. We fully hedged our U.K. earnings through 2019 at rates above the $1.30 per pound budgeted rate in our EPS growth targets. Since the second quarter call, we've continued to reposition our hedge value for 2018 and '19 and have further hedged 2020, which is now 15% hedged at an average rate of $1.47 per pound.
With hedges above our budgeted rate in 2018, '19 and '20, we have incremental hedge value of about $0.14 across the 3 years. Our current plan is to maintain this incremental hedge value to protect against potential depreciation in the exchange rate during Brexit negotiations or any other geopolitical event that could result in a negative currency impact. We have the hedges in place to derisk our business plan, providing us a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve the 5% to 6% EPS growth rate through 2020.
And as you know, we have a dynamic hedging program that we evaluate regularly, which really enables us to be responsive to changing market conditions and risks.
Moving to slide 10. We have refreshed the foreign currency forecast through September 30. The bearish view for 2020 remains around $1.40 per pound and the bullish case much higher. You can see by the green line, the forward curve is still above our budgeted rate through 2020. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering on additional hedges to limit future earnings volatility and provide transparent earnings stability to our shareholders. If the pound continues to trade at levels above our budgeted rate, we would expect to be able to achieve the high end of our guided growth range.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Bill for the Q&A period."

So -- just so folks on the call a aware, I think in the U.K. there's been a lot of concern on behalf of some consumer advocates, in particular, about the total effect of electricity and natural gas prices in the U.K. and the focus has been predominantly on the suppliers. So in the U.K., every consumer has to pick an independent gas or electric supply source. Most of those come from fairly good-size marketers. So there has been a lot of focus on the volatility and the overall cost associated with the supply component of the bill. So obviously, the distribution component is much lower, supply being typically about 70% of the bill. So thus far, we still feel confident, as you describe, Julien, not only because the focus has predominantly been on the suppliers, but also because there's a great track record with Ofgem and the value that their process, regulatory framework, has provided to the ultimate consumers. That value is measured directly and very openly and transparently to consumers through things like customer service metrics, reliability metrics and the overall very reasonable cost to deliver power to the customer. So again, we feel confident that the overall framework, regulatory framework will remain intact. And as you know, we're really set up for continuing to deliver on the approved plan through 2023. So we have a long runway yet on the current process and the new process for beyond 2023 is just now kicking off."

Responses to that letter, which essentially asked for comments on how various stakeholders felt about the current processes, not only for the electric companies, but also for the gas companies. Specifically, for the electric companies, the responses were due on September 4. We didn't see anything in the responses that concerned us in the stakeholder comments that we read. The purpose of the framework review is really to build on the lessons learned from the current price control review and develop a framework that would be adaptable to meeting the needs of kind of the evolving U.K. energy sector. As you're aware, we've been successful in the past at navigating through new price controls and feel there's ample time to effectively prepare for the start of RIIO-ED2, which is the next process we get into. We're very early in that process and as I mentioned, no changes would take effect until 2023, it would be April of 2023.

Now politically, someone could propose legislation and either change that process so that is not independent as it is today. But again, that would take significant movement in Parliament on both sides. So even if the Labour Party were to come to power in an election and start to change things, it's still got to go through a process, a fairly lengthy process. Given that that's going to be a lengthy process and given that we've seen changes in the political landscape, significant ones just in the last 5 years, and we are -- we've still got 6 years to run on the current time frame until we get to 2023, so I guess my view is a lot of things are likely to change between now and 2023. It's going to be a long and, I think, a difficult process to put that toothpaste back in the tube, as I describe it, after a very long and successful kind of run with the framework. So that's kind of our opinion on it. Obviously, we continue to monitor it.

If, for example, one of the other companies is significantly underspending, I believe there was already an adjustment made on the transmission side because there was a very large transmission project that's not going to go forward that was included in the transmission revenue construct. So a major project like that, maybe that arm-twisting as you put it, could be effective. I think in our case, first, as I mentioned earlier, we're the only companies to be fast tracked, meaning that we had a very well justified business plan. And therefore, we don't see any justification for an adjustment based on the roles that are set forth today. If one of our peers on the distribution side were to acquiesce, if you will, and adjust the revenues downward, we have to look at their circumstance.
