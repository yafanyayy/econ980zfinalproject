For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, total revenue was $1.4 billion and earnings per share were in line with our expectations at $1.64. We saw solid",1810,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, total revenue was $1.4 billion and earnings per share were in line with our expectations at $1.64. We saw solid results in several areas of our business during the quarter. The new fall and holiday handbag introductions performed well, led by the Mercer, Brooklyn and Sloan Editor collections. All of these new fashion luxury handbag groups were supported by enhanced marketing in both traditional and social media channels, which helped create strong sell-throughs across these launches. We also continued to see strong response to our new MICHAEL KORS ACCESS line of wearable technology with sales exceeding our expectations for the season. 
In addition, momentum in our athletic footwear business remains strong, and our holiday womenâ€™s ready-to-wear collection received favorable response. Our digital flagship in North America continued to deliver double-digit comparable sales growth while sales in our new digital flagship in Europe exceeded expectations. We also rolled out Custom Kors on our digital flagship in North America, which featured free monogramming services as well as options to create your own personally styled Sloan Select handbag. All of these initiatives, which were led by Michael and our design team, demonstrate our continued commitment to delivering exciting, new luxury fashion products to consumers globally. 
While we were pleased to see the strong performance in multiple areas of our business, we were disappointed in our North American and European comparable sales, which continued to be impacted by negative traffic trends and currency fluctuations. We also saw average unit retails negatively impacted by the highly promotional environment as well as the continued fashion trends towards crossbody and small leather goods. Additionally, the fashion watch category remained challenged, which continued to negatively impact our comparable sales. 
In the retail segment, global net sales grew 9% during the quarter and comparable sales decreased 6.9%. In the Americas, retail net sales decreased 1% and comparable sales decreased in the mid-single digits, which was in line with our expectations despite the very difficult retail environment. 
The e-commerce business outperformed expectations with double-digit comparable sales increases. In stores, traffic declined in the high single digits, which was partially offset by an increase in conversion rates. We also saw solid results from the launch of our click-and-collect offering in 10 stores in North America during the quarter enabling customers to make their purchases online and pick up the merchandise in one of our retail location on the same day. Based on the strong response to click and collect thus far, we plan to roll out this feature across all U.S. locations in this quarter. We believe that further enhancing our omni-channel presence will help us to drive improved comparable sales results in the future. 
Turning to the international business. In Europe, overall retail net sales were essentially flat during the quarter. In our newly launched digital flagships, sales significantly exceeded expectations. In stores, comparable sales decreased in the mid-teens range as we saw steeper-than-expected declines in store traffic, which we believe was due to the continuation of weak tourism trends as well as reduced consumer confidence related to Brexit and terrorist attacks in certain markets. 
In addition, a portion of the decline was attributable to a shift in customer traffic from retail locations to the newly launched digital flagships. If we were to include e-commerce sales, our European comparable sales results would have been down in the mid-single digits on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant-currency basis. This is similar to the trend we saw in North America when we launched our e-commerce platform. 
In Asia, total retail net sales increased almost 300%, largely as a result of revenue from the acquisition of the Greater China and Korea operations. In Japan, retail net sales grew more than 25% with comparable sales increasing in the mid-single digits. The Greater China business, while not included in the comparable sales base, increased double digits on a constant-currency basis. 
We were also excited to launch our first digital flagship in China in October with, initial performance exceeding expectations. While the digital landscape remains small for luxury brands into this region, we feel that offering a full view of the Michael Kors brand online enhances our customer engagement and acquisition. Importantly, these results indicate that the Michael Kors brand is strong and growing in Asia. 
We opened 29 net new stores globally throughout the quarter, including 14 new and expanded men's stores, bringing our total to 35 men's locations, as well as 2 new flagships in Asia. Michael was on hand for the opening festivities of our flagship store in Seoul, Korea and helped celebrate Harper's Bazaar Young Korea feature, which showcase looks from our resort 2017 collection. In Singapore, Michael was joined by Kate Hudson to help celebrate the opening of our Mandarin Galleria (sic) [ Mandarin Gallery ] store, which, at 6,000 square feet, is the largest Michael Kors flagship store in Southeast Asia. 
Turning to the Wholesale business. Net sales declined 18% during the quarter. In the Americas, sales decreased 15% as we continue to strategically reduce sell-in into the department store channel. In addition, beginning this month, we are reducing promotional activity across the retail and wholesale channels, which is expected to result in average unit retails -- higher average unit retails as the product positioning will be elevated. While we believe this is the right thing to do for our brand long term, this decision is expected to negatively impact our net sales throughout fiscal 2018, albeit to a smaller degree, and the declines are expected to further moderate in fiscal 2019 as we anniversary the reductions in inventory and reduced promotional activity. As we continue to reduce our inventory position in the wholesale channel, we anticipate this segment will be a smaller portion of our net sales going forward. 
In Europe, net sales in the Wholesale segment decreased 12% as the headwinds that impacted our retail stores also had a negative effect on sales in the wholesale channel. We also continued to see a shift in sales trends towards products with lower average unit retails, such as crossbodies and small leather goods, and anticipate this trend will continue throughout fiscal 2018. In addition, we anticipate market volatility in this region throughout the calendar year. In the U.K., we saw -- we continue to experience a decrease in traffic despite the weaker pound sterling. In France and Germany, we are concerned about the upcoming elections, which we believe may impact consumer buying habits. 
In Asia, Wholesale net sales decreased 68%, primarily attributable to the shift of China and South Korean sales to our company-owned retail segment. This decrease will continue until we anniversary the acquisition of our Greater China license. 
Turning to our men's segment. We are pleased with the performance of this developing business. We now have more than 250 men's shop-in-shops, and our men's sportswear offerings is resonating with the customer globally. Additionally, we have further expanded our leather goods offering, which drove accelerated growth in this category during the quarter. We remain committed to developing this segment of the men's business. 
In the licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter as a result of continued softness in the fashion watch and jewelry categories and lower revenues in Asia as a result of the recent acquisition of our licensed operations. This was partially offset by the strong performance of the ACCESS line of wearable technology globally, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Given the current size of the ACCESS business, the new collection only partially offset the decline in fashion watches. Based on this success, we will continue to invest in and expand the wearable technology category with the goal of ultimately becoming the second-largest smartwatch brand globally. 
We were also pleased with the performance of the fragrance collection in this quarter, especially the positive response to our new Wonderlust fragrance, which led to strong results particularly during the holiday period. The fragrance category continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for the company. 
In conclusion, we believe the Michael Kors brand remains strong, but it is clear that we must enact changes to reverse the negative comparable sales trends that we are experiencing in our stores. We are focused on 5 specific initiatives to improve comparable sales performance in North America and Europe. 
First, Michael and our design teams have introduced new design elements in accessories to provide a more elevated and layered assortment. These unique and innovative techniques, including artisanal craftsmanship, iconic hardware details and intricate mixed-media leathers, that will enhance our glamorous handbag offerings in the $498 to $398 category. Additionally, we have 5 iconic groups consisting of Hamilton, Selma, Savannah, Cynthia and Mercer handbags that will be shipped this quarter and are strategically priced at $298 for medium sizes and $258 to $228 on certain smaller sizes. 
Second, we will be expanding the presence of our new Jet Set signature accessories in our stores, which will include multiple layers for the fall season. Initial results of our new Jet Set signature deliveries for the spring season have been very strong. This is an iconic element for our brand, and we will capitalize on the current fashion trend for signature accessories. 
Third, we are increasing the penetration of footwear in our largest volume doors. As one of the leading fashion footwear companies globally, we intend to capitalize on this strength and increase the presence of this category in key stores. 
Fourth, we are focusing on our fast-growing dress category as an iconic cornerstone of our womenâ€™s ready to wear. This will be highlighted by our new online dress shop that is scheduled to launch this fall. This category will represent approximately 50% of our ready-to-wear assortments in our stores. 
Fifth, we will significantly increase our digital marketing spend to fuel our fast-growing e-commerce business globally. We continue to see strong revenue growth from our initiatives in this channel as consumers shift their shopping behavior. 
With these 5 initiatives, we expect to drive increased store and site visits as well as increased average unit retails and deepen our engagement with consumers in our retail channel to improve comparable sales in North America and Europe. In addition to these initiatives, we remain confident that we have a significant incremental revenue opportunity as we build Asia into a $1 billion business. We also feel strongly that we're on the right track to developing a significant men's business, which could ultimately be $1 billion in revenue. In summary, our increased emphasis on the retail segment, in addition to the expansion of our Asia and men's business, will help us rebalance our revenues and position us for growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to review our financials."

For the third quarter, total revenue was $1.35 billion compared to $1.40 billion in the prior year quarter. In the retail segment, net sales increased 9.2%, driven primarily by the addition of 193 net new stores since the third quarter",1635,"Thank you, John. For the third quarter, total revenue was $1.35 billion compared to $1.40 billion in the prior year quarter. 
In the retail segment, net sales increased 9.2%, driven primarily by the addition of 193 net new stores since the third quarter of last year, including 143 stores associated with the recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea. 
Comparable sales decreased 6.9%, reflecting a mid-single-digit decrease in North America and a mid-teens decline in Europe, partially offset by a mid-single-digit increase in Asia. E-commerce comparable sales contributed approximately 340 basis points to our performance in the quarter. 
As John mentioned, North America remained under pressure from declining store traffic and the aggressive promotional environment, which was partially offset by increased conversion rates and strong performance of our digital flagships. The comparable sales decline in Europe was driven by reduced store traffic and lower average unit retails as a result of shift in product mix, with a portion of the decline attributable to the launch of our European digital flagships. The North American digital flagships achieved double-digit comparable sales increases in the quarter. While European digital flagships are not yet included in the comparable sales base, had they been included, the European comp would have been down in the mid-single digits on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant-currency basis. 
In the Wholesale segment, net sales declined 17.8% due to lower sales in the women's accessories and apparel businesses. The Wholesale business in the Americas region declined in the mid-teens as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we ship into that channel. European net sales decreased in the low teens while, on Asia, the decrease in net sales largely reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korea businesses to the retail segment during the quarter. 
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 22.9%. This was primarily due to the continued softness of the fashion watch and jewelry categories as well as lower revenues from the geographic licensing arrangement in Asia due to the recent acquisitions of our licensee operations. 
Gross margin expanded 10 basis points to 59.6% due to a favorable channel mix shift towards the retail segment as well as an increase in the wholesale gross margin. Gross margin increased 210 basis points in the Wholesale segment primarily due to lower allowances and favorable change in the geographic mix. Gross margin declined 270 basis points in the retail segment, which was attributable to an increase in promotional activities as compared to last year. 
Total operating expense grew 9.7% and increased 410 basis points to 34.3% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China and South Korea, including the higher depreciation expense and amortization of the reacquired rights of the intangible asset recognized in connection with the recently acquired businesses as well as investments in new stores, e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities, new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements. 
Income from operations was $341.9 million or 25.3% of total revenue as compared to 29.3% of total revenue in the same period last year. Retail operating margin was 21.3% compared to 27.8% in the prior year period. 270 basis points of this decrease was due to the gross margin reduction that I described earlier; 180 basis points was the result of China and South Korea acquisitions, including the amortization of reacquired rights; and 190 basis points was related to the continued investments in building our digital flagship platforms, retail store-related costs and deleverage, in large part related to a mix shift between e-commerce and in-store sales. We expect operating margin for the retail segment to continue to be negatively impacted by the inclusion of the newly acquired international businesses and a mix shift of sales to our e-commerce channel, both of which currently carry a lower operating margin. 
Wholesale operating margin was 29.6% compared to 27.9% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of the 210 basis point increase in our wholesale gross margin, partially offset by a 40 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue. 
Licensing operating margin was 54.7% compared to 64.8% in the prior year period. This was primarily due to increased costs associated with advertising as well as increased depreciation expense. 
Income taxes were $70.4 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 20.6% as compared to 28.0% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of certain global financing activities. 
Net income was $271.3 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $1.64. This compares to net income of $294.6 million or $1.59 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $521.6 million in operating cash flow, ending the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $368.8 million. Inventory was relatively flat compared to the prior year as we continued to carefully manage these levels. 
We ended the quarter with $147.8 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. At the end of the third quarter, the amount available for future borrowings was approximately $852.7 million. In January 2017, the company repaid all of the borrowings outstanding under the 2015 credit facility. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares totaling $100 million under our share repurchase program and have another $250 million of availability remaining in our most recent $1 billion authorization. This most recent share repurchase further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and our confidence in our long-term growth potential. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $39.1 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. 
Looking forward, we expect continued headwinds from challenging retail trends in North America and Europe as well as our decision to further tighten inventory control and reduce promotional activity. As a result, we have moderated our outlook and now expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be approximately 14 -- excuse me, $4.48 billion and comparable sales to decrease in the high single-digit range. We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 59.3%, below our initial expectation as our lower European sales outlook will result in a less favorable benefit from geographic mix than we initially anticipated. We expect operating expenses as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 39.7%. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 19.9%, excluding the $11.3 million in onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.13 on a GAAP basis including the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs, and be between $4.15 and $4.19 excluding the onetime cost. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 169.0 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect continued -- we expect total revenue to be between $1.035 billion and $1.055 billion and a low-teens decrease in comparable sales. As compared to our prior fourth quarter expectations, we now anticipate retail net sales to be approximately $54 million lower as we have prudently adjusted our outlook to reflect continued slower sales as well as revised foreign exchange expectations, somewhat offset by our strong e-commerce results. We reduced our Wholesale segment expectation by approximately $11 million, reflecting a larger-than-anticipated impact from the new promotional policy and weak trends in Europe. 
Gross margin is now expected to increase to approximately 58.4%, driven by a favorable geographic and channel mix shift. 
We plan to continue to invest in our digital flagships, international expansion and global infrastructure. This would result in an operating expense as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 44.4%, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 14.0%, a decrease of approximately 400 basis points from our prior expectations, with approximately 150 basis points as a result of lower gross margin and 250 basis points as a result of deleverage as we reduce our retail and Wholesale sales. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.72. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 22% and 164.0 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
For fiscal 2017, capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $200 million and will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omni-channel capabilities; global retail expansion, including approximately 8 net new stores in the Americas, 25 in Europe and 28 in Asia, 96 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information system and corporate facilities. 
In conclusion, while the current environment is challenging, we continue to focus on our operating priorities in order to drive sales and earnings growth. Looking forward to fiscal 2018, we anticipate modest top line growth, driven by higher retail net sales, as we continue to deliver an innovative luxury product offering, enhance our e-commerce capabilities, further expand our business in Asia and grow the men's segment. 
We anticipate the declines in the Wholesale business will moderate as we anniversary the reductions in inventory and reduce promotional activity. And we expect licensing revenue to be relatively flat as declines in the fashion watch category subside and the smartwatch sales continue to grow. Taking all this into account and the strategic investments that we are making in the company, we expect operating margin in the high teens and modest earnings per share growth. Consistent with our prior practice, we will provide you with additional detailed guidance when we announce our fourth quarter results in late May. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

Thank you, Omar. I would answer it differently for North America and Europe. In North America, as we have previously said and indicated, our revenue base will decline throughout the entire period of next fiscal year, and that's as we reset with our department store partners, based upon our new promotional policy, which, as we said in the prepared remarks, starts actually around February 1. So that's in place now, and many of our partners are reducing their inventory with us and we're reducing it with them as they have operated with a much more aggressive promotional posture. And as we said, again, our objective is to reduce promotion, increase average AUR and position the brand in a more elevated place with our consumer. This is a very aggressive approach. We don't believe any of our competitors are taking this level of stance as it relates to walking away from the promotional activity. We will have 4 periods that we do authorize a Michael Kors event during the year. And so we think it's going to take the entire fiscal year to work our way through that. And as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we kind of see that leveling off in our fiscal '19. That being said, inside -- the category of men's as a wholesale component inside the United States will grow and should grow rather quickly, and we're very pleased with what we've seen so far, in particular, on the wholesale side with that business both in ready to wear and in leather. Europe is a separate conversation. Again, many of the department stores are experiencing similar things that you're seeing here in North America. There's been a slowdown in traffic in many of the cities, and we've gone through the reasons of that, whether it was Brexit or whether it was terrorist activities, which have stopped certain people internationally on a tourism basis. And also, locally, there are many places where people are, quite frankly, fearful of going into shopping malls because of incidents. So we anticipate that to continue -- that level of disruption to continue through, again, the balance of this fiscal year. And in addition to that, we're very concerned about upcoming elections and what that might do in certain of the marketplaces, and we highlighted, in particular, Germany and France, where we have very sizable businesses. So again, we do not see that kind of resetting until, I would say, fiscal '19 for us. And that's why we're really looking at the company in total, Omar, to kind of rebalance our business. We're going to be much more retail focused, led by our digital flagships than our retail stores, and also, that will be really driven even more heavily by our opportunities that are inside of Asia."

We certainly have the capacity to do sizable transactions or smaller transaction.

And so what we want to do is create value when she walks in the door and she sees an amazing design, she doesn't have to wait for a coupon or a sale or anything else. She's stimulated by what she's seen and we clearly saw that with our Mercer handbag collection, which was nonpromotional the entire Fall season and was basically our #1 selling collection. So she responded to the design, she responded to the fact that it's full price, but she also responded to the fact there was great value there in that collection. So what we're doing is we've kind of learn from that, and we said, okay, why do we expect thought process. And a lot of the great exciting collections that we're actually reintroducing in new shapes is Hamilton, which has one of our best-selling groups for many, many years.

And again, they were just literally unpacking the boxes on that in some stores recently and had some excellent initial sales results. So we think that's the right thing to do to create value at the right price so that when she walks into the door, she doesn't have to think about whether something is on sale are not, and we believe that's going to have a fairly significant impact on our AUR. And then secondly, we are, as I said in my prepared remarks, now that we kind of believe we've reset this $295 and $259 -- I'm sorry, $298 and $258 and $228 basis, we're now going to look at our $498 and $398 category and really try and build up that area of opportunity where we believe, in particular, on our own stores we're capable all being able to sell that at a full price. I also want to point out that the second best-selling product for us that we actually run off during the holiday season was our ACCESS watches. Again, totally full price, no sale on that product. And again, when it's the right fashion, the right price for the consumer, we think we're doing quite well with them on that. So that's the strategy on AUR and we will be a lot less promotional by a significant amount of days. So we're looking to raise that ultimately by approximately 10%. That's our goal to get to. And we think we can do that throughout the year. It's not going to happen all on day 1, but it will happen throughout the year. Secondly, on the store traffic side, we view our stores in 2 ways. First off, the majority of our fleet globally is very profitable. There are definitely some unprofitable stores that we will analyze over the next 6 months and make some decisions on, but the majority of the fleet is very nicely profitable. That being said, we also view our store footprints as an opportunity for us to act as a distribution center, in a sense. And we talked about click and collect and our omni capabilities. We're learning a lot more about that as we go forward. We also have tests that our upcoming in the spring season on same-day delivery out of a number of locations. And, so we want to make the determination of what does a footprint allow you to do in terms of service. And we think service is going to be a critical component of our long-term success as a brand and also as an omnichannel retailer. So how do we service her, where do service, where do we provide for that service and at which speed. And we all know that people are setting the standard in that, so we take very seriously, and we think the store footprints will allow us to -- of the Kabul police of doing that as well as other human profitable or of asleep you don't remain profitable then we will look to reduce that footprint."

Actually, our operating margins in retail will expand for 2 reasons. Number one, for geographic mix and, in particular, Asia. Asia is getting more profitable for us each quarter as we're gaining velocity and we're gaining scale, which is creating leverage. And as you know from many of the other global luxury players, Asia and sometimes can be the most profitable part of their business. So we believe that's going to have a very significant impact on our operating margin performance going forward in retail. We are also getting more profitable in our e-commerce business. It's still not too where we want it to be in terms of against where we are in our retail stores, but it is getting more profitable. So we believe that, that will have a positive impact on us next year in terms of operating margins. We will see operating margins decline slightly in our wholesale business as we do have some deleverage in terms of the size volume coming down. And then also there had been some significant initiatives that have gone inside our organization obviously to reduce cost given our new revenue outlooks. So while we are disappointed that we are no longer able to, for the moment, say that we can carry a 2-handle, we do think that we will still be one of the most significantly profitable global luxury brands in the world and generating significant free cash flow, which will continue to give us the ability to execute on both share repurchase and then acquisition potential. And as we said even in the future we might consider dividend, although that's not in the immediate horizon. So I think we are comfortable that we do not need to think about a further, a significant deceleration in the EBIT margins. Joe?"

And then secondly, just back on the operating margins, so do we think that towards of the end of the SG&A dollar investment cycle, and then also CapEx, I think you said $200 million, can we get further lower from there because the free cash flow of the company continues to pile up and the market multiple on those cash flow keeps going down.

And then the predominant amount of store openings will be focused in Asia. We're pretty much done with the footprint in North America, we're pretty much done with the footprint in Europe. There'll be some capital around men's expansion. So we feel very comfortable kind of in that range of where we are today or lower, slightly lower we will be on a go-forward basis. In terms of acquisitions, look, I said to you earlier. Our #1 capital allocation priority is to repurchase shares again, with our multiple being consistently below where our peer group is and us still being much more profitable than many of them. We think there's a dislocation. And the board and the senior management of the team of the company feel that's really the best investment for us to make. And so I think that will be #1. And #2, again, if we can utilize the company -- the management team's expertise and certain other of our capabilities internally to create value for our shareholders, we will look at that. But we're not going to do that at the expense of our own corporate initiatives. And again, we believe there is still they are significant volume revenue opportunity for the company over the next few years. We are being impacted by decision that we've made to kind of get out of the fray of these every kind of few weeks promotional activity. And I think that's the right decision for us. But that's going to take a significant amount of revenues away from the company. But I think create much better value for us long term as a brand with the end consumer, and that's the right thing for us to do. So we'll stay focus on that is our priority and then look at our share repurchase program. And if the right acquisitions come up, we will consider it and if we don't, then we'll pass and stay focus on what we're doing."

And I will tell you that the minute the watches the store, we have something happened that we haven't seen in a long time as it relates the watch category, we have people kind of lining up for the watches. You may have seen with some of our stores. And we're still having trouble catching up with the demand that we have both in on our own stores and many of our retail partners. So clearly, this is a category that is here as a category that will grow. So we're excited about that. And both Fossil and ourselves feel that we're at the very beginning of something that could become sizable. I can't tell you, whether it's going to ultimately outpace where we were with the total fashion watch business. The category of fashion watches in total continues to decline not just us, many competitors as well are seeing the same thing. Again, both Fossil and, in particular, Costar [ph] and I believe that the fashion watch business will be completely reshaped as we know it today. And that most watches over the next 3 to 5 years will come with some level of technology.  We'll be making some exciting announcements in Fossil in a few weeks about some additional things that we're doing in the wearable technology space that we think will further enhance our positioning. So just know that again, Fossil and, in particular, Costar and myself are very, very committed to maintaining our leadership position in the fashion watch business. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we think we will ultimately become second-largest wearable watch business in the world. And clearly, the numbers are pointing towards that. So if this category grows, this could be important for us. As I said, again, in the prepare remarks, it did not offset the decline in the total fashion watch business, but we were significantly encouraged by the beginning of a trend change that we saw and look forward to that continuing on. The handbag category, Dana, our kind of intel, we believe the category was about flat in calendar Q4/ our Q3 and I would say that was both in North America and Europe. We believe the category actually grew in Asia. And we are going to have reduced market share, that is absolutely something that we actually want. And by us reducing our wholesale shipments, and to some degree, pulling back on the promotional activity in our own stores, we'll reduce our velocity in our own stores, we will have less market share. We actually, think it's that's healthy thing for us in a go-forward basis and our outlook is that the handbag marketplace globally will remain approximately flat, maybe up 1 point or 2, again that's in dollars. And in units, we actually think that the market was up significantly. So I'll just give you one number. In North America, in handbags, where we had a single-digit decline in our own stores, we were up 11% in units, that's actually sold units to the customer. So once again, that gives us great comfort that the consumer is absolutely engaging with the Michael Kors brand and again, all of our consumer research says that. She's just finding it at a much more attractively price -- much more attractive price and even finding that. And we're going to show her value in a different way going forward that we think will keep her engaged and our objective is to sell significantly less units next fiscal year than we sold this fiscal year."

The European trends again, I think there's was an interesting note that you heard in my prepared remarks, and you heard in Joe's prepared remarks, which were that if you added back in our e-commerce business on a constant-currency basis, actually our business in Europe was flat. So we far exceeded our expectations when we turned on our e-commerce sites, what we refer to as our digital flagships, which we believe had a significant impact on our business in the marketplace. While traffic was down in Europe, it was down in kind of the mid-single digits, which was lower than what we had anticipated, but again, it was, we believe, a lot of that volume went directly to our own website during the period. So we're going to continue to watch that. We saw the exact same thing happen in North America the minute we turned on our e-commerce, our comp store sales were impacted pretty dramatically quickly and again, that's just consumers changing their shopping behavior. And as we've seen in many countries, they want to go to the official website. We certainly have had other partners having e-commerce in the territories. But now, there is the Michael Kors website, which you are able to see the full range of our products, you're able to engage with many of our social activities and styling tips. And as we said in North America, we're launching specialized product offerings under Kors customs, we're going to roll that out in Europe as well. There's a lot going on in our website, and also talk about the fact that our dress shop will launch in the early part of Fall, maybe late as Spring. So we think that this is only going to get bigger. And again that's why as I said in my prepared remarks, we're spending more money to help fuel that. And we think Europe, in particular, we'll see that trend continue. So there's a long-winded way of me saying that we think actual store comps will be -- will remain down kind of in the same trend, maybe even worse than they've been and we'll look about the total mix is wrapped up with our e-commerce business to see how that's impacting our trends."

So there's something going on all the time. And as I said to you, we're going to have -- we're going to really consolidate that down to 4x a year. So we believe that's going to significantly reduce the amount of off-price business that we're doing, hence the reason for the significant reduction in the inventory going into the channel. And so I think that, that's something we're going to just to have to see how it plays out over time. But we are focused on making sure that, along with that, we provide great value. And that value doesn't only mean $295 or -- I'm sorry, $298 or $228, that value could also be in one of our very successful, our Mercer bag, which the grab bag with the garments and the consumer saw that at $498, wow, this is amazing design and tremendous amount of workmanship and detail and design that went into that. We thought was a very, very exciting and compelling value for the consumer. So we look at those things and really balance them. And again, we're trying to make sure that she sees the Michael Kors at an elevated brand and not something that's on promotion on a regular basis. And in the outlet channel, I would say, AUR did decline during the quarter and has declined over the last few quarters as the channel has become also extremely promotional. Our competitors are in many cases much deeper discount than we are. And so that's becoming something that we had to really compete with. The good news in that channel is this less of a traffic issue, and so that's kind of help us balance of the AUR piece in our conversions are up in that channel as well.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, total revenue was $1.4 billion and earnings per share were in line with our expectations at $1.64. We saw solid results in several areas of our business during the quarter. The new fall and holiday handbag introductions performed well, led by the Mercer, Brooklyn and Sloan Editor collections. All of these new fashion luxury handbag groups were supported by enhanced marketing in both traditional and social media channels, which helped create strong sell-throughs across these launches. We also continued to see strong response to our new MICHAEL KORS ACCESS line of wearable technology with sales exceeding our expectations for the season. 
In addition, momentum in our athletic footwear business remains strong, and our holiday womenâ€™s ready-to-wear collection received favorable response. Our digital flagship in North America continued to deliver double-digit comparable sales growth while sales in our new digital flagship in Europe exceeded expectations. We also rolled out Custom Kors on our digital flagship in North America, which featured free monogramming services as well as options to create your own personally styled Sloan Select handbag. All of these initiatives, which were led by Michael and our design team, demonstrate our continued commitment to delivering exciting, new luxury fashion products to consumers globally. 
While we were pleased to see the strong performance in multiple areas of our business, we were disappointed in our North American and European comparable sales, which continued to be impacted by negative traffic trends and currency fluctuations. We also saw average unit retails negatively impacted by the highly promotional environment as well as the continued fashion trends towards crossbody and small leather goods. Additionally, the fashion watch category remained challenged, which continued to negatively impact our comparable sales. 
In the retail segment, global net sales grew 9% during the quarter and comparable sales decreased 6.9%. In the Americas, retail net sales decreased 1% and comparable sales decreased in the mid-single digits, which was in line with our expectations despite the very difficult retail environment. 
The e-commerce business outperformed expectations with double-digit comparable sales increases. In stores, traffic declined in the high single digits, which was partially offset by an increase in conversion rates. We also saw solid results from the launch of our click-and-collect offering in 10 stores in North America during the quarter enabling customers to make their purchases online and pick up the merchandise in one of our retail location on the same day. Based on the strong response to click and collect thus far, we plan to roll out this feature across all U.S. locations in this quarter. We believe that further enhancing our omni-channel presence will help us to drive improved comparable sales results in the future. 
Turning to the international business. In Europe, overall retail net sales were essentially flat during the quarter. In our newly launched digital flagships, sales significantly exceeded expectations. In stores, comparable sales decreased in the mid-teens range as we saw steeper-than-expected declines in store traffic, which we believe was due to the continuation of weak tourism trends as well as reduced consumer confidence related to Brexit and terrorist attacks in certain markets. 
In addition, a portion of the decline was attributable to a shift in customer traffic from retail locations to the newly launched digital flagships. If we were to include e-commerce sales, our European comparable sales results would have been down in the mid-single digits on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant-currency basis. This is similar to the trend we saw in North America when we launched our e-commerce platform. 
In Asia, total retail net sales increased almost 300%, largely as a result of revenue from the acquisition of the Greater China and Korea operations. In Japan, retail net sales grew more than 25% with comparable sales increasing in the mid-single digits. The Greater China business, while not included in the comparable sales base, increased double digits on a constant-currency basis. 
We were also excited to launch our first digital flagship in China in October with, initial performance exceeding expectations. While the digital landscape remains small for luxury brands into this region, we feel that offering a full view of the Michael Kors brand online enhances our customer engagement and acquisition. Importantly, these results indicate that the Michael Kors brand is strong and growing in Asia. 
We opened 29 net new stores globally throughout the quarter, including 14 new and expanded men's stores, bringing our total to 35 men's locations, as well as 2 new flagships in Asia. Michael was on hand for the opening festivities of our flagship store in Seoul, Korea and helped celebrate Harper's Bazaar Young Korea feature, which showcase looks from our resort 2017 collection. In Singapore, Michael was joined by Kate Hudson to help celebrate the opening of our Mandarin Galleria (sic) [ Mandarin Gallery ] store, which, at 6,000 square feet, is the largest Michael Kors flagship store in Southeast Asia. 
Turning to the Wholesale business. Net sales declined 18% during the quarter. In the Americas, sales decreased 15% as we continue to strategically reduce sell-in into the department store channel. In addition, beginning this month, we are reducing promotional activity across the retail and wholesale channels, which is expected to result in average unit retails -- higher average unit retails as the product positioning will be elevated. While we believe this is the right thing to do for our brand long term, this decision is expected to negatively impact our net sales throughout fiscal 2018, albeit to a smaller degree, and the declines are expected to further moderate in fiscal 2019 as we anniversary the reductions in inventory and reduced promotional activity. As we continue to reduce our inventory position in the wholesale channel, we anticipate this segment will be a smaller portion of our net sales going forward. 
In Europe, net sales in the Wholesale segment decreased 12% as the headwinds that impacted our retail stores also had a negative effect on sales in the wholesale channel. We also continued to see a shift in sales trends towards products with lower average unit retails, such as crossbodies and small leather goods, and anticipate this trend will continue throughout fiscal 2018. In addition, we anticipate market volatility in this region throughout the calendar year. In the U.K., we saw -- we continue to experience a decrease in traffic despite the weaker pound sterling. In France and Germany, we are concerned about the upcoming elections, which we believe may impact consumer buying habits. 
In Asia, Wholesale net sales decreased 68%, primarily attributable to the shift of China and South Korean sales to our company-owned retail segment. This decrease will continue until we anniversary the acquisition of our Greater China license. 
Turning to our men's segment. We are pleased with the performance of this developing business. We now have more than 250 men's shop-in-shops, and our men's sportswear offerings is resonating with the customer globally. Additionally, we have further expanded our leather goods offering, which drove accelerated growth in this category during the quarter. We remain committed to developing this segment of the men's business. 
In the licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter as a result of continued softness in the fashion watch and jewelry categories and lower revenues in Asia as a result of the recent acquisition of our licensed operations. This was partially offset by the strong performance of the ACCESS line of wearable technology globally, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Given the current size of the ACCESS business, the new collection only partially offset the decline in fashion watches. Based on this success, we will continue to invest in and expand the wearable technology category with the goal of ultimately becoming the second-largest smartwatch brand globally. 
We were also pleased with the performance of the fragrance collection in this quarter, especially the positive response to our new Wonderlust fragrance, which led to strong results particularly during the holiday period. The fragrance category continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for the company. 
In conclusion, we believe the Michael Kors brand remains strong, but it is clear that we must enact changes to reverse the negative comparable sales trends that we are experiencing in our stores. We are focused on 5 specific initiatives to improve comparable sales performance in North America and Europe. 
First, Michael and our design teams have introduced new design elements in accessories to provide a more elevated and layered assortment. These unique and innovative techniques, including artisanal craftsmanship, iconic hardware details and intricate mixed-media leathers, that will enhance our glamorous handbag offerings in the $498 to $398 category. Additionally, we have 5 iconic groups consisting of Hamilton, Selma, Savannah, Cynthia and Mercer handbags that will be shipped this quarter and are strategically priced at $298 for medium sizes and $258 to $228 on certain smaller sizes. 
Second, we will be expanding the presence of our new Jet Set signature accessories in our stores, which will include multiple layers for the fall season. Initial results of our new Jet Set signature deliveries for the spring season have been very strong. This is an iconic element for our brand, and we will capitalize on the current fashion trend for signature accessories. 
Third, we are increasing the penetration of footwear in our largest volume doors. As one of the leading fashion footwear companies globally, we intend to capitalize on this strength and increase the presence of this category in key stores. 
Fourth, we are focusing on our fast-growing dress category as an iconic cornerstone of our womenâ€™s ready to wear. This will be highlighted by our new online dress shop that is scheduled to launch this fall. This category will represent approximately 50% of our ready-to-wear assortments in our stores. 
Fifth, we will significantly increase our digital marketing spend to fuel our fast-growing e-commerce business globally. We continue to see strong revenue growth from our initiatives in this channel as consumers shift their shopping behavior. 
With these 5 initiatives, we expect to drive increased store and site visits as well as increased average unit retails and deepen our engagement with consumers in our retail channel to improve comparable sales in North America and Europe. In addition to these initiatives, we remain confident that we have a significant incremental revenue opportunity as we build Asia into a $1 billion business. We also feel strongly that we're on the right track to developing a significant men's business, which could ultimately be $1 billion in revenue. In summary, our increased emphasis on the retail segment, in addition to the expansion of our Asia and men's business, will help us rebalance our revenues and position us for growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to review our financials."

For the third quarter, total revenue was $1.35 billion compared to $1.40 billion in the prior year quarter. In the retail segment, net sales increased 9.2%, driven primarily by the addition of 193 net new stores since the third quarter",1635,"Thank you, John. For the third quarter, total revenue was $1.35 billion compared to $1.40 billion in the prior year quarter. 
In the retail segment, net sales increased 9.2%, driven primarily by the addition of 193 net new stores since the third quarter of last year, including 143 stores associated with the recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea. 
Comparable sales decreased 6.9%, reflecting a mid-single-digit decrease in North America and a mid-teens decline in Europe, partially offset by a mid-single-digit increase in Asia. E-commerce comparable sales contributed approximately 340 basis points to our performance in the quarter. 
As John mentioned, North America remained under pressure from declining store traffic and the aggressive promotional environment, which was partially offset by increased conversion rates and strong performance of our digital flagships. The comparable sales decline in Europe was driven by reduced store traffic and lower average unit retails as a result of shift in product mix, with a portion of the decline attributable to the launch of our European digital flagships. The North American digital flagships achieved double-digit comparable sales increases in the quarter. While European digital flagships are not yet included in the comparable sales base, had they been included, the European comp would have been down in the mid-single digits on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant-currency basis. 
In the Wholesale segment, net sales declined 17.8% due to lower sales in the women's accessories and apparel businesses. The Wholesale business in the Americas region declined in the mid-teens as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we ship into that channel. European net sales decreased in the low teens while, on Asia, the decrease in net sales largely reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korea businesses to the retail segment during the quarter. 
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 22.9%. This was primarily due to the continued softness of the fashion watch and jewelry categories as well as lower revenues from the geographic licensing arrangement in Asia due to the recent acquisitions of our licensee operations. 
Gross margin expanded 10 basis points to 59.6% due to a favorable channel mix shift towards the retail segment as well as an increase in the wholesale gross margin. Gross margin increased 210 basis points in the Wholesale segment primarily due to lower allowances and favorable change in the geographic mix. Gross margin declined 270 basis points in the retail segment, which was attributable to an increase in promotional activities as compared to last year. 
Total operating expense grew 9.7% and increased 410 basis points to 34.3% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China and South Korea, including the higher depreciation expense and amortization of the reacquired rights of the intangible asset recognized in connection with the recently acquired businesses as well as investments in new stores, e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities, new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements. 
Income from operations was $341.9 million or 25.3% of total revenue as compared to 29.3% of total revenue in the same period last year. Retail operating margin was 21.3% compared to 27.8% in the prior year period. 270 basis points of this decrease was due to the gross margin reduction that I described earlier; 180 basis points was the result of China and South Korea acquisitions, including the amortization of reacquired rights; and 190 basis points was related to the continued investments in building our digital flagship platforms, retail store-related costs and deleverage, in large part related to a mix shift between e-commerce and in-store sales. We expect operating margin for the retail segment to continue to be negatively impacted by the inclusion of the newly acquired international businesses and a mix shift of sales to our e-commerce channel, both of which currently carry a lower operating margin. 
Wholesale operating margin was 29.6% compared to 27.9% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of the 210 basis point increase in our wholesale gross margin, partially offset by a 40 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue. 
Licensing operating margin was 54.7% compared to 64.8% in the prior year period. This was primarily due to increased costs associated with advertising as well as increased depreciation expense. 
Income taxes were $70.4 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 20.6% as compared to 28.0% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of certain global financing activities. 
Net income was $271.3 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $1.64. This compares to net income of $294.6 million or $1.59 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $521.6 million in operating cash flow, ending the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $368.8 million. Inventory was relatively flat compared to the prior year as we continued to carefully manage these levels. 
We ended the quarter with $147.8 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. At the end of the third quarter, the amount available for future borrowings was approximately $852.7 million. In January 2017, the company repaid all of the borrowings outstanding under the 2015 credit facility. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares totaling $100 million under our share repurchase program and have another $250 million of availability remaining in our most recent $1 billion authorization. This most recent share repurchase further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and our confidence in our long-term growth potential. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $39.1 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. 
Looking forward, we expect continued headwinds from challenging retail trends in North America and Europe as well as our decision to further tighten inventory control and reduce promotional activity. As a result, we have moderated our outlook and now expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be approximately 14 -- excuse me, $4.48 billion and comparable sales to decrease in the high single-digit range. We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 59.3%, below our initial expectation as our lower European sales outlook will result in a less favorable benefit from geographic mix than we initially anticipated. We expect operating expenses as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 39.7%. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 19.9%, excluding the $11.3 million in onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.13 on a GAAP basis including the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs, and be between $4.15 and $4.19 excluding the onetime cost. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 169.0 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect continued -- we expect total revenue to be between $1.035 billion and $1.055 billion and a low-teens decrease in comparable sales. As compared to our prior fourth quarter expectations, we now anticipate retail net sales to be approximately $54 million lower as we have prudently adjusted our outlook to reflect continued slower sales as well as revised foreign exchange expectations, somewhat offset by our strong e-commerce results. We reduced our Wholesale segment expectation by approximately $11 million, reflecting a larger-than-anticipated impact from the new promotional policy and weak trends in Europe. 
Gross margin is now expected to increase to approximately 58.4%, driven by a favorable geographic and channel mix shift. 
We plan to continue to invest in our digital flagships, international expansion and global infrastructure. This would result in an operating expense as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 44.4%, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 14.0%, a decrease of approximately 400 basis points from our prior expectations, with approximately 150 basis points as a result of lower gross margin and 250 basis points as a result of deleverage as we reduce our retail and Wholesale sales. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.72. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 22% and 164.0 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
For fiscal 2017, capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $200 million and will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omni-channel capabilities; global retail expansion, including approximately 8 net new stores in the Americas, 25 in Europe and 28 in Asia, 96 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information system and corporate facilities. 
In conclusion, while the current environment is challenging, we continue to focus on our operating priorities in order to drive sales and earnings growth. Looking forward to fiscal 2018, we anticipate modest top line growth, driven by higher retail net sales, as we continue to deliver an innovative luxury product offering, enhance our e-commerce capabilities, further expand our business in Asia and grow the men's segment. 
We anticipate the declines in the Wholesale business will moderate as we anniversary the reductions in inventory and reduce promotional activity. And we expect licensing revenue to be relatively flat as declines in the fashion watch category subside and the smartwatch sales continue to grow. Taking all this into account and the strategic investments that we are making in the company, we expect operating margin in the high teens and modest earnings per share growth. Consistent with our prior practice, we will provide you with additional detailed guidance when we announce our fourth quarter results in late May. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

In North America, as we have previously said and indicated, our revenue base will decline throughout the entire period of next fiscal year, and that's as we reset with our",475,"Okay. Thank you, Omar. I would answer it differently for North America and Europe. In North America, as we have previously said and indicated, our revenue base will decline throughout the entire period of next fiscal year, and that's as we reset with our department store partners, based upon our new promotional policy, which, as we said in the prepared remarks, starts actually around February 1. So that's in place now, and many of our partners are reducing their inventory with us and we're reducing it with them as they have operated with a much more aggressive promotional posture. And as we said, again, our objective is to reduce promotion, increase average AUR and position the brand in a more elevated place with our consumer. This is a very aggressive approach. We don't believe any of our competitors are taking this level of stance as it relates to walking away from the promotional activity. We will have 4 periods that we do authorize a Michael Kors event during the year. And so we think it's going to take the entire fiscal year to work our way through that. And as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we kind of see that leveling off in our fiscal '19. That being said, inside -- the category of men's as a wholesale component inside the United States will grow and should grow rather quickly, and we're very pleased with what we've seen so far, in particular, on the wholesale side with that business both in ready to wear and in leather. Europe is a separate conversation. Again, many of the department stores are experiencing similar things that you're seeing here in North America. There's been a slowdown in traffic in many of the cities, and we've gone through the reasons of that, whether it was Brexit or whether it was terrorist activities, which have stopped certain people internationally on a tourism basis. And also, locally, there are many places where people are, quite frankly, fearful of going into shopping malls because of incidents. So we anticipate that to continue -- that level of disruption to continue through, again, the balance of this fiscal year. And in addition to that, we're very concerned about upcoming elections and what that might do in certain of the marketplaces, and we highlighted, in particular, Germany and France, where we have very sizable businesses. So again, we do not see that kind of resetting until, I would say, fiscal '19 for us. And that's why we're really looking at the company in total, Omar, to kind of rebalance our business. We're going to be much more retail focused, led by our digital flagships than our retail stores, and also, that will be really driven even more heavily by our opportunities that are inside of Asia. So thank you very much for that question."

Secondly, we've said that we will look at potential acquisitions. We are actively looking at a number of different things.

I would answer the first question regarding AUR, again, in 2 ways. First, what we did, and we announced it, I think, on the last call, we're really looking at what the average product that's going out the door to the customer at,",739,"Sure. Thank you, Oliver. I would answer the first question regarding AUR, again, in 2 ways. First, what we did, and we announced it, I think, on the last call, we're really looking at what the average product that's going out the door to the customer at, and we believe that the $300 handbag category is a very big opportunity. And so what we want to do is create value, when she walks in the door and she sees an amazing design, she doesn't have to wait for a coupon or a sale or anything else. She's stimulated by what she's seen. And we clearly saw that with our Mercer handbag collection, which was non-promotional the entire fall season and was basically our #1 selling collection. So she responded to the design, she responded to the fact that it was full price, but she also responded to the fact there was great value there in that collection. So what we're doing is we've kind of learned from that, and we've said, ""Okay. Why don't we expand that thought process?"" And one of the great exciting collections that we're actually reintroducing in new shapes is Hamilton, which has been one of our best-selling groups for many, many years. We had decided to remove that from our retail channel, and we're reintroducing that. And again, they were just literally unpacking the boxes on that in some stores recently, and we've had excellent initial sales results. So we think that's the right thing to do to create value at the right price so that when she walks in the door, she doesn't have to think about whether something is on sale or not, and we believe that's going to have a fairly significant impact on our AUR. And then, secondly, we are -- as I said in my prepared remarks, now that we kind of believe we've reset this $295 and $259 and -- I'm sorry, $298 and $258 and $228 basis, we're now going to look at our $498 and $398 category and really try and build up that area of opportunity where we believe, in particular, in our own stores, we're capable of being able to sell that at a full price. I also want to point out that the second bestselling product for us that we actually ran out of during the holiday season was our ACCESS watches, again, totally full price, no sale on that product. And again -- so when it's the right fashion, the right price for the consumer, we think we're doing quite well with them on that. So that's the strategy on AUR, and we will be a lot less promotional by a significant amount of days. So we're looking to raise that ultimately by approximately 10%. That's our goal to get to, and we think we can do that throughout the year. It's not going to happen all on day 1, but it will happen throughout the year. Secondly, on the store traffic side, the -- we view our stores in 2 ways. First off, the majority of our fleet globally is very profitable. There are definitely some unprofitable stores that we will analyze over the next 6 months and make some decisions on, but the majority of the fleet is very nicely profitable. That being said, we also view our store footprints as an opportunity for us to act as a distribution center, in a sense. And we talked about click and collect and our omni capabilities. We're learning a lot more about that as we go forward. We also have tests that are upcoming in the spring season on same-day delivery out of a number of locations. And so we want to make the determination of what does a footprint allow you to do in terms of service, and we think service is going to be a critical component of our long-term success as a brand and also as an omni-channel retailer. So how do we service her? Where do we service -- where do we provide her that service and at which speed? And we all know the people who are setting the standard in that. So we take it very seriously, and we think that the store footprints will allow us the capabilities of doing that as long as they remain profitable. Obviously, if they don't remain profitable, then we will look to reduce that footprint. Thank you, Oliver."

Next year, we expect the following things to happen. Actually, our operating margins in retail will expand for 2 reasons: number one, for geographic mix and, in particular, Asia. Asia is getting more profitable for us each quarter as we're gaining velocity and we're gaining scale, which is creating leverage. And as you know from many of the other global luxury players, Asia sometimes can be the most profitable part of their business. So we believe that's going to have a very significant impact on our operating margin performance going forward in retail. We are also getting more profitable in our e-commerce business. It's still not where we want it to be in terms of against where we are in our retail stores, but it is getting more profitable. So we believe that, that will have a positive impact on us next year in terms of operating margins. We will see operating margins decline slightly in our Wholesale business as we do have some deleverage in terms of the size, volume coming down. And then also, there have been some significant initiatives that have gone on inside of our organization, obviously, to reduce costs given our new revenue outlook. So while we are disappointed that we are no longer able to, for the moment, say that we can carry a 2 handle, we do think that we will still be one of the most significantly profitable global luxury brands in the world and generating significant free cash flow, which will continue to give us the ability to execute on both share repurchase and then acquisition potential. And as we've said, even in the future, we might consider dividend, although that's not on the immediate horizon. So I think we are comfortable that we do not need to think about a further, a significant deceleration in the EBIT margins. Joe?"

Why even do one or contemplate one? And then, secondly, just back on the operating margins. So do we think that we're towards the end of the SG&A dollar investment cycle? And then also, CapEx, I think you said $200 million. Can we get further lower from there? Because the free cash flow of the company continues to pile up, and the market multiple on those cash flows keeps going down. So I'm just trying to get a sense of -- the market wants to know where these cash flows bottom, where these expenses bottom, et cetera.

The CapEx is going to be around the -- continue to be around the level that we're at this year. They may go down a little bit but not much. We have some additional IT initiatives that are going to go on inside the company, but the significant -- whether it was our corporate headquarters in New York, whether it was our Venlo operations that we built in -- for distribution in Europe, most of that is all -- will be finished. And then the predominant amount of store openings will be focused in Asia. We're pretty much done with the footprint in North America. We're pretty much done with the footprint in Europe. There'll be some capital around the men's expansion. So we feel very comfortable kind of in that range of where we are today or lower. Slightly lower will be where we will be on a go-forward basis. In terms of acquisitions, look, I said it to you earlier. Our #1 capital allocation priority is to repurchase shares, again. With our multiple being consistently below where our peer group is and us still being much more profitable than many of them, we think there's a dislocation, and the board and the senior management of the team of the company feel that's really the best investment for us to make. And so I think that will be number one. And number two, again, if we can utilize the company -- the management team's expertise and certain other of our capabilities internally to create value for our shareholders, we will look at that. But we're not going to do that at the expense of our own corporate initiatives. And again, we believe there is still very significant volume, revenue opportunity for the company over the next few years. We are being impacted by a decision that we've made to kind of get out of the fray of this every-kind-of-few-weeks promotional activity. And I think that's the right decision for us. But that's going to take a significant amount of revenues away from the company, but, I think, create much better value for us long term as a brand with the end consumer, and that's the right thing for us to do. So we'll stay focused on that as our priority and then look at our share repurchase program. And if the right acquisition comes up, we will consider it. And if we don't, then we'll pass and stay focused on what we're doing. Thank you, Randy."

Dana, we're very excited about what happened with ACCESS watches. And I will tell you that from the minute the watches hit the store, we had something happen that we haven't seen in a long time as it relates to the watch category. We have people kind of lining up for the watches. You may have seen it in some of our stores. And we're still having trouble catching up with the demand that we have, both in on our own stores and then at many of our retail partners. So clearly, this is a category that is here, and it's a category that will grow. So we're excited about that. And both Fossil and ourselves feel that we're at the very beginning of something that could become sizable. I can't tell you whether it's going to ultimately outpace where we were with the total fashion watch business. The category of fashion watches in total continues to decline. Not just us, many competitors as well are seeing the same thing. Again, both Fossil and, in particular, Kosta and I believe that the fashion watch business will be completely reshaped as we know it today and that most watches over the next 3 to 5 years will come with some level of technology.  We'll be making some exciting announcements in Fossil in a few weeks about some additional things that we're doing in the wearable technology space that we think will further enhance our positioning. So just know that, again, Fossil and, in particular, Kosta and myself are very, very committed to maintaining our leadership position in the fashion watch business. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we think we will ultimately become the second-largest wearable watch business in the world. And clearly, the numbers are pointing towards that. So if this category grows, this can be important for us. As I said, again, in the prepared remarks, it did not offset the decline in the total fashion watch business, but we were significantly encouraged by the beginning of a trend change that we saw and look forward to that continuing on. The handbag category, Dana, our kind of intel, we believe the category was about flat in Q -- calendar Q4/our Q3, and I would say that was both in North America and Europe. We believe the category actually grew in Asia. And we are going to have reduced market share. That is absolutely something that we actually want. And by us reducing our wholesale shipments and, to some degree, pulling back on the promotional activity in our own stores, we'll reduce our velocity in our own stores, we will have less market share, and we actually think that's a healthy thing for us on a go-forward basis. And our outlook is that the handbag marketplace globally will remain approximately flat, maybe up 1 point or 2. Again, that's in dollars. And in units, we actually think that the market was up significantly. So I'll just give you one number. In North America, in handbags, where we had a single-digit decline in our own stores, we were up 11% in units. That's actually sold units to the customer. So once again, that gives us great comfort that the consumer is absolutely engaging with the Michael Kors brand, and again, all of our consumer research says that. She's just finding it at a much more attractively -- much more attractive price than she's previously even finding that. And we're going to show her value in a different way going forward that we think will keep her engaged. And our objective is to sell significantly less units next fiscal year than we sold in this fiscal year."

The second question, we're not going to have time to do, so I'm only going to answer the first question for you. The European trends, again, I think there was an interesting note that you heard in my prepared remarks and you heard in Joe's prepared remarks, which were that if you added back in our e-commerce business, on a constant-currency basis, actually our business in Europe was flat. So we far exceeded our expectations when we turned on our e-commerce sites or what we refer to as our digital flagships, which we believe had a significant impact on our business in the marketplace. While traffic was down in Europe, it was down in kind of the mid-single digits, which was lower than what we had anticipated, but again, it was -- we believe, a lot of that volume went directly to our own website during the period. So we're going to continue to watch that. We saw the exact same thing happen in North America. The minute we turned on our e-commerce, our comp store sales were impacted pretty dramatically quickly. And again, that's just consumers changing their shopping behavior. And as we've seen in many countries, they want to go to the official website. We certainly have had other partners having e-commerce in the territories. But now there is the Michael Kors website, which you are able to see the full range of our products, you're able to engage with many of our social activities and styling tips. And as we said, in North America, we're launching specialized product offerings under Kors Custom (sic) [ Custom Kors]. We're going to roll that out in Europe as well. So there's a lot that's going on, on our websites. We also talked about the fact that our dress shop will launch in the early part of fall, maybe in the early -- as late as spring. So we think that this is only going to get bigger. And again, that's why, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're spending more money to help fuel that. And we think Europe, in particular, we'll see that trend continue. So that's a long-winded way of me saying that we think actual store comps will be -- will remain down kind of in the same trend, maybe even a little worse than they've been, and we'll look at what that total mix is wrapped up with our e-commerce business to see how that's impacting our trends."

But what I can say to you is the following, is that many of our department store partners have been offering promotions. It's -- if it's not every 2 weeks, it's every third week, so there's something going on all the time. And as I said to you, we're going to have -- we're going to really consolidate that down to 4 times a year. So we believe that's going to significantly reduce the amount of off-price business that we're doing, hence the reason for the significant reduction in the inventory going into the channel. And so I think that, that's something we're going to just to have to see how it plays out over time. But we are focused on making sure that, along with that, we provide great value. And that value doesn't only mean $295 or -- I'm sorry, $298 or $228. That value could also be in one of our very successful -- our Mercer bag, which is the grab bag with the grommets. And the consumer saw that at $498 and said  ""Wow, this is amazing design and tremendous amount of workmanship and detail and design that went into that"" at what we thought was a very, very exciting and compelling value for the consumer. So we look at those things and really balance them. And again, we're trying to make sure that she sees Michael Kors as an elevated brand and not something that's on promotion on a regular basis. And in the outlet channel, I would say AUR did decline during the quarter and has declined over the last few quarters as the channel has become also extremely promotional. Our competitors are, in many cases, much deeper at discount than we are, and so that's becoming something that we've had to really compete with. The good news in that channel is there is less of a traffic issue. And so that kind of has helped us balance off the AUR piece, and our conversions are up in that channel as well.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, total revenue was $1.4 billion and earnings per share were in line with our expectations at $1.64. We saw solid results in several areas of our business during the quarter. The new fall and holiday handbag introductions performed well, led by the Mercer, Brooklyn and Sloan Editor collections. All of these new fashion luxury handbag groups were supported by enhanced marketing in both traditional and social media channels, which helped create strong sell-throughs across these launches. We also continued to see strong response to our new MICHAEL KORS ACCESS line of wearable technology with sales exceeding our expectations for the season. 
In addition, momentum in our athletic footwear business remains strong, and our holiday womenâ€™s ready-to-wear collection received favorable response. Our digital flagship in North America continued to deliver double-digit comparable sales growth while sales in our new digital flagship in Europe exceeded expectations. We also rolled out Custom Kors on our digital flagship in North America, which featured free monogramming services as well as options to curate your own personally styled Sloan Select handbag. All of these initiatives, which were led by Michael and our design team, demonstrate our continued commitment to delivering exciting, new luxury fashion products to consumers globally. 
While we were pleased to see the strong performance in multiple areas of our business, we were disappointed in our North American and European comparable sales, which continued to be impacted by negative traffic trends and currency fluctuations. We also saw average unit retails negatively impacted by the highly promotional environment as well as the continued fashion trends towards crossbody and small leather goods. Additionally, the fashion watch category remained challenged, which continued to negatively impact our comparable sales. 
In the retail segment, global net sales grew 9% during the quarter and comparable sales decreased 6.9%. In the Americas, retail net sales decreased 1% and comparable sales decreased in the mid-single digits, which was in line with our expectations despite the very difficult retail environment. 
The e-commerce business outperformed expectations with double-digit comparable sales increases. In stores, traffic declined in the high single digits, which was partially offset by an increase in conversion rates. We also saw solid results from the launch of our click-and-collect offering in 10 stores in North America during the quarter enabling customers to make their purchases online and pick up the merchandise in one of our retail locations on the same day. Based on the strong response to click and collect thus far, we plan to roll out this feature across all U.S. locations in this quarter. We believe that further enhancing our omni-channel presence will help us to drive improved comparable sales results in the future. 
Turning to the international business. In Europe, overall retail net sales were essentially flat during the quarter. In our newly launched digital flagships, sales significantly exceeded expectations. In stores, comparable sales decreased in the mid-teens range as we saw steeper-than-expected declines in store traffic, which we believe was due to the continuation of weak tourism trends as well as reduced consumer confidence related to Brexit and terrorist attacks in certain markets. 
In addition, a portion of this decline was attributable to a shift in customer traffic from retail locations to the newly launched digital flagships. If we were to include e-commerce sales, our European comparable sales results would have been down in the mid-single digits on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant-currency basis. This is similar to the trend we saw in North America when we launched our e-commerce platform. 
In Asia, total retail net sales increased almost 300%, largely as a result of revenue from the acquisition of the Greater China and Korea operations. In Japan, retail net sales grew more than 25% with comparable sales increasing in the mid-single digits. The Greater China business, while not included in the comparable sales base, increased double digits on a constant-currency basis. 
We were also excited to launch our first digital flagship in China in October with, initial performance exceeding expectations. While the digital landscape remains small for luxury brands into this region, we feel that offering a full view of the Michael Kors brand online enhances our customer engagement and acquisition. Importantly, these results indicate that the Michael Kors brand is strong and growing in Asia. 
We opened 29 net new stores globally throughout the quarter, including 14 new and expanded men's stores, bringing our total to 35 men's locations, as well as 2 new flagships in Asia. Michael was on hand for the opening festivities of our flagship store in Seoul, Korea and helped celebrate Harper's Bazaar Young Korea feature, which showcased looks from our resort 2017 collection. In Singapore, Michael was joined by Kate Hudson to help celebrate the opening of our Mandarin Galleria (sic) [ Mandarin Gallery ] store, which at 6,000 square feet is the largest Michael Kors flagship store in Southeast Asia. 
Turning to the Wholesale business. Net sales declined 18% during the quarter. In the Americas, sales decreased 15% as we continue to strategically reduce sell-in into the department store channel. In addition, beginning this month, we are reducing promotional activity across the retail and wholesale channels, which is expected to result in average unit retails -- higher average unit retails as the product positioning will be elevated. While we believe this is the right thing to do for our brand long term, this decision is expected to negatively impact our net sales throughout fiscal 2018, albeit to a smaller degree, and the declines are expected to further moderate in fiscal 2019 as we anniversary the reductions in inventory and reduced promotional activity. As we continue to reduce our inventory position in the wholesale channel, we anticipate this segment will be a smaller portion of our net sales going forward. 
In Europe, net sales in the Wholesale segment decreased 12% as the headwinds that impacted our retail stores also had a negative effect on sales in the wholesale channel. We also continued to see a shift in sales trends towards products with lower average unit retails, such as crossbodies and small leather goods, and anticipate this trend will continue throughout fiscal 2018. In addition, we anticipate market volatility in this region throughout the calendar year. In the U.K., we saw -- we continue to experience a decrease in traffic despite the weaker pound sterling. In France and Germany, we are concerned about the upcoming elections, which we believe may impact consumer buying habits. 
In Asia, Wholesale net sales decreased 68%, primarily attributable to the shift of China and South Korean sales to our company-owned retail segment. This decrease will continue until we anniversary the acquisition of our Greater China license. 
Turning to our men's segment. We are pleased with the performance of this developing business. We now have more than 250 men's shop-in-shops, and our men's sportswear offerings is resonating with the customer globally. Additionally, we have further expanded our leather goods offering, which drove accelerated growth in this category during the quarter. We remain committed to developing this segment of the men's business. 
In the licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter as a result of continued softness in the fashion watch and jewelry categories and lower revenues in Asia as a result of the recent acquisition of our licensed operations. This was partially offset by the strong performance of the ACCESS line of wearable technology globally, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Given the current size of the ACCESS business, the new collection only partially offset the decline in fashion watches. Based on this success, we will continue to invest in and expand the wearable technology category with the goal of ultimately becoming the second-largest smartwatch brand globally. 
We were also pleased with the performance of the fragrance collection in this quarter, especially the positive response to our new Wonderlust fragrance, which led to strong results particularly during the holiday period. The fragrance category continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for the company. 
In conclusion, we believe the Michael Kors brand remains strong, but it is clear that we must enact changes to reverse the negative comparable sales trends that we are experiencing in our stores. We are focused on 5 specific initiatives to improve comparable sales performance in North America and Europe. 
First, Michael and our design teams have introduced new design elements in accessories to provide a more elevated and layered assortment. These unique and innovative techniques, including artisanal craftsmanship, iconic hardware details and intricate mixed-media leathers, that will enhance our glamorous handbag offerings in the $498 to $398 category. Additionally, we have 5 iconic groups consisting of Hamilton, Selma, Savannah, Cynthia and Mercer handbags that will be shipped this quarter and are strategically priced at $298 for medium sizes and $258 to $228 on certain smaller sizes. 
Second, we will be expanding the presence of our new Jet Set signature accessories in our stores, which will include multiple layers for the fall season. Initial results of our new Jet Set signature deliveries for the spring season have been very strong. This is an iconic element for our brand, and we will capitalize on the current fashion trend for signature accessories. 
Third, we are increasing the penetration of footwear in our largest volume doors. As one of the leading fashion footwear companies globally, we intend to capitalize on this strength and increase the presence of this category in key stores. 
Fourth, we are focusing on our fast-growing dress category as an iconic cornerstone of our womenâ€™s ready to wear. This will be highlighted by our new online dress shop that is scheduled to launch this fall. This category will represent approximately 50% of our ready-to-wear assortments in our stores. 
Fifth, we will significantly increase our digital marketing spend to fuel our fast-growing e-commerce business globally. We continue to see strong revenue growth from our initiatives in this channel as consumers shift their shopping behavior. 
With these 5 initiatives, we expect to drive increased store and site visits as well as increased average unit retails and deepen our engagement with consumers in our retail channel to improve comparable sales in North America and Europe. In addition to these initiatives, we remain confident that we have a significant incremental revenue opportunity as we build Asia into a $1 billion business. We also feel strongly that we're on the right track to developing a significant men's business, which could ultimately be $1 billion in revenue. In summary, our increased emphasis on the retail segment, in addition to the expansion of our Asia and men's business, will help us rebalance our revenues and position us for growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to review our financials."

For the third quarter, total revenue was $1.35 billion compared to $1.40 billion in the prior year quarter. In the retail segment, net sales increased 9.2%, driven primarily by the addition of 193 net new stores since the third quarter",1637,"Thank you, John. For the third quarter, total revenue was $1.35 billion compared to $1.40 billion in the prior year quarter. 
In the retail segment, net sales increased 9.2%, driven primarily by the addition of 193 net new stores since the third quarter of last year, including 143 stores associated with the recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea. 
Comparable sales decreased 6.9%, reflecting a mid-single-digit decrease in North America and a mid-teens decline in Europe, partially offset by a mid-single-digit increase in Asia. E-commerce comparable sales contributed approximately 340 basis points to our performance in the quarter. 
As John mentioned, North America remained under pressure from declining store traffic and the aggressive promotional environment, which was partially offset by increased conversion rates and strong performance of our digital flagships. The comparable sales decline in Europe was driven by reduced store traffic and lower average unit retails as a result of shift in product mix, with a portion of the decline attributable to the launch of our European digital flagships. The North American digital flagships achieved double-digit comparable sales increases in the quarter. While European digital flagships are not yet included in the comparable sales base, had they been included, the European comp would have been down in the mid-single digits on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant-currency basis. 
In the Wholesale segment, net sales declined 17.8% due to lower sales in the women's accessories and apparel businesses. The Wholesale business in the Americas region declined in the mid-teens as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we ship into that channel. European net sales decreased in the low teens while, on Asia, the decrease in net sales largely reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korea businesses to the retail segment during the quarter. 
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 22.9%. This was primarily due to the continued softness of the fashion watch and jewelry categories as well as lower revenues from the geographic licensing arrangement in Asia due to the recent acquisitions of our licensee operations. 
Gross margin expanded 10 basis points to 59.6% due to a favorable channel mix shift towards the retail segment as well as an increase in the wholesale gross margin. Gross margin increased 210 basis points in the Wholesale segment primarily due to lower allowances and favorable change in the geographic mix. Gross margin declined 270 basis points in the retail segment, which was attributable to an increase in promotional activities as compared to last year. 
Total operating expense grew 9.7% and increased 410 basis points to 34.3% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China and South Korea, including the higher depreciation expense and amortization of the reacquired rights of the intangible asset recognized in connection with the recently acquired businesses as well as investments in new stores, e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities, new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements. 
Income from operations was $341.9 million or 25.3% of total revenue as compared to 29.3% of total revenue in the same period last year. Retail operating margin was 21.3% compared to 27.8% in the prior year period. 270 basis points of this decrease was due to the gross margin reduction that I described earlier; 180 basis points was the result of China and South Korea acquisitions, including the amortization of reacquired rights; and 190 basis points was related to the continued investments in building our digital flagship platforms, retail store-related costs and deleverage, in large part related to a mix shift between e-commerce and in-store sales. We expect operating margin for the retail segment to continue to be negatively impacted by the inclusion of the newly acquired international businesses and a mix shift of sales to our e-commerce channels, both of which currently carry a lower operating margin. 
Wholesale operating margin was 29.6% compared to 27.9% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of the 210 basis point increase in our wholesale gross margin, partially offset by a 40 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue. 
Licensing operating margin was 54.7% compared to 64.8% in the prior year period. This was primarily due to increased costs associated with advertising as well as increased depreciation expense. 
Income taxes were $70.4 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 20.6% as compared to 28.0% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of certain global financing activities. 
Net income was $271.3 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $1.64. This compares to net income of $294.6 million or $1.59 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $521.6 million in operating cash flow, ending the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $368.8 million. Inventory was relatively flat compared to the prior year as we continued to carefully manage these levels. 
We ended the quarter with $147.8 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. At the end of the third quarter, the amount available for future borrowings was approximately $852.7 million. In January 2017, the company repaid all of the borrowings outstanding under the 2015 credit facility. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares totaling $100 million under our share repurchase program and have another $250 million of availability remaining in our most recent $1 billion authorization. This most recent share repurchase further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and our confidence in our long-term growth potential. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $39.1 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. 
Looking forward, we expect continued headwinds from challenging retail trends in North America and Europe as well as our decision to further tighten inventory control and reduce promotional activity. As a result, we have moderated our outlook and now expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be approximately 14 -- excuse me, $4.48 billion and comparable sales to decrease in the high single-digit range. We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 59.3%, below our initial expectation as our lower European sales outlook will result in a less favorable benefit from geographic mix than we initially anticipated. We expect operating expenses as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 39.7%. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 19.9%, excluding the $11.3 million in onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.13 on a GAAP basis including the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs, and be between $4.15 and $4.19 excluding the onetime cost. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 169.0 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect continued -- we expect total revenue to be between $1.035 billion and $1.055 billion and a low-teens decrease in comparable sales. As compared to our prior fourth quarter expectations, we now anticipate retail net sales to be approximately $54 million lower as we have prudently adjusted our outlook to reflect continued slower sales as well as revised foreign exchange expectations, somewhat offset by our strong e-commerce results. We reduced our Wholesale segment expectation by approximately $11 million, reflecting a larger than anticipated impact from the new promotional policy and weak trends in Europe. 
Gross margin is now expected to increase to approximately 58.4%, driven by a favorable geographic and channel mix shift. 
We plan to continue to invest in our digital flagships, international expansion and global infrastructure. This would result in an operating expense as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 44.4%, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 14.0%, a decrease of approximately 400 basis points from our prior expectations, with approximately 150 basis points as a result of lower gross margin and 250 basis points as a result of deleverage as we reduce our retail and Wholesale sales. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.72. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 22% and 164.0 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
For fiscal 2017, capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $200 million and will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omni-channel capabilities; global retail expansion, including approximately 8 net new stores in the Americas, 25 in Europe and 28 in Asia, 96 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities. 
In conclusion, while the current environment is challenging, we continue to focus on our operating priorities in order to drive sales and earnings growth. Looking forward to fiscal 2018, we anticipate modest top line growth, driven by higher retail net sales, as we continue to deliver an innovative luxury product offering, enhance our e-commerce capabilities, further expand our business in Asia and grow the men's segment. 
We anticipate the declines in the Wholesale business will moderate as we anniversary the reductions in inventory and reduce promotional activity. And we expect licensing revenue to be relatively flat as declines in the fashion watch category subside and the smartwatch sales continue to grow. Taking all this into account and the strategic investments that we are making in the company, we expect operating margin in the high teens and modest earnings per share growth. Consistent with our prior practice, we will provide you with additional detailed guidance when we announce our fourth quarter results in late May. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

Thank you, Omar. I would answer it differently for North America and Europe. In North America, as we have previously said and indicated, our revenue base will decline throughout the entire period of next fiscal year, and that's as we reset with our department store partners, based upon our new promotional policy, which, as we said in the prepared remarks, starts actually around February 1. So that's in place now, and many of our partners are reducing their inventory with us and we're reducing it with them as they have operated with a much more aggressive promotional posture. And as we said, again, our objective is to reduce promotion, increase average AUR and position the brand in a more elevated place with our consumer. This is a very aggressive approach. We don't believe any of our competitors are taking this level of stance as it relates to walking away from the promotional activity. We will have 4 periods that we do authorize a Michael Kors event during the year. And so we think it's going to take the entire fiscal year to work our way through that. And as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we kind of see that leveling off in our fiscal '19. That being said, inside -- the category of men's as a wholesale component inside the United States will grow and should grow rather quickly, and we're very pleased with what we've seen so far, in particular, on the wholesale side with that business both in ready to wear and in leather. Europe is a separate conversation. Again, many of the department stores are experiencing similar things that you're seeing here in North America. There's been a slowdown in traffic in many of the cities, and we've gone through the reasons of that, whether it was Brexit or whether it was terrorist activities, which have stopped certain people internationally on a tourism basis. And also, locally, there are many places where people are, quite frankly, fearful of going into shopping malls because of incidents. So we anticipate that to continue -- that level of disruption to continue through, again, the balance of this fiscal year. And in addition to that, we're very concerned about upcoming elections and what that might do in certain of the marketplaces, and we highlighted, in particular, Germany and France, where we have very sizable businesses. So again, we do not see that kind of resetting until, I would say, fiscal '19 for us. And that's why we're really looking at the company in total, Omar, to kind of rebalance our business. We're going to be much more retail focused, led by our digital flagships than our retail stores, and also, that will be really driven even more heavily by our opportunities that are inside of Asia. So thank you very much for that question."

Secondly, we've said that we will look at potential acquisitions. We are actively looking at a number of different things. And if it's right for our company and our management's ability to execute and create value for our shareholders, then we will take advantage of that. We certainly have the capacity to do sizable transactions or smaller transactions. But what we've said to you in the past is, is that we probably won't do anything small.

I would answer the first question regarding AUR, again, in 2 ways. First, what we did, and we announced this, I think, on the last call, we're really looking at what the average product that's going out the door to the customer at",739,"Sure. Thank you, Oliver. I would answer the first question regarding AUR, again, in 2 ways. First, what we did, and we announced this, I think, on the last call, we're really looking at what the average product that's going out the door to the customer at, and we believe that the $300 handbag category is a very big opportunity. And so what we want to do is create value, when she walks in the door and she sees an amazing design, she doesn't have to wait for a coupon or a sale or anything else. She's stimulated by what she's seen. And we clearly saw that with our Mercer handbag collection, which was non-promotional the entire fall season and was basically our #1 selling collection. So she responded to the design, she responded to the fact that it was full price, but she also responded to the fact there was great value there in that collection. So what we're doing is we've kind of learned from that, and we've said, ""Okay. Why don't we expand that thought process?"" And one of the great exciting collections that we're actually reintroducing in new shapes is Hamilton, which has been one of our best-selling groups for many, many years. We had decided to remove that from our retail channel, and we're reintroducing that. And again, they were just literally unpacking the boxes on that in some stores recently, and we've had excellent initial sales results. So we think that's the right thing to do to create value at the right price so that when she walks in the door, she doesn't have to think about whether something is on sale or not, and we believe that's going to have a fairly significant impact on our AUR. And then, secondly, we are -- as I said in my prepared remarks, now that we kind of believe we've reset this $295 and $259 and -- I'm sorry, $298 and $258 and $228 basis, we're now going to look at our $498 and $398 category and really try and build up that area of opportunity where we believe, in particular, in our own stores, we're capable of being able to sell that at a full price. I also want to point out that the second bestselling product for us that we actually ran out of during the holiday season was our ACCESS watches, again, totally full price, no sale on that product. And again -- so when it's the right fashion, the right price for the consumer, we think we're doing quite well with them on that. So that's the strategy on AUR, and we will be a lot less promotional by a significant amount of days. So we're looking to raise that ultimately by approximately 10%. That's our goal to get to, and we think we can do that throughout the year. It's not going to happen all on day 1, but it will happen throughout the year. Secondly, on the store traffic side, the -- we view our stores in 2 ways. First off, the majority of our fleet globally is very profitable. There are definitely some unprofitable stores that we will analyze over the next 6 months and make some decisions on, but the majority of the fleet is very nicely profitable. That being said, we also view our store footprints as an opportunity for us to act as a distribution center, in a sense. And we talked about click and collect and our omni capabilities. We're learning a lot more about that as we go forward. We also have tests that are upcoming in the spring season on same-day delivery out of a number of locations. And so we want to make the determination of what does a footprint allow you to do in terms of service, and we think service is going to be a critical component of our long-term success as a brand and also as an omni-channel retailer. So how do we service her? Where do we service -- where do we provide her that service and at which speed? And we all know the people who are setting the standards in that. So we take it very seriously, and we think that the store footprints will allow us the capabilities of doing that as long as they remain profitable. Obviously, if they don't remain profitable, then we will look to reduce that footprint. Thank you, Oliver."

Next year, we expect the following things to happen. Actually, our operating margins in retail will expand for 2 reasons: number one, for geographic mix and, in particular, Asia. Asia is getting more profitable for us each quarter as we're gaining velocity and we're gaining scale, which is creating leverage. And as you know from many of the other global luxury players, Asia sometimes can be the most profitable part of their business. So we believe that's going to have a very significant impact on our operating margin performance going forward in retail. We are also getting more profitable in our e-commerce business. It's still not where we want it to be in terms of against where we are in our retail stores, but it is getting more profitable. So we believe that, that will have a positive impact on us next year in terms of operating margins. We will see operating margins decline slightly in our Wholesale business as we do have some deleverage in terms of the size, volume coming down. And then also, there have been some significant initiatives that have gone on inside of our organization, obviously, to reduce costs given our new revenue outlook. So while we are disappointed that we are no longer able to, for the moment, say that we can carry a 2 handle, we do think that we will still be one of the most significantly profitable global luxury brands in the world and generating significant free cash flow, which will continue to give us the ability to execute on both share repurchase and then acquisition potential. And as we've said, even in the future, we might consider dividend, although that's not on the immediate horizon. So I think we are comfortable that we do not need to think about a further, a significant deceleration in the EBIT margins. Joe?"

I guess my question is, why do them when the cap of the company is where it was with the IPO, the stock is significantly cheaper than peers, et cetera? I'm just kind of curious. Why even do one or contemplate one? And then, secondly, just back on the operating margins. So do we think that we're towards the end of the SG&A dollar investment cycle? And then also, CapEx, I think you said $200 million. Can we get further lower from there? Because the free cash flow of the company continues to pile up, and the market multiple on those cash flows keeps going down. So I'm just trying to get a sense of -- the market wants to know where these cash flows bottom, where these expenses bottom, et cetera. So I'm just kind of thinking through those items and would love your response."

The CapEx is going to be around the -- continue to be around the level that we're at this year. They may go down a little bit but not much. We have some additional IT initiatives that are going to go on inside the company, but the significant -- whether it was our corporate headquarters in New York, whether it was our Venlo operations that we built in -- for distribution in Europe, most of that is all -- will be finished. And then the predominant amount of store openings will be focused in Asia. We're pretty much done with the footprint in North America. We're pretty much done with the footprint in Europe. There'll be some capital around the men's expansion. So we feel very comfortable kind of in that range of where we are today or lower. Slightly lower will be where we will be on a go-forward basis. In terms of acquisitions, look, I said it to you earlier. Our #1 capital allocation priority is to repurchase shares, again. With our multiple being consistently below where our peer group is and us still being much more profitable than many of them, we think there's a dislocation, and the board and the senior management of the team of the company feel that's really the best investment for us to make. And so I think that will be number one. And number two, again, if we can utilize the company -- the management team's expertise and certain other of our capabilities internally to create value for our shareholders, we will look at that. But we're not going to do that at the expense of our own corporate initiatives. And again, we believe there is still very significant volume, revenue opportunity for the company over the next few years. We are being impacted by a decision that we've made to kind of get out of the fray of this every-kind-of-few-weeks promotional activity. And I think that's the right decision for us. But that's going to take a significant amount of revenues away from the company, but, I think, create much better value for us long term as a brand with the end consumer, and that's the right thing for us to do. So we'll stay focused on that as our priority and then look at our share repurchase program. And if the right acquisition comes up, we will consider it. And if we don't, then we'll pass and stay focused on what we're doing. Thank you, Randy."

Dana, we're very excited about what happened with ACCESS watches. And I will tell you that from the minute the watches hit the store, we had something happen that we haven't seen in a long time as it relates to the watch category. We have people kind of lining up for the watches. You may have seen it in some of our stores. And we're still having trouble catching up with the demand that we have, both in on our own stores and then at many of our retail partners. So clearly, this is a category that is here, and it's a category that will grow. So we're excited about that. And both Fossil and ourselves feel that we're at the very beginning of something that could become sizable. I can't tell you whether it's going to ultimately outpace where we were with the total fashion watch business. The category of fashion watches in total continues to decline. Not just us, many competitors as well are seeing the same thing. Again, both Fossil and, in particular, Kosta and I believe that the fashion watch business will be completely reshaped as we know it today and that most watches over the next 3 to 5 years will come with some level of technology.  We'll be making some exciting announcements in Fossil in a few weeks about some additional things that we're doing in the wearable technology space that we think will further enhance our positioning. So just know that, again, Fossil and, in particular, Kosta and myself are very, very committed to maintaining our leadership position in the fashion watch business. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we think we will ultimately become the second-largest wearable watch business in the world. And clearly, the numbers are pointing towards that. So if this category grows, this can be important for us. As I said, again, in the prepared remarks, it did not offset the decline in the total fashion watch business, but we were significantly encouraged by the beginning of a trend change that we saw and look forward to that continuing on. The handbag category, Dana, our kind of intel, we believe the category was about flat in Q -- calendar Q4/our Q3, and I would say that was both in North America and Europe. We believe the category actually grew in Asia. And we are going to have reduced market share. That is absolutely something that we actually want. And by us reducing our wholesale shipments and, to some degree, pulling back on the promotional activity in our own stores, we'll reduce our velocity in our own stores, we will have less market share, and we actually think that's a healthy thing for us on a go-forward basis. And our outlook is that the handbag marketplace globally will remain approximately flat, maybe up 1 point or 2. Again, that's in dollars. And in units, we actually think that the market was up significantly. So I'll just give you one number. In North America, in handbags, where we had a single-digit decline in our own stores, we were up 11% in units. That's actually sold units to the customer. So once again, that gives us great comfort that the consumer is absolutely engaging with the Michael Kors brand, and again, all of our consumer research says that. She's just finding it at a much more attractively -- much more attractive price than she's previously been finding it at. And we're going to show her value in a different way going forward that we think will keep her engaged. And our objective is to sell significantly less units next fiscal year than were sold in this fiscal year."

The second question, we're not going to have time to do, so I'm only going to answer the first question for you. The European trends, again, I think there was an interesting note that you heard in my prepared remarks and you heard in Joe's prepared remarks, which were that if you added back in our e-commerce business, on a constant-currency basis, actually our business in Europe was flat. So we far exceeded our expectations when we turned on our e-commerce sites or what we refer to as our digital flagships, which we believe had a significant impact on our business in the marketplace. While traffic was down in Europe, it was down in kind of the mid-single digits, which was lower than what we had anticipated, but again, it was -- we believe, a lot of that volume went directly to our own website during the period. So we're going to continue to watch that. We saw the exact same thing happen in North America. The minute we turned on our e-commerce, our comp store sales were impacted pretty dramatically quickly. And again, that's just consumers changing their shopping behavior. And as we've seen in many countries, they want to go to the official website. We certainly have had other partners having e-commerce in the territories. But now there is the Michael Kors website, which you are able to see the full range of our products, you're able to engage with many of our social activities and styling tips. And as we said, in North America, we're launching specialized product offerings under Kors Custom (sic) [ Custom Kors]. We're going to roll that out in Europe as well. So there's a lot that's going on, on our websites. We also talked about the fact that our dress shop will launch in the early part of fall, maybe in the early -- as late as spring. So we think that this is only going to get bigger. And again, that's why, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're spending more money to help fuel that. And we think Europe, in particular, we'll see that trend continue. So that's a long-winded way of me saying that we think actual store comps will be -- will remain down kind of in the same trend, maybe even a little worse than they've been, and we'll look at what that total mix is wrapped up with our e-commerce business to see how that's impacting our trends."

But what I can say to you is the following, is that many of our department store partners have been offering promotions. It's -- if it's not every 2 weeks, it's every third week, so there's something going on all the time. And as I said to you, we're going to have -- we're going to really consolidate that down to 4 times a year. So we believe that's going to significantly reduce the amount of off-price business that we're doing, hence the reason for the significant reduction in the inventory going into the channel. And so I think that, that's something we're going to just to have to see how it plays out over time. But we are focused on making sure that, along with that, we provide great value. And that value doesn't only mean $295 or -- I'm sorry, $298 or $228. That value could also be in one of our very successful -- our Mercer bag, which is the grab bag with the grommets. And the consumer saw that at $498 and said  ""Wow, this is amazing design and tremendous amount of workmanship and detail and design that went into that"" at what we thought was a very, very exciting and compelling value for the consumer. So we look at those things and really balance them. And again, we're trying to make sure that she sees Michael Kors as an elevated brand and not something that's on promotion on a regular basis. And in the outlet channel, I would say AUR did decline during the quarter and has declined over the last few quarters as the channel has become also extremely promotional. Our competitors are, in many cases, much deeper in discount than we are, and so that's becoming something that we've had to really compete with. The good news in that channel is there is less of a traffic issue. And so that kind of has helped us balance off the AUR piece, and our conversions are up in that channel as well.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, total revenue was $1.4 billion and earnings per share were in line with our expectations at $1.64. We saw solid",1810,"Thank you, Krystyna. Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, total revenue was $1.4 billion and earnings per share were in line with our expectations at $1.64. We saw solid results in several areas of our business during the quarter. The new fall and holiday handbag introductions performed well, led by the Mercer, Brooklyn and Sloan Editor collections. All of these new fashion luxury handbag groups were supported by enhanced marketing in both traditional and social media channels, which helped create strong sell-throughs across these launches. We also continued to see strong response to our new MICHAEL KORS ACCESS line of wearable technology with sales exceeding our expectations for the season. 
In addition, momentum in our athletic footwear business remains strong, and our holiday womenâ€™s ready-to-wear collection received favorable response. Our digital flagship in North America continued to deliver double-digit comparable sales growth while sales in our new digital flagship in Europe exceeded expectations. We also rolled out Custom Kors on our digital flagship in North America, which featured free monogramming services as well as options to curate your own personally styled Sloan Select handbag. All of these initiatives, which were led by Michael and our design team, demonstrate our continued commitment to delivering exciting, new luxury fashion products to consumers globally. 
While we were pleased to see the strong performance in multiple areas of our business, we were disappointed in our North American and European comparable sales, which continued to be impacted by negative traffic trends and currency fluctuations. We also saw average unit retails negatively impacted by the highly promotional environment as well as the continued fashion trends towards crossbody and small leather goods. Additionally, the fashion watch category remained challenged, which continued to negatively impact our comparable sales. 
In the retail segment, global net sales grew 9% during the quarter and comparable sales decreased 6.9%. In the Americas, retail net sales decreased 1% and comparable sales decreased in the mid-single digits, which was in line with our expectations despite the very difficult retail environment. 
The e-commerce business outperformed expectations with double-digit comparable sales increases. In stores, traffic declined in the high single digits, which was partially offset by an increase in conversion rates. We also saw solid results from the launch of our click-and-collect offering in 10 stores in North America during the quarter enabling customers to make their purchases online and pick up the merchandise in one of our retail locations on the same day. Based on the strong response to click and collect thus far, we plan to roll out this feature across all U.S. locations in this quarter. We believe that further enhancing our omni-channel presence will help us to drive improved comparable sales results in the future. 
Turning to the international business. In Europe, overall retail net sales were essentially flat during the quarter. In our newly launched digital flagships, sales significantly exceeded expectations. In stores, comparable sales decreased in the mid-teens range as we saw steeper-than-expected declines in store traffic, which we believe was due to the continuation of weak tourism trends as well as reduced consumer confidence related to Brexit and terrorist attacks in certain markets. 
In addition, a portion of this decline was attributable to a shift in customer traffic from retail locations to the newly launched digital flagships. If we were to include e-commerce sales, our European comparable sales results would have been down in the mid-single digits on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant-currency basis. This is similar to the trend we saw in North America when we launched our e-commerce platform. 
In Asia, total retail net sales increased almost 300%, largely as a result of revenue from the acquisition of the Greater China and Korea operations. In Japan, retail net sales grew more than 25% with comparable sales increasing in the mid-single digits. The Greater China business, while not included in the comparable sales base, increased double digits on a constant-currency basis. 
We were also excited to launch our first digital flagship in China in October with, initial performance exceeding expectations. While the digital landscape remains small for luxury brands into this region, we feel that offering a full view of the Michael Kors brand online enhances our customer engagement and acquisition. Importantly, these results indicate that the Michael Kors brand is strong and growing in Asia. 
We opened 29 net new stores globally throughout the quarter, including 14 new and expanded men's stores, bringing our total to 35 men's locations, as well as 2 new flagships in Asia. Michael was on hand for the opening festivities of our flagship store in Seoul, Korea and helped celebrate Harper's Bazaar Young Korea feature, which showcased looks from our resort 2017 collection. In Singapore, Michael was joined by Kate Hudson to help celebrate the opening of our Mandarin Galleria (sic) [ Mandarin Gallery ] store, which at 6,000 square feet is the largest Michael Kors flagship store in Southeast Asia. 
Turning to the Wholesale business. Net sales declined 18% during the quarter. In the Americas, sales decreased 15% as we continue to strategically reduce sell-in into the department store channel. In addition, beginning this month, we are reducing promotional activity across the retail and wholesale channels, which is expected to result in average unit retails -- higher average unit retails as the product positioning will be elevated. While we believe this is the right thing to do for our brand long term, this decision is expected to negatively impact our net sales throughout fiscal 2018, albeit to a smaller degree, and the declines are expected to further moderate in fiscal 2019 as we anniversary the reductions in inventory and reduced promotional activity. As we continue to reduce our inventory position in the wholesale channel, we anticipate this segment will be a smaller portion of our net sales going forward. 
In Europe, net sales in the Wholesale segment decreased 12% as the headwinds that impacted our retail stores also had a negative effect on sales in the wholesale channel. We also continued to see a shift in sales trends towards products with lower average unit retails, such as crossbodies and small leather goods, and anticipate this trend will continue throughout fiscal 2018. In addition, we anticipate market volatility in this region throughout the calendar year. In the U.K., we saw -- we continue to experience a decrease in traffic despite the weaker pound sterling. In France and Germany, we are concerned about the upcoming elections, which we believe may impact consumer buying habits. 
In Asia, Wholesale net sales decreased 68%, primarily attributable to the shift of China and South Korean sales to our company-owned retail segment. This decrease will continue until we anniversary the acquisition of our Greater China license. 
Turning to our men's segment. We are pleased with the performance of this developing business. We now have more than 250 men's shop-in-shops, and our men's sportswear offerings is resonating with the customer globally. Additionally, we have further expanded our leather goods offering, which drove accelerated growth in this category during the quarter. We remain committed to developing this segment of the men's business. 
In the licensing segment, revenue declined during the quarter as a result of continued softness in the fashion watch and jewelry categories and lower revenues in Asia as a result of the recent acquisition of our licensed operations. This was partially offset by the strong performance of the ACCESS line of wearable technology globally, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Given the current size of the ACCESS business, the new collection only partially offset the decline in fashion watches. Based on this success, we will continue to invest in and expand the wearable technology category with the goal of ultimately becoming the second-largest smartwatch brand globally. 
We were also pleased with the performance of the fragrance collection in this quarter, especially the positive response to our new Wonderlust fragrance, which led to strong results particularly during the holiday period. The fragrance category continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for the company. 
In conclusion, we believe the Michael Kors brand remains strong, but it is clear that we must enact changes to reverse the negative comparable sales trends that we are experiencing in our stores. We are focused on 5 specific initiatives to improve comparable sales performance in North America and Europe. 
First, Michael and our design teams have introduced new design elements in accessories to provide a more elevated and layered assortment. These unique and innovative techniques, including artisanal craftsmanship, iconic hardware details and intricate mixed-media leathers, that will enhance our glamorous handbag offerings in the $498 to $398 category. Additionally, we have 5 iconic groups consisting of Hamilton, Selma, Savannah, Cynthia and Mercer handbags that will be shipped this quarter and are strategically priced at $298 for medium sizes and $258 to $228 on certain smaller sizes. 
Second, we will be expanding the presence of our new Jet Set signature accessories in our stores, which will include multiple layers for the fall season. Initial results of our new Jet Set signature deliveries for the spring season have been very strong. This is an iconic element for our brand, and we will capitalize on the current fashion trend for signature accessories. 
Third, we are increasing the penetration of footwear in our largest volume doors. As one of the leading fashion footwear companies globally, we intend to capitalize on this strength and increase the presence of this category in key stores. 
Fourth, we are focusing on our fast-growing dress category as an iconic cornerstone of our womenâ€™s ready to wear. This will be highlighted by our new online dress shop that is scheduled to launch this fall. This category will represent approximately 50% of our ready-to-wear assortments in our stores. 
Fifth, we will significantly increase our digital marketing spend to fuel our fast-growing e-commerce business globally. We continue to see strong revenue growth from our initiatives in this channel as consumers shift their shopping behavior. 
With these 5 initiatives, we expect to drive increased store and site visits as well as increased average unit retails and deepen our engagement with consumers in our retail channel to improve comparable sales in North America and Europe. In addition to these initiatives, we remain confident that we have a significant incremental revenue opportunity as we build Asia into a $1 billion business. We also feel strongly that we're on the right track to developing a significant men's business, which could ultimately be $1 billion in revenue. In summary, our increased emphasis on the retail segment, in addition to the expansion of our Asia and men's business, will help us rebalance our revenues and position us for growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe to review our financials."

For the third quarter, total revenue was $1.35 billion compared to $1.40 billion in the prior year quarter. In the retail segment, net sales increased 9.2%, driven primarily by the addition of 193 net new stores since the third quarter",1637,"Thank you, John. For the third quarter, total revenue was $1.35 billion compared to $1.40 billion in the prior year quarter. 
In the retail segment, net sales increased 9.2%, driven primarily by the addition of 193 net new stores since the third quarter of last year, including 143 stores associated with the recent acquisitions of Greater China and South Korea. 
Comparable sales decreased 6.9%, reflecting a mid-single-digit decrease in North America and a mid-teens decline in Europe, partially offset by a mid-single-digit increase in Asia. E-commerce comparable sales contributed approximately 340 basis points to our performance in the quarter. 
As John mentioned, North America remained under pressure from declining store traffic and the aggressive promotional environment, which was partially offset by increased conversion rates and strong performance of our digital flagships. The comparable sales decline in Europe was driven by reduced store traffic and lower average unit retails as a result of shift in product mix, with a portion of the decline attributable to the launch of our European digital flagships. The North American digital flagships achieved double-digit comparable sales increases in the quarter. While European digital flagships are not yet included in the comparable sales base, had they been included, the European comp would have been down in the mid-single digits on a reported basis and essentially flat on a constant-currency basis. 
In the Wholesale segment, net sales declined 17.8% due to lower sales in the women's accessories and apparel businesses. The Wholesale business in the Americas region declined in the mid-teens as we remain disciplined with the amount of inventory we ship into that channel. European net sales decreased in the low teens while, on Asia, the decrease in net sales largely reflects the shift of our Greater China and South Korea businesses to the retail segment during the quarter. 
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 22.9%. This was primarily due to the continued softness of the fashion watch and jewelry categories as well as lower revenues from the geographic licensing arrangement in Asia due to the recent acquisitions of our licensee operations. 
Gross margin expanded 10 basis points to 59.6% due to a favorable channel mix shift towards the retail segment as well as an increase in the wholesale gross margin. Gross margin increased 210 basis points in the Wholesale segment primarily due to lower allowances and favorable change in the geographic mix. Gross margin declined 270 basis points in the retail segment, which was attributable to an increase in promotional activities as compared to last year. 
Total operating expense grew 9.7% and increased 410 basis points to 34.3% of total revenue. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our businesses in Greater China and South Korea, including the higher depreciation expense and amortization of the reacquired rights of the intangible asset recognized in connection with the recently acquired businesses as well as investments in new stores, e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities, new shop-in-shops and infrastructure improvements. 
Income from operations was $341.9 million or 25.3% of total revenue as compared to 29.3% of total revenue in the same period last year. Retail operating margin was 21.3% compared to 27.8% in the prior year period. 270 basis points of this decrease was due to the gross margin reduction that I described earlier; 180 basis points was the result of China and South Korea acquisitions, including the amortization of reacquired rights; and 190 basis points was related to the continued investments in building our digital flagship platforms, retail store-related costs and deleverage, in large part related to a mix shift between e-commerce and in-store sales. We expect operating margin for the retail segment to continue to be negatively impacted by the inclusion of the newly acquired international businesses and a mix shift of sales to our e-commerce channels, both of which currently carry a lower operating margin. 
Wholesale operating margin was 29.6% compared to 27.9% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of the 210 basis point increase in our wholesale gross margin, partially offset by a 40 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue. 
Licensing operating margin was 54.7% compared to 64.8% in the prior year period. This was primarily due to increased costs associated with advertising as well as increased depreciation expense. 
Income taxes were $70.4 million in the quarter, and our effective tax rate was 20.6% as compared to 28.0% in the same period last year. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of certain global financing activities. 
Net income was $271.3 million for the third quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $1.64. This compares to net income of $294.6 million or $1.59 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $521.6 million in operating cash flow, ending the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $368.8 million. Inventory was relatively flat compared to the prior year as we continued to carefully manage these levels. 
We ended the quarter with $147.8 million of debt, which was recorded within short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. The debt consisted of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities. At the end of the third quarter, the amount available for future borrowings was approximately $852.7 million. In January 2017, the company repaid all of the borrowings outstanding under the 2015 credit facility. 
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares totaling $100 million under our share repurchase program and have another $250 million of availability remaining in our most recent $1 billion authorization. This most recent share repurchase further demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and our confidence in our long-term growth potential. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $39.1 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. 
Looking forward, we expect continued headwinds from challenging retail trends in North America and Europe as well as our decision to further tighten inventory control and reduce promotional activity. As a result, we have moderated our outlook and now expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be approximately 14 -- excuse me, $4.48 billion and comparable sales to decrease in the high single-digit range. We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 59.3%, below our initial expectation as our lower European sales outlook will result in a less favorable benefit from geographic mix than we initially anticipated. We expect operating expenses as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 39.7%. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 19.9%, excluding the $11.3 million in onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of our Greater China licensee. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.13 on a GAAP basis including the $11.3 million of onetime transaction costs, and be between $4.15 and $4.19 excluding the onetime cost. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 21% and 169.0 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect continued -- we expect total revenue to be between $1.035 billion and $1.055 billion and a low-teens decrease in comparable sales. As compared to our prior fourth quarter expectations, we now anticipate retail net sales to be approximately $54 million lower as we have prudently adjusted our outlook to reflect continued slower sales as well as revised foreign exchange expectations, somewhat offset by our strong e-commerce results. We reduced our Wholesale segment expectation by approximately $11 million, reflecting a larger than anticipated impact from the new promotional policy and weak trends in Europe. 
Gross margin is now expected to increase to approximately 58.4%, driven by a favorable geographic and channel mix shift. 
We plan to continue to invest in our digital flagships, international expansion and global infrastructure. This would result in an operating expense as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 44.4%, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 14.0%, a decrease of approximately 400 basis points from our prior expectations, with approximately 150 basis points as a result of lower gross margin and 250 basis points as a result of deleverage as we reduce our retail and Wholesale sales. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.72. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 22% and 164.0 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
For fiscal 2017, capital expenditures are now expected to approximate $200 million and will focus on ongoing investments in global digital strategies and omni-channel capabilities; global retail expansion, including approximately 8 net new stores in the Americas, 25 in Europe and 28 in Asia, 96 wholesale shop-in-shops globally; and the company's global distribution infrastructure, information systems and corporate facilities. 
In conclusion, while the current environment is challenging, we continue to focus on our operating priorities in order to drive sales and earnings growth. Looking forward to fiscal 2018, we anticipate modest top line growth, driven by higher retail net sales, as we continue to deliver an innovative luxury product offering, enhance our e-commerce capabilities, further expand our business in Asia and grow the men's segment. 
We anticipate the declines in the Wholesale business will moderate as we anniversary the reductions in inventory and reduce promotional activity. And we expect licensing revenue to be relatively flat as declines in the fashion watch category subside and the smartwatch sales continue to grow. Taking all this into account and the strategic investments that we are making in the company, we expect operating margin in the high teens and modest earnings per share growth. Consistent with our prior practice, we will provide you with additional detailed guidance when we announce our fourth quarter results in late May. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

Thank you, Omar. I would answer it differently for North America and Europe. In North America, as we have previously said and indicated, our revenue base will decline throughout the entire period of next fiscal year, and that's as we reset with our department store partners, based upon our new promotional policy, which, as we said in the prepared remarks, starts actually around February 1. So that's in place now, and many of our partners are reducing their inventory with us and we're reducing it with them as they have operated with a much more aggressive promotional posture. And as we said, again, our objective is to reduce promotion, increase average AUR and position the brand in a more elevated place with our consumer. This is a very aggressive approach. We don't believe any of our competitors are taking this level of stance as it relates to walking away from the promotional activity. We will have 4 periods that we do authorize a Michael Kors event during the year. And so we think it's going to take the entire fiscal year to work our way through that. And as Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, we kind of see that leveling off in our fiscal '19. That being said, inside -- the category of men's as a wholesale component inside the United States will grow and should grow rather quickly, and we're very pleased with what we've seen so far, in particular, on the wholesale side with that business both in ready to wear and in leather. Europe is a separate conversation. Again, many of the department stores are experiencing similar things that you're seeing here in North America. There's been a slowdown in traffic in many of the cities, and we've gone through the reasons of that, whether it was Brexit or whether it was terrorist activities, which have stopped certain people internationally on a tourism basis. And also, locally, there are many places where people are, quite frankly, fearful of going into shopping malls because of incidents. So we anticipate that to continue -- that level of disruption to continue through, again, the balance of this fiscal year. And in addition to that, we're very concerned about upcoming elections and what that might do in certain of the marketplaces, and we highlighted, in particular, Germany and France, where we have very sizable businesses. So again, we do not see that kind of resetting until, I would say, fiscal '19 for us. And that's why we're really looking at the company in total, Omar, to kind of rebalance our business. We're going to be much more retail focused, led by our digital flagships than our retail stores, and also, that will be really driven even more heavily by our opportunities that are inside of Asia. So thank you very much for that question."

Secondly, we've said that we will look at potential acquisitions. We are actively looking at a number of different things. And if it's right for our company and our management's ability to execute and create value for our shareholders, then we will take advantage of that. We certainly have the capacity to do sizable transactions or smaller transactions. But what we've said to you in the past is, is that we probably won't do anything small.

I would answer the first question regarding AUR, again, in 2 ways. First, what we did, and we announced this, I think, on the last call, we're really looking at what the average product that's going out the door to the customer at",739,"Sure. Thank you, Oliver. I would answer the first question regarding AUR, again, in 2 ways. First, what we did, and we announced this, I think, on the last call, we're really looking at what the average product that's going out the door to the customer at, and we believe that the $300 handbag category is a very big opportunity. And so what we want to do is create value, when she walks in the door and she sees an amazing design, she doesn't have to wait for a coupon or a sale or anything else. She's stimulated by what she's seen. And we clearly saw that with our Mercer handbag collection, which was non-promotional the entire fall season and was basically our #1 selling collection. So she responded to the design, she responded to the fact that it was full price, but she also responded to the fact there was great value there in that collection. So what we're doing is we've kind of learned from that, and we've said, ""Okay. Why don't we expand that thought process?"" And one of the great exciting collections that we're actually reintroducing in new shapes is Hamilton, which has been one of our best-selling groups for many, many years. We had decided to remove that from our retail channel, and we're reintroducing that. And again, they were just literally unpacking the boxes on that in some stores recently, and we've had excellent initial sales results. So we think that's the right thing to do to create value at the right price so that when she walks in the door, she doesn't have to think about whether something is on sale or not, and we believe that's going to have a fairly significant impact on our AUR. And then, secondly, we are -- as I said in my prepared remarks, now that we kind of believe we've reset this $295 and $259 and -- I'm sorry, $298 and $258 and $228 basis, we're now going to look at our $498 and $398 category and really try and build up that area of opportunity where we believe, in particular, in our own stores, we're capable of being able to sell that at a full price. I also want to point out that the second bestselling product for us that we actually ran out of during the holiday season was our ACCESS watches, again, totally full price, no sale on that product. And again -- so when it's the right fashion, the right price for the consumer, we think we're doing quite well with them on that. So that's the strategy on AUR, and we will be a lot less promotional by a significant amount of days. So we're looking to raise that ultimately by approximately 10%. That's our goal to get to, and we think we can do that throughout the year. It's not going to happen all on day 1, but it will happen throughout the year. Secondly, on the store traffic side, the -- we view our stores in 2 ways. First off, the majority of our fleet globally is very profitable. There are definitely some unprofitable stores that we will analyze over the next 6 months and make some decisions on, but the majority of the fleet is very nicely profitable. That being said, we also view our store footprints as an opportunity for us to act as a distribution center, in a sense. And we talked about click and collect and our omni capabilities. We're learning a lot more about that as we go forward. We also have tests that are upcoming in the spring season on same-day delivery out of a number of locations. And so we want to make the determination of what does a footprint allow you to do in terms of service, and we think service is going to be a critical component of our long-term success as a brand and also as an omni-channel retailer. So how do we service her? Where do we service -- where do we provide her that service and at which speed? And we all know the people who are setting the standards in that. So we take it very seriously, and we think that the store footprints will allow us the capabilities of doing that as long as they remain profitable. Obviously, if they don't remain profitable, then we will look to reduce that footprint. Thank you, Oliver."

Next year, we expect the following things to happen. Actually, our operating margins in retail will expand for 2 reasons: number one, for geographic mix and, in particular, Asia. Asia is getting more profitable for us each quarter as we're gaining velocity and we're gaining scale, which is creating leverage. And as you know from many of the other global luxury players, Asia sometimes can be the most profitable part of their business. So we believe that's going to have a very significant impact on our operating margin performance going forward in retail. We are also getting more profitable in our e-commerce business. It's still not where we want it to be in terms of against where we are in our retail stores, but it is getting more profitable. So we believe that, that will have a positive impact on us next year in terms of operating margins. We will see operating margins decline slightly in our Wholesale business as we do have some deleverage in terms of the size, volume coming down. And then also, there have been some significant initiatives that have gone on inside of our organization, obviously, to reduce costs given our new revenue outlook. So while we are disappointed that we are no longer able to, for the moment, say that we can carry a 2 handle, we do think that we will still be one of the most significantly profitable global luxury brands in the world and generating significant free cash flow, which will continue to give us the ability to execute on both share repurchase and then acquisition potential. And as we've said, even in the future, we might consider dividend, although that's not on the immediate horizon. So I think we are comfortable that we do not need to think about a further, a significant deceleration in the EBIT margins. Joe?"

I guess my question is, why do them when the cap of the company is where it was with the IPO, the stock is significantly cheaper than peers, et cetera? I'm just kind of curious. Why even do one or contemplate one? And then, secondly, just back on the operating margins. So do we think that we're towards the end of the SG&A dollar investment cycle? And then also, CapEx, I think you said $200 million. Can we get further lower from there? Because the free cash flow of the company continues to pile up, and the market multiple on those cash flows keeps going down. So I'm just trying to get a sense of -- the market wants to know where these cash flows bottom, where these expenses bottom, et cetera. So I'm just kind of thinking through those items and would love your response."

The CapEx is going to be around the -- continue to be around the level that we're at this year. They may go down a little bit but not much. We have some additional IT initiatives that are going to go on inside the company, but the significant -- whether it was our corporate headquarters in New York, whether it was our Venlo operations that we built in -- for distribution in Europe, most of that is all -- will be finished. And then the predominant amount of store openings will be focused in Asia. We're pretty much done with the footprint in North America. We're pretty much done with the footprint in Europe. There'll be some capital around the men's expansion. So we feel very comfortable kind of in that range of where we are today or lower. Slightly lower will be where we will be on a go-forward basis. In terms of acquisitions, look, I said it to you earlier. Our #1 capital allocation priority is to repurchase shares, again. With our multiple being consistently below where our peer group is and us still being much more profitable than many of them, we think there's a dislocation, and the board and the senior management of the team of the company feel that's really the best investment for us to make. And so I think that will be number one. And number two, again, if we can utilize the company -- the management team's expertise and certain other of our capabilities internally to create value for our shareholders, we will look at that. But we're not going to do that at the expense of our own corporate initiatives. And again, we believe there is still very significant volume, revenue opportunity for the company over the next few years. We are being impacted by a decision that we've made to kind of get out of the fray of this every-kind-of-few-weeks promotional activity. And I think that's the right decision for us. But that's going to take a significant amount of revenues away from the company, but, I think, create much better value for us long term as a brand with the end consumer, and that's the right thing for us to do. So we'll stay focused on that as our priority and then look at our share repurchase program. And if the right acquisition comes up, we will consider it. And if we don't, then we'll pass and stay focused on what we're doing. Thank you, Randy."

Dana, we're very excited about what happened with ACCESS watches. And I will tell you that from the minute the watches hit the store, we had something happen that we haven't seen in a long time as it relates to the watch category. We have people kind of lining up for the watches. You may have seen it in some of our stores. And we're still having trouble catching up with the demand that we have, both in on our own stores and then at many of our retail partners. So clearly, this is a category that is here, and it's a category that will grow. So we're excited about that. And both Fossil and ourselves feel that we're at the very beginning of something that could become sizable. I can't tell you whether it's going to ultimately outpace where we were with the total fashion watch business. The category of fashion watches in total continues to decline. Not just us, many competitors as well are seeing the same thing. Again, both Fossil and, in particular, Kosta and I believe that the fashion watch business will be completely reshaped as we know it today and that most watches over the next 3 to 5 years will come with some level of technology.  We'll be making some exciting announcements in Fossil in a few weeks about some additional things that we're doing in the wearable technology space that we think will further enhance our positioning. So just know that, again, Fossil and, in particular, Kosta and myself are very, very committed to maintaining our leadership position in the fashion watch business. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we think we will ultimately become the second-largest wearable watch business in the world. And clearly, the numbers are pointing towards that. So if this category grows, this can be important for us. As I said, again, in the prepared remarks, it did not offset the decline in the total fashion watch business, but we were significantly encouraged by the beginning of a trend change that we saw and look forward to that continuing on. The handbag category, Dana, our kind of intel, we believe the category was about flat in Q -- calendar Q4/our Q3, and I would say that was both in North America and Europe. We believe the category actually grew in Asia. And we are going to have reduced market share. That is absolutely something that we actually want. And by us reducing our wholesale shipments and, to some degree, pulling back on the promotional activity in our own stores, we'll reduce our velocity in our own stores, we will have less market share, and we actually think that's a healthy thing for us on a go-forward basis. And our outlook is that the handbag marketplace globally will remain approximately flat, maybe up 1 point or 2. Again, that's in dollars. And in units, we actually think that the market was up significantly. So I'll just give you one number. In North America, in handbags, where we had a single-digit decline in our own stores, we were up 11% in units. That's actually sold units to the customer. So once again, that gives us great comfort that the consumer is absolutely engaging with the Michael Kors brand, and again, all of our consumer research says that. She's just finding it at a much more attractively -- much more attractive price than she's previously been finding it at. And we're going to show her value in a different way going forward that we think will keep her engaged. And our objective is to sell significantly less units next fiscal year than were sold in this fiscal year."

The second question, we're not going to have time to do, so I'm only going to answer the first question for you. The European trends, again, I think there was an interesting note that you heard in my prepared remarks and you heard in Joe's prepared remarks, which were that if you added back in our e-commerce business, on a constant-currency basis, actually our business in Europe was flat. So we far exceeded our expectations when we turned on our e-commerce sites or what we refer to as our digital flagships, which we believe had a significant impact on our business in the marketplace. While traffic was down in Europe, it was down in kind of the mid-single digits, which was lower than what we had anticipated, but again, it was -- we believe, a lot of that volume went directly to our own website during the period. So we're going to continue to watch that. We saw the exact same thing happen in North America. The minute we turned on our e-commerce, our comp store sales were impacted pretty dramatically quickly. And again, that's just consumers changing their shopping behavior. And as we've seen in many countries, they want to go to the official website. We certainly have had other partners having e-commerce in the territories. But now there is the Michael Kors website, which you are able to see the full range of our products, you're able to engage with many of our social activities and styling tips. And as we said, in North America, we're launching specialized product offerings under Kors Custom (sic) [ Custom Kors]. We're going to roll that out in Europe as well. So there's a lot that's going on, on our websites. We also talked about the fact that our dress shop will launch in the early part of fall, maybe in the early -- as late as spring. So we think that this is only going to get bigger. And again, that's why, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're spending more money to help fuel that. And we think Europe, in particular, we'll see that trend continue. So that's a long-winded way of me saying that we think actual store comps will be -- will remain down kind of in the same trend, maybe even a little worse than they've been, and we'll look at what that total mix is wrapped up with our e-commerce business to see how that's impacting our trends."

But what I can say to you is the following, is that many of our department store partners have been offering promotions. It's -- if it's not every 2 weeks, it's every third week, so there's something going on all the time. And as I said to you, we're going to have -- we're going to really consolidate that down to 4 times a year. So we believe that's going to significantly reduce the amount of off-price business that we're doing, hence the reason for the significant reduction in the inventory going into the channel. And so I think that, that's something we're going to just to have to see how it plays out over time. But we are focused on making sure that, along with that, we provide great value. And that value doesn't only mean $295 or -- I'm sorry, $298 or $228. That value could also be in one of our very successful -- our Mercer bag, which is the grab bag with the grommets. And the consumer saw that at $498 and said  ""Wow, this is amazing design and tremendous amount of workmanship and detail and design that went into that"" at what we thought was a very, very exciting and compelling value for the consumer. So we look at those things and really balance them. And again, we're trying to make sure that she sees Michael Kors as an elevated brand and not something that's on promotion on a regular basis. And in the outlet channel, I would say AUR did decline during the quarter and has declined over the last few quarters as the channel has become also extremely promotional. Our competitors are, in many cases, much deeper in discount than we are, and so that's becoming something that we've had to really compete with. The good news in that channel is there is less of a traffic issue. And so that kind of has helped us balance off the AUR piece, and our conversions are up in that channel as well.

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Call. As many of you know, last month, we announced that after 13 years with Michael Kors, Joe Parsons has decided to retire. On behalf of Michael, the board and the entire organization, I would like to thank Joe for the integral role he played in building Michael Kors into a leading global luxury fashion house. Joe and I have worked together for 20 years and I would like to personally thank him for his leadership, partnership, and friendship. I and the rest of the team wish him well in his retirement. 
On that note, I would also like to welcome Tom Edwards, our incoming Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer. Tom joined us from the [ Brink International ] where he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Joe will continue in his current role through August 1, working with Tom to ensure a thorough and seamless transition. 
Moving now to our results. While the fourth quarter performance was largely in line with our expectations, fiscal 2017 was a difficult and disappointing year for us. The retail environment remains challenging. That being said, we must acknowledge that our company needs to take steps to accelerate the level of luxury fashion innovation in our accessories assortments and further enhance our store experience in order to better engage and excite consumers. We have developed a long-term strategic plan, which we have named Runway 2020 to address these and other areas. We believe the execution of this strategic plan and our leading luxury fashion brand, which is renowned for design innovation and fashion leadership will position us to return to long-term sustainable and profitable growth. 
Looking back on the year, we executed on a number of initiatives, which will lay the groundwork for our strategic plan. During fiscal 2017, we expanded our global revenues with the acquisition of our Greater China license. We continue to believe that this region, along with Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia will ultimately generate $1 billion in revenue for our company. We also launched digital flagships in Europe and Asia bringing the number of countries served to 11. And we've begun to take steps to protect our brand by reducing promotional activity in our digital flagships, lifestyle stores and wholesale doors. While we have seen a decrease in both retail and wholesale sales as a result of these changes, we believe this is the right action to protect our brand health long-term. In addition, we undertook 5 specific initiatives, which I outlined for you on our last call. During the fourth quarter, we made good initial progress on these efforts. While it was not enough to meaningfully impact our results, we believe we are moving in the right direction by infusing more luxury detailing and fashion innovation in our product assortment. And this is being met with the favorable consumer reaction. For instance, Michael and our design team have been focused on creating more elevated and layered assortments. These fresh new design elements were represented in some of our best-selling styles in the fourth quarter. Our Mercer handbag collection, which saw strong sell-throughs globally reflected an area an array of bring spring colors and novelty detailing. The Brooklyn handbag collection saw strong response and was offered in several styles, including novelty detailing like grommets and an oversized tassel. We also expanded the presence of our new Jet Set signature accessories capitalizing on current fashion trends. The collection features multiple layers composed of luxury fashion silhouettes and novelty details. The Jet Set signature Group is an icon element of our brand and continues to resonate with consumers. 
We also increased our offering of mix-and-match products, including the Selma swap handbag, which allows consumers to purchase a reversible jacket to change the look of their bag effectively creating 3 bags in 1. In addition, we introduced interchangeable handbag straps, which featured enhanced styling such as floral embellishments, grommets and studs. 
Finally, we continue to focus on opportunities to engage and excite our customers through customization and saw continued positive response to our free monogramming services, which we offered in our digital flagships and select retail stores. Later this year, we will begin to offer monogramming enhancements, including symbols, additional fonts, and alternative placements. We will also debut a customized pendant program. These perforated leather handbags, accessories and footwear will be uniquely styled by the consumer with a variety of pins, including leathers, horoscope signs, symbols and more. 
In our footwear assortment, we continue to offer on-trend innovative product with consumers responding positively to exciting new details like the strong floral motif in our [ Heidi thong ] and Kip sandals as well as to pumps with our signature chain heel treatment. Active footwear sales continue to grow and our new floral perforated designs saw particularly strong response. 
In women's ready-to-wear, dresses were our best performing category in the quarter with high single digit comparable sales growth. Our expanded dress assortment included innovative fashion detailing as well as seasonal colors and concepts. We are pleased with the favorable consumer response and we'll build on our momentum as we continue to grow this category. 
Turning to our men's business. We continue to grow this segment of our business in fiscal 2017. As our sportswear offerings resonated with the consumer and we saw strong response to our expanded offering in men's luxury leather goods. While this remains a small part of our overall business, we now have 41 stores as well as 261 shop-in-shops and see men's as an important category of growth going forward. As we have previously stated, we believe men's will ultimately grow to a $1 billion business. 
In our watch business, ACCESS smartwatches continue to be an outstanding success. This product line is expected to represent approximately 25% of our watch assortment in fiscal 2018 as we expand our offerings with exciting new styles, updated plating options, and an increase selection of interchangeable straps which enable consumers to customize their smartwatches with multiple looks. 
Finally, with respect to marketing. Michael's luxury fashion message remains a cornerstone of our communication with consumers. We continue to invest in both traditional and digital marketing channels. We're increasingly incorporating CRM activation in our digital marketing activities to drive traffic and conversion. We are using data on purchase history, interests and geography to align the creative in our messages to the most relevant audiences in order to more effectively connect with consumers, which in turn has helped drive traffic and conversion, in particular, in our digital flagships globally. 
Moving to our financial performance. For the full year 2017, we reported total revenue of $4.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.24. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $0.73. In the quarter, global retail net sales grew 0.5% and comparable sales decreased 14.1%. In the Americas, retail net sales decreased 13.8% and comparable sales decreased in the low-teens. 
Our digital flagships continue to generate double-digit sales growth as consumers shift to online channel. However, retail comps remained under pressure by challenging traffic trends in the retail industry and the highly promotional environment. 
As we have previously discussed, beginning in February, we implemented a new promotional policy as part of our effort to protect brand integrity and improve margins. Additionally, in our North American digital flagships and lifestyle stores, we offered our Mercer and Hamilton accessories collection as well as our ACCESS smartwatch collection on a nonpromotional basis. Those products generated approximately 20% of our digital flagship and lifestyle store full-price sales, which contributed to a low single digit increase in full price AUR in the quarter. 
In Europe, retail net sales declined 15.4%. Comparable sales, which exclude e-commerce sales declined in the low 20s percent range on a reported basis and a high-teens range on a constant-currency basis. Including e-commerce sales on a constant currency basis, European comparable sales results would have declined in the low-teens range for the quarter. Similar to North America, we are taking steps in Europe to reduce promotional activities. We have 16 fewer brand-like promotional days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 than in the same period last year. While this change negatively impacted store traffic, it was the right long-term decision. We also believe traffic was pressured by reduced consumer confidence and uncertainty in certain markets stemming from European elections and the formal triggering of Brexit. 
In Asia, retail net sales increased more than 200%, largely as a result of the shift in China sales to our company-owned Retail segment. Asia comparable sales, which included Japan and Korea grew in the low single digits on a reported basis and were flat on a constant-currency basis as Japan comparable sales continue to be impact by the decline in Chinese tourist. Asia comparable sales, including the Greater China business grew in the mid-single digits, or high single digits on a constant-currency basis. Overall, we remain pleased with our continued strong performance in the Asia region. 
Now I'd like to discuss our retail strategy. While we expect the digital channel to grow as a percent of sales, our stores will also continue to play an important role in increasing the company's revenue long-term. Stores will continue to serve as the destination for consumers looking for experience of the Michael Kors brand firsthand, make luxury fashion purchases as well as to showcase our innovative designs and engage consumers through service and clientele. In order to optimize our store base, we performed an in-depth analysis on our entire fleet. Based on the results of this evaluation, we plan to close between 100 and 125 lifestyle stores globally over the next 2 years. This will enable us to focus on the most productive locations as well as those that we believe are important in supporting our brand image. We will continue to selectively open new stores in key cities with a primary focus on expanding our presence in Asia. 
Another key element of our retail strategy is to modernize our stores around the world. Last spring, we opened our new flagship on Regent Street in London. The store features a pallette of soft browns and grays that mixed with the warm woods and luxury materials captures our refined take on glamour, while offering a modern and inviting environment in which to shop. The new store layout is built around a center runway opening onto luxurious rooms that  distinctly showcase our accessories, footwear, womenswear and menswear categories and allow our sales associates to provide consumers with a unique and elevated styling experience. We are pleased with the performance of our Regent Street store and plan to use this as our design concept for the future. 
Over the next 2 years, we plan to renovate approximately 100 locations with this new concept. We expect these enhancements will improve the productivity of our overall fleet by highlighting our footwear, women's ready-to-wear, and menswear areas, in addition to our accessories offering. And look forward to providing you with updates as we continue with our fleet modernization efforts. 
Turning to our Wholesale segment. Net sales declined 22.8% in the fourth quarter. The Americas declined 22.1%, largely driven by reduced sell-in into the department store channel as well as our decision to reduce our authorized promotional periods to 4x per year. As a result of this decision, we had 49 fewer promotional days in this quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year. This drove an increase in full-price AUR across our accessories, footwear, and menswear categories. While the decrease in promotional activity may cause a short-term reduction in sales, we are encouraged by the improvement in full-price AUR and remain confident that this is the right long-term decision for our brand. 
In Europe, net sales declined 17.4% in the quarter as the headwinds that impacted our retail stores also had a negative impact on our wholesale channel. As part of our continued focus on our brand health, we have thoughtfully and selectively begun to curtail shipments into this channel to reduce the end-of-season promotional inventory in wholesale accounts. 
In Asia, net sales decreased 56.9% primarily attributable to the shift of China sales to our company-owned Retail segment. 
Turning to our license segment. Revenues decreased 6.2% in the quarter with good performance from the new fashion watch styles, ACCESS smartwatches and eyewear partially offsetting declines in other categories. We saw positive response to new luxury fashion watch styles, [ Portia ] and Cynthia, both of which feature our new slim and feminine design. We are also pleased with the continued sales growth of our ACCESS wearable technology assortment. As I stated earlier, we plan to expand this category and are excited about the 2 new ACCESS smartwatch styles [ Sophie ] and [ Grayson ] that were introduced at Basel World in March. We plan to role these new styles out to stores this fall. 
We are continuing to expand our leadership in the fashion wearable technology category with the introduction of My Social, a feature, which will enable users to link their Instagram account and set a personal post photo as a watch face. The app allows the user to scroll through their Instagram posts, select their favorite image, and even apply filters creating a watch face that is personal as their life. As we expand this category through the new product introductions and technology innovations with our partner, Google, we believe our ACCESS wearable technology business can ultimately reach 50% of our overall watch sales. 
We're also pleased with the performance of our eyewear category in the quarter as consumers reacted favorably to new styles, including [ Ron ], a flat lens aviator and [ Ena ], an open wire metal cateye. 
Lastly, we continue to be pleased with the fragrance category performance, particularly in Europe. We're excited to expand the category this fall with the global launch of a major new fragrance, Sexy Ruby, which will add another pillar to our successful fragrance business. 
Looking ahead, as we deepen the fashion innovation in our assortments, grow key product categories, right-size our store fleet, and elevate our store experience, fiscal 2018 will be a transition year in which we establish a new baseline before returning to long-term growth. We have a strong luxury brand led by Michael Kors with a history of fashion innovation and leadership, a global footprint with stores positioned in many of the best locations around the world, and the marketing expertise to effectively convey our fashion stories. 
We will be hosting an Investor Day on June 9 at our company's New York headquarters where we will walk you through our Runway 2020 strategic growth plan. Members of the leadership team will be joining me to share the details of this plan, which builds on some of the recent initiatives I discussed today. Ultimately, Runway 2020 is designed to leverage our product innovation, elevated store experience, personalized shopping experience, and global presence to drive long-term sales and profitability growth. I look forward to sharing more details on our future growth initiatives with you at our Investor Day. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe."
143971118,430398723,1217450,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, May 31, 2017",2017-05-31,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John. For the fourth quarter, total revenue was $1.1 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes approximately $34 million in sales associated with the 53rd week of that fiscal year. In the Re",1624,"Thank you, John. For the fourth quarter, total revenue was $1.1 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes approximately $34 million in sales associated with the 53rd week of that fiscal year. In the Retail segment, net sales increased 0.5%, due primarily to the addition of 159 net new stores since the fourth quarter of last year, including 111 stores associated with the recent acquisitions of the Greater China license. Comparable sales decreased 14.1%, reflecting a low teens decrease in North America and a low 20% decline in Europe partially offset by a low single digit increase in Asia. Our e-commerce comparable sales contributed approximately 450 basis points to our performance in the quarter. 
Our results in North America continued to face pressure from declining traffic and our decision to reduce promotional activity in our lifestyle stores. This was partially offset by increased conversion rates in our stores and strong performance of our digital flagships, which achieved double-digit comparable sales growth in the quarter. 
The comparable sales decline in Europe was due to reduced store traffic and lower average unit retail, in addition to sales that migrated to the online channel following the launch of our European digital flagships in the fall of calendar 2016. While European digital flagships are not yet included in the comparable sales base, have they been included, European comparable sales would have been down in the mid-teens on a reported basis and down in the low-teens on a constant-currency basis. 
Asia comparable sales, which include Japan and Korea, grew in the low single digits on a reported basis and were flat on a constant-currency basis. 
In the Wholesale segment, net sales declined 22.8%. The wholesale in the Americas region declined 22.1% as we strategically reduced the amount of inventory we ship into that channel and reduced our authorized promotional periods to 4x per year. 
European wholesale net sales decreased 17.4%. As John explained earlier, we are strategically decreasing our sell-in, in this channel as we focus on ensuring long-term brand health. In Asia, the 56.9% decrease in net sales largely reflects the shift of our Greater China business to the Retail segment. 
In the Licensing segment, revenue decreased 6.2%. ACCESS smartwatches performed well during the quarter but did not offset the decline in fashion watches. We also saw strong results in eyewear. 
Gross margin was flat compared to last year at 58.2%. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we conformed our elimination of certain intercompany costs in Greater China region with our consolidated methodology. As recorded, retail gross margins declined 20 basis points and decreased 190 basis points, excluding the impact of this adjustment. As recorded, gross margin for our Wholesale segment decline 280 basis points and decreased 60 basis points, excluding the impact of this adjustment. This adjustment did not impact consolidated gross margin or have a material impact on previously recorded retail or wholesale gross margins. 
Total adjusted operating expense increased 710 basis points to 44.0% of total revenue. In addition to deleverage, the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our business in Greater China as well as investments in new stores, e-commerce, omnichannel capabilities, and infrastructure improvements. Adjusted income from operations was $151.2 million or 14.2% as a percentage of total revenue as compared to $255.0 million or 21.3% as a percentage of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
In the fourth quarter, retail and wholesale operating margins were impacted by the aforementioned gross margin adjustment for Greater China. Conforming the methodology did not impact consolidated operating income or have a material impact on the previously reported operating income by segment. 
Adjusted operating margin for our Retail segment declined 650 basis points to 6.8%, which includes the positive impact of the gross margin adjustment. Excluding this, operating margin declined 820 basis points to 5.1% as compared to 13.3% in the prior year period. This decrease was largely driven by continued investments in building our digital flagship platforms, retail store-related costs, and deleverage as well as the decrease in the gross margin I previously described. 
Fourth quarter wholesale operating margin declined 510 basis points to 22.1%, which includes the negative impact of the gross margin adjustment. Excluding this, wholesale operating margin decreased 290 basis points to 24.3% versus 27.2% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of the increase in operating expense as a percent of revenue. 
Licensing operating margin was 33.2% compared to 44.1% in the prior year period, largely as a result of deleverage. Adjusted net income was $118.0 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This compares to an adjusted net income of $184.8 million or $1.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $227.7 million. Inventory was relatively flat compared to last year, despite the increases from the inclusion of Greater China inventory of $51.8 million and the translation increase of $6.3 million caused by the increase euro on our European inventory. This compares to an 11.2% decrease in net sales or a decrease of 8.6%, excluding prior year's 53rd week of sales. Given our reduced promotional activity, we are planning for slower inventory turns in the future. Due to the slower turns, we project that inventory will incur a similar increase in inventory relative to net sales for fiscal 2018. 
Moving to capital allocation. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders, and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares totaling $250 million under our share repurchase program. This completed our most recent $1 billion authorization and on May 25, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion authorization. During fiscal 2017, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $17.1 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships, and other infrastructure improvements. 
During the quarter, we recorded a noncash payment charge of $193.8 million related to retail store and other long-lived assets in the fourth quarter. The [Audio Gap] of reduced revenue expectations for our store fleet based upon our review that overall traffic trends will remain under pressure as well as our decision to close between 100 and 125 stores over the next 2 years. We expect to record additional charges of approximately $100 million to $125 million of onetime cost related to the store closures over that time period. We ultimately anticipate annual savings of approximately $16 million as a result of store closures and the lower depreciation and amortization associated with the impairment charge. In fiscal 2018, we expect to close between 20 and 40 full-priced stores. 
The guidance we are providing today includes assumptions about the ongoing impact to revenue as well as to operating and D&A cost, but excludes any one-time costs associated with the store closures. For fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be approximately $4.25 billion. We expect to continue to tighten inventory control and reduce promotional activity in both the retail and wholesale channels. As a result, we anticipate that retail net sales will be roughly flat versus the prior year with comparable sales decreasing in the high single-digits range. We expect wholesale net sales to decline in the low-teens range and licensing revenue to be approximately flat. We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 60.0% for the full year. We expect gross margin improvement from the reduction in promotional days as well as favorable channel and geographic mix due to higher percent of revenue from the Retail segment and growth in Asia. This will be somewhat offset by the growth of lower-margin categories, including apparel and footwear. 
For the full year, we expect operating expenses as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 44.0%, largely due to deleverage on lower sales volumes. We expect D&A for the year to be between $210 million and $220 million, which includes a $35 million reduction in D&A as a result of impairment charges, partially offset by D&A that is beginning to roll in from capital projects that we undertook over the last several years. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 16.0%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.57 to $3.67. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 18% and 155 million weighted average shares outstanding. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million, and we will focus on renovating our retail store fleet, continuing to make investments in global digital strategies, and omnichannel capabilities. We also plan to open approximately 50 new stores primarily in the Asia region as well 77 shop-in-shops, most of which will be for our men's business. For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $910 million and $930 million and a high single digit decrease in comparable sales. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 60.5%. We expect operating expense as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 47.5% resulting in an operating margin of approximately 13.0%. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.64. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 19% and 160 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
In conclusion, we were disappointed in our financial performance in fiscal 2017 and are taking action to improve our long-term performance. We expect fiscal 2018 to be a year where we will reset our base and begin to execute on our strategic plan. Through these efforts, we expect improve our financial performance and return the company to long-term profitable growth. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

And as we've said, our #1 priority is to focus on really fashion innovation, which we were inspired by what we saw happen in the fourth quarter and in the third quarter as well by certain elements of newness that we started bringing into our accessories collection and also our women's ready-to-wear collection, which as you noted -- as we noted in the prepared remarks, was a very -- has been very strong for the company. So we know that the consumer is still -- are very engaged with our brand, and we know that when we deliver product that is exciting, compelling and innovative, she's responding. So we've seen that in a number of areas inside the company. So that's going to be our #1 focus. I would say, the #2 focus for us is really going to be our fleet optimization, both beginning the execution of closing the 100 to 125 stores and also of the development of our fleet modernization. Again, we look forward on June 9 to being able to give a much greater picture of how that will roll out over the next few years and what will that mean for the company's growth. But again, I want to just reiterate, we have incredibly strong brand and the consumer continues to resonate with it. But we've had some product misses, and I want to be very clear and say to you that we are facing that as a significant and important challenge for us as we go forward. And we're going to do that all amongst the backdrop of reducing promotional activity and next year is going to be significant. So that's really why we're anticipating that the comps will be down on the high single digit range. While, that again, is painful, it's the right thing to do for the brand and it's the right thing to signal to the customer that we're proud of the product that we're selling and we don't have put it on sale all the time to get her to purchase it. And again, as we said in the prepared remarks, 20% of our business in our lifestyle stores in the full price category came from products that weren't on sale one day during the promotional periods, not one day, so Mercer, Brook Lane and ACCESS were all regular priced and she brought it at regular priced. So we know there's an appetite for that. It's going to take a little bit of time to ease into do that, and so we're excited to continue that journey. In terms of the footprint of our, and again, we believe in our retail fleet. We think it's critical to our business. It's still going to be by far the majority of the company's revenues. And we think that the key to success there again, revolves around product and it revolves around the store environment and creating incitement. We hope that you all will get a chance to go out and visit [ Short Hills ], New Jersey where we just opened up about 1.5 weeks ago, the new concept that is in Regent Street, if you haven't been able to see Regent Street, you can now see it at Churchill, New Jersey, and we have a number of stores coming behind that and the initial results are absolutely outstanding. Now again, a few weeks doesn't make whole year or multiple seasons, but we're very pleased with what we see there. So what's happened is there's a number of stores in the fleet that, that are either going to -- they're either/or now unprofitable or going to turn unprofitable and that's a result of declining revenues and because of declining traffic in certain of the malls. We wouldn't call these the most high-profile locations, so we don't think it's going to do anything to the brand integrity by closing a number of these locations. And we know that it will increase the profitability of our fleet and also give us an opportunity to focus more time and energy on less stores. In terms of the wholesale footprint, the doors have declined somewhat and that's either predominantly by some of the retailers closing stores or handful of locations that we're finding unprofitable but there's no significant change on our part to reduce our exposure with our wholesale partners. We're very proud to be in business with them. They've been great partners with us. And now that we have, in North America, a promotional policy that we think protects the integrity of our brand, we're very comfortable with how our brand sits at retail and the way that the consumer is now seeing it presented to them both in terms of presentation and in terms of the way that it's handled from a pricing integrity standpoint."

Today, of the company-owned stores, outlet is approximately 25% of our fleet. Now that will go up slightly as a percentage because we're going to close 100 to 125 stores but remember we're also going to open 50 stores this year in Asia and they'll probably be equal that many the following year in the Asia region as we get to a more full distribution in that area. So it's going to be in that 25% to 30% range in terms of store count. So we still feel comfortable that, that's the right number for us, and again, keeping the integrity because again, our primary focus as a company is to sell full priced merchandise and present Michael Kors in the best and most appropriate exciting environment for our consumer. In terms of the store complexion, we're going to look at the proclivity and profitability of stores every single quarter. And if we think that more of the fleet is heading in the direction that will be unprofitable, then we will deal with that if that's the case. We think we've taken a fairly long-term view of what this is and I don't want to promise you that we would never come out say that we will close more stores. But we think this captures the general sense of the doors that have become, as I said, either unprofitable today or are moving in that direction. We still have a considerable amount of doors worldwide that are profitable and we view that as our most important efforts around returning those stores to a positive comp growth. We know that's not going to happen this year. But we have aspirations that we think that, that will come, in particular, led by the modernization and obviously, some of the park innovation we've talked about. The 100-store renovation, even though we've said that will happen over 24 months, now that could actually be accelerated, that's just probably more on the outside than what our intentions are. We intend on executing that as quickly as possible. And that's just going to be a matter of working with the developers where we can get temporary locations because obviously we would have to shut certain stores for a period of time, while we go through a complete renovation. So there's going to be a little bit of turmoil. And as you know, those stores will typically be impacted during that period of time when we relocate them to temporary locations. But our intention is quickly. And if the results are positive, which I would say it will probably take us about 12 months to report back to you, then our intent will be to, in particular, the full-price stores, we would go and renovate, all the full priced stores globally or the majority of them. And part of this is also natural. Many of our stores now are approaching in some cases, over 10 years old that haven't been touched in terms of renovation. So this is kind of needed almost regardless. The good news for us that we've held off until we found a concept that we felt was innovative, it'll create excitement for the consumers and also give us a unique position in terms of the marketplace. And we believe we found that now, and we feel really good about making that investment. So that's how we kind of look at the fleet and where we are going with it in the future. And I would lastly add that more of those renovations will happen in North America and to a lesser degree, in Europe and probably very few in Asia because most of the Asia fleet is brand-new, with the caveat that if we see significant lift, we would go back and look at that. But the majority of those renovations will happen in North America and then probably next will be Europe."

Matthew, we don't disclose the 2 pieces of information that you're asking about, which is how much went up the door sales versus regular price, et cetera and the purchase on that. The way we think about price laddering is twofold. First, we want -- what we do know is that our AUR has declined for 2 years consecutively. So we went for basically 12 years or more and AUR never moved. I think you know that for all the years of listening to us discuss it And we really -- after digging in and taking a little digging in, but we understood that, that was coming from promotional activity that we were either doing on our own or doing relative to matching competitors. So we feel that we can elevate our AUR by 10%, and it probably won't happen completely over this year. But that is our internal goal and we're going to do that by reducing the amount of days that we have on sale. And by the way, we are not only doing that in our regular promotional policy that you've, I think heard about, which addresses what we call our full-price sale, but also even in our markdown sales in our lifestyle stores. So we're going to be begin to reduce that cadence. You'll see the reduction both online and inside the stores, and we'll move more of that product onto our outlet stores to be cleared and to be handled through there. So that will help our AUR inside of our stores. And the second part of price laddering is our -- as we said in our prepared remarks, 20% of our sales came from items that were not put on sale at all. So there's a label that hangs on the product that indicates that, that product is excluded from the sales. And that really has had a tremendous impact on AUR, and we will introduce hopefully another new group into that range in spring season. And we will also begin to ladder up price points inside of our stores as well. So we're very excited about 2 different strategies. First, when we kind of reset the base, we had 5 groups out, we talked to you about at $298 range, and we did that specifically so that when we were on promotion less, she would walk in and find a great value for the product. Now we're going to really layer up our 350 -- our 400 and plus bags so that -- because there's less foot fall in the stores, we've got to be able to take the average transaction up. What we're also excited about is we're going to be a little more aggressive then we'll talk to you more about this at our Investor Day, with our collection label. We're launching a new group called Bancroft for the Fall season that and again, we've always sold collection bags in our stores but are going to actually take a more aggressive positioning around that part of our business, again, Michael is a runway designer. We have tremendous engagement with our customers around his runway collections. And we think that product offers us a unique opportunity to talk to the luxury and fashion customer. So the second part of that laddering be on the promotion is dealt around product and the price points in that product and how we're going to position that with the customer over the next 12 to 24 months."

So let me just -- I think there's an easier way for us to define it. We estimate that we will have approximately 40% less promotional days in our North American lifestyle retail stores this year versus last year in 2018, hence, the reason why we are anticipating the account sales to continue to decline. So that will be both on our full-price promotion and when you see additional percentages off on markdowns, so be approximately in that range, so it's quite significant in terms of reduction in days and events that will be held inside the stores. And again, what the best part about that is the full-price promotion, those are cadenced, and they will happen in the same time coordinated as what happening in the wholesale channel, and they think you saw that executed in the fourth quarter and I think our partners did a terrific job of doing that. And again, as we've said in the prepared remarks, they also saw AUR increases. So I think that the general feeling is that, that strategy is working in terms of getting a better handle around presenting a brand to the end consumer."

We think it's down slightly in North America, we think it's flattish in Europe, and we think it's up slightly in Asia. And actually, probably picking up in Asia even from the past trends, we see some good momentum there, not only from ourselves but some of our competitors. And as you know, in the Asia market, every call will have a different perspective on certain of the regions given the political turmoil that's happening there on any given day, whether things that happen in Korea or Japan or in China and how that all kind of intersects. I think again, many of our competitors also talk about that. So just understand that on the call, it may move around by region, but we think the region in total is quite healthy and actually, growing. I want to just give you as an overall perspective. I will talk about the watch business. As you know, the fashion watch business continues to be under pressure, although we are pleased with what is happening with the wearable technology and how the consumer is responding to wearable technology. Very clearly, Apple is the leader in that, and we hope to be a very, very significant player in that. And it's really doing some really good things for our own retail stores as well as our wholesale and specialty store partners around the world. And I have to take my hat off to [ Coasta ] and Fossil and everything that we're doing there, there really are putting us in a leadership position. And I also have to thank Google because they're doing just a tremendous jobs and really have a strong dedication to making these an important part of their ecosystem. So with that being said, the fashion watch business continues to decline. And, as you know, the Switch business is declining. So we think that's going to be continued headwind for us in the coming year. Again, watch still remain a significant part of our business. And until that category starts getting a little bit turned around, I think we have a concern and again, that's also baked into our down high single digit comp number. That all being said, and we're going to talk to you about this during Investor Day, we're a lifestyle brand. We're not a company that has to become a lifestyle brand. We've been a lifestyle brand. we're going to put a lot of emphasis on our women's ready-to-wear business, which we made it stand, and we said we're going to be one of the most important dress companies from a fashion standpoint, and that's paying off very, very nicely both in our own stores and our wholesale distributional as well. And we think we can take that a lot further than we've gone today. We think that our footwear assortments are great and again, it's another leadership area for us. So we'll be talking a little bit about rebalancing at our Investor Day and how -- while we know we've got -- under pressure in some of these other categories, we're going to have to kind of redirect some of our assets towards these other businesses. And we're in them, and we're good at that we think we can get better. As it relates to the laddering of product and innovation, look, Michael has been doing this for a long time. And he certainly, and the design teams, are very capable of creating innovation and fashion leadership. We know we've got a little bit behind, and we're very clearly stated it and are saying that it's a significant initiative inside the company. And unlike other companies, this is the man who took us to $4.5 billion and has been driving this company, and he still is deeply engaged and is leading our team with what we think are going to be incredible design concepts for the upcoming seasons. In our

detailing and marketing and we're going to use the power of that to help really launch and communicate those new products and innovations that we're going to be moving forward. On your second question around Amazon, Amazon is an incredible company and obviously, probably the most successful online player in the world. We have a relationship with them in watches and that's all we intend on going forward with currently. And again, they've been terrific partners and again, especially in the wearable technology area, they're a dominant player. And our focus is going to be on our own e-commerce businesses and as you know, we've made significant investments. We're up in 10 countries. We're adding a lot more countries as we go forward towards the back half of the year and we're going to really build out our CRM capabilities. So that will be our focus in terms of how we'll communicate to our customer digitally, primarily through our own online channels."

So I just want to remind everyone, there was no specific guidance provided in February. But that being said, we did indicate that we would have sales earnings increases in 2018, which now we are indicating is not going to be the case. So as we said in both our prepared remarks and some of the comments that I mentioned, we really made the decision after studying our store fleets and what we're going to do in terms of optimizing those presentations and profitability that we would take 2018 and kind of reset for us, and the resets are clearly, first off, closing unproductive, and unprofitable stores. Secondly, to modernize our store fleet. And as I've said, we're very happy about what we've seen happen in Regent Street, we're also very happy few weeks in but what we're seeing happen in our [ short hill ] store, so we're going to push forward with renovating 100 stores as quickly as possible. Hopefully, the majority of those will happen probably in the very back half of this year, but the time we can actually get to these stores. But we would like to get as many done as possible in this year. And then lastly, is really product innovation and pushing that forward much faster than we had. So taking that into account, along with the fact that we have decided to kind of even take a step further with our promotional stance and cadence inside of our lifestyle stores and reducing even on the percentage off, markdowns, that, that will impact our comp stores. So after you look at all that together, that brought us to the conclusion that between closing stores, between reducing our comp store expectations, that would lower our revenue expectations and unfortunately, that creates deleverage and that would lower our earnings per share expectations and our operating income expectations. But we do believe that there is growth and opportunity that lies ahead for us. And I look forward to speaking to each of you and seeing you during our Investor Day coming up on June 9.

As many of you know, last month, we announced that after 13 years with Michael Kors, Joe Parsons has decided to retire. On behalf of Michael, the board and the entire organization, I would like to thank Joe for the integral role he played in building Michael Kors into a leading global luxury fashion house. Joe and I have worked together for 20 years, and I would like to personally thank him for his leadership, partnership and friendship. I and the rest of the team wish him well in his retirement. 
On that note, I would also like to welcome Tom Edwards, our incoming Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer. Tom joined us from the Brinker International where he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Joe will continue in his current role through August 1, working with Tom to ensure a thorough and seamless transition. 
Moving now to our results. While the fourth quarter performance was largely in line with our expectations, fiscal 2017 was a difficult and disappointing year for us. The retail environment remains challenging. That being said, we must acknowledge that our company needs to take steps to accelerate the level of luxury fashion innovation in our accessories assortments and further enhance our store experience in order to better engage and excite consumers. We have developed a long-term strategic plan, which we have named [ Runway 2020 ] to address these and other areas. We believe the execution of this strategic plan and our leading luxury fashion brand, which is renowned for design innovation and fashion leadership will position us to return to long-term sustainable and profitable growth. 
Looking back on the year, we executed on a number of initiatives, which will lay the groundwork for our strategic plan. During fiscal 2017, we expanded our global revenues with the acquisition of our Greater China license. We continue to believe that this region, along with Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, will ultimately generate $1 billion in revenue for our company. We also launched digital flagships in Europe and Asia bringing the number of countries served to 11. And we began to take steps to protect our brand by reducing promotional activity in our digital flagships, lifestyle stores and wholesale doors. While we have seen a decrease in both retail and wholesale sales as a result of these changes, we believe this is the right action to protect our brand health long term. 
In addition, we undertook 5 specific initiatives, which I outlined for you on our last call. During the fourth quarter, we made good initial progress on these efforts. While it was not enough to meaningfully impact our results, we believe we are moving in the right direction by infusing more luxury detailing and fashion innovation in our product assortment. And this is being met with the favorable consumer reaction. For instance, Michael and our design team have been focused on creating more elevated and layered assortments. These fresh new design elements were represented in some of our best-selling styles in the fourth quarter. Our Mercer handbag collection, which saw strong sell-throughs globally reflected an array of bright spring colors and novelty detailing. The Brooklyn handbag collection saw strong response and was offered in several styles including novelty detailing like grommets and an oversized tassel. We also expanded the presence of our new Jet Set signature accessories capitalizing on current fashion trends. The collection features multiple layers composed of luxury fashion silhouettes and novelty details. The Jet Set signature group is an icon element of our brand and continues to resonate with consumers. 
We also increased our offering of mix-and-match products including the Selma Swap handbag, which allows consumers to purchase a reversible jacket to change the look of their bag, effectively creating 3 bags in one. In addition, we introduced interchangeable handbag straps, which featured enhanced styling such as floral embellishments, grommets and studs. 
Finally, we continued to focus on opportunities to engage and excite our customers through customization and saw continued positive response to our free monogramming services, which we offered in our digital flagships and select retail stores. Later this year, we will begin to offer monogramming enhancements including symbols, additional fonts and alternative placements. We will also debut a customized [ pin-it ] program. These perforated leather handbags, accessories and footwear will be uniquely styled by the consumer with a variety of pins including leathers, horoscope signs, symbols and more. 
In our footwear assortment, we continued to offer on-trend innovative product with consumers responding positively to exciting new details like the strong floral motif in our Heidi thong and Kit sandals as well as to pumps with our signature chain heel treatment. Active footwear sales continued to grow and our new floral perforated designs saw particularly strong response. 
In women's ready-to-wear, dresses were our best performing category in the quarter with high single-digit comparable sales growth. Our expanded dress assortment included innovative fashion detailing as well as seasonal colors and concepts. We are pleased with the favorable consumer response and we'll build on our momentum as we continue to grow this category. 
Turning to our men's business. We continued to grow this segment of our business in fiscal 2017 as our sportswear offerings resonated with the consumer and we saw strong response to our expanded offering in men's luxury leather goods. While this remains a small part of our overall business, we now have 41 stores as well as 261 shop-in-shops and see men's as an important category of growth going forward. As we've previously stated, we believe men's will ultimately grow to a $1 billion business. 
In our watch business, ACCESS smartwatches continued to be an outstanding success. This product line is expected to represent approximately 25% of our watch assortment in fiscal 2018 as we expand our offerings with exciting new styles, updated plating options and an increased selection of interchangeable straps, which enable consumers to customize their smartwatches with multiple looks. 
Finally, with respect to marketing. Michael's luxury fashion message remains a cornerstone of our communication with consumers. We continued to invest in both traditional and digital marketing channels. We're increasingly incorporating CRM activation in our digital marketing activities to drive traffic and conversion. We are using data on purchase history, interests and geography to align the creative in our messages to the most relevant audiences in order to more effectively connect with consumers, which, in turn, has helped drive traffic and conversion, in particular, in our digital flagships globally. 
Moving to our financial performance. For the full year 2017, we reported total revenue of $4.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.24. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $0.73. 
In the quarter, global retail net sales grew 0.5% and comparable sales decreased 14.1%. In the Americas, retail net sales decreased 13.8% and comparable sales decreased in the low teens. 
Our digital flagships continued to generate double-digit sales growth as consumers shift to online channel. However, retail comps remained under pressure by challenging traffic trends in the retail industry and the highly promotional environment. 
As we have previously discussed, beginning in February, we implemented a new promotional policy part of our effort to protect brand integrity and improve margins. Additionally, in our North American digital flagships and lifestyle stores, we offered our Mercer and Hamilton accessories collection as well as our ACCESS smartwatch collection on a nonpromotional basis. Those products generated approximately 20% of our digital flagship and lifestyle store full-price sales, which contributed to a low single-digit increase in full price AUR in the quarter. 
In Europe, retail net sales declined 15.4%. Comparable sales, which exclude e-commerce sales declined in the low 20s percent range on a reported basis and the high-teens range on a constant-currency basis. Including e-commerce sales on a constant-currency basis, European comparable sales results would have declined in the low teens range for the quarter. Similar to North America, we are taking steps in Europe to reduce promotional activities. We had 16 fewer brand-wide promotional days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 than in the same period last year. While this change negatively impacted store traffic, it was the right long-term decision. We also believe traffic was pressured by reduced consumer confidence and uncertainty in certain markets stemming from European elections and the formal triggering of Brexit. 
In Asia, retail net sales increased more than 200%, largely as a result of the shift in China sales to our company-owned retail segment. Asia comparable sales, which included Japan and Korea, grew in the low single digits on a reported basis and were flat on a constant-currency basis as Japan comparable sales continued to be impact by the decline in Chinese tourists. Asia comparable sales including the Greater China business grew in the mid-single digits or high single digits on a constant-currency basis. Overall, we remain pleased with our continued strong performance in the Asia region. 
Now I'd like to discuss our retail strategy. While we expect the digital channel to grow as a percent of sales, our stores will also continue to play an important role in increasing the company's revenue long term. Stores will continue to serve as the destination for consumers looking for experience of the Michael Kors brand firsthand, make luxury fashion purchases as well as to showcase our innovative designs and engage consumers through service and clientele-ing. In order to optimize our store base, we performed an in-depth analysis on our entire fleet. Based on the results of this evaluation, we plan to close between 100 and 125 lifestyle stores globally over the next 2 years. This will enable us to focus on the most productive locations as well as those that we believe are important in supporting our brand image. We will continue to selectively open new stores in key cities with the primary focus on expanding our presence in Asia. 
Another key element of our retail strategy is to modernize our stores around the world. Last spring, we opened our new flagship on Regent Street in London. The store features a palette of soft browns and grays that, mixed with the warm woods and luxury materials, captures our refined take on glamor while offering a modern and inviting environment in which to shop. The new store layout is built around a center runway opening on to luxurious rooms that  distinctly showcase our accessories, footwear, womenswear and menswear categories and allow our sales associates to provide consumers with a unique and elevated styling experience. We are pleased with the performance of our Regent Street store and plan to use this as our design concept for the future. 
Over the next 2 years, we plan to renovate approximately 100 locations with this new concept. We expect these enhancements will improve the productivity of our overall fleet by highlighting our footwear, women's ready-to-wear and men's areas, in addition to our accessories offering and look forward to providing you with updates as we continue with our fleet modernization efforts. 
Turning to our wholesale segment. Net sales declined 22.8% in the fourth quarter. The Americas declined 22.1% largely driven by reduced sell-in into the department store channel as well as our decision to reduce our authorized promotional periods to 4 times per year. As a result of this decision, we had 49 fewer promotional days in this quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year. This drove an increase in full-price AUR across our accessories, footwear, and menswear categories. While the decrease in promotional activity may cause a short-term reduction in sales, we are encouraged by the improvement in full-price AUR and remain confident that this is the right long-term decision for our brand. 
In Europe, net sales declined 17.4% in the quarter as the headwinds that impacted our retail stores also had a negative impact on our wholesale channel. As part of our continued focus on our brand health, we have thoughtfully and selectively begun to curtail shipments into this channel to reduce the end-of-season promotional inventory in wholesale accounts. 
In Asia, net sales decreased 56.9% primarily attributable to the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. 
Turning to our license segment. Revenues decreased 6.2% in the quarter with good performance from the new fashion watch styles, ACCESS smartwatches and eyewear, partially offsetting declines in other categories. We saw positive response to new luxury fashion watch styles, Portia and Cynthia, both of which feature our new slim and feminine design. We are also pleased with the continued sales growth of our ACCESS wearable technology assortment. As I stated earlier, we plan to expand this category and are excited about the 2 new ACCESS smartwatch styles Sofie and Grayson that were introduced at Baselworld in March. We plan to roll these new styles out to stores this fall. 
We are continuing to expand our leadership in the fashion wearable technology category with the introduction of My Social, a feature, which will enable users to link their Instagram account and set a personal post photo as a watch face. The app allows the user to scroll through their Instagram posts, select a favorite image and even apply filters, creating a watch face that's as personal as their life. As we expand this category through the new product introductions and technology innovations with our partner, Google, we believe our ACCESS wearable technology business can ultimately reach 50% of our overall watch sales. 
We are also pleased with the performance of our eyewear category in the quarter as consumers reacted favorably to new styles including Lon, a flat lens aviator, and Ina, an open-wire metal cat-eye. 
Lastly, we continued to be pleased with the fragrance category performance, particularly in Europe. We're excited to expand the category this fall with the global launch of a major new fragrance, Sexy Ruby, which will add another pillar to our successful fragrance business. 
Looking ahead, as we deepen the fashion innovation in our assortments, grow key product categories, rightsize our store fleet and elevate our store experience, fiscal 2018 will be a transition year in which we establish a new baseline before returning to long-term growth. We have a strong luxury brand led by Michael Kors with a history of fashion innovation and leadership, a global footprint with stores positioned in many of the best locations around the world and the marketing expertise to effectively convey our fashion stories. 
We will be hosting an Investor Day on June 9 at our company's New York headquarters where we will walk you through our [ Runway 2020 ] strategic growth plan. Members of the leadership team will be joining me to share the details of this plan, which builds on some of the recent initiatives I discussed today. Ultimately, [ Runway 2020 ] is designed to leverage our product innovation, elevated store experience, personalized shopping experience and global presence to drive long-term sales and profitability growth. I look forward to sharing more details on our future growth initiatives with you at our Investor Day. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe."

As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes approximately $34 million in sales associated with the 53rd week of that fiscal year. In the",1632,"Thank you, John. For the fourth quarter, total revenue was $1.1 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes approximately $34 million in sales associated with the 53rd week of that fiscal year. 
In the retail segment, net sales increased 0.5%, due primarily to the addition of 159 net new stores since the fourth quarter of last year including 111 stores associated with the recent acquisitions of the Greater China license. Comparable sales decreased 14.1%, reflecting a low teens decrease in North America and a low 20% decline in Europe partially offset by a low single digit increase in Asia. Our e-commerce comparable sales contributed approximately 450 basis points to our performance in the quarter. Our results in North America continued to face pressure from declining traffic and our decision to reduce promotional activity in our lifestyle stores. This was partially offset by increased conversion rates in our stores and strong performance of our digital flagships, which achieved double-digit comparable sales growth in the quarter. 
The comparable sales decline in Europe was due to reduced store traffic and lower average unit retail in addition to sales that migrated to the online channel following the launch of our European digital flagships in the fall of calendar 2016. While European digital flagships are not yet included in the comparable sales base, had they been included, European comparable sales would have been down in the mid-teens on a reported basis and down in the low teens on a constant-currency basis. 
Asia comparable sales, which include Japan and Korea, grew in the low single digits on a reported basis and were flat on a constant-currency basis. 
In the wholesale segment, net sales declined 22.8%. The wholesale in the Americas region declined 22.1% as we strategically reduced the amount of inventory we ship into that channel and reduced our authorized promotional periods to 4 times per year. 
European wholesale net sales decreased 17.4%. As John explained earlier, we are strategically decreasing our sell-in, in this channel as we focus on ensuring long-term brand health. 
In Asia, the 56.9% decrease in net sales largely reflects the shift of our Greater China business to the retail segment. 
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 6.2%. ACCESS smartwatches performed well during the quarter, but did not offset the decline in fashion watches. We also saw strong results in eyewear. 
Gross margin was flat compared to last year at 58.2%. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we conformed our elimination of certain intercompany costs in Greater China region with our consolidated methodology. As recorded, retail gross margins declined 20 basis points and decreased 190 basis points excluding the impact of this adjustment. As recorded, gross margin for our wholesale segment declined 280 basis points and decreased 60 basis points excluding the impact of this adjustment. This adjustment did not impact consolidated gross margin or have a material impact on previously recorded retail or wholesale gross margins. 
Total adjusted operating expense increased 710 basis points to 44.0% of total revenue. In addition to deleverage, the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our business in Greater China as well as investments in new stores, e-commerce, omnichannel capabilities and infrastructure improvements. 
Adjusted income from operations was $151.2 million or 14.2% as a percentage of total revenue as compared to $255.0 million or 21.3% as a percentage of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
In the fourth quarter, retail and wholesale operating margins were impacted by the aforementioned gross margin adjustment for Greater China. Conforming the methodology did not impact consolidated operating income or have a material impact on the previously reported operating income by segment. 
Adjusted operating margin for our retail segment declined 650 basis points to 6.8%, which includes the positive impact of the gross margin adjustment. Excluding this, operating margin declined 820 basis points to 5.1% as compared to 13.3% in the prior year period. This decrease was largely driven by continued investments in building our digital flagship platforms, retail store-related costs and deleverage as well as the decrease in the gross margin I previously described. 
Fourth quarter wholesale operating margin declined 510 basis points to 22.1%, which includes the negative impact of the gross margin adjustment. Excluding this, wholesale operating margin decreased 290 basis points to 24.3% versus 27.2% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of the increase in operating expense as a percent of revenue. 
Licensing operating margin was 33.2% compared to 44.1% in the prior year period, largely as a result of deleverage. Adjusted net income was $118.0 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This compares to an adjusted net income of $184.8 million or $1.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
We ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $227.7 million. 
Inventory was relatively flat compared to last year despite the increases from the inclusion of Greater China inventory of $51.8 million and the translation increase of $6.3 million caused by the increased euro on our European inventory. This compares to an 11.2% decrease in net sales or a decrease of 8.6% excluding prior year's 53rd week of sales. Given our reduced promotional activity, we are planning for slower inventory turns in the future. Due to the slower turns, we project that inventory will incur a similar increase in inventory relative to net sales for fiscal 2018. 
Moving to capital allocation. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders, and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares totaling $250 million under our share repurchase program. This completed our most recent $1 billion authorization, and on May 25, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion authorization. 
During fiscal 2017, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $17.1 million and were related to the build-out of new retail shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. 
During the quarter, we recorded a noncash payment charge of $193.8 million related to retail store and other long-lived assets in the fourth quarter. The charge came primarily as a result of reduced revenue expectations for our store fleet based upon our review that overall traffic trends will remain under pressure as well as our decision to close between 100 and 125 stores over the next 2 years. 
We expect to record additional charges of approximately $100 million to $125 million of onetime costs related to the store closures over that time period. We ultimately anticipate annual savings of approximately $60 million as a result of store closures and the lower depreciation and amortization associated with the impairment charge. In fiscal 2018, we expect to close between 20 and 40 full-price stores. 
The guidance we are providing today includes assumptions about the ongoing impact to revenue as well as to operating and D&A costs, but excludes any onetime costs associated with the store closures. For fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be approximately $4.25 billion. We expect to continue to tighten inventory control and reduce promotional activity in both the retail and wholesale channels. As a result, we anticipate that retail net sales will be roughly flat versus the prior year with comparable sales decreasing in the high single-digits range. We expect wholesale net sales to decline in the low teens range and licensing revenue to be approximately flat. We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 60.0% for the full year. We expect gross margin improvement from the reduction in promotional days as well as favorable channel and geographic mix due to higher percent of revenue from the retail segment and growth in Asia. This will be somewhat offset by the growth of lower-margin categories including apparel and footwear. 
For the full year, we expect operating expenses as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 44.0%, largely due to deleverage on lower sales volumes. We expect D&A for the year to be between $210 million and $220 million, which includes a $35 million reduction in D&A as a result of impairment charges, partially offset by D&A that is beginning to roll in from capital projects that we undertook over the last several years. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 16.0%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.57 to $3.67. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 18% and 155 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million, and we will focus on renovating our retail store fleet, continuing to make investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities. We also plan to open approximately 50 new stores primarily in the Asia region as well as 77 shop-in-shops, most of which will be for our men's business. 
For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $910 million and $930 million and a high single-digit decrease in comparable sales. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 60.5%. 
We expect operating expense as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 47.5% resulting in an operating margin of approximately 13.0%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.64. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 19% and 160 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
In conclusion, we were disappointed in our financial performance in fiscal 2017 and are taking action to improve our long-term performance. We expect fiscal 2018 to be a year where we will reset our base and begin to execute on our strategic plan. Through these efforts, we expect to improve our financial performance and return the company to long-term profitable growth. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

So we know that the consumer is still very engaged with our brand, and we know that when we deliver product that is exciting, compelling and innovative, she's responding. So we've seen that in a number of areas inside the company. So that's going to be our number one focus. I would say the number two focus for us is really going to be our fleet optimization, both beginning the execution of closing the 100 to 125 stores and also of the development of our fleet modernization. Again, we look forward on June 9 to being able to give a much greater picture of how that will roll out over the next few years and what will that mean for the company's growth. But again, I want to just reiterate we have an incredibly strong brand and the consumer continues to resonate with it. But we've had some product misses, and I want to be very clear and say to you that we are facing that as a significant and important challenge for us as we go forward. And we're going to do that all amongst the backdrop of reducing promotional activity and next year is going to be significant. So that's really why we're anticipating that the comps will be down on the high single-digit range. While, that again, is painful, it's the right thing to do for the brand and it's the right thing to do to signal to the customer that we're proud of the product that we're selling and we don't have put it on sale all the time to get her to purchase it. And again, as we said in the prepared remarks, 20% of our business in our lifestyle stores -- in the full-price category came from products that weren't on sale one day during the promotional periods, not one day, so Mercer, Brooklyn and ACCESS were all regular priced and she brought it at regular price. So we know there's an appetite for that. It's going to take us a little bit of time to ease into that and so we're excited to continue that journey. In terms of the footprint, Omar, and again, we believe in our retail fleet. We think it's critical to our business. It's still going to be, by far, the majority of the company's revenues and we think that the key to success there, again, revolves around product and it revolves around the store environment and creating excitement. We hope that you all will get a chance to go out and visit Short Hills, New Jersey where we've just opened up about 1.5 weeks ago the new concept that is in Regent Street. If you haven't been able to see it in Regent Street, you can now see it in Short Hills, New Jersey and we have a number of stores coming behind that. And the initial results are absolutely outstanding. Now again, a few weeks doesn't make whole year or multiple seasons, but we're very pleased with what we see there. So what's happened is, is there's a number of stores in the fleet that are either going to -- they either are now unprofitable or going to turn unprofitable and that's a result of declining revenues and because of declining traffic in certain of the malls. We wouldn't call these the most high-profile locations, so we don't think it's going to do anything to the brand integrity by closing a number of these locations. And we know that it will increase the profitability of our fleet and also give us an opportunity to focus more time and energy on less doors. In terms of the wholesale footprint, the doors have declined somewhat and that's either predominantly by some of the retailers closing stores or handful of locations that we're finding unprofitable, but there is no significant change on our part to reduce our exposure with our wholesale partners. We're very proud to be in business with them. They've been great partners with us. And now that we have, in North America, a promotional policy that we think protects the integrity of our brand, we're very comfortable with how our brand sits at retail and the way that the consumer is now seeing it presented to them both in terms of presentation and in terms of the way that it's handled from a pricing integrity standpoint."

Now that'll go up slightly as a percentage because we're going to close 100 to 125 stores, but remember we're also going",659,"Kimberly, let me start with the store fleet complexion. Today, of the company-owned stores, outlet is approximately 25% of our fleet. Now that'll go up slightly as a percentage because we're going to close 100 to 125 stores, but remember we're also going to open 50 stores this year in Asia and they'll probably be equal that many the following year in the Asia region as we get to a more full distribution in that area. So it's going to be in that 25% to 30% range in terms of store count. So we still feel comfortable that, that's the right number for us, and again, keeping the integrity because, again, our primary focus as a company is to sell full-price merchandise and present Michael Kors in the best and most appropriate exciting environment for our consumer. In terms of the store complexion, we're going to look at the productivity and profitability of stores every single quarter. And if we think that more of the fleet is heading in the direction that will be unprofitable, then we will deal with that if that's the case. We think we've taken a fairly long-term view of what this is and I don't want to promise you that we would never come out say that we will close more stores. But we think this captures the general sense of the doors that have become, as I said, either unprofitable today or are moving in that direction. We still have a considerable amount of doors worldwide that are profitable and we view that as our most important efforts around returning those stores to a positive comp growth. We know that's not going to happen this year. But we have aspirations that we think that, that will come, in particular, led by the modernization and obviously some of the product innovation we've talked about. The 100-store renovation, even though we've said that will happen over 24 months, that could actually be accelerated, that's just probably more on the outside than what our intentions are. We intend on executing that as quickly as possible and that's just going to be a matter of working with the developers where we can get temporary locations because obviously we have to shut certain stores for a period of time while we go through a complete renovation. So there's going to be a little bit of turmoil. And as you know, those stores will typically be impacted during that period of time when we relocate them to temporary locations. So -- but our intention is to do that quickly, and if the results are positive, which I would say it will probably take us about 12 months to report back to you, then our intent would be to, in particular, the full-price stores, we would go and renovate all the full-price stores globally or the majority of them. And part of this is also natural. Many of our stores now are approaching, in some cases, over 10 years old that haven't been touched in terms of renovation. So this is kind of needed almost regardless. The good news for us is we've held off until we found a concept that we thought was innovative, it would create excitement for the consumers and also give us a unique position in terms of the marketplace and we believe we found that now and we feel really good about making that investment. So that's how we kind of look at the fleet and where we're going with it in the future. And I would lastly add that more of those renovations will happen in North America, and to a lesser degree, in Europe and probably very few in Asia because most of the Asia fleet is brand-new with the caveat that if we see significant lift, we would go back and look at that. But the majority of those renovations will happen in North America and then probably next will be Europe."

So we feel that we can elevate our AUR by 10% and it probably won't happen completely over this year, but that is our internal goal and we're going to do that by reducing the amount of days that we have on sale. And by the way, we are not only doing that in our regular promotional policy that you've, I think, heard about, which addresses what we call our full-price sales, but also even in our markdown sales in our lifestyle stores. So we're going to be begin to reduce that cadence, you'll see the reduction both online and inside the stores. And we'll move more of that product to our outlet stores to be cleared and to be handled through there. So that will help our AUR inside of our stores. And the second part of price laddering is our -- as we said in our prepared remarks, 20% of our sales came from items that were not put on sale at all. So there's a label that hangs on the product that indicates that, that product is excluded from the sales and that really has had a tremendous impact on AUR, and we will introduce hopefully another new group into that range in spring season. And we will also begin to ladder up price points inside of our stores as well. So we're very excited about 2 different strategies. First, when we kind of reset the base, we had 5 groups out we talked to you about that were at the $298 range and we did that specifically so that when we were on promotion less, she would walk in and find a great value for the product. Now we're going to really layer up our $350 -- our $400-and-plus bags so that -- because there's less footfall in the stores, we've got to be able to take the average transaction up. What we're also excited about is we're going to be a little more aggressive, and we'll talk to you more about this at our Investor Day, with our Collection label. We're launching a new group called Bancroft for the fall season that -- and again, we've always sold Collection bags in our stores, but we're going to actually take a more aggressive positioning around that part of our business. Again, Michael is a runway designer. We have tremendous engagement with our customers around his runway collections. And we think that product offers us a unique opportunity to talk to the luxury and fashion customer. So the second part of the laddering be on the promotion is really dealt around product and the price points in that product and how we're going to position that with the customer over the next 12 to 24 months."

Let me just -- I think there's an easier way for us to define it. We estimate that we will have approximately 40% less promotional days in our North American lifestyle retail stores this year versus last year in 2018, hence, the reason why we are anticipating the comp store sales to continue to decline. So that would be both on our full-price promotion and on when you see additional percentages off on markdowns. So it'd be approximately in that range, so it's quite significant in terms of reduction in days and events that will be held inside the stores. And again, what the best part about it is, is on the full -- what we refer to as the full-price promotions, those are cadenced and they will happen at the same time coordinated as what's happening in the wholesale channel, and I think you saw that executed in the fourth quarter and I think our partners did a terrific job of doing that. And again, as we've said in the prepared remarks, they also saw AUR increases. So I think the general feeling is that, that strategy is working in terms of getting a better handle around presenting the brand to the end consumer."

So in terms of the product portfolio, our view is that the global accessories market, handbags and small leather goods, is roughly flat. We think it's down slightly in North America, we think it's flattish in Europe and we think it's up slightly in Asia and actually probably ticking up in Asia. Even from its past trends, we see some good momentum there, not only from ourselves, but from some of our competitors. And as you know, in the Asia market, every call will have a different perspective on certain of the regions given the political turmoil that's happening there on any given day, whether it's things that happen in Korea or Japan or in China and how that all kind of intersects. Again, I think many of our competitors also talk about that. So just understand that on the call, it may move around by region, but we think the region in total is quite healthy and actually growing. I want to just give you that as an overall perspective. I want to talk about the watch business. As you know, the fashion watch business continues to be under pressure, although we are pleased with what is happening with the wearable technology and how the consumer is responding to wearable technology. Very clearly, Apple is the leader in that and we hope to be a very, very significant player in that and it's really doing some really good things for our own retail stores as well as our wholesale and specialty store partners around the world. And I have to take my hat off to Kosta and Fossil and everything that they're doing there that really are putting us in a leadership position. And I also have to thank Google because they're doing just a tremendous job and really have a strong dedication to making this an important part of their ecosystem. So with that being said, the fashion watch business continues to decline, and as you know, the Swiss business is declining. So we think that's going to be continued headwind for us in the coming year. Again, watches still remain a significant part of our business and until that category starts getting a little bit turned around, I think we have a concern, and again, that's also baked into our down high single-digit comp number. That all being said, and we're going to talk to you about this during Investor Day, we're a lifestyle brand. We're not a company that has to become a lifestyle brand, we've been a lifestyle brand. So we are going to put a lot more emphasis on our women's ready-to-wear business, which we made a stance and said that we're going to be one of the most important dress companies from a fashion standpoint and that's paying off very, very nicely both in our own stores and in our wholesale distributional as well and we think we can take that a lot further than we've gone today. We think that our footwear assortments are great, and again, it's another leadership area for us. So we'll be talking a little bit about rebalancing at our Investor Day and how -- while we know we've got -- we're under pressure in some of these other categories, we're going to have to kind of redirect some of our assets towards these other businesses. And we're in them and we're relatively good at them and we think we can get better. As it relates to the laddering of product and innovation, look, Michael has been doing this for a long time and he certainly and the design teams are very capable of creating innovation and fashion leadership. We know we've got a little bit behind and we've very clearly stated it and are saying that it's a significant initiative inside the company. And unlike other companies, this is the man who took us to $4.5 billion and has been driving this company and he still is deeply engaged and is leading our team with what we think are going to be incredible design concepts for the upcoming seasons. In our

retailing and marketing and we're going to use the power of that to help really launch and communicate those new products and innovations that we're going to be moving forward. On your second question around Amazon, Amazon is an incredible company and obviously probably the most successful online player in the world. We have a relationship with them in watches and that's all we intend on going forward with currently. And again, they've been terrific partners, and again, especially in the wearable technology area, they are a dominant player. And our focus is going to be on our own e-commerce businesses, and as you know, we've made significant investments. We're up in 10 countries. We're adding a lot more countries as we go forward towards the back half of the year and we're going to really build out our CRM capabilities. So that'll be our focus in terms of how we'll communicate to our customer digitally, primarily through our own online channels."

So I just want to remind everyone, there was no specific guidance provided in February. But that being said, we did indicate that we would have sales earnings increases in 2018, which now we are indicating is not going to be the case. So as we said in both our prepared remarks and some of the comments that I mentioned, we really made the decision after studying our store fleets and what we are going to do in terms of optimizing those presentations and profitability that we would take 2018 and kind of reset for us. And the resets are, clearly, first off, closing unproductive and unprofitable stores. Secondly, to modernize our store fleet, and as I said, we're very happy about what we've seen happen in Regent Street. We're also very happy, again, only few weeks in, but what we're seeing happen in our Short Hills store and -- so we're going to push forward with renovating 100 stores as quickly as possible. Hopefully, the majority of those will happen probably in the very back half of this year by the time we can actually get to these doors. But we would like to get as many done as possible in this year. And then, lastly, is really product innovation and pushing that forward much faster than we had. So taking that into account, along with the fact that we have decided to kind of even take a step further with our promotional stance and cadence inside of our lifestyle stores and reducing even on the percentage off and markdowns, that, that will impact our comp stores. So after you look at all of that together, that brought us to the conclusion that between closing stores, between reducing our comp store expectations, that would lower our revenue expectations and unfortunately that creates deleverage and that would lower our earnings per share expectations and our operating income expectations. But we do believe that there is growth and opportunity that lies ahead for us, and I look forward to speaking to each of you and seeing you during our Investor Day coming up on June 9. 
On that, I'll say thank you for joining us today on our conference call and look forward to seeing you shortly. Thank you."

Good morning, and welcome to Michael Kors' Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Call. 
As many of you know, last month, we announced that after 13 years with Michael Kors, Joe Parsons has decided to retire. On behalf of Michael, the board and the entire organization, I would like to thank Joe for the integral role he played in building Michael Kors into a leading global luxury fashion house. Joe and I have worked together for 20 years, and I would like to personally thank him for his leadership, partnership and friendship. I and the rest of the team wish him well in his retirement. 
On that note, I would also like to welcome Tom Edwards, our incoming Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer. Tom joined us from the Brinker International where he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Prior to that, he held a number of positions at Wyndham Worldwide including Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Wyndham Hotel Group and he has held a number of leadership positions at Kraft Foods and Nabisco. 
Tom has strong financial and operating experience across a diverse set of consumer-facing industries, and we are thrilled to have him join the team. Joe will continue in his current role through August 1, working with Tom to ensure a thorough and seamless transition. 
Moving now to our results. While the fourth quarter performance was largely in line with our expectations, fiscal 2017 was a difficult and disappointing year for us. The retail environment remains challenging. That being said, we must acknowledge that our company needs to take steps to accelerate the level of luxury fashion innovation in our accessories assortments and further enhance our store experience in order to better engage and excite consumers. 
We have developed a long-term strategic plan, which we have named Runway 2020 to address these and other areas. We believe the execution of this strategic plan and our leading luxury fashion brand, which is renowned for design innovation and fashion leadership, will position us to return to long-term sustainable and profitable growth. 
Looking back on the year, we executed on a number of initiatives, which will lay the groundwork for our strategic plan. During fiscal 2017, we expanded our global revenues with the acquisition of our Greater China license. We continue to believe that this region, along with Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, will ultimately generate $1 billion in revenue for our company. 
We also launched digital flagships in Europe and Asia, bringing the number of countries served to 11. And we began to take steps to protect our brand by reducing promotional activity in our digital flagships, Lifestyle stores and wholesale doors. While we have seen a decrease in both retail and wholesale sales as a result of these changes, we believe this is the right action to protect our brand health long term. 
In addition, we undertook 5 specific initiatives, which I outlined for you on our last call. During the fourth quarter, we made good initial progress on these efforts. While it was not enough to meaningfully impact our results, we believe we are moving in the right direction by infusing more luxury detailing and fashion innovation in our product assortment. And this is being met with favorable consumer reaction. 
For instance, Michael and our design team have been focused on creating more elevated and layered assortments. These fresh new design elements were represented in some of our best-selling styles in the fourth quarter. Our Mercer handbag collection, which saw strong sell-throughs globally, reflected an array of bright spring colors and novelty detailing. The Brooklyn handbag collection saw strong response and was offered in several styles, including novelty detailing like grommets and an oversized tassel. 
We also expanded the presence of our new Jet Set signature accessories capitalizing on current fashion trends. The collection features multiple layers composed of luxury fashion silhouettes and novelty details. The Jet Set signature group is an icon element of our brand and continues to resonate with consumers. 
We also increased our offering of mix-and-match products, including the Selma Swap handbag, which allows consumers to purchase a reversible jacket to change the look of their bag, effectively creating 3 bags in one. In addition, we introduced interchangeable handbag straps, which featured enhanced styling, such as floral embellishments, grommets and studs. 
Finally, we continued to focus on opportunities to engage and excite our customers through customization and saw continued positive response to our free monogramming services, which we offered in our digital flagships and select retail stores. Later this year, we will begin to offer monogramming enhancements, including symbols, additional fonts and alternative placements. We will also debut a customized [ pin-it ] program. These perforated leather handbags, accessories and footwear will be uniquely styled by the consumer with a variety of pins, including letters, horoscope signs, symbols and more. 
In our footwear assortment, we continued to offer on-trend innovative product with consumers responding positively to exciting new details like the strong floral motif in our Heidi thong and Kit sandal as well as to pumps with our signature chain heel treatment. Active footwear sales continued to grow, and our new floral perforated designs saw particularly strong response. 
In women's ready-to-wear, dresses were our best-performing category in the quarter with high single-digit comparable sales growth. Our expanded dress assortment included innovative fashion detailing as well as seasonal colors and concepts. We are pleased with the favorable consumer response, and we'll build on our momentum as we continue to grow this category. 
Turning to our men's business. We continued to grow this segment of our business in fiscal 2017 as our sportswear offerings resonated with the consumer and we saw strong response to our expanded offering in men's luxury leather goods. While this remains a small part of our overall business, we now have 41 stores as well as 261 shop-in-shops and see men's as an important category of growth going forward. As we've previously stated, we believe men's will ultimately grow to a $1 billion business. 
In our watch business, ACCESS smartwatches continue to be an outstanding success. This product line is expected to represent approximately 25% of our watch assortment in fiscal 2018 as we expand our offerings with exciting new styles, updated plating options and an increased selection of interchangeable straps, which enable consumers to customize their smartwatches with multiple looks.   
Finally, with respect to marketing, Michael's luxury fashion message remains a cornerstone of our communication with consumers. We continue to invest in both traditional and digital marketing channels. We're increasingly incorporating CRM activation in our digital marketing activities to drive traffic and conversion. We are using data on purchase history, interests and geography to align the creative in our messages to the most relevant audiences in order to more effectively connect with consumers, which, in turn, has helped drive traffic and conversion, in particular, in our digital flagships globally. 
Moving to our financial performance. For the full year 2017, we reported total revenue of $4.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.24. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $0.73. 
In the quarter, global retail net sales grew 0.5% and comparable sales decreased 14.1%. In the Americas, retail net sales decreased 13.8% and comparable sales decreased in the low teens. 
Our digital flagships continued to generate double-digit sales growth as consumers shift to online channel. However, retail comps remained under pressure by challenging traffic trends in the retail industry and the highly promotional environment. 
As we have previously discussed, beginning in February, we implemented a new promotional policy as part of our effort to protect brand integrity and improve margins. Additionally, in our North American digital flagships and lifestyle stores, we offered our Mercer and Hamilton accessories collection as well as our ACCESS smartwatch collection on a nonpromotional basis. Those products generated approximately 20% of our digital flagship and lifestyle store full-price sales, which contributed to a low single-digit increase in full-price AUR in the quarter. 
In Europe, retail net sales declined 15.4%. Comparable sales, which exclude e-commerce sales declined in the low 20s percent range on a reported basis and the high-teens range on a constant-currency basis. Including e-commerce sales on a constant-currency basis, European comparable sales results would have declined in the low teens range for the quarter. 
Similar to North America, we are taking steps in Europe to reduce promotional activities. We had 16 fewer brand-wide promotional days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 than in the same period last year. While this change negatively impacted store traffic, it was the right long-term decision. We also believe traffic was pressured by reduced consumer confidence and uncertainty in certain markets stemming from European elections and the formal triggering of Brexit. 
In Asia, retail net sales increased more than 200%, largely as a result of the shift in China sales to our company-owned retail segment. Asia comparable sales, which included Japan and Korea, grew in the low single digits on a reported basis and were flat on a constant-currency basis as Japan comparable sales continue to be impact by the decline in Chinese tourists. Asia comparable sales, including the Greater China business, grew in the mid-single digits or high single digits on a constant-currency basis. Overall, we remain pleased with our continued strong performance in the Asia region. 
Now I'd like to discuss our retail strategy. While we expect the digital channel to grow as a percent of sales, our stores will also continue to play an important role in increasing the company's revenue long term. Stores will continue to serve as the destination for consumers looking for experience of the Michael Kors brand firsthand, make luxury fashion purchases as well as to showcase our innovative designs and engage consumers through service and clientele-ing. 
In order to optimize our store base, we performed an in-depth analysis on our entire fleet. Based on the results of this evaluation, we plan to close between 100 and 125 Lifestyle stores globally over the next 2 years. This will enable us to focus on the most productive locations as well as those that we believe are important in supporting our brand image. We will continue to selectively open new stores in key cities with a primary focus on expanding our presence in Asia. 
Another key element of our retail strategy is to modernize our stores around the world. Last spring, we opened our new flagship on Regent Street in London. The store features a palette of soft browns and grays that, mixed with the warm woods and luxury materials, captures our refined take on glamor while offering a modern and inviting environment in which to shop. The new store layout is built around a center runway opening on to luxurious rooms that  distinctly showcase our accessories, footwear, womenswear and menswear categories and allow our sales associates to provide consumers with a unique and elevated styling experience. We are pleased with the performance of our Regent Street store and plan to use this as our design concept for the future. 
Over the next 2 years, we plan to renovate approximately 100 locations with this new concept. We expect these enhancements will improve the productivity of our overall fleet by highlighting our footwear, women's ready-to-wear and men's areas, in addition to our accessories offering and look forward to providing you with updates as we continue with our fleet modernization efforts. 
Turning to our wholesale segment. Net sales declined 22.8% in the fourth quarter. The Americas declined 22.1% largely driven by reduced sell-in into the department store channel as well as our decision to reduce our authorized promotional periods to 4 times per year. 
As a result of this decision, we had 49 fewer promotional days in this quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year. This drove an increase in full-price AUR across our accessories, footwear and menswear categories. While the decrease in promotional activity may cause a short-term reduction in sales, we're encouraged by the improvement in full-price AUR and remain confident that this is the right long-term decision for our brand. 
In Europe, net sales declined 17.4% in the quarter as the headwinds that impacted our retail stores also had a negative impact on our wholesale channel. As part of our continued focus on our brand health, we have thoughtfully and selectively begun to curtail shipments into this channel to reduce the end-of-season promotional inventory in wholesale accounts. In Asia, net sales decreased 56.9% primarily attributable to the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. 
Turning to our license segment. Revenues decreased 6.2% in the quarter with good performance from the new fashion watch styles, ACCESS smartwatches and eyewear partially offsetting declines in other categories. We saw positive response to new luxury fashion watch styles Portia and Cynthia, both of which feature our new slim and feminine design. We're also pleased with the continued sales growth of our ACCESS wearable technology assortment. As I stated earlier, we plan to expand this category and are excited about the 2 new ACCESS smartwatch styles Sofie and Grayson that were introduced at Baselworld in March. We plan to roll these new styles out to stores this fall. 
We are continuing to expand our leadership in the fashion wearable technology category with the introduction of My Social, a feature which will enable users to link their Instagram account and set a personal post photo as a watch face. The app allows the user to scroll through their Instagram posts, select a favorite image and even apply filters, creating a watch face that's as personal as their life. As we expand this category through the new product introductions and technology innovations with our partner, Google, we believe our ACCESS wearable technology business can ultimately reach 50% of our overall watch sales. 
We're also pleased with the performance of our eyewear category in the quarter as consumers reacted favorably to new styles, including Lon, a flat lens aviator, and Ina, an open-wire metal cat-eye. 
Lastly, we continued to be pleased with the fragrance category performance, particularly in Europe. We're excited to expand the category this fall with the global launch of a major new fragrance, Sexy Ruby, which will add another pillar to our successful fragrance business. 
Looking ahead, as we deepen the fashion innovation in our assortments, grow key product categories, rightsize our store fleet and elevate our store experience, fiscal 2018 will be a transition year in which we establish a new baseline before returning to long-term growth. We have a strong luxury brand led by Michael Kors with a history of fashion innovation and leadership, a global footprint with stores positioned in many of the best locations around the world and the marketing expertise to effectively convey our fashion stories. 
We'll be hosting an Investor Day on June 9 at our company's New York headquarters where we will walk you through our Runway 2020 strategic growth plan. Members of the leadership team will be joining me to share the details of this plan, which builds on some of the recent initiatives I discussed today. Ultimately, Runway 2020 is designed to leverage our product innovation, elevated store experience, personalized shopping experience and global presence to drive long-term sales and profitability growth. I look forward to sharing more details on our future growth initiatives with you at our Investor Day. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe."
143971118,430398723,1217978,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, May 31, 2017",2017-05-31,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John. For the fourth quarter, total revenue was $1.1 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes approximately $34 million in sales associated with the 53rd week of that fiscal year. In the",1629,"Thank you, John. For the fourth quarter, total revenue was $1.1 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes approximately $34 million in sales associated with the 53rd week of that fiscal year. 
In the retail segment, net sales increased 0.5% due primarily to the addition of 159 net new stores since the fourth quarter of last year, including 111 stores associated with the recent acquisition of the Greater China license. Comparable sales decreased 14.1%, reflecting a low teens decrease in North America and a low 20% decline in Europe partially offset by a low single-digit increase in Asia. Our e-commerce comparable sales contributed approximately 450 basis points to our performance in the quarter. 
Our results in North America continued to face pressure from declining traffic and our decision to reduce promotional activity in our Lifestyle stores. This was partially offset by increased conversion rates in our stores and strong performance of our digital flagships, which achieved double-digit comparable sales growth in the quarter. 
The comparable sales decline in Europe was due to reduced store traffic and lower average unit retail in addition to sales that migrated to the online channel following the launch of our European digital flagships in the fall of calendar 2016. While European digital flagships are not yet included in the comparable sales base, had they been included, European comparable sales would have been down in the mid-teens on a reported basis and down in the low teens on a constant-currency basis. Asia comparable sales, which include Japan and Korea, grew in the low single digits on a reported basis and were flat on a constant-currency basis. 
In the wholesale segment, net sales declined 22.8%. The wholesale in the Americas region declined 22.1% as we strategically reduced the amount of inventory we ship into that channel and reduced our authorized promotional periods to 4 times per year. European wholesale net sales decreased 17.4%. As John explained earlier, we are strategically decreasing our sell-in in this channel as we focus on ensuring long-term brand health. In Asia, the 56.9% decrease in net sales largely reflects the shift of our Greater China business to the retail segment. 
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 6.2%. ACCESS smartwatches performed well during the quarter but did not offset the decline in fashion watches. We also saw strong results in eyewear. 
Gross margin was flat compared to last year at 58.2%. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we conformed our elimination of certain intercompany costs in Greater China region with our consolidated methodology. As recorded, retail gross margins declined 20 basis points and decreased 190 basis points excluding the impact of this adjustment. As recorded, gross margin for our wholesale segment declined 280 basis points and decreased 60 basis points excluding the impact of this adjustment. This adjustment did not impact consolidated gross margin or have a material impact on previously recorded retail or wholesale gross margins. 
Total adjusted operating expense increased 710 basis points to 44.0% of total revenue. In addition to deleverage, the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our business in Greater China as well as investments in new stores, e-commerce, omnichannel capabilities and infrastructure improvements. Adjusted income from operations was $151.2 million or 14.2% as a percentage of total revenue as compared to $255.0 million or 21.3% as a percentage of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
In the fourth quarter, retail and wholesale operating margins were impacted by the aforementioned gross margin adjustment for Greater China. Conforming the methodology did not impact consolidated operating income or have a material impact on the previously reported operating income by segment. 
Adjusted operating margin for our retail segment declined 650 basis points to 6.8%, which includes the positive impact of the gross margin adjustment. Excluding this, operating margin declined 820 basis points to 5.1% as compared to 13.3% in the prior year period. This decrease was largely driven by continued investments in building our digital flagship platforms, retail store-related cost and deleverage as well as the decrease in the gross margin I previously described. 
Fourth quarter wholesale operating margin declined 510 basis points to 22.1%, which includes the negative impact of the gross margin adjustment. Excluding this, wholesale operating margin decreased 290 basis points to 24.3% versus 27.2% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of the increase in operating expense as a percent of revenue. 
Licensing operating margin was 33.2% compared to 44.1% in the prior year period largely as a result of deleverage. Adjusted net income was $118.0 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This compares to an adjusted net income of $184.8 million or $1.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $227.7 million. 
Inventory was relatively flat compared to last year despite increases from the inclusion of Greater China inventory of $51.8 million and the translation increase of $6.3 million caused by the increased euro on our European inventory. This compares to an 11.2% decrease in net sales or a decrease of 8.6% excluding prior year's 53rd week of sales. Given our reduced promotional activity, we are planning for slower inventory turns in the future. Due to the slower turns, we project that inventory will incur a similar increase in inventory relative to net sales for fiscal 2018. 
Moving to capital allocation. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders, and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares totaling $250 million under our share repurchase program. This completed our most recent $1 billion authorization, and on May 25, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion authorization. During fiscal 2017, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $17.1 million and were related to the buildout of new retail shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. 
During the quarter, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $193.8 million related to retail store and other long-lived assets in the fourth quarter. The charge came primarily as a result of reduced revenue expectations for our store fleet based upon our review that overall traffic trends will remain under pressure as well as our decision to close between 100 and 125 stores over the next 2 years. 
We expect to record additional charges of approximately $100 million to $125 million of onetime costs related to store closures over that time period. We ultimately anticipate annual savings of approximately $60 million as a result of store closures and the lower depreciation and amortization associated with the impairment charge. In fiscal 2018, we expect to close between 20 and 40 full-price stores. 
The guidance we are providing today includes assumptions about the ongoing impact to revenue as well as to operating and D&A costs, but excludes any onetime cost associated with the store closures. For fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be approximately $4.25 billion. We expect to continue to tighten inventory control and reduce promotional activity in both the retail and wholesale channels. As a result, we anticipate that retail net sales will be roughly flat versus the prior year with comparable sales decreasing in the high single-digits range. We expect wholesale net sales to decline in the low teens range and licensing revenue to be approximately flat. 
We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 60.0% for the full year. We expect gross margin improvement from the reduction in promotional days as well as favorable channel and geographic mix due the higher percent of revenue from the retail segment and growth in Asia. This will be somewhat offset by the growth of lower-margin categories, including apparel and footwear. 
For the full year, we expect operating expenses as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 44.0%, largely due to deleverage on lower sales volume. We expect D&A for the year to be between $210 million and $220 million, which includes a $35 million reduction in D&A as a result of impairment charges, partially offset by D&A that is beginning to roll in from capital projects that we undertook over the last several years. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 16.0%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.57 to $3.67. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 18% and 155 million weighed average shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million, and we will focus on renovating our retail store fleet, continuing to make investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities. We also plan to open approximately 50 new stores primarily in the Asia region as well as 77 shop-in-shops, most of which will be for our men's business. 
For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $910 million and $930 million and a high single-digit decrease in comparable sales. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 60.5%. We expect operating expense as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 47.5% resulting in an operating margin of approximately 13.0%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.64. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 19% and 160 million weighed average shares outstanding. 
In conclusion, we were disappointed in our financial performance in fiscal 2017 and are taking action to improve our long-term performance. We expect fiscal 2018 to be a year where we will reset our base and begin to execute on our strategic plan. Through these efforts, we expect to improve our financial performance and return the company to long-term profitable growth. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

So we know that the consumer is still very engaged with our brand, and we know that when we deliver product that is exciting, compelling and innovative, she's responding. So we've seen that in a number of areas inside the company. So that's going to be our #1 focus. I would say the #2 focus for us is really going to be our fleet optimization, both beginning the execution of closing the 100 to 125 stores and also of the development of our fleet modernization. Again, we look forward on June 9 to being able to give a much greater picture of how that will roll out over the next few years and what will that mean for the company's growth. But again, I want to just reiterate we have an incredibly strong brand, and the consumer continues to resonate with it. But we've had some product misses, and I want to be very clear and say to you that we are facing that as a significant and important challenge for us as we go forward. And we're going to do that all amongst the backdrop of reducing promotional activity, and next year is going to be significant. So that's really why we're anticipating that the comps will be down on the high single-digit range. While that, again, is painful, it's the right thing to do for the brand, and it's the right thing to do to signal to the customer that we're proud of the product that we're selling and we don't have to put it on sale all the time to get her to purchase it. And again, as we said in the prepared remarks, 20% of our business in our Lifestyle stores -- in the full-price category came from products that weren't on sale one day during the promotional periods, not one day, so Mercer, Brooklyn and ACCESS were all regular priced, and she brought it at regular price. So we know there's an appetite for that. It's going to take us a little bit of time to ease into that, and so we're excited to continue that journey. In terms of the footprint, Omar, and again, I'm -- we believe in our retail fleet. We think it's critical to our business. It's still going to be, by far, the majority of the company's revenues, and we think that the key to success there, again, revolves around product, and it revolves around the store environment and creating excitement. We hope that you all will get a chance to go out and visit Short Hills, New Jersey, where we've just opened up about 1.5 weeks ago the new concept that is in Regent Street. If you haven't been able to see it in Regent Street, you can now see it in Short Hills, New Jersey and we have a number of stores coming behind that. And the initial results are absolutely outstanding. Now again, a few weeks doesn't make a whole year or multiple seasons, but we're very pleased with what we see there. So what's happened is, is there's a number of stores in the fleet that are either going to -- they're either -- are now unprofitable or going to turn unprofitable, and that's as a result of declining revenues and because of declining traffic in certain of the malls. We wouldn't call these the most high-profile locations, so we don't think it's going to do anything to the brand integrity by closing a number of these locations. And we know that it'll increase the profitability of our fleet and also give us an opportunity to focus more time and energy on less doors. In terms of the wholesale footprint, the doors have declined somewhat, and that's either predominantly by some of the retailers closing stores or a handful of locations that we're finding unprofitable, but there is no significant change on our part to reduce our exposure with our wholesale partners. We're very proud to be in business with them. They've been great partners with us. And now that we have, in North America, a promotional policy that we think protects the integrity of our brand, we're very comfortable with how our brand sits at retail and the way that the consumer is now seeing it presented to them both in terms of presentation and in terms of the way that it's handled from a pricing integrity standpoint."

Now that'll go up slightly as a percentage because we're going to close 100 to 125 stores, but remember we're also going",661,"Kimberly, let me start with the store fleet complexion. Today, of the company-owned stores, outlet is approximately 25% of our fleet. Now that'll go up slightly as a percentage because we're going to close 100 to 125 stores, but remember we're also going to open 50 stores this year in Asia, and they'll probably be equal that many the following year in the Asia region as we get to a more full distribution in that area. So it's going to be in that 25% to 30% range in terms of store count. So we still feel comfortable that that's the right number for us, and, again, keeping the integrity because, again, our primary focus as a company is to sell full-price merchandise and present Michael Kors in the best and most appropriate exciting environment for our consumer. In terms of the store complexion, we're going to look at the productivity and profitability of stores every single quarter. And if we think that more of the fleet is heading in a direction that will be unprofitable, then we will deal with that if that's the case. We think we've taken a fairly long-term view of what this is, and I don't want to promise you that we would never come out and say that we would close more stores. But we think this captures the general sense of the doors that have become, as I said, either unprofitable today or are moving in that direction. We still have a considerable amount of doors worldwide that are profitable, and we view that as our most important efforts around returning those stores to a positive comp growth. We know that's not going to happen this year. But we have aspirations that we think that, that will come, in particular, led by the modernization and, obviously, some of the product innovation we've talked about. The 100-store renovation, even though we've said that will happen over 24 months, that could actually be accelerated. That's just probably more on the outside than what our intentions are. We intend on executing that as quickly as possible, and that's just going to be a matter of working with the developers where we can get temporary locations because, obviously, we have to shut certain stores for a period of time while we go through a complete renovation. So there's going to be a little bit of turmoil. And as you know, those stores will typically be impacted during that period of time when we relocate them to temporary locations. So -- but our intention is to do that quickly, and if the results are positive, which I would say it will probably take us about 12 months to report back to you, then our intent would be to, in particular, the full-price stores, we would go and renovate all the full-price stores globally or the majority of them. And part of this is also natural. Many of our stores now are approaching, in some cases, over 10 years old that haven't been touched in terms of renovation. So this is kind of needed almost regardless. The good news for us -- and we've held off until we found a concept that we thought was innovative, would create excitement for the consumers and also give us a unique position in terms of the marketplace, and we believe we found that now, and we feel really good about making that investment. So that's how we kind of look at the fleet and where we're going with it in the future. And I would lastly add that more of those renovations will happen in North America, and to a lesser degree, in Europe and probably very few in Asia because most of the Asia fleet is brand new with the caveat that if we see significant lift, we would go back and look at that. But the majority of those renovations will happen in North America and then probably next will be Europe."

Matthew, we don't disclose the 2 pieces of information that you're really asking about, which is how much went out the door at sale versus regular price, et cetera, and the purchase on that. The way we think about price laddering is twofold. First, we want -- what we do know is that our AUR has declined for 2 years consecutively, so -- and we went for basically 12 years or more, and our AUR never moved. I think you know that from all the years of listening to us discuss it. And we really -- after digging in, and it didn't take a lot of digging in, but we understood that, that was coming from promotional activity that we were either doing on our own or doing relative to matching competitors. So we feel that we can elevate our AUR by 10%, and it probably won't happen completely over this year, but that is our internal goal. And we're going to do that by reducing the amount of days that we have on sale. And by the way, we are not only doing that in our regular promotional policy that you've, I think, heard about, which addresses what we call our full-price sales but also even in our markdown sales in our Lifestyle stores. So we're going to be begin to reduce that cadence. You'll see the reduction both online and inside the stores. And we'll move more of that product to our outlet stores to be cleared and to be handled through there. So that will help our AUR inside of our stores. And the second part of price laddering is our -- as we said in our prepared remarks, 20% of our sales came from items that were not put on sale at all. So there's a label that hangs on the product that indicates that, that product is excluded from the sales and that really has had a tremendous impact on AUR, and we will introduce hopefully another new group into that range in spring season. And we will also begin to ladder up price points inside of our stores as well. So we're very excited about 2 different strategies. First, when we kind of reset the base, we had 5 groups out we talked to you about that were at the $298 range, and we did that specifically so that when we were on promotion less, she would walk in and find a great value for the product. Now we're going to really layer up our $350 -- our $400-and-plus bags so that -- because as there's less footfall in the stores, we've got to be able to take the average transaction up. What we're also excited about is we're going to be a little more aggressive, and we'll talk to you more about this at our Investor Day, with our Collection label. We're launching a new group called Bancroft for the fall season that -- and again, we've always sold Collection bags in our stores, but we're going to actually take a more aggressive positioning around that part of our business. Again, Michael is a runway designer. We have tremendous engagement with our customers around his runway collections. And we think that product offers us a unique opportunity to talk to the luxury and fashion customer. So the second part of the laddering beyond the promotion is really dealt around product and the price points in that product and how we're going to position that with the customer over the next 12 to 24 months."

Let me just -- I think there's an easier way for us to define it. We estimate that we will have approximately 40% less promotional days in our North American Lifestyle retail stores this year versus last year in 2018, hence, the reason why we are anticipating the comp store sales to continue to decline. So that will be both on our full-price promotion and on when you see additional percentages off on markdowns. So it'd be approximately in that range, so it's quite significant in terms of reduction in days and events that will be held inside the stores. And again, the best part about it is, is on the -- what we refer to as the full-price promotions, those are cadenced, and they will happen at the same time coordinated as what's happening in the wholesale channel, and I think you saw that executed in the fourth quarter, and I think our partners did a terrific job of doing that. And again, as we said in the prepared remarks, they also saw AUR increases. So I think the general feeling is that, that strategy is working in terms of getting a better handle around presenting the brand to the end consumer."

So in terms of the product portfolio, our view is that the global accessories market, handbags and small leather goods, is roughly flat. We think it's down slightly in North America. We think it's flattish in Europe. And we think it's up slightly in Asia and actually probably ticking up in Asia even from its past trends. We see some good momentum there, not only from ourselves, but from some of our competitors. And as you know, in the Asia market, every call will have a different perspective on certain of the regions given the political turmoil that's happening there on any given day, whether it's things that happen in Korea or Japan or in China and how that all kind of intersects. Again, I think many of our competitors also talk about that. So just understand that on the call, it may move around by region, but we think the region in total is quite healthy and actually growing. I want to just give you that as an overall perspective. I want to talk about the watch business. As you know, the fashion watch business continues to be under pressure, although we are pleased with what is happening with the wearable technology and how the consumer is responding to wearable technology. Very clearly, Apple is the leader in that, and we hope to be a very, very significant player in that, and it's really doing some really good things for our own retail stores as well as our wholesale and specialty store partners around the world. And I have to take my hat off to Kosta and Fossil and everything that they're doing there. They really are putting us in a leadership position. And I also have to thank Google because they're doing just a tremendous job and really have a strong dedication to making this an important part of their ecosystem. So but that being said, the fashion watch business continues to decline, and as you know, the Swiss watch business is declining. So we think that's going to be continued headwind for us in the coming year. Again, watches still remain a significant part of our business, and until that category starts getting a little bit turned around, I think we have a concern, and again, that's also baked into our down high single-digit comp number. That all being said, and we're going to talk to you about this during Investor Day, we're a lifestyle brand. We're not a company that has to become a lifestyle brand. We've been a lifestyle brand. So we are going to put a lot more emphasis on our women's ready-to-wear business, which has -- we made a stance and said that we're going to be one of the most important dress companies from a fashion standpoint, and that's paying off very, very nicely both in our own stores and in our wholesale distribution as well, and we think we can take that a lot further than we've gone today. We think that our footwear assortments look great, and again, it's another leadership area for us. So we'll be talking a little bit about rebalancing at our Investor Day and how -- while we know we've got -- we're under pressure in some of these other categories, we're going to have to kind of redirect some of our assets towards these other businesses. And we're in them. And we're relatively good at them. And we think we can get better. As it relates to the laddering of product and innovation, look, Michael has been doing this for a long time, and he certainly -- and the design teams are very capable of creating innovation and fashion leadership. We know we've got a little bit behind, and we very clearly stated it and are saying that it's a significant initiative inside the company. And unlike other companies, this is the man who took us to $4.5 billion and has been driving this company and he still is deeply engaged and is leading our team with what we think are going to be incredible design concepts for the upcoming seasons. In our  
[Audio Gap] 
storytelling and marketing, and we're going to use the power of that to help really launch and communicate those new products and innovations that we're going to be moving forward with. On your second question around Amazon, Amazon is an incredible company and obviously probably the most successful online player in the world. We have a relationship with them in watches, and that's all we intend on going forward with currently. And again, they've been terrific partners, and again, especially in the wearable technology area, they are a dominant player. And our focus is going to be on our own e-commerce businesses, and as you know, we've made significant investments. We're up in 10 countries. We're adding a lot more countries as we go forward towards the back half of the year, and we're going to really build out our CRM capabilities. So that'll be our focus in terms of how we'll communicate to our customer digitally primarily through our own online channels."

So I just want to remind everyone, there was no specific guidance provided in February. But that being said, we did indicate that we would have sales earnings increases in 2018, which now we are indicating is not going to be the case. So as we said in both our prepared remarks and some of the comments that I mentioned, we really made the decision after studying our store fleets and what we're going to do in terms of optimizing those presentations and profitability that we would take 2018 and kind of reset for us. And the resets are, clearly, first off, closing unproductive and unprofitable stores. Secondly, to modernize our store fleet, and as I said, we're very happy about what we've seen happen in Regent Street. We're also very happy, again, only a few weeks in, but what we're seeing happen in our Short Hills store and -- so we're going to push forward with renovating 100 stores as quickly as possible. Hopefully, the majority of those will happen probably in the very back half of this year by the time we can actually get to these doors. But we would like to get as many done as possible in this year. And then, lastly, is really product innovation and pushing that forward much faster than we had. So taking that into account along with the fact that we have decided to kind of even take a step further with our promotional stance and cadence inside of our Lifestyle stores and reducing even on the percentage off on markdowns, that, that will impact our comp stores. So after you look at all that together, that brought us to the conclusion that, between closing stores, between reducing our comp store expectations, that would lower our revenue expectations, and unfortunately that creates deleverage and that would lower our earnings per share expectations and our operating income expectations. But we do believe that there is growth and opportunity that lies ahead for us, and I look forward to speaking to each of you and seeing you during our Investor Day coming up on June 9. 
On that, I'll say thank you for joining us today on our conference call and look forward to seeing you shortly. Thank you."

On behalf of Michael, the board and the entire organization, I would like to thank Joe for the integral role he played in building Michael Kors into a leading global luxury fashion house. Joe and I have worked together for 20 years, and I would like to personally thank him for his leadership, partnership and friendship. I and the rest of the team wish him well in his retirement. 
On that note, I would also like to welcome Tom Edwards, our incoming Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer. Tom joined us from the Brinker International where he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Tom has strong financial and operating experience across a diverse set of consumer-facing industries, and we are thrilled to have him join the team. Joe will continue in his current role through August 1, working with Tom to ensure a thorough and seamless transition. 
Moving now to our results. While the fourth quarter performance was largely in line with our expectations, fiscal 2017 was a difficult and disappointing year for us. The retail environment remains challenging. That being said, we must acknowledge that our company needs to take steps to accelerate the level of luxury fashion innovation in our accessories assortments and further enhance our store experience in order to better engage and excite consumers. 
We have developed a long-term strategic plan, which we have named Runway 2020 to address these and other areas. We believe the execution of this strategic plan and our leading luxury fashion brand, which is renowned for design innovation and fashion leadership, will position us to return to long-term sustainable and profitable growth. 
Looking back on the year, we executed on a number of initiatives, which will lay the groundwork for our strategic plan. During fiscal 2017, we expanded our global revenues with the acquisition of our Greater China license. We continue to believe that this region, along with Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, will ultimately generate $1 billion in revenue for our company. 
We also launched digital flagships in Europe and Asia, bringing the number of countries served to 11. And we began to take steps to protect our brand by reducing promotional activity in our digital flagships, Lifestyle stores and wholesale doors. While we have seen a decrease in both retail and wholesale sales as a result of these changes, we believe this is the right action to protect our brand health long term. 
In addition, we undertook 5 specific initiatives, which I outlined for you on our last call. During the fourth quarter, we made good initial progress on these efforts. While it was not enough to meaningfully impact our results, we believe we are moving in the right direction by infusing more luxury detailing and fashion innovation in our product assortment. And this is being met with favorable consumer reaction. 
For instance, Michael and our design team have been focused on creating more elevated and layered assortments. These fresh new design elements were represented in some of our best-selling styles in the fourth quarter. Our Mercer handbag collection, which saw strong sell-throughs globally, reflected an array of bright spring colors and novelty detailing. The Brooklyn handbag collection saw strong response and was offered in several styles, including novelty detailing like grommets and an oversized tassel. 
We also expanded the presence of our new Jet Set signature accessories capitalizing on current fashion trends. The collection features multiple layers composed of luxury fashion silhouettes and novelty details. The Jet Set signature group is an icon element of our brand and continues to resonate with consumers. 
We also increased our offering of mix-and-match products, including the Selma Swap handbag, which allows consumers to purchase a reversible jacket to change the look of their bag, effectively creating 3 bags in one. In addition, we introduced interchangeable handbag straps, which featured enhanced styling, such as floral embellishments, grommets and studs. 
Finally, we continued to focus on opportunities to engage and excite our customers through customization and saw continued positive response to our free monogramming services, which we offered in our digital flagships and select retail stores. Later this year, we will begin to offer monogramming enhancements, including symbols, additional fonts and alternative placements. We will also debut a customized [ pin-it ] program. These perforated leather handbags, accessories and footwear will be uniquely styled by the consumer with a variety of pins, including letters, horoscope signs, symbols and more. 
In our footwear assortment, we continued to offer on-trend innovative product with consumers responding positively to exciting new details like the strong floral motif in our Heidi thong and Kit sandal as well as to pumps with our signature chain heel treatment. Active footwear sales continued to grow, and our new floral perforated designs saw particularly strong response. 
In women's ready-to-wear, dresses were our best-performing category in the quarter with high single-digit comparable sales growth. Our expanded dress assortment included innovative fashion detailing as well as seasonal colors and concepts. We are pleased with the favorable consumer response, and we'll build on our momentum as we continue to grow this category. 
Turning to our men's business. We continued to grow this segment of our business in fiscal 2017 as our sportswear offerings resonated with the consumer and we saw strong response to our expanded offering in men's luxury leather goods. While this remains a small part of our overall business, we now have 41 stores as well as 261 shop-in-shops and see men's as an important category of growth going forward. As we've previously stated, we believe men's will ultimately grow to a $1 billion business. 
In our watch business, ACCESS smartwatches continue to be an outstanding success. This product line is expected to represent approximately 25% of our watch assortment in fiscal 2018 as we expand our offerings with exciting new styles, updated plating options and an increased selection of interchangeable straps, which enable consumers to customize their smartwatches with multiple looks.   
Finally, with respect to marketing, Michael's luxury fashion message remains a cornerstone of our communication with consumers. We continue to invest in both traditional and digital marketing channels. We're increasingly incorporating CRM activation in our digital marketing activities to drive traffic and conversion. We are using data on purchase history, interests and geography to align the creative in our messages to the most relevant audiences in order to more effectively connect with consumers, which, in turn, has helped drive traffic and conversion, in particular, in our digital flagships globally. 
Moving to our financial performance. For the full year 2017, we reported total revenue of $4.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.24. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $0.73. 
In the quarter, global retail net sales grew 0.5% and comparable sales decreased 14.1%. In the Americas, retail net sales decreased 13.8% and comparable sales decreased in the low teens. 
Our digital flagships continued to generate double-digit sales growth as consumers shift to online channel. However, retail comps remained under pressure by challenging traffic trends in the retail industry and the highly promotional environment. 
As we have previously discussed, beginning in February, we implemented a new promotional policy as part of our effort to protect brand integrity and improve margins. Additionally, in our North American digital flagships and lifestyle stores, we offered our Mercer and Hamilton accessories collection as well as our ACCESS smartwatch collection on a nonpromotional basis. Those products generated approximately 20% of our digital flagship and lifestyle store full-price sales, which contributed to a low single-digit increase in full-price AUR in the quarter. 
In Europe, retail net sales declined 15.4%. Comparable sales, which exclude e-commerce sales declined in the low 20s percent range on a reported basis and the high-teens range on a constant-currency basis. Including e-commerce sales on a constant-currency basis, European comparable sales results would have declined in the low teens range for the quarter. 
Similar to North America, we are taking steps in Europe to reduce promotional activities. We had 16 fewer brand-wide promotional days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 than in the same period last year. While this change negatively impacted store traffic, it was the right long-term decision. We also believe traffic was pressured by reduced consumer confidence and uncertainty in certain markets stemming from European elections and the formal triggering of Brexit. 
In Asia, retail net sales increased more than 200%, largely as a result of the shift in China sales to our company-owned retail segment. Asia comparable sales, which included Japan and Korea, grew in the low single digits on a reported basis and were flat on a constant-currency basis as Japan comparable sales continue to be impact by the decline in Chinese tourists. Asia comparable sales, including the Greater China business, grew in the mid-single digits or high single digits on a constant-currency basis. Overall, we remain pleased with our continued strong performance in the Asia region. 
Now I'd like to discuss our retail strategy. While we expect the digital channel to grow as a percent of sales, our stores will also continue to play an important role in increasing the company's revenue long term. Stores will continue to serve as the destination for consumers looking for experience of the Michael Kors brand firsthand, make luxury fashion purchases as well as to showcase our innovative designs and engage consumers through service and clientele-ing. 
In order to optimize our store base, we performed an in-depth analysis on our entire fleet. Based on the results of this evaluation, we plan to close between 100 and 125 Lifestyle stores globally over the next 2 years. This will enable us to focus on the most productive locations as well as those that we believe are important in supporting our brand image. We will continue to selectively open new stores in key cities with a primary focus on expanding our presence in Asia. 
Another key element of our retail strategy is to modernize our stores around the world. Last spring, we opened our new flagship on Regent Street in London. The store features a palette of soft browns and grays that, mixed with the warm woods and luxury materials, captures our refined take on glamor while offering a modern and inviting environment in which to shop. The new store layout is built around a center runway opening on to luxurious rooms that  distinctly showcase our accessories, footwear, womenswear and menswear categories and allow our sales associates to provide consumers with a unique and elevated styling experience. We are pleased with the performance of our Regent Street store and plan to use this as our design concept for the future. 
Over the next 2 years, we plan to renovate approximately 100 locations with this new concept. We expect these enhancements will improve the productivity of our overall fleet by highlighting our footwear, women's ready-to-wear and men's areas, in addition to our accessories offering and look forward to providing you with updates as we continue with our fleet modernization efforts. 
Turning to our wholesale segment. Net sales declined 22.8% in the fourth quarter. The Americas declined 22.1% largely driven by reduced sell-in into the department store channel as well as our decision to reduce our authorized promotional periods to 4 times per year. 
As a result of this decision, we had 49 fewer promotional days in this quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year. This drove an increase in full-price AUR across our accessories, footwear and menswear categories. While the decrease in promotional activity may cause a short-term reduction in sales, we're encouraged by the improvement in full-price AUR and remain confident that this is the right long-term decision for our brand. 
In Europe, net sales declined 17.4% in the quarter as the headwinds that impacted our retail stores also had a negative impact on our wholesale channel. As part of our continued focus on our brand health, we have thoughtfully and selectively begun to curtail shipments into this channel to reduce the end-of-season promotional inventory in wholesale accounts. In Asia, net sales decreased 56.9% primarily attributable to the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. 
Turning to our license segment. Revenues decreased 6.2% in the quarter with good performance from the new fashion watch styles, ACCESS smartwatches and eyewear partially offsetting declines in other categories. We saw positive response to new luxury fashion watch styles Portia and Cynthia, both of which feature our new slim and feminine design. We're also pleased with the continued sales growth of our ACCESS wearable technology assortment. As I stated earlier, we plan to expand this category and are excited about the 2 new ACCESS smartwatch styles Sofie and Grayson that were introduced at Baselworld in March. We plan to roll these new styles out to stores this fall. 
We are continuing to expand our leadership in the fashion wearable technology category with the introduction of My Social, a feature which will enable users to link their Instagram account and set a personal post photo as a watch face. The app allows the user to scroll through their Instagram posts, select a favorite image and even apply filters, creating a watch face that's as personal as their life. As we expand this category through the new product introductions and technology innovations with our partner, Google, we believe our ACCESS wearable technology business can ultimately reach 50% of our overall watch sales. 
We're also pleased with the performance of our eyewear category in the quarter as consumers reacted favorably to new styles, including Lon, a flat lens aviator, and Ina, an open-wire metal cat-eye. 
Lastly, we continued to be pleased with the fragrance category performance, particularly in Europe. We're excited to expand the category this fall with the global launch of a major new fragrance, Sexy Ruby, which will add another pillar to our successful fragrance business. 
Looking ahead, as we deepen the fashion innovation in our assortments, grow key product categories, rightsize our store fleet and elevate our store experience, fiscal 2018 will be a transition year in which we establish a new baseline before returning to long-term growth. We have a strong luxury brand led by Michael Kors with a history of fashion innovation and leadership, a global footprint with stores positioned in many of the best locations around the world and the marketing expertise to effectively convey our fashion stories. 
We'll be hosting an Investor Day on June 9 at our company's New York headquarters where we will walk you through our Runway 2020 strategic growth plan. Members of the leadership team will be joining me to share the details of this plan, which builds on some of the recent initiatives I discussed today. Ultimately, Runway 2020 is designed to leverage our product innovation, elevated store experience, personalized shopping experience and global presence to drive long-term sales and profitability growth. I look forward to sharing more details on our future growth initiatives with you at our Investor Day. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Joe."
143971118,430398723,1218889,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q4 2017 Earnings Call, May 31, 2017",2017-05-31,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John. For the fourth quarter, total revenue was $1.1 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes approximately $34 million in sales associated with the 53rd week of that fiscal year. In the",1629,"Thank you, John. For the fourth quarter, total revenue was $1.1 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes approximately $34 million in sales associated with the 53rd week of that fiscal year. 
In the retail segment, net sales increased 0.5% due primarily to the addition of 159 net new stores since the fourth quarter of last year, including 111 stores associated with the recent acquisition of the Greater China license. Comparable sales decreased 14.1%, reflecting a low teens decrease in North America and a low 20% decline in Europe partially offset by a low single-digit increase in Asia. Our e-commerce comparable sales contributed approximately 450 basis points to our performance in the quarter. 
Our results in North America continued to face pressure from declining traffic and our decision to reduce promotional activity in our Lifestyle stores. This was partially offset by increased conversion rates in our stores and strong performance of our digital flagships, which achieved double-digit comparable sales growth in the quarter. 
The comparable sales decline in Europe was due to reduced store traffic and lower average unit retail in addition to sales that migrated to the online channel following the launch of our European digital flagships in the fall of calendar 2016. While European digital flagships are not yet included in the comparable sales base, had they been included, European comparable sales would have been down in the mid-teens on a reported basis and down in the low teens on a constant-currency basis. Asia comparable sales, which include Japan and Korea, grew in the low single digits on a reported basis and were flat on a constant-currency basis. 
In the wholesale segment, net sales declined 22.8%. The wholesale in the Americas region declined 22.1% as we strategically reduced the amount of inventory we ship into that channel and reduced our authorized promotional periods to 4 times per year. European wholesale net sales decreased 17.4%. As John explained earlier, we are strategically decreasing our sell-in in this channel as we focus on ensuring long-term brand health. In Asia, the 56.9% decrease in net sales largely reflects the shift of our Greater China business to the retail segment. 
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 6.2%. ACCESS smartwatches performed well during the quarter but did not offset the decline in fashion watches. We also saw strong results in eyewear. 
Gross margin was flat compared to last year at 58.2%. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we conformed our elimination of certain intercompany costs in Greater China region with our consolidated methodology. As recorded, retail gross margins declined 20 basis points and decreased 190 basis points excluding the impact of this adjustment. As recorded, gross margin for our wholesale segment declined 280 basis points and decreased 60 basis points excluding the impact of this adjustment. This adjustment did not impact consolidated gross margin or have a material impact on previously recorded retail or wholesale gross margins. 
Total adjusted operating expense increased 710 basis points to 44.0% of total revenue. In addition to deleverage, the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of our business in Greater China as well as investments in new stores, e-commerce, omnichannel capabilities and infrastructure improvements. Adjusted income from operations was $151.2 million or 14.2% as a percentage of total revenue as compared to $255.0 million or 21.3% as a percentage of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. 
In the fourth quarter, retail and wholesale operating margins were impacted by the aforementioned gross margin adjustment for Greater China. Conforming the methodology did not impact consolidated operating income or have a material impact on the previously reported operating income by segment. 
Adjusted operating margin for our retail segment declined 650 basis points to 6.8%, which includes the positive impact of the gross margin adjustment. Excluding this, operating margin declined 820 basis points to 5.1% as compared to 13.3% in the prior year period. This decrease was largely driven by continued investments in building our digital flagship platforms, retail store-related cost and deleverage as well as the decrease in the gross margin I previously described. 
Fourth quarter wholesale operating margin declined 510 basis points to 22.1%, which includes the negative impact of the gross margin adjustment. Excluding this, wholesale operating margin decreased 290 basis points to 24.3% versus 27.2% in the prior year period. This was largely the result of the increase in operating expense as a percent of revenue. 
Licensing operating margin was 33.2% compared to 44.1% in the prior year period largely as a result of deleverage. Adjusted net income was $118.0 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This compares to an adjusted net income of $184.8 million or $1.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $227.7 million. 
Inventory was relatively flat compared to last year despite increases from the inclusion of Greater China inventory of $51.8 million and the translation increase of $6.3 million caused by the increased euro on our European inventory. This compares to an 11.2% decrease in net sales or a decrease of 8.6% excluding prior year's 53rd week of sales. Given our reduced promotional activity, we are planning for slower inventory turns in the future. Due to the slower turns, we project that inventory will incur a similar increase in inventory relative to net sales for fiscal 2018. 
Moving to capital allocation. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders, and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares totaling $250 million under our share repurchase program. This completed our most recent $1 billion authorization, and on May 25, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion authorization. During fiscal 2017, we generated operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $17.1 million and were related to the buildout of new retail shops as well as investments in our distribution facilities, our corporate offices, digital flagships and other infrastructure improvements. 
During the quarter, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $193.8 million related to retail store and other long-lived assets in the fourth quarter. The charge came primarily as a result of reduced revenue expectations for our store fleet based upon our review that overall traffic trends will remain under pressure as well as our decision to close between 100 and 125 stores over the next 2 years. 
We expect to record additional charges of approximately $100 million to $125 million of onetime costs related to store closures over that time period. We ultimately anticipate annual savings of approximately $60 million as a result of store closures and the lower depreciation and amortization associated with the impairment charge. In fiscal 2018, we expect to close between 20 and 40 full-price stores. 
The guidance we are providing today includes assumptions about the ongoing impact to revenue as well as to operating and D&A costs, but excludes any onetime cost associated with the store closures. For fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be approximately $4.25 billion. We expect to continue to tighten inventory control and reduce promotional activity in both the retail and wholesale channels. As a result, we anticipate that retail net sales will be roughly flat versus the prior year with comparable sales decreasing in the high single-digits range. We expect wholesale net sales to decline in the low teens range and licensing revenue to be approximately flat. 
We anticipate gross margin to be approximately 60.0% for the full year. We expect gross margin improvement from the reduction in promotional days as well as favorable channel and geographic mix due the higher percent of revenue from the retail segment and growth in Asia. This will be somewhat offset by the growth of lower-margin categories, including apparel and footwear. 
For the full year, we expect operating expenses as a percent of total revenue to be approximately 44.0%, largely due to deleverage on lower sales volume. We expect D&A for the year to be between $210 million and $220 million, which includes a $35 million reduction in D&A as a result of impairment charges, partially offset by D&A that is beginning to roll in from capital projects that we undertook over the last several years. These assumptions result in an operating margin of approximately 16.0%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.57 to $3.67. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 18% and 155 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million, and we will focus on renovating our retail store fleet, continuing to make investments in global digital strategies and omnichannel capabilities. We also plan to open approximately 50 new stores primarily in the Asia region as well as 77 shop-in-shops, most of which will be for our men's business. 
For the first quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $910 million and $930 million and a high single-digit decrease in comparable sales. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 60.5%. We expect operating expense as a percentage of total revenue of approximately 47.5% resulting in an operating margin of approximately 13.0%. 
We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.64. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 19% and 160 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
In conclusion, we were disappointed in our financial performance in fiscal 2017 and are taking action to improve our long-term performance. We expect fiscal 2018 to be a year where we will reset our base and begin to execute on our strategic plan. Through these efforts, we expect to improve our financial performance and return the company to long-term profitable growth. 
I will now turn the call back to John for closing remarks."

So we know that the consumer is still very engaged with our brand, and we know that when we deliver product that is exciting, compelling and innovative, she's responding. So we've seen that in a number of areas inside the company. So that's going to be our #1 focus. I would say the #2 focus for us is really going to be our fleet optimization, both beginning the execution of closing the 100 to 125 stores and also of the development of our fleet modernization. Again, we look forward on June 9 to being able to give a much greater picture of how that will roll out over the next few years and what will that mean for the company's growth. But again, I want to just reiterate we have an incredibly strong brand, and the consumer continues to resonate with it. But we've had some product misses, and I want to be very clear and say to you that we are facing that as a significant and important challenge for us as we go forward. And we're going to do that all amongst the backdrop of reducing promotional activity, and next year is going to be significant. So that's really why we're anticipating that the comps will be down on the high single-digit range. While that, again, is painful, it's the right thing to do for the brand, and it's the right thing to do to signal to the customer that we're proud of the product that we're selling and we don't have to put it on sale all the time to get her to purchase it. And again, as we said in the prepared remarks, 20% of our business in our Lifestyle stores -- in the full-price category came from products that weren't on sale one day during the promotional periods, not one day, so Mercer, Brooklyn and ACCESS were all regular priced, and she brought it at regular price. So we know there's an appetite for that. It's going to take us a little bit of time to ease into that, and so we're excited to continue that journey. In terms of the footprint, Omar, and again, I'm -- we believe in our retail fleet. We think it's critical to our business. It's still going to be, by far, the majority of the company's revenues, and we think that the key to success there, again, revolves around product, and it revolves around the store environment and creating excitement. We hope that you all will get a chance to go out and visit Short Hills, New Jersey, where we've just opened up about 1.5 weeks ago the new concept that is in Regent Street. If you haven't been able to see it in Regent Street, you can now see it in Short Hills, New Jersey and we have a number of stores coming behind that. And the initial results are absolutely outstanding. Now again, a few weeks doesn't make a whole year or multiple seasons, but we're very pleased with what we see there. So what's happened is, is there's a number of stores in the fleet that are either going to -- they're either -- are now unprofitable or going to turn unprofitable, and that's as a result of declining revenues and because of declining traffic in certain of the malls. We wouldn't call these the most high-profile locations, so we don't think it's going to do anything to the brand integrity by closing a number of these locations. And we know that it'll increase the profitability of our fleet and also give us an opportunity to focus more time and energy on less doors. In terms of the wholesale footprint, the doors have declined somewhat, and that's either predominantly by some of the retailers closing stores or a handful of locations that we're finding unprofitable, but there is no significant change on our part to reduce our exposure with our wholesale partners. We're very proud to be in business with them. They've been great partners with us. And now that we have, in North America, a promotional policy that we think protects the integrity of our brand, we're very comfortable with how our brand sits at retail and the way that the consumer is now seeing it presented to them both in terms of presentation and in terms of the way that it's handled from a pricing integrity standpoint."

Today, of the company-owned stores, outlet is approximately 25% of our fleet. Now that'll go up slightly as a percentage because we're going to close 100 to 125 stores, but remember we're also going to open 50 stores this year in Asia, and they'll probably be equal that many the following year in the Asia region as we get to a more full distribution in that area. So it's going to be in that 25% to 30% range in terms of store count. So we still feel comfortable that that's the right number for us, and, again, keeping the integrity because, again, our primary focus as a company is to sell full-price merchandise and present Michael Kors in the best and most appropriate exciting environment for our consumer. In terms of the store complexion, we're going to look at the productivity and profitability of stores every single quarter. And if we think that more of the fleet is heading in a direction that will be unprofitable, then we will deal with that if that's the case. We think we've taken a fairly long-term view of what this is, and I don't want to promise you that we would never come out and say that we would close more stores. But we think this captures the general sense of the doors that have become, as I said, either unprofitable today or are moving in that direction. We still have a considerable amount of doors worldwide that are profitable, and we view that as our most important efforts around returning those stores to a positive comp growth. We know that's not going to happen this year. But we have aspirations that we think that, that will come, in particular, led by the modernization and, obviously, some of the product innovation we've talked about. The 100-store renovation, even though we've said that will happen over 24 months, that could actually be accelerated. That's just probably more on the outside than what our intentions are. We intend on executing that as quickly as possible, and that's just going to be a matter of working with the developers where we can get temporary locations because, obviously, we have to shut certain stores for a period of time while we go through a complete renovation. So there's going to be a little bit of turmoil. And as you know, those stores will typically be impacted during that period of time when we relocate them to temporary locations. So -- but our intention is to do that quickly, and if the results are positive, which I would say it will probably take us about 12 months to report back to you, then our intent would be to, in particular, the full-price stores, we would go and renovate all the full-price stores globally or the majority of them. And part of this is also natural. Many of our stores now are approaching, in some cases, over 10 years old that haven't been touched in terms of renovation. So this is kind of needed almost regardless. The good news for us -- and we've held off until we found a concept that we thought was innovative, would create excitement for the consumers and also give us a unique position in terms of the marketplace, and we believe we found that now, and we feel really good about making that investment. So that's how we kind of look at the fleet and where we're going with it in the future. And I would lastly add that more of those renovations will happen in North America, and to a lesser degree, in Europe and probably very few in Asia because most of the Asia fleet is brand new with the caveat that if we see significant lift, we would go back and look at that. But the majority of those renovations will happen in North America and then probably next will be Europe."

Matthew, we don't disclose the 2 pieces of information that you're really asking about, which is how much went out the door at sale versus regular price, et cetera, and the purchase on that. The way we think about price laddering is twofold. First, we want -- what we do know is that our AUR has declined for 2 years consecutively, so -- and we went for basically 12 years or more, and our AUR never moved. I think you know that from all the years of listening to us discuss it. And we really -- after digging in, and it didn't take a lot of digging in, but we understood that, that was coming from promotional activity that we were either doing on our own or doing relative to matching competitors. So we feel that we can elevate our AUR by 10%, and it probably won't happen completely over this year, but that is our internal goal. And we're going to do that by reducing the amount of days that we have on sale. And by the way, we are not only doing that in our regular promotional policy that you've, I think, heard about, which addresses what we call our full-price sales but also even in our markdown sales in our Lifestyle stores. So we're going to be begin to reduce that cadence. You'll see the reduction both online and inside the stores. And we'll move more of that product to our outlet stores to be cleared and to be handled through there. So that will help our AUR inside of our stores. And the second part of price laddering is our -- as we said in our prepared remarks, 20% of our sales came from items that were not put on sale at all. So there's a label that hangs on the product that indicates that, that product is excluded from the sales and that really has had a tremendous impact on AUR, and we will introduce hopefully another new group into that range in spring season. And we will also begin to ladder up price points inside of our stores as well. So we're very excited about 2 different strategies. First, when we kind of reset the base, we had 5 groups out we talked to you about that were at the $298 range, and we did that specifically so that when we were on promotion less, she would walk in and find a great value for the product. Now we're going to really layer up our $350 -- our $400-and-plus bags so that -- because as there's less footfall in the stores, we've got to be able to take the average transaction up. What we're also excited about is we're going to be a little more aggressive, and we'll talk to you more about this at our Investor Day, with our Collection label. We're launching a new group called Bancroft for the fall season that -- and again, we've always sold Collection bags in our stores, but we're going to actually take a more aggressive positioning around that part of our business. Again, Michael is a runway designer. We have tremendous engagement with our customers around his runway collections. And we think that product offers us a unique opportunity to talk to the luxury and fashion customer. So the second part of the laddering beyond the promotion is really dealt around product and the price points in that product and how we're going to position that with the customer over the next 12 to 24 months."

Let me just -- I think there's an easier way for us to define it. We estimate that we will have approximately 40% less promotional days in our North American Lifestyle retail stores this year versus last year in 2018, hence, the reason why we are anticipating the comp store sales to continue to decline. So that will be both on our full-price promotion and on when you see additional percentages off on markdowns. So it'd be approximately in that range, so it's quite significant in terms of reduction in days and events that will be held inside the stores. And again, the best part about it is, is on the -- what we refer to as the full-price promotions, those are cadenced, and they will happen at the same time coordinated as what's happening in the wholesale channel, and I think you saw that executed in the fourth quarter, and I think our partners did a terrific job of doing that. And again, as we said in the prepared remarks, they also saw AUR increases. So I think the general feeling is that, that strategy is working in terms of getting a better handle around presenting the brand to the end consumer."

So in terms of the product portfolio, our view is that the global accessories market, handbags and small leather goods, is roughly flat. We think it's down slightly in North America. We think it's flattish in Europe. And we think it's up slightly in Asia and actually probably ticking up in Asia even from its past trends. We see some good momentum there, not only from ourselves, but from some of our competitors. And as you know, in the Asia market, every call will have a different perspective on certain of the regions given the political turmoil that's happening there on any given day, whether it's things that happen in Korea or Japan or in China and how that all kind of intersects. Again, I think many of our competitors also talk about that. So just understand that on the call, it may move around by region, but we think the region in total is quite healthy and actually growing. I want to just give you that as an overall perspective. I want to talk about the watch business. As you know, the fashion watch business continues to be under pressure, although we are pleased with what is happening with the wearable technology and how the consumer is responding to wearable technology. Very clearly, Apple is the leader in that, and we hope to be a very, very significant player in that, and it's really doing some really good things for our own retail stores as well as our wholesale and specialty store partners around the world. And I have to take my hat off to Kosta and Fossil and everything that they're doing there. They really are putting us in a leadership position. And I also have to thank Google because they're doing just a tremendous job and really have a strong dedication to making this an important part of their ecosystem. So but that being said, the fashion watch business continues to decline, and as you know, the Swiss watch business is declining. So we think that's going to be continued headwind for us in the coming year. Again, watches still remain a significant part of our business, and until that category starts getting a little bit turned around, I think we have a concern, and again, that's also baked into our down high single-digit comp number. That all being said, and we're going to talk to you about this during Investor Day, we're a lifestyle brand. We're not a company that has to become a lifestyle brand. We've been a lifestyle brand. So we are going to put a lot more emphasis on our women's ready-to-wear business, which has -- we made a stance and said that we're going to be one of the most important dress companies from a fashion standpoint, and that's paying off very, very nicely both in our own stores and in our wholesale distribution as well, and we think we can take that a lot further than we've gone today. We think that our footwear assortments look great, and again, it's another leadership area for us. So we'll be talking a little bit about rebalancing at our Investor Day and how -- while we know we've got -- we're under pressure in some of these other categories, we're going to have to kind of redirect some of our assets towards these other businesses. And we're in them. And we're relatively good at them. And we think we can get better. As it relates to the laddering of product and innovation, look, Michael has been doing this for a long time, and he certainly -- and the design teams are very capable of creating innovation and fashion leadership. We know we've got a little bit behind, and we very clearly stated it and are saying that it's a significant initiative inside the company. And unlike other companies, this is the man who took us to $4.5 billion and has been driving this company and he still is deeply engaged and is leading our team with what we think are going to be incredible design concepts for the upcoming seasons. In our  
[Audio Gap] 
storytelling and marketing, and we're going to use the power of that to help really launch and communicate those new products and innovations that we're going to be moving forward with. On your second question around Amazon, Amazon is an incredible company and obviously probably the most successful online player in the world. We have a relationship with them in watches, and that's all we intend on going forward with currently. And again, they've been terrific partners, and again, especially in the wearable technology area, they are a dominant player. And our focus is going to be on our own e-commerce businesses, and as you know, we've made significant investments. We're up in 10 countries. We're adding a lot more countries as we go forward towards the back half of the year, and we're going to really build out our CRM capabilities. So that'll be our focus in terms of how we'll communicate to our customer digitally primarily through our own online channels."

So I just want to remind everyone, there was no specific guidance provided in February. But that being said, we did indicate that we would have sales earnings increases in 2018, which now we are indicating is not going to be the case. So as we said",378,"Right. So I just want to remind everyone, there was no specific guidance provided in February. But that being said, we did indicate that we would have sales earnings increases in 2018, which now we are indicating is not going to be the case. So as we said in both our prepared remarks and some of the comments that I mentioned, we really made the decision after studying our store fleets and what we're going to do in terms of optimizing those presentations and profitability that we would take 2018 and kind of reset for us. And the resets are, clearly, first off, closing unproductive and unprofitable stores. Secondly, to modernize our store fleet, and as I said, we're very happy about what we've seen happen in Regent Street. We're also very happy, again, only a few weeks in, but what we're seeing happen in our Short Hills store and -- so we're going to push forward with renovating 100 stores as quickly as possible. Hopefully, the majority of those will happen probably in the very back half of this year by the time we can actually get to these doors. But we would like to get as many done as possible in this year. And then, lastly, is really product innovation and pushing that forward much faster than we had. So taking that into account along with the fact that we have decided to kind of even take a step further with our promotional stance and cadence inside of our Lifestyle stores and reducing even on the percentage off on markdowns, that, that will impact our comp stores. So after you look at all that together, that brought us to the conclusion that, between closing stores, between reducing our comp store expectations, that would lower our revenue expectations, and unfortunately that creates deleverage and that would lower our earnings per share expectations and our operating income expectations. But we do believe that there is growth and opportunity that lies ahead for us, and I look forward to speaking to each of you and seeing you during our Investor Day coming up on June 9.

We are in an exciting and transformative time for our company.

We are in an exciting and transformative time for our company. We recently announced that Michael Kors Holding Limited is forming a global fashion luxury group with our acquisition of Jimmy Choo, bringing together 2 iconic companies and creating a platform for future acquisitions. The foundation of our group will be built on fashion authority with craftsmanship and heritage at the core. Jimmy Choo embodies all of these elements and is an excellent fit for our group. The brand has been a leader in designing glamorous, innovative, expertly crafted footwear and accessories that have resonated with luxury trendsetters for more than 20 years. Under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Denis and Creative Director, Sandra Choi, the company has demonstrated an impressive track record of consistent sales and earnings growth in addition to strong cash flow generation. We believe Jimmy Choo can reach $1 billion in revenue over time as we partner with Pierre, Sandra and the rest of the talented management team to build the brand's online presence, expand its retail footprint globally and accelerate growth in the accessories and men's categories. Through the formation of a global fashion luxury group, we expect to enhance long-term value for shareholders by growing the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo's businesses, while diversifying our product and geographic mix. 
Now moving to the quarter's performance. This morning, we reported first quarter fiscal 2018 results, which were ahead of our expectations, largely as a result of the better-than-anticipated comparable sales performance in our Retail segment in North America and Europe. We have also begun to execute our strategic plan, Runway 2020, to reposition our company for future growth. These efforts are expected to drive improved financial performance as we generate even greater appeal for our fashion luxury assortments, deepen consumers' connection with our brand and further elevate exceptional jet-set experience that we offer online and in our stores. It is still early in the process, but we have certainly begun to lay the foundation for future success. While we recognize that it will take time for our initiatives to bare fruit and meaningfully benefit our financial results, it's encouraging that we have already seen early signs that our efforts are resonating with our consumers. 
I will now provide you with an update on the actions we are taking in our focus areas of product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience. Beginning with product innovation. We continue to leverage Michael's fashion luxury leadership and iconic runway heritage to further elevate our accessories product offerings. Importantly, we are also expanding our presence in other key categories including womenâ€™s ready-to-wear, footwear, men's sportswear, Men's Leather goods and ACCESS smartwatches. In our accessories assortments, the layering and increased fashion innovation that we injected into our offerings elicited excitement among our consumers, with the Mercer collection continuing to be a true favorite. New Mercer styles with feminine novelty detailing, including studs, perforation, crystals and leather inlays garnered outstanding response. In addition, the hardware branding details we offered on shoulder bags, including the Sloan Editor and [ Mott ] collections were well received among consumers. Finally, the launch of our iconic Jet Set signature pattern in a smaller size was also a notable success. We remain pleased with the performance of products that provide opportunities for customization and personalization. Consumers continue to take advantage of the opportunity to personalize their leather goods through our monogramming services, which we offer in our digital flagships and select retail stores. In addition, we continue to see strong response to our customizable product offerings, including our mix-and-match guitar straps, as well as our Selma Swap handbag. Our fall accessories assortments will build on this momentum beginning with the launch of Bancroft from the Michael Kors Collection line. This important new group is a first step in expanding our collection offers. In addition, we're introducing Sadie into our Michael, Michael Kors line. Sadie is a new satchel collection with a cool fashion sensibility featuring chain inlay detailing. Both Bancroft and Sadie will be featured in our upcoming fall fashion campaign as part of our efforts to showcase these new collections through a 360-degree marketing efforts generating excitement and creating desire for these innovative products. We also continue to see positive response to our enhanced assortment of womenâ€™s ready-to-wear and footwear. The increased innovation and elevated positioning of our assortments was well received and our expanded dress offerings continue to garner exceptional response from consumers contributing to growth in our women's ready-to-wear business during the quarter. Men's sportswear and luxury goods also continue to exhibit positive momentum in the quarter. In sportswear, the consumer responded well to our fashion introductions in woven and knit-classifications. Our Greenwich knit polo is now becoming a best seller at retail. In leather goods, we saw strong response to our expanded offerings, including Bryant and Harrison groups. Backpacks are now the #1 selling silhouette in our collections. In addition, our iconic Jet Set signature collection continues to perform well and we saw a particularly strong response to our camouflage print as part of our Father's Day gift efforts. With respect to the watch business. ACCESS smartwatches remain an important and growing category. Consumers continue to respond well with an increased array of styles, plaidings and interchangeable strap options. For the Fall season, we are excited introduced 2 new ACCESS smartwatches styles, Sofie and Grayson. These styles will help fuel our growth of smartwatches, which we anticipate will reach 25% of our overall watch sales by year-end. We also continued to expand our leadership in fashion wearable technology. During the quarter, we launched My Social, a feature that enables users to link to their Instagram account and set a personal post photo as their watch face. In addition, consumers were highly engaged with our expanded offering of watch styles as we have seen more than 4.5 million watch face changes since April. 
Turning to brand engagement. We continue to leverage Michael's iconic image and fashion leadership as we deepen our bond with consumers and enhanced excitement of our brands. Michael's strong presence in the fashion industry was showcased at the Met Gala where an ensemble of celebrities were dressed in his design, including [ Kerri Washington ] Mandy Moore, Elizabeth Banks, Natasha Foley and [ Yang Mi ]. Impressive celebrity lineup garnered significant global print and broadcast media coverage as well as 297 million global impressions across various social media channels. In June, Michael traveled to London to celebrate the launch of [ Tacklers ] English Roses. This multimedia exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery showcases the work of the acclaimed photographer, [ David Burton ]. The portfolio features the most exciting, interesting and beautiful women in Britain right now, many of whom were photographed wearing looks from the fall 2017 Michael Kors Collection. The event generated great global press and digital exposure across the globe.  
Finally, turning the customer experience. We continue to focus on elevating the brand experience in our digital flagships and brick-and-mortar stores. As part of these efforts, we continue to expand our global presence with the launch of 12 additional European digital flagships in the quarter. We now serve a total of 23 countries globally. We also launched a number features to support our efforts to grow ready-to-wear and footwear penetration in the channel. These efforts include the launch of our online dress shop as well as the rollout of Kors style, which allows customers to view Michael's head-to-toe styles of the season and buy them in a single transaction. 
Now turning to the details of the quarter's financial performance. Total revenue was $952 million, a decrease of 3.6%. Retail comparable sales decreased 5.9% and earnings per share was $0.80, a 3.6% decline year-over-year. In the Americas, total revenue declined 8.2% in the quarter. We continue to take steps to increase excitement and desire for our assortments, deepening the innovation and layering our offerings. In addition, we remain focused on taking action to elevate our brand positioning as we reduce promotional activity in our digital flagships, Lifestyle stores and wholesale channel. In the Americas, retail net sales were flat with comparable sales declining in the mid-single digits. E-commerce continue to perform well with a double-digit comparable sales increase in the quarter. In addition, consumers responded well to the more elevated and layered assortments in our digital flagships and retail stores, which help to drive mid-single digit increases in AUR for handbags and ready-to-wear in the quarter. However, this was more than offset by the decline in volume as a result of our strategic decision to reduce brand-wide promotional days in our digital flagship and Lifestyle stores, which declined 56% as compared to last year. In the Americas, wholesale net sales declined 19.5% largely driven by our decision to strategically reduced sell-in and limit promotional activity in this channel. In the first quarter, there were 42 fewer brand-wide promotional days as compared to last year. We believe this is absolutely the right long-term decision for our brand despite the near-term sales pressure. As I mentioned earlier, there was positive consumer response to our more elevated and layered assortments, which help to drive AUR increases in women's accessories, footwear and ready-to-wear in the quarter in this channel. 
Moving to Europe. Total revenue declined 10.2%. In the retail channel, net sales grew 2.5% with a comparable sales decline in the low teens on a reported basis and high single digits on a constant-currency basis. Please note, including e-commerce sales and on a constant-currency basis, European comparable sales results would have been modestly positive for the quarter. The sequential improvement in comparable sales performance was partially driven by better tourism trends in the quarter led by improving performance from Chinese and Russian visitors, although local trends remained soft. European wholesale net sales declined 28.4% largely as a result of our strategic decision to reduce shipments into the channel as part of our efforts to protect brand health and elevate our positioning. 
Turning to Asia. This region continues to perform well with total revenue growth of 60.2% in the quarter. Asia retail net sales grew 104.8% largely as a result of the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. Comparable sales, which currently exclude China, decreased in the low single digits on a reported basis, but increased in the low single digits on a constant-currency basis. Including China, comparable sales for Asia increased in the low single digits on a reported basis and in the mid-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Asia wholesale net sales decreased 47% primarily as a result of the shift of China sales to our company-owned Retail segment. We continue to see strong performance in Mainland China and Japan, which was partially offset by weaker performance in South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau, which continue to be impacted by the decline in Mainland Chinese tourists. 
Finally, in our licensing business, revenue decreased 5.6% in the quarter. We saw continued strong performance from ACCESS smartwatches, which was offset by declines in fashion watches. We are pleased with the continued strong momentum of ACCESS smartwatches, and we believe they will reach 25% of our total watch sales by year-end. In fragrance, we added another scent our Wonderlust collection with the July launch of Wonderlust Essence. The scent is a more intense richer version of the original. We are also excited to expand the category this fall with the global launch of a major new fragrance, Sexy Ruby. In eyewear, consumers responded well to the [ Leah ] open-wider aviators and the [ Ella ] which featured a trendy double brow feature. 
In conclusion, we are pleased that our first quarter results outperformed our expectations but continue to believe fiscal 2018 will be a transition year for Michael Kors as we execute on our strategic plan, Runway 2020. We are intently focused on raising the level of fashion luxury innovation, elevating our store experience and expanding our global presence. As I stated earlier, it will take some time before our actions translate into improved financial performance. However, we are encouraged by early indicators of success as well as customer feedback and enhanced engagement. Overall, we are confident that we have the right plan in place and are committed to a successful execution. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom."

I'd like to cover our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, provide an update on our forward outlook for the second quarter and full year and conclude with some additional perspective on the Jimmy Choo acquisition. 
For the first quarter, we reported net income of $125.5 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, which was ahead of our expectations, largely due to higher-than-anticipated retail comparable sales results. This represents a 3.6% decline compared to last year, including $11.3 million of onetime cost associated with the acquisition of the Greater China license. Excluding these onetime cost, earnings per share decreased 11.1% in the quarter. 
Moving to top line performance. Total revenue was $952.4 million, a decline of 3.6% compared to last year. Retail net sales increased 10.1% largely driven by 67 net new store openings and the impact of the acquisition of the Greater China license. This was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 5.9% in the quarter with North America e-commerce contributing 330 basis points of benefit. Wholesale net sales declined 23.0% due to our strategic decision to reduce sell-in in order to protect the long-term health of our brand in North America and Europe as well as the shift of China sales to our company-owned Retail segment. In the Licensing segment, revenue decreased 5.6%, primarily due to the absence of licensing revenue associated with the previously licensed business in Greater China, while fashion watch decline were almost entirely offset by increases in ACCESS smartwatch revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was roughly in line with our expectations at 60.3% compared to 59.9% last year. This year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to the growth of retail sales as a percentage of total revenue. Retail gross margin increased 120 basis points, which was largely due to an increase in international sales as a percentage of the total. As we anticipated, wholesale gross margin declined 490 basis points. This performance reflected higher allowances related to margin assistance to our wholesale channel partners as well as a strategic pricing initiatives designed to create higher sell-throughs on core products. We expect this margin trend will continue through the balance of the year. 
Total adjusted operating expense increased $32.3 million to 44.7% of revenue compared to 39.8% in the prior year. The increase in expense as a percent of revenue was due to both deleverage and the inclusion of our business in Greater China. Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 15.7% compared to 20.1% in the prior year. Adjusted retail operating margin was 14.9% versus 13.8% in the first quarter fiscal 2017. This year-over-year increase was driven by higher gross margin as adjusted retail operating expense were roughly in line with sales. Wholesale operating margin was 14.3% compared to 26.6% in the prior year. This anticipated decrease in wholesale operating margin was primarily the result of expense deleverage on lower sales as well as the decline in wholesale gross margin. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $273.7 million in cash and cash equivalent and a debt balance of $155.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $14.8 million and were related to retail store openings and renovations as well as continued investments in information systems enhancements. Additionally, we spent $157.8 million repurchasing approximately 4.5 million shares and have $842.2 million remaining under our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Michael Kors generate significant free cash flow, maintains a strong balance sheet, and will remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Following the completion of the Jimmy Choo acquisition, we plan to prioritize debt repayment as our primary use of free cash flow to rapidly delever to achieve our target lease adjusted leverage ratio of 2.0 to 2.25x. To support this, we intend to discontinue our share repurchase activity through the balance of this fiscal year. 
Now turning to our guidance. We are raising the full year outlook to reflect the better-than-anticipated first quarter results, partially offset by our decision to stop our share repurchase activity for the remainder of fiscal 2018. For the full year, we now expect total revenue to be approximately $4.275 billion with a mid-single digit decrease in comparable sales. Gross margin is still expected to be approximately 60.0% and operating expenses expected to be approximately 44.0% of total revenue, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 16.0%. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $3.62 to $3.72 assuming a tax rate of 17% with 156 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1 billion -- $1,035 billion and $1,055 billion with a mid-single digit decrease in comparable sales. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 59.3% and operating expense is expected to be approximately 45.0% of total revenue resulting in an operating margin of approximately 14.3%. Diluted earnings per share expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.84. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 15% and weighted average shares outstanding of 154 million. We continue to plan capital expenditures at approximately $200 million, which will be focused on select new store openings, renovation to our retail store fleet and investment in information system enhancements. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we expect to incur $100 million to $125 million in onetime expenses over the next 2 years as we close between 100 to 125 stores. The guidance I just provided includes assumptions about the ongoing impact of revenue as well as to operating and depreciation and amortization costs but excludes any onetime cost associated with these plans. For fiscal 2018, we expect to close between 20 and 40 stores with onetime costs between $40 million and $60 million, predominantly in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the Jimmy Choo acquisition. I'd like to provide some additional thoughts on our expectations for Jimmy Choo as it relates to our financial outlook, transaction and transition cost and foreign exchange risk. Please note that these expectations have not been incorporated into the guidance I just provided as the transaction has not yet been completed. Based on our internal forecast for Jimmy Choo, and assuming a close early in our third fiscal quarter, we expect incremental revenue of approximately $275 million for the second half of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, we expect incremental revenue of approximately $570 million to $580 million. Based on these assumptions and our anticipated free cash flow generation of Jimmy Choo, we expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive on a cash basis. We expect the acquisition to be dilutive to EPS in the low single digit percentage range in both fiscal '18 and '19 and accretive in the low single digits in fiscal 2020, the second full year after acquisition. These expectations exclude one-time transaction and transition costs. With respect to these one-time costs, we forecast transaction costs related to the acquisition to be between $40 million and $50 million and transition cost to be between $20 million and $30 million over the next 2 years as we integrate Jimmy Choo into the broader group. In addition, the mitigate foreign exchange risk related to the British pound purchase price we have entered into a foreign exchange hedge. This type of position does not receive hedge accounting treatment, and we will report mark-to-market gains and losses through our income statement until the completion of the transaction. With respect to financing. We ultimately plan to finance the acquisition through a combination of term loan and longer-term bond and we anticipated a weighted average rate of 4.25% to 4.75%. We look forward to updating you on the forecast for the combined group following the close of the transaction. 
With that, I will turn it back over to John for closing remarks."

And then one follow-up on the wholesale revenue.

The most exciting thing that happened to us in the quarter was the increase in AUR, which I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as you recall",1074,"Thank you, Kimberly, and I'll start with your first question and just give some brief update on the categories. The most exciting thing that happened to us in the quarter was the increase in AUR, which I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as you recall a few quarters back, we said that we have made the decision to create a promotional policy for the company that would really increase AURs over time because we felt that there was too much activity of the brand being put on sale really just at multiple different time periods. So that has absolutely had a positive impact across our own retail distribution and in the wholesale channel as well. So AURs are definitively up. The second part that has helped the AURs again, in our retail channel and the wholesale channel, is the fact that we took 5 groups and we focused those 5 groups on price points that we thought would improve full-price sell-throughs. We went back and looked at where was the product going ""out the door at"" and really analyzed where the customers response was the highest for us. And that obviously has impacted our wholesale gross margins, but we've seen the improved sell-throughs as it relates to that strategy. I might add that what you're going to see happen really comes spring season and through the balance of calendar 2018 is we will now begin to layer up price points in our own stores and the wholesale channel, in particular, our own stores we will start that with the Michael Kors Collection handbags, I talked to you about Bancroft, which landed in the stores a few weeks ago and we've had tremendous sell-throughs on this product, which we're very excited about. It's an expensive product, averaging approximately $1,000 on a bag. And that's really been -- showed us the power of the brand and the customer's desire when the product is right and that product by the way is made 100% in Italy. And so we're really going after product that has craftsmanship as we talked about in our whole brand positioning. So I would tell you that while the accessories category was down in total, the AURs are up and the full-price sell-throughs are up, and that's exactly where we wanted to be at this point in time. And what I'm also excited about, and we've talked about this previously, we're going to put hundreds of millions of dollars less product into the marketplace for Michael Kors handbags. That is going to create a bit more scarcity, and we believe a bit more desire, so we feel like we're on the right path there. And then just concluding obviously, the product that we have delivered -- we're going to deliver for spring season, we're right on track with where we wanted to be with innovation and as we spoke about that before, that'll be between 65% and 70% newness come spring season on the floors in our stores and in our wholesale accounts. That's going to be terrific. In terms of women's ready-to-wear, the business is performing very, very strong. We're comping up over last year and very strong numbers in our own stores and we're starting to see the same trend in our wholesale distribution both domestically and internationally, and we've made some great changes to that product and brought a lot of innovation. And Michael and the design teams have just kind of, in our opinion, done a spectacular job there as they are starting to do the same in accessories. So customers are responding to that, we feel really good about that. Footwear, also is seeing great response. Again we're one of the leaders, in particular, in the active -- fashion active market, great response there. And we're going to take on some additional categories, in particular, more dress footwear, which is going to go with that ramp up in our women's ready-to-wear and as we talked about on our e-commerce site, we have the ability with Kors style, she can click through and buy the whole look. That's an important way that we're going to continue to show our fashion leadership. In terms of watches, I think we are not going to call a bottom yet, but we're definitely seeing improvement. Smartwatches are retailing, she is responding. We have 2 great new styles coming for the fall and holiday season. So we're very hopeful that, that acceleration continues for us. And we hope that the category will be reinvigorated, in particular, because of the smartwatch initiatives we're taking. And I might add, we have an incredible partnership with Google that we'll be talking to you more about in our upcoming call, but we are partnering with them on some very significant programs for the Fall season that I think will create a lot of consumer engagement, desire and ultimately, sales for us. And then lastly, while it's a small, we're getting some really good response to our men's business. We saw very strong comp store increases in the men's business both at wholesale and at retail. And again, it's not big enough yet to impact our company. But the early indications are over the next few years, this is going to be a powerful business for the company. And again, as we've said, our goal is to rightsize our accessories business and then have it have some low single-digit growth starting next year and then really have these other categories augment our Lifestyle stores and our wholesale distribution and provide a bit more accelerated growth as they're underpenetrated to our total company and in the marketplace in terms of competition. And then lastly, to answer your question on wholesale, it's early days. We are feeling and we are planning with our partners that next calendar year, we will start to see some small increases in the business and we're hopeful that, that is what's going to happen. We have been to get through the holiday season. But the response to what the consumers have seen in our other wholesale customers have seen in our showrooms is quite strong and I think they're feeling good about where we are executing against our plan with them to reduce promotional activity, bringing a greater scarcity level of product, particularly in North American markets and get AURs up in full-price AUR selling. So sorry for the long-winded answer but thank you, Kimberly."

John, just can you expand upon, you had a nice impressive result that you talked about in the AUR inflection. I think it's the first time in a number of years now.

Can you just give us some perspective on what you think silhouette changes come through in the next 12 months to impact AUR either up or down from here? And then the other thing that kind of stood out in the numbers was the inflection in the Retail segment margins. I think it was mentioned that the gross margin improved there. Just get some sense of are we seeing the floor in the Retail segment margins? And what can we kind of think about now that we're seeing to see some stabilization in your business model or business, where the retail operating margins can re-shake back out on a normalized basis going forward over the next couple of years, because it seems like it's starting to kind of move higher and just want to get some perspective on the drivers of that change going forward."

On the AUR side, the thing that will continue to drive AUR for the next I'd call it almost 12 months is going to be the reduction in promotional activity. That will be the single-largest driver. The second driver of that will actually be our introduction of higher price points into the business. And that's not just raising prices but it's actually delivering fashion that's very evident to the consumer and we're really working again with Michael and the design teams on innovative materials and workmanship to that product because clearly, the customer wants that. They want something that's going to be -- look different for them and look different with their wardrobe. And then customization will also help to drive AUR. Again, we're seeing a lot of response to monogramming and all the different areas, whether it's guitar straps we talked about and whatnot that's going to become a significant part of the business as we move forward for anyone in this category. That's the tailwinds. The headwind is unfortunately, some of the small leather goods business is being impacted as you see with payment plans coming on through all different vendors, there's less need for cash and in some cases, credit cards. So there is some impact in that business that we're experiencing, which does hurt a little bit as smaller wallet sales are becoming more popular as opposed to larger wallet sales. So again, we'll just have to see how that shakes out. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one of the real key drivers in the Men's Leather good business is backpacks and we're seeing thing emerge in the women's business. And that's -- it's really shaking out. It's taking a lot of the tote business and there's a lot of shifting into that category so I will call that neutral, but it's definitely a trend that's happening out at retail and I think we're right there to take advantage of it. It's very much a fashion trend. In terms of the retail margins, what you're seeing is, first and foremost, mix shift on a global basis, which we had talked about over the last couple of quarters. That as the Asian business ahs brought on, which has higher gross margin and as retail in total is becoming a bigger mix of the company, you're seeing the gross margins favorably impacted. And we think that's going to continue to go forward. Again, we've given guidance and we think that, that guidance is pretty steady. On the operating margin side, where you're seeing improvements, again that's a mix of what you're seeing happen in terms of the Asian businesses, which are more profitable. But you're also seeing us being able to -- as the comps begin to normalize in our business in North America and in Europe, we're going to stop that deleverage that you're seeing, and hopefully, as we get to flat or slightly increased comps, we're going to create leverage. And then I also want to remind you that we've talked about it many times. Unfortunately, as the commerce business grows, we have lower operating margins in that business. So that's kind of been a headwind for us. We're making progress in that business. We're making progress in improving our operating margins, again created by velocity and other activities that we're doing internally to help improve that. So I would tell you that we think that the retail business will ultimately grow in the operating margin in the out years and that will be driven by stabilization of comps, improvement in how we're operating our e-commerce business and ultimately, positive comps, which will create leverage for us."

I think our product that we're delivering is getting better and the customer is responding to that. I would say, the traffic trends really haven't changed at all. So that's not something that we're seeing as of yet. But we think that our conversion rates continue to accelerate inside of our stores. But there's definitely a slightly better feeling that we're seeing with the consumers coming into the store being a bit more optimistic and, I would say, also being more excited about fashion and innovation. I've said it before that I think our company needed to be more aggressive in its fashion and innovation and Michael and the design teams have done just a spectacular job with that. So I'd say it again, we're seeing business definitely improve. And I don't think it's a channel that's one channel versus the other. It's just a general -- there's a little bit of uptick that we're felling, so it gives us some optimism going into the Fall season the way that she is responding to newness. And also I want to leave you with one other thing too. The reduction in promotional activity, what we've seen is this she's not biting us on that. As long as we are giving her the right product, she's responding extremely well and our 2 best selling products being Mercer and our smartwatches have basically no sale, there are some limited colors that are on sale on Mercer but we really have shown that if it's the right product, you don't have to have these aggressive markdowns happening at retail and I think that's proving to be a real plus for us. Moving on to Jimmy Choo, super excited. I have to tell you that we've now had a number of meetings with the management team. We're heading off there again, this afternoon. And Pierre and Sandra and the management team there are just, I can't tell you how excited we are to have them as part of our organization and family and group, and we really believe in the plan that they've developed and are executing on. And I think it's too early to make any comments about synergies. I have said before, whatever synergies there will be -- won't be anything significant that we think that the biggest opportunity in acquiring Jimmy Choo and bringing into our fashion luxury group is the fact that this company, we very strongly believe, will grow to $1 billion. And if we, and the Jimmy Choo management team, were able to achieve that, we think that as Tom had stated earlier, that will add to some very nice accretion for the company in the long term. So if we're able to execute on 2020 and the Jimmy Choo plan rolls out as we anticipate, I think we will have a company that's delivering very significant revenue in totality with some very nice growth and operating earnings and net income earnings that will be growing in the future."

I think first, we know from the industry trend that product, we're in a cycle where more innovation is what the consumer is responding to, and we're not the only company seeing that. You certainly look at many of our luxury or European luxury competitors, and they're seeing the same type of response form the end consumer. And given that we're a global luxury brand, we don't just compete in North America, but we compete around the world. And we're sitting on the best streets in the world across from the best or next to the best competitors in the world. So we have to really excite the customer because she has choices. And we know that clearly in the women's ready-to-wear business where we got off to a little quicker start and being able to get that innovation in front of the consumer, the results have been outstanding. And so now we have actually customers coming in here saying, let's make it a little bigger next year. And we're going to slow and we're going to be patient about that. We have our own retail teams who are going, wow, let's get more of this in our stores and we're seeing the consumer respond. We saw that seen kind of reaction to this market when we opened up with our accessories collection for our teams and our retail partners walked in and said, wow, this is different. Our customers is going to respond to this. Some of this innovation is based on taking the bag like Mercer, which is a group like Mercer, which is very strong and powerful for us, and creating layer up in that. Some of this is based upon areas that are very strong in terms of fashion trends like backpacks we talked about. And some of these is a new groups that we're introducing. a little bit of that will happen as we said already in the holiday season we have new introductions that are going to be coming in, in particular in calendar Q4, which will be right before the holiday season. So we'll get some reactions from that and be able to chase those products where the consumer does react strongly to. So anything that the strategy is across all product categories inside the company. And so that really gives us the feeling that we're on the right track and again, early results of what we're seeing in some of the newness and innovation, which I talked about in the previous call in some of the layer up products and 1 or 2 of the new styles that we introduced have been quite good. So I think the response from our teams, response from the wholesale accounts and early indications from the end consumer have given us reason to feel that we're on the right track with Runway 2020. It's still going to take time, that being said, I think we got the right plan in place."

We are in an exciting and transformative time for our company.

We are in an exciting and transformative time for our company. We recently announced that Michael Kors Holdings Limited is forming a global fashion luxury group with our acquisition of Jimmy Choo, bringing together 2 iconic companies and creating a platform for future acquisitions. The foundation of our group will be built on fashion authority with craftsmanship and heritage at the core.
Jimmy Choo embodies all of these elements and is an excellent fit for our group. The brand has been a leader in designing glamorous, innovative, expertly crafted footwear and accessories that have resonated with luxury trendsetters for more than 20 years. Under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Pierre Denis and Creative Director Sandra Choi, the company has demonstrated an impressive track record of consistent sales and earnings growth in addition to strong cash flow generation.
We believe Jimmy Choo can reach $1 billion in revenue over time as we partner with Pierre, Sandra and the rest of the talented management team to build the brand's online presence, expand its retail footprint globally and accelerate growth in the accessories and men's categories. Through the formation of a global fashion luxury group, we expect to enhance long-term value for shareholders by growing the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo's businesses, while diversifying our product and geographic mix. 
Now moving to the quarter's performance. This morning, we reported first quarter fiscal 2018 results, which were ahead of our expectations, largely as a result of better-than-anticipated comparable sales performance in our retail segment in North America and Europe. We have also begun to execute our strategic plan, Runway 2020, to reposition our company for future growth. These efforts are expected to drive improved financial performance as we generate even greater appeal for our fashion luxury assortments, deepen consumers' connection with our brand and further elevate exceptional jet-set experience that we offer online and in our stores. It is still early in the process, but we have certainly begun to lay the foundation for future success. While we recognize that it will take time for our initiatives to bare fruit and meaningfully benefit our financial results, it is encouraging that we have already seen early signs that our efforts are resonating with our consumers. 
I will now provide you with an update on the actions we are taking in our focus areas of product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience. Beginning with product innovation. We continue to leverage Michael's fashion luxury leadership and iconic runway heritage to further elevate our accessories product offerings. Importantly, we are also expanding our presence in other key categories, including women's ready-to-wear, footwear, men's sportswear, men's leather goods and ACCESS smartwatches.
In our accessories assortments, the layering and increased fashion innovation that we injected into our offerings elicited excitement among our consumers, with the Mercer collection continuing to be a true favorite. New Mercer styles with feminine novelty detailing, including studs, perforation, crystals and leather inlays, garnered outstanding response. In addition, the hardware branding details we offered on shoulder bags, including the Sloan Editor and Mott collections, were well-received among consumers. Finally, the launch of our iconic Jet Set signature pattern in a smaller size was also a notable success.
We remain pleased with the performance of products that provide opportunities for customization and personalization. Consumers continue to take advantage of the opportunity to personalize their leather goods through our monogramming services, which we offer in our digital flagships and select retail stores. In addition, we continue to see strong response to our customizable product offerings, including our mix-and-match guitar straps as well as our Selma Swap handbag.
Our fall accessories assortments will build on this momentum beginning with the launch of Bancroft from the Michael Kors Collection line. This important new group is a first step in expanding our collection offerings. In addition, we are introducing Sadie into our MICHAEL Michael Kors line. Sadie is a new soft satchel collection with a cool fashion sensibility featuring chain inlay detailing. Both Bancroft and Sadie will be featured in our upcoming fall fashion campaign as part of our efforts to showcase these new collections through a 360-degree marketing effort generating excitement and creating desire for these innovative products.
We also continue to see positive response to our enhanced assortment of women's ready-to-wear and footwear. The increased innovation and elevated positioning of our assortments was well-received, and our expanded dress offerings continued to garner exceptional response from consumers, contributing to growth in our women's ready-to-wear business during the quarter.
Men's sportswear and luxury goods also continued to exhibit positive momentum in the quarter. In sportswear, the consumer responded well to our fashion introductions in woven and knit classifications. Our Greenwich knit polo is now becoming a bestseller at retail. In leather goods, we saw strong response to our expanded offerings, including Bryant and Harrison groups. Backpacks are now the #1-selling silhouette in our collections. In addition, our iconic Jet Set signature collection continues to perform well, and we saw a particularly strong response to our camouflage print as part of our Father's Day gift efforts.
With respect to the watch business. ACCESS smartwatches remain an important and growing category. Consumers continue to respond well to the increased array of styles, plaidings and interchangeable strap options. For the fall season, we are excited to introduce 2 new ACCESS smartwatches styles, Sofie and Grayson. These styles will help fuel our growth of smartwatches, which we anticipate will reach 25% of our overall watch sales by year-end.
We also continued to expand our leadership in fashion wearable technology. During the quarter, we launched My Social, a feature that enables users to link to their Instagram account and set a personal post photo as their watch face. In addition, consumers were highly engaged with our expanded offering of watch styles as we have seen more than 4.5 million watch face changes since April. 
Turning to brand engagement. We continue to leverage Michael's iconic image and fashion leadership as we deepen our bond with consumers and enhance excitement of our brand. Michael's strong presence in the fashion industry was showcased at the Met Gala where an ensemble of celebrities were dressed in his designs, including Kerry Washington, Mandy Moore, Elizabeth Banks, Natasha Poly and Yang Mi. The impressive celebrity lineup garnered significant global print and broadcast media coverage as well as 297 million global impressions across various social media channels.
In June, Michael traveled to London to celebrate the launch of Tatler's English Roses. This multimedia exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery showcases the work of the acclaimed photographer, David Burton. The portfolio features the most exciting, interesting and beautiful women in Britain right now, many of whom were photographed wearing looks from the Fall 2017 Michael Kors Collection. The event generated great global press and digital exposure across the globe.
Finally, turning to customer experience. We continue to focus on elevating the brand experience in our digital flagships and brick-and-mortar stores. As part of these efforts, we continue to expand our global presence with the launch of 12 additional European digital flagships in the quarter. We now serve a total of 23 countries globally. We also launched a number features to support our efforts to grow ready-to-wear and footwear penetration in the channel. These efforts include the launch of our online dress shop as well as the rollout of Kors Style, which allows customers to view Michael's head-to-toe styles of the season and buy them in a single transaction. 
Now turning to the details of the quarter's financial performance. Total revenue was $952 million, a decrease of 3.6%. Retail comparable sales decreased 5.9%. And earnings per share was $0.80, a 3.6% decline year-over-year.
In the Americas, total revenue declined 8.2% in the quarter. We continue to take steps to increase excitement and desire for our assortments, deepening the innovation and layering our offerings. In addition, we remain focused on taking action to elevate our brand positioning as we reduce promotional activity in our digital flagships, lifestyle stores and wholesale channel. In the Americas, retail net sales were flat, with comparable sales declining in the mid-single digits. E-commerce continue to perform well with a double-digit comparable sales increase in the quarter.
In addition, consumers responded well to the more elevated and layered assortments in our digital flagships and retail stores, which helped to drive mid-single-digit increases in AUR for handbags and ready-to-wear in the quarter. However, this was more than offset by the decline in volume as a result of our strategic decision to reduce brand-wide promotional days in our digital flagship and lifestyle stores, which declined 56% as compared to last year.
In the Americas, wholesale net sales declined 19.5%, largely driven by our decision to strategically reduce sell-in and limit promotional activity in this channel. In the first quarter, there were 42 fewer brand-wide promotional days as compared to last year. We believe this is absolutely the right long-term decision for our brand despite the near-term sales pressure. As I mentioned earlier, there was positive consumer response to our more elevated and layered assortments, which helped to drive AUR increases in women's accessories, footwear and ready-to-wear in the quarter in this channel. 
Moving to Europe. Total revenue declined 10.2%. In the retail channel, net sales grew 2.5%, with a comparable sales decline in the low teens on a reported basis and high single digits on a constant-currency basis. Please note, including e-commerce sales and on a constant-currency basis, European comparable sales results would have been modestly positive for the quarter. The sequential improvement in comparable sales performance was partially driven by better tourism trends in the quarter, led by improving performance from Chinese and Russian visitors, although local trends remained soft. European wholesale net sales declined 28.4%, largely as a result of our strategic decision to reduce shipments into the channel as part of our efforts to protect brand health and elevate our positioning. 
Turning to Asia. This region continues to perform well with total revenue growth of 60.2% in the quarter. Asia retail net sales grew 104.8%, largely as a result of the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. Comparable sales, which currently exclude China, decreased in the low single digits on a reported basis, but increased in the low single digits on a constant-currency basis. Including China, comparable sales for Asia increased in the low single digits on a reported basis and in the mid-single digits on a constant-currency basis.
Asia wholesale net sales decreased 47%, primarily as a result of the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. We continue to see strong performance in Mainland China and Japan, which was partially offset by weaker performance in South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau, which continue to be impacted by the decline in Mainland Chinese tourists. 
Finally, in our licensing business, revenue decreased 5.6% in the quarter. We saw continued strong performance from ACCESS smartwatches, which was offset by declines in fashion watches. We are pleased with the continued strong momentum of ACCESS smartwatches, and we believe they will reach 25% of our total watch sales by year-end.
In fragrance, we added another scent to our Wonderlust collection with the July launch of Wonderlust Essence. The scent is a more intense, richer version of the original. We are also excited to expand the category this fall with the global launch of a major new fragrance, Sexy Ruby. In eyewear, consumers responded well to the Lia open-wire aviators and the Ila, which featured a trendy double-brow feature. 
In conclusion, we are pleased that our first quarter results outperformed our expectations, but continue to believe fiscal 2018 will be a transition year for Michael Kors as we execute on our strategic plan, Runway 2020. We are intently focused on raising the level of fashion luxury innovation, elevating our store experience and expanding our global presence. As I stated earlier, it will take some time before our actions translate into improved financial performance. However, we are encouraged by early indicators of success as well as customer feedback and enhanced engagement. Overall, we are confident that we have the right plan in place and are committed to a successful execution. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom."
143971118,531128427,1271498,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2017",2017-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John. I'd like to cover our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, provide an update on our forward outlook for the second quarter and full year, and conclude with some additional perspective on the Jimmy Choo acquisition. For the firs",1297,"Thank you, John. I'd like to cover our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, provide an update on our forward outlook for the second quarter and full year, and conclude with some additional perspective on the Jimmy Choo acquisition. 
For the first quarter, we reported net income of $125.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share, which was ahead of our expectations, largely due to higher-than-anticipated retail comparable sales results. This represents a 3.6% decline compared to last year, including $11.3 million of onetime costs associated with the acquisition of the Greater China license. Excluding these onetime costs, earnings per share decreased 11.1% in the quarter. 
Moving to top line performance. Total revenue was $952.4 million, a decline of 3.6% compared to last year. Retail net sales increased 10.1%, largely driven by 67 net new store openings and the impact of the acquisition of the Greater China license. This was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 5.9% in the quarter, with North America e-commerce contributing 330 basis points of benefit. 
Wholesale net sales declined 23.0% due to our strategic decision to reduce sell-in in order to protect the long-term health of our brand in North America and Europe as well as the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment.
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 5.6%, primarily due to the absence of licensing revenue associated with the previously licensed business in Greater China, while fashion watch declines were almost entirely offset by increases in ACCESS smartwatch revenue.
Gross margin for the quarter was roughly in line with our expectations at 60.3% compared to 59.9% last year. This year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to the growth of retail sales as a percentage of total revenue. Retail gross margin increased 120 basis points, which was largely due to an increase in international sales as a percentage of the total.
As we anticipated, wholesale gross margin declined 490 basis points. This performance reflected higher allowances related to margin assistance to our wholesale channel partners as well as strategic pricing initiatives designed to create higher sell-throughs on core products. We expect this margin trend will continue through the balance of the year. 
Total adjusted operating expense increased $32.3 million to 44.7% of revenue compared to 39.8% in the prior year. The increase in expense as a percent of revenue was due to both deleverage and the inclusion of our business in Greater China.
Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 15.7% compared to 20.1% in the prior year. Adjusted retail operating margin was 14.9% versus 13.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This year-over-year increase was driven by higher gross margin as adjusted retail operating expense were roughly in line with sales.
Wholesale operating margin was 14.3% compared to 26.6% in the prior year. This anticipated decrease in wholesale operating margin was primarily the result of expense deleverage on lower sales as well as the decline in wholesale gross margin. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $273.7 million in cash and cash equivalent and a debt balance of $155.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $14.8 million and were related to retail store openings and renovations as well as continued investments in information systems enhancements. Additionally, we spent $157.8 million repurchasing approximately 4.5 million shares and have $842.2 million remaining under our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
Michael Kors generate significant free cash flow, maintains a strong balance sheet and will remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Following the completion of the Jimmy Choo acquisition, we plan to prioritize debt repayment as our primary use of free cash flow to rapidly delever to achieve our target lease adjusted leverage ratio of 2.0x to 2.25x. To support this, we intend to discontinue our share repurchase activity through the balance of this fiscal year. 
Now turning to our guidance. We are raising the full year outlook to reflect the better-than-anticipated first quarter results, partially offset by our decision to stop our share repurchase activity for the remainder of fiscal 2018. For the full year, we now expect total revenue to be approximately $4.275 billion with a mid-single-digit decrease in comparable sales.
Gross margin is still expected to be approximately 60.0%, and operating expense is expected to be approximately 44.0% of total revenue, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 16.0%.
Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $3.62 to $3.72, assuming a tax rate of 17% with 156 million weighted average shares outstanding.
For the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1 billion -- $1.035 billion and $1.055 billion with a mid-single-digit decrease in comparable sales.
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 59.3%, and operating expense is expected to be approximately 45.0% of total revenue, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 14.3%.
Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.84. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 15% and weighted average shares outstanding of 154 million. 
We continue to plan capital expenditures at approximately $200 million, which will be focused on select new store openings, renovations to our retail store fleet and investment in information system enhancements.
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we expect to incur $100 million to $125 million in onetime expenses over the next 2 years as we close between 100 and 125 stores. The guidance I just provided includes assumptions about the ongoing impact to revenue as well as to operating and depreciation and amortization costs, but excludes any onetime costs associated with these plans.
For fiscal 2018, we expect to close between 20 and 40 stores with onetime costs between $40 million and $60 million, predominantly in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the Jimmy Choo acquisition. I'd like to provide some additional thoughts on our expectations for Jimmy Choo as it relates to our financial outlook, transaction and transition costs and foreign exchange risk. Please note that these expectations have not been incorporated into the guidance I just provided as the transaction has not yet been completed.
Based on our internal forecast for Jimmy Choo and assuming a close early in our third fiscal quarter, we expect incremental revenue of approximately $275 million for the second half of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, we expect incremental revenue of approximately $570 million to $580 million.
Based on these assumptions and our anticipated free cash flow generation of Jimmy Choo, we expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive on a cash basis. We expect the acquisition to be dilutive to EPS in the low single-digit percentage range in both fiscal '18 and '19 and accretive in the low single digits in fiscal 2020, the second full year after acquisition. These expectations exclude one-time transaction and transition costs.
With respect to these one-time costs, we forecast transaction costs related to the acquisition to be between $40 million and $50 million and transition costs to be between $20 million and $30 million over the next 2 years as we integrate Jimmy Choo into the broader group.
In addition, to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to the British pound purchase price, we have entered into a foreign exchange hedge. This type of position does not receive hedge accounting treatment, and we will record mark-to-market gains and losses through our income statement until the completion of the transaction.
With respect to financing, we ultimately plan to finance the acquisition through a combination of term loan and longer-term bond, and we anticipated a weighted average cost of 4.25% to 4.75%. We look forward to updating you on the forecast for the combined group following the close of the transaction. 
With that, I will turn it back over to John for closing remarks."

And then one follow-up, on the wholesale revenue, if you could talk about sort of look out over the next 2 years and give us your best guess at where you think, once the wholesale channel is cleaned up and the promotional days are down to where you want them to be, what does that wholesale revenue look like in total?"
143971118,531128427,1271498,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2017",2017-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, Kimberly. I'll start with your first question and just give some brief updates on the categories. The most exciting thing that happened to us in the quarter was the increase in AUR, which I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as you recall, a",1078,"Thank you, Kimberly. I'll start with your first question and just give some brief updates on the categories. The most exciting thing that happened to us in the quarter was the increase in AUR, which I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as you recall, a few quarters back, we said that we had made the decision to create a promotional policy for the company that would really increase AURs over time because we felt that there was too much activity of the brand being put on sale, really, just at multiple different time periods. So that has absolutely had a positive impact across our own retail distribution and in the wholesale channel as well. So AURs are definitively up. The second part that has helped the AURs in, again, in our retail channel and the wholesale channel is the fact that we took 5 groups and we focused those 5 groups on price points that we thought would improve full-price sell-throughs. We went back and looked at where was the product going ""out the door"" at and really analyzed where the customers' response was the highest for us. And that obviously has impacted our wholesale gross margins, but we've seen the improved sell-throughs as it relates to that strategy. I might add that what you're going to see happen really comes spring season and through the balance of calendar 2018 is we will now begin to layer up price points in our own stores and the wholesale channel, in particular, in our own stores, we will start that with the Michael Kors Collection handbags. I talked to you about Bancroft, which landed in the stores a few weeks ago, and we've had tremendous sell-throughs on this product which we're very excited about. It's an expensive product, averaging approximately $1,000 on a bag. And that's really been -- showed us the power of the brand and the customer's desire when the product is right. And that product, by the way, is made 100% in Italy. And so we're really going after product that has craftsmanship as we've talked about in our whole brand positioning. So I would tell you that, while the accessories category was down in total, the AURs are up and the full-price sell-throughs are up, and that's exactly where we wanted to be at this point in time. And what I'm also excited about and we've talked about this previously, we're going to put hundreds of millions of dollars less product into the marketplace for Michael Kors handbags. That is going to create a bit more scarcity and we believe a bit more desire. So we feel like we're on the right path there. And then just concluding, obviously, that's a product that we have delivered -- or we are going to deliver for spring season. We're right on track with where we wanted to be with innovation. And as we spoke about that before, they'll be between 65% and 70% newness come spring season on the floors in our stores and in our wholesale accounts. That's going to be terrific. In terms of women's ready-to-wear, the business is performing very, very strong. We're comping up over last year and very strong numbers in our own stores, and we're starting to see the same trend in our wholesale distribution both domestically and internationally. And we've made some great changes to that product and brought a lot of innovation. And Michael and the design teams have just kind of, in our opinion, done a spectacular job there as they are starting to do the same in accessories. So customers responding to that, we feel really good about that. Footwear also is seeing great response. Again, we're one of the leaders, in particular, in the active -- fashion active market, great response there. And we're going to take on some additional categories, in particular, more dress footwear, which is going to go with that ramp-up in our women's ready-to-wear. And as we talked about, on our e-commerce site, we have the ability with Kors Style that she can click through and buy the whole look. That's an important way that we're going to continue to show our fashion leadership. In terms of watches, I think we are not going to call a bottom yet, but we're definitely seeing improvement. Smartwatches are retailing, she is responding. We have 2 great new styles coming for the fall and holiday season. So we're very hopeful that, that acceleration continues for us. And we hope that the category will be reinvigorated, in particular, because of the smartwatch initiatives we're taking. And I might add, we have an incredible partnership with Google that we'll be talking to you more about in our upcoming call. But we are partnering with them on some very significant programs for the fall season that I think will create a lot of consumer engagement, desire and ultimately, sales for us. And then lastly, while it's small, we're getting some really good response to our men's business. We saw very strong comp store increases in the men's business, both at wholesale and at retail. And again, it's not big enough yet to impact our company. But the early indications are over the next few years, this is going to be a powerful business for the company. And again, as we've said, our goal is to rightsize our accessories business and then have it have some low single-digit growth starting next year, and then really have these other categories augment our lifestyle stores and our wholesale distribution and provide a bit more accelerated growth as they're underpenetrated to our total company and in the marketplace in terms of competition. And then lastly, to answer your question on wholesale, it's early days. We are feeling and we are planning with our partners that next calendar year, we will start to see some small increases in the business. And we're hopeful that, that is what's going to happen. We have to get through the holiday season. And -- but the response to what the consumers have seen in our -- or the wholesale customers have seen in our showrooms is quite strong, and I think they're feeling good about where we are executing against our plan with them to reduce promotional activity, bring a greater scarcity level of product, particularly in North American markets and get AURs up in full-price selling. So sorry for the long-winded answer, but thank you, Kimberly."

John, just can you expand upon the -- you had a nice impressive result that you talked about on the AUR inflection. I think it's the first time in a number of years now.

Can you just give us some perspective on what you think silhouette changes come through in the next 12 months to impact AUR, either up or down from here? And then the other thing that kind of stood out in the numbers was the inflection in the retail segment margins. I think it was mentioned that the gross margin improved there. Just kind of give some sense of, are we seeing the floor in the retail segment margins? And what can we kind of think about, now we're starting to see some stabilization in your business model or business, where the retail operating margins can reshake back out on a normalized basis going forward over the next couple of years? Because it seems like it's starting to kind of move higher, and just want to get some perspective on the drivers of that change going forward."

On the AUR side, the thing that will continue to drive AUR for the next, I'd call it, almost 12 months is going to be the reduction in promotional activity. That will be the single-largest driver. The second driver of that will actually be our introduction of higher price points into the business, and that's not just raising prices, but it's actually delivering fashion that's very evident to the consumer. And we're really working again with Michael and the design teams on innovative materials and workmanship to that product because clearly, the customer wants that. They want something that's going to be -- look different for them and look different with their wardrobe. And then customization will also help to drive AUR. Again, we're seeing a lot of response to monogramming and all the different areas, whether it's the guitar straps we talked about and whatnot. That's going to become a significant part of the business as we move forward for anyone in this category. That's the tailwind. The headwind is, unfortunately, some of the small leather goods business is being impacted, as you see, with payment plans coming on through all different vendors, there's less need for cash and, in some cases, credit cards. So there is some impact in that business that we're experiencing, which does hurt a little bit as smaller wallet sales are becoming more popular as opposed to larger wallet sales. So again, we'll just have to see how that shakes out. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one of the real key drivers in the men's leather goods business is backpacks, and we're seeing the same thing emerge in the women's business. And that's -- it's really shaking out. It's taking a lot of the tote business, and there's a lot shifting into that category. So I would call that neutral, but it's definitely a trend that's happening out at retail, and I think we're right there to take advantage of it. It's very much a fashion trend. In terms of the retail margins, what you're seeing is, first and foremost, mix shift on a global basis, which we had talked about over the last couple of quarters, that as the Asian business has brought on, which has higher gross margins, and as retail in total is becoming a bigger mix of the company, you're seeing the gross margins favorably impacted. And we think that's going to continue to go forward. Again, we've given guidance, and we think that, that guidance is pretty steady. On the operating margin side where you're seeing improvements, again, that's a mix of what you're seeing happen in terms of the Asian businesses, which are more profitable. But you're also seeing us being able to -- as the comps begin to normalize in our business in North America and in Europe, we're going to stop that deleverage that you're seeing. And hopefully, as we get to flat or slightly increased comps, we're going to create leverage. So -- and then I also want to remind you that, we've talked about it many times, unfortunately, as the e-commerce business grows, we have lower gross -- we have lower operating margins in that business. So that's kind of been a headwind for us. We're making progress in that business. We're making progress in improving our operating margins, again, created by velocity and other activities that we're doing internally to help improve that. So I would tell you that we think that the retail business will ultimately grow in the operating margin in the out years, and that will be driven by stabilization of comps, improvement in how we're operating our e-commerce business and ultimately, positive comps which will create leverage for us. But thank you, Randy."

We're definitely seeing business improve in North America. Now that's I think a combination of a few things. I think our product that we're delivering is getting better, and the customer is responding to that. I would say the traffic trends really haven't changed at all, so that's not something that we're seeing as of yet. But we think that our conversion rates continue to accelerate inside of our stores. But there's definitely a slightly better feeling that we're seeing with the consumers coming into the store being a bit more optimistic and I would say also being more excited about fashion and innovation. I've said before that I think our company needed to be more aggressive in its fashion and innovation, and Michael and the design teams have done just a spectacular job with that. So I'd say it again, we're seeing business definitely improve. And I don't think it's a channel that's one channel versus the other. It's just a general -- there's a little bit of uptick that we're felling, so it gives us some optimism going into the fall season the way that she is responding to newness. And also, I want to leave you with one other thing too. The reduction in promotional activity, what we've seen is that she's not biting us on that. As long as we are giving her the right product, she's responding extremely well. And our 2 best-selling products being Mercer and our smartwatches have basically no sale. There are some limited colors that aren't selling on Mercer. But we really have shown that if it's the right product, you do not have to have these aggressive markdowns happening at retail, and I think that's proving to be a real plus for us. Moving on to Jimmy Choo, super excited. I have to tell you that we've now had a number of meetings with the management team. We're heading off there again this afternoon. And Pierre and Sandra and the management team there are just -- I can't tell you how excited we are to have them as part of our organization and family and group. And we really believe in the plan that they've developed and are executing on. And I think it's too early to make any comments about synergies. I have said before, whatever synergies there will be won't be anything significant, that we think that the biggest opportunity in acquiring Jimmy Choo and bringing it into our fashion luxury group is the fact that this company, we very strongly believe, will grow to $1 billion. And if we and the Jimmy Choo management team were able to achieve that, we think that, as Tom had stated earlier, that will add to some very nice accretion for the company in the long term. So if we're able to execute on 2020 and the Jimmy Choo plan rolls out as we anticipate, I think we will have a company that's delivering very significant revenue in totality with some very nice growth and operating earnings and net income earnings that will be growing in the future. Thank you, Lindsay."

I think first, we know from the industry trend that product -- we're in a cycle where more innovation is what the consumer is responding to, and we're not the only company seeing that. You certainly look at many of our luxury -- our European luxury competitors, and they're seeing the same type of response from the end consumer. And given that we are a global luxury brand, we don't just compete in North America, but we compete around the world. And we're sitting on the best streets in the world across from the best -- or next to the best competitors in the world. So we have to really excite the customer because she has choices. And we know that, clearly, in the women's ready-to-wear business where we got off to a little quicker start and being able to get that innovation in front of the consumer, the results have been outstanding. And so now we have actually customers coming in here saying, let's make it a little bigger next year. And we're going to slow, and we're going to be patient about that. We have our own retail teams who are going, wow, let's get more of this in our stores, and we're seeing the consumer respond. We saw that same kind of reaction in this market when we opened up with our accessories collections where our teams and our retail partners walked in and said, wow, this is different, our customer is going to respond to this. So some of this innovation is based on taking the bag like Mercer, which is -- or a group like Mercer, which is very strong and powerful for us, and creating layer-ups in that. Some of this is based upon areas that are very strong in terms of fashion trends like backpacks, we talked about. And some of this is in new groups that we're introducing. A little bit of that will happen, as we said already, in the holiday season. We have new introductions that are going to be coming in, in particular in calendar Q4, which will be right before the holiday season. So we'll get some reactions from that and be able to chase those products where the consumer does react strongly too. So I think that the strategy is across all product categories inside the company. And so that really gives us the feeling that we're on the right track. And again, early results of what we're seeing in some of the newness and innovation, which I talked about in the previous call, in some of the layer-up products and 1 or 2 of the new styles that we introduced have been quite good. So I think the response from our own teams, response from the wholesale accounts and early indications from the end consumer have given us reason to feel that we're on the right track with Runway 2020. It's still going to take time. That being said, we think we've got the right plan in place. Thank you, Omar."

We are in an exciting and transformative time for our company.

We are in an exciting and transformative time for our company. We recently announced that Michael Kors Holdings Limited is forming a global fashion luxury group with our acquisition of Jimmy Choo, bringing together 2 iconic companies and creating a platform for future acquisitions. The foundation of our group will be built on fashion authority with craftsmanship and heritage at the core.
Jimmy Choo embodies all of these elements and is an excellent fit for our group. The brand has been a leader in designing glamorous, innovative, expertly crafted footwear and accessories that have resonated with luxury trendsetters for more than 20 years. Under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Pierre Denis and Creative Director Sandra Choi, the company has demonstrated an impressive track record of consistent sales and earnings growth in addition to strong cash flow generation.
We believe Jimmy Choo can reach $1 billion in revenue over time as we partner with Pierre, Sandra and the rest of the talented management team to build the brand's online presence, expand its retail footprint globally and accelerate growth in the accessories and men's categories. Through the formation of a global fashion luxury group, we expect to enhance long-term value for shareholders by growing the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo's businesses, while diversifying our product and geographic mix. 
Now moving to the quarter's performance. This morning, we reported first quarter fiscal 2018 results, which were ahead of our expectations, largely as a result of better-than-anticipated comparable sales performance in our retail segment in North America and Europe. We have also begun to execute our strategic plan, Runway 2020, to reposition our company for future growth. These efforts are expected to drive improved financial performance as we generate even greater appeal for our fashion luxury assortments, deepen consumers' connection with our brand and further elevate exceptional jet-set experience that we offer online and in our stores. It is still early in the process, but we have certainly begun to lay the foundation for future success. While we recognize that it will take time for our initiatives to bear fruit and meaningfully benefit our financial results, it is encouraging that we have already seen early signs that our efforts are resonating with our consumers. 
I will now provide you with an update on the actions we are taking in our focus areas of product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience. Beginning with product innovation. We continue to leverage Michael's fashion luxury leadership and iconic runway heritage to further elevate our accessories product offerings. Importantly, we are also expanding our presence in other key categories, including women's ready-to-wear, footwear, men's sportswear, men's leather goods and ACCESS smartwatches.
In our accessories assortments, the layering and increased fashion innovation that we injected into our offerings elicited excitement among our consumers, with the Mercer collection continuing to be a true favorite. New Mercer styles with feminine novelty detailing, including studs, perforation, crystals and leather inlays, garnered outstanding response. In addition, the hardware branding details we offered on shoulder bags, including the Sloan Editor and Mott collections, were well-received among consumers. Finally, the launch of our iconic Jet Set signature pattern in a smaller size was also a notable success.
We remain pleased with the performance of products that provide opportunities for customization and personalization. Consumers continue to take advantage of the opportunity to personalize their leather goods through our monogramming services, which we offer in our digital flagships and select retail stores. In addition, we continue to see strong response to our customizable product offerings, including our mix-and-match guitar straps as well as our Selma Swap handbag.
Our fall accessories assortments will build on this momentum beginning with the launch of Bancroft from the Michael Kors Collection line. This important new group is a first step in expanding our collection offerings. In addition, we are introducing Sadie into our MICHAEL Michael Kors line. Sadie is a new soft satchel collection with a cool fashion sensibility featuring chain inlay detailing. Both Bancroft and Sadie will be featured in our upcoming fall fashion campaign as part of our efforts to showcase these new collections through a 360-degree marketing effort generating excitement and creating desire for these innovative products.
We also continue to see positive response to our enhanced assortment of women's ready-to-wear and footwear. The increased innovation and elevated positioning of our assortments was well-received, and our expanded dress offerings continued to garner exceptional response from consumers, contributing to growth in our women's ready-to-wear business during the quarter.
Men's sportswear and luxury goods also continued to exhibit positive momentum in the quarter. In sportswear, the consumer responded well to our fashion introductions in woven and knit classifications. Our Greenwich knit polo is now becoming a bestseller at retail. In leather goods, we saw strong response to our expanded offerings, including Bryant and Harrison groups. Backpacks are now the #1-selling silhouette in our collections. In addition, our iconic Jet Set signature collection continues to perform well, and we saw a particularly strong response to our camouflage print as part of our Father's Day gift efforts.
With respect to the watch business. ACCESS smartwatches remain an important and growing category. Consumers continue to respond well to the increased array of styles, plaidings and interchangeable strap options. For the fall season, we are excited to introduce 2 new ACCESS smartwatches styles, Sofie and Grayson. These styles will help fuel our growth of smartwatches, which we anticipate will reach 25% of our overall watch sales by year-end.
We also continued to expand our leadership in fashion wearable technology. During the quarter, we launched My Social, a feature that enables users to link to their Instagram account and set a personal post photo as their watch face. In addition, consumers were highly engaged with our expanded offering of watch dials as we have seen more than 4.5 million watch face changes since April. 
Turning to brand engagement. We continue to leverage Michael's iconic image and fashion leadership as we deepen our bond with consumers and enhance excitement of our brand. Michael's strong presence in the fashion industry was showcased at the Met Gala where an ensemble of celebrities were dressed in his designs, including Kerry Washington, Mandy Moore, Elizabeth Banks, Natasha Poly and Yang Mi. The impressive celebrity lineup garnered significant global print and broadcast media coverage as well as 297 million global impressions across various social media channels.
In June, Michael traveled to London to celebrate the launch of Tatler's English Roses. This multimedia exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery showcases the work of the acclaimed photographer, David Burton. The portfolio features the most exciting, interesting and beautiful women in Britain right now, many of whom were photographed wearing looks from the Fall 2017 Michael Kors Collection. The event generated great global press and digital exposure across the globe.
Finally, turning to customer experience. We continue to focus on elevating the brand experience in our digital flagships and brick-and-mortar stores. As part of these efforts, we continue to expand our global presence with the launch of 12 additional European digital flagships in the quarter. We now serve a total of 23 countries globally. We also launched a number features to support our efforts to grow ready-to-wear and footwear penetration in the channel. These efforts include the launch of our online dress shop as well as the rollout of Kors Style, which allows customers to view Michael's head-to-toe styles of the season and buy them in a single transaction. 
Now turning to the details of the quarter's financial performance. Total revenue was $952 million, a decrease of 3.6%. Retail comparable sales decreased 5.9%. And earnings per share was $0.80, a 3.6% decline year-over-year.
In the Americas, total revenue declined 8.2% in the quarter. We continue to take steps to increase excitement and desire for our assortments, deepening the innovation and layering our offerings. In addition, we remain focused on taking action to elevate our brand positioning as we reduce promotional activity in our digital flagships, lifestyle stores and wholesale channel. In the Americas, retail net sales were flat, with comparable sales declining in the mid-single digits. E-commerce continue to perform well with a double-digit comparable sales increase in the quarter.
In addition, consumers responded well to the more elevated and layered assortments in our digital flagships and retail stores, which helped to drive mid-single-digit increases in AUR for handbags and ready-to-wear in the quarter. However, this was more than offset by the decline in volume as a result of our strategic decision to reduce brand-wide promotional days in our digital flagship and lifestyle stores, which declined 56% as compared to last year.
In the Americas, wholesale net sales declined 19.5%, largely driven by our decision to strategically reduce sell-in and limit promotional activity in this channel. In the first quarter, there were 42 fewer brand-wide promotional days as compared to last year. We believe this is absolutely the right long-term decision for our brand despite the near-term sales pressure. As I mentioned earlier, there was positive consumer response to our more elevated and layered assortments, which helped to drive AUR increases in women's accessories, footwear and ready-to-wear in the quarter in this channel. 
Moving to Europe. Total revenue declined 10.2%. In the retail channel, net sales grew 2.5%, with a comparable sales decline in the low teens on a reported basis and high single digits on a constant-currency basis. Please note, including e-commerce sales and on a constant-currency basis, European comparable sales results would have been modestly positive for the quarter. The sequential improvement in comparable sales performance was partially driven by better tourism trends in the quarter, led by improving performance from Chinese and Russian visitors, although local trends remained soft. European wholesale net sales declined 28.4%, largely as a result of our strategic decision to reduce shipments into the channel as part of our efforts to protect brand health and elevate our positioning. 
Turning to Asia. This region continues to perform well with total revenue growth of 60.2% in the quarter. Asia retail net sales grew 104.8%, largely as a result of the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. Comparable sales, which currently exclude China, decreased in the low single digits on a reported basis, but increased in the low single digits on a constant-currency basis. Including China, comparable sales for Asia increased in the low single digits on a reported basis and in the mid-single digits on a constant-currency basis.
Asia wholesale net sales decreased 47%, primarily as a result of the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. We continue to see strong performance in Mainland China and Japan, which was partially offset by weaker performance in South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau, which continue to be impacted by the decline in Mainland Chinese tourists. 
Finally, in our licensing business, revenue decreased 5.6% in the quarter. We saw continued strong performance from ACCESS smartwatches, which was offset by declines in fashion watches. We are pleased with the continued strong momentum of ACCESS smartwatches, and we believe they will reach 25% of our total watch sales by year-end.
In fragrance, we added another scent to our Wonderlust collection with the July launch of Wonderlust Essence. The scent is a more intense, richer version of the original. We are also excited to expand the category this fall with the global launch of a major new fragrance, Sexy Ruby. In eyewear, consumers responded well to the Lia open-wire aviators and the Ila, which featured a trendy double-brow feature. 
In conclusion, we are pleased that our first quarter results outperformed our expectations, but continue to believe fiscal 2018 will be a transition year for Michael Kors as we execute on our strategic plan, Runway 2020. We are intently focused on raising the level of fashion luxury innovation, elevating our store experience and expanding our global presence. As I stated earlier, it will take some time before our actions translate into improved financial performance. However, we are encouraged by early indicators of success as well as customer feedback and enhanced engagement. Overall, we are confident that we have the right plan in place and are committed to its successful execution. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom."
143971118,531128427,1271847,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2017",2017-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John. I'd like to cover our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, provide an update on our forward outlook for the second quarter and full year, and conclude with some additional perspective on the Jimmy Choo acquisition. For the firs",1297,"Thank you, John. I'd like to cover our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, provide an update on our forward outlook for the second quarter and full year, and conclude with some additional perspective on the Jimmy Choo acquisition. 
For the first quarter, we reported net income of $125.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share, which was ahead of our expectations, largely due to higher-than-anticipated retail comparable sales results. This represents a 3.6% decline compared to last year, including $11.3 million of onetime costs associated with the acquisition of the Greater China license. Excluding these onetime costs, earnings per share decreased 11.1% in the quarter. 
Moving to top line performance. Total revenue was $952.4 million, a decline of 3.6% compared to last year. Retail net sales increased 10.1%, largely driven by 67 net new store openings and the impact of the acquisition of the Greater China license. This was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 5.9% in the quarter, with North America e-commerce contributing 330 basis points of benefit. 
Wholesale net sales declined 23.0% due to our strategic decision to reduce sell-in in order to protect the long-term health of our brand in North America and Europe as well as the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment.
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 5.6%, primarily due to the absence of licensing revenue associated with the previously licensed business in Greater China, while fashion watch declines were almost entirely offset by increases in ACCESS smartwatch revenue.
Gross margin for the quarter was roughly in line with our expectations at 60.3% compared to 59.9% last year. This year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to the growth of retail sales as a percentage of total revenue. Retail gross margin increased 120 basis points, which was largely due to an increase in international sales as a percentage of the total.
As we anticipated, wholesale gross margin declined 490 basis points. This performance reflected higher allowances related to margin assistance to our wholesale channel partners as well as strategic pricing initiatives designed to create higher sell-throughs on core products. We expect this margin trend will continue through the balance of the year. 
Total adjusted operating expense increased $32.3 million to 44.7% of revenue compared to 39.8% in the prior year. The increase in expense as a percent of revenue was due to both deleverage and the inclusion of our business in Greater China.
Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 15.7% compared to 20.1% in the prior year. Adjusted retail operating margin was 14.9% versus 13.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This year-over-year increase was driven by higher gross margin as adjusted retail operating expense grew roughly in line with sales.
Wholesale operating margin was 14.3% compared to 26.6% in the prior year. This anticipated decrease in wholesale operating margin was primarily the result of expense deleverage on lower sales as well as the decline in wholesale gross margin. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $273.7 million in cash and cash equivalent and a debt balance of $155.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $14.8 million and were related to retail store openings and renovations as well as continued investments in information systems enhancements. Additionally, we spent $157.8 million repurchasing approximately 4.5 million shares and have $842.2 million remaining under our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
Michael Kors generate significant free cash flow, maintains a strong balance sheet and will remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Following the completion of the Jimmy Choo acquisition, we plan to prioritize debt repayment as our primary use of free cash flow to rapidly delever to achieve our target lease adjusted leverage ratio of 2.0x to 2.25x. To support this, we intend to discontinue our share repurchase activity through the balance of this fiscal year. 
Now turning to our guidance. We are raising the full year outlook to reflect the better-than-anticipated first quarter results, partially offset by our decision to stop our share repurchase activity for the remainder of fiscal 2018. For the full year, we now expect total revenue to be approximately $4.275 billion with a mid-single-digit decrease in comparable sales.
Gross margin is still expected to be approximately 60.0%, and operating expense is expected to be approximately 44.0% of total revenue, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 16.0%.
Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $3.62 to $3.72, assuming a tax rate of 17% with 156 million weighted average shares outstanding.
For the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1 billion -- $1.035 billion and $1.055 billion with a mid-single-digit decrease in comparable sales.
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 59.3%, and operating expense is expected to be approximately 45.0% of total revenue, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 14.3%.
Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.84. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 15% and weighted average shares outstanding of 154 million. 
We continue to plan capital expenditures at approximately $200 million, which will be focused on select new store openings, renovations to our retail store fleet and investment in information system enhancements.
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we expect to incur $100 million to $125 million in onetime expenses over the next 2 years as we close between 100 and 125 stores. The guidance I just provided includes assumptions about the ongoing impact to revenue as well as to operating and depreciation and amortization costs, but excludes any onetime costs associated with these plans.
For fiscal 2018, we expect to close between 20 and 40 stores with onetime costs between $40 million and $60 million, predominantly in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the Jimmy Choo acquisition. I'd like to provide some additional thoughts on our expectations for Jimmy Choo as it relates to our financial outlook, transaction and transition costs and foreign exchange risk. Please note that these expectations have not been incorporated into the guidance I just provided as the transaction has not yet been completed.
Based on our internal forecast for Jimmy Choo and assuming a close early in our third fiscal quarter, we expect incremental revenue of approximately $275 million for the second half of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, we expect incremental revenue of approximately $570 million to $580 million.
Based on these assumptions and our anticipated free cash flow generation of Jimmy Choo, we expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive on a cash basis. We expect the acquisition to be dilutive to EPS in the low single-digit percentage range in both fiscal '18 and '19 and accretive in the low single digits in fiscal 2020, the second full year after acquisition. These expectations exclude one-time transaction and transition costs.
With respect to these one-time costs, we forecast transaction costs related to the acquisition to be between $40 million and $50 million and transition costs to be between $20 million and $30 million over the next 2 years as we integrate Jimmy Choo into the broader group.
In addition, to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to the British pound purchase price, we have entered into a foreign exchange hedge. This type of position does not receive hedge accounting treatment, and we will record mark-to-market gains and losses through our income statement until the completion of the transaction.
With respect to financing, we ultimately plan to finance the acquisition through a combination of term loan and longer-term bond, and we anticipated a weighted average cost of 4.25% to 4.75%. We look forward to updating you on the forecast for the combined group following the close of the transaction. 
With that, I will turn it back over to John for closing remarks."

The most exciting thing that happened to us in the quarter was the increase in AUR, which I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as you recall, a",1081,"Thank you, Kimberly. I'll start with your first question and just give some brief updates on the categories. The most exciting thing that happened to us in the quarter was the increase in AUR, which I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as you recall, a few quarters back, we said that we had made the decision to create a promotional policy for the company that would really increase AURs over time because we felt that there was too much activity of the brand being put on sale, really, just at multiple different time periods. So that has absolutely had a positive impact across our own retail distribution and in the wholesale channel as well. So AURs are definitively up. The second part that has helped the AURs in, again, in our retail channel and the wholesale channel is the fact that we took 5 groups and we focused those 5 groups on price points that we thought would improve full-price sell-throughs. We went back and looked at where was the product going ""out the door"" at and really analyzed where the customers' response was the highest for us. And that obviously has impacted our wholesale gross margins, but we've seen the improved sell-throughs as it relates to that strategy. I might add that what you're going to see happen really comes spring season and through the balance of calendar 2018 is we will now begin to layer up price points in our own stores and the wholesale channel, in particular, in our own stores, we will start that with the Michael Kors Collection handbags. I talked to you about Bancroft, which landed in the stores a few weeks ago, and we've had tremendous sell-throughs on this product which we're very excited about. It's an expensive product, averaging approximately $1,000 on a bag. And that's really been -- showed us the power of the brand and the customer's desire when the product is right. And that product, by the way, is made 100% in Italy. And so we're really going after product that has craftsmanship as we've talked about in our whole brand positioning. So I would tell you that, while the accessories category was down in total, the AURs are up and the full-price sell-throughs are up, and that's exactly where we wanted to be at this point in time. And what I'm also excited about and we've talked about this previously, we're going to put hundreds of millions of dollars less product into the marketplace for Michael Kors handbags. That is going to create a bit more scarcity and we believe a bit more desire. So we feel like we're on the right path there. And then just concluding, obviously, that's a product that we have delivered -- or we are going to deliver for spring season. We're right on track with where we wanted to be with innovation. And as we spoke about that before, they'll be between 65% and 70% newness come spring season on the floors in our stores and in our wholesale accounts. That's all -- that's going to be terrific. In terms of women's ready-to-wear, the business is performing very, very strong. We're comping up over last year and very strong numbers in our own stores, and we're starting to see the same trend in our wholesale distribution both domestically and internationally. And we've made some great changes to that product and brought a lot of innovation. And Michael and the design teams have just kind of, in our opinion, done a spectacular job there, as they are starting to do the same in accessories. So customers responding to that, we feel really good about that. Footwear also is seeing great response. Again, we're one of the leaders, in particular, in the active -- fashion active market, great response there. And we're going to take on some additional categories, in particular, more dress footwear, which is going to go with that ramp-up in our women's ready-to-wear. And as we talked about, on our e-commerce site, we have the ability with Kors Style that she can click through and buy the whole look. That's an important way that we're going to continue to show our fashion leadership. In terms of watches, I think we are not going to call a bottom yet, but we're definitely seeing improvement. Smartwatches are retailing, she is responding. We have 2 great new styles coming for the fall and holiday season. So we're very hopeful that, that acceleration continues for us. And we hope that the category will be reinvigorated, in particular, because of the smartwatch initiatives we're taking. And I might add, we have an incredible partnership with Google that we'll be talking to you more about in our upcoming call. But we are partnering with them on some very significant programs for the fall season that I think will create a lot of consumer engagement, desire and ultimately, sales for us. And then lastly, while it's small, we're getting some really good response to our men's business. We saw very strong comp store increases in the men's business, both at wholesale and at retail. And again, it's not big enough yet to impact our company. But the early indications are over the next few years, this is going to be a powerful business for the company. And again, as we've said, our goal is to rightsize our accessories business and then have it have some low single-digit growth starting next year, and then really have these other categories augment our lifestyle stores and our wholesale distribution and provide a bit more accelerated growth as they're underpenetrated to our total company and in the marketplace in terms of competition. And then lastly, to answer your question on wholesale, it's early days. We are feeling and we are planning with our partners that next calendar year, we will start to see some small increases in the business. And we're hopeful that, that is what's going to happen. We have to get through the holiday season. And -- but the response to what the consumers have seen in our -- or the wholesale customers have seen in our showrooms is quite strong, and I think they're feeling good about where we are executing against our plan with them to reduce promotional activity, bring a greater scarcity level of product, particularly in North American markets and get AURs up in full-price selling. So sorry for the long-winded answer, but thank you, Kimberly."

John, just can you expand upon the -- you had a nice impressive result that you talked about on the AUR inflection. I think it's the first time in a number of years now. You gave some commentary around the full-price sell-through improvement. In the years past, we've also been hurt on AUR because of, I guess, silhouette. Can you just give us some perspective on what you think silhouette changes come through in the next 12 months to impact AUR, either up or down from here? And then the other thing that kind of stood out in the numbers was the inflection in the retail segment margins. I think it was mentioned that the gross margin improved there. Just kind of give some sense of, are we seeing the floor in the retail segment margins? And what can we kind of think about, now we're starting to see some stabilization in your business model -- or business, where the retail operating margins can reshake back out on a normalized basis going forward over the next couple of years? Because it seems like it's starting to kind of move higher, and just want to get some perspective on the drivers of that change going forward."

On the AUR side, the thing that will continue to drive AUR for the next, I'd call it, almost 12 months is going to be the reduction in promotional activity. That will be the single-largest driver. The second driver of that will actually be our introduction of higher price points into the business, and that's not just raising prices, but it's actually delivering fashion that's very evident to the consumer. And we're really working again with Michael and the design teams on innovative materials and workmanship to that product because clearly, the customer wants that. They want something that's going to be -- look different for them and look different with their wardrobe. And then customization will also help to drive AUR. Again, we're seeing a lot of response to monogramming and all the different areas, whether it's the guitar straps we talked about and whatnot. That's going to become a significant part of the business as we move forward for anyone in this category. That's the tailwind. The headwind is, unfortunately, some of the small leather goods business is being impacted, as you see, with payment plans coming on through all different vendors, there's less need for cash and, in some cases, credit cards. So there is some impact in that business that we're experiencing, which does hurt a little bit as smaller wallet sales are becoming more popular as opposed to larger wallet sales. So again, we'll just have to see how that shakes out. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one of the real key drivers in the men's leather goods business is backpacks, and we're seeing the same thing emerge in the women's business. And that's -- it's really shaking out. It's taking a lot of the tote business, and there's a lot shifting into that category. So I would call that neutral, but it's definitely a trend that's happening out at retail, and I think we're right there to take advantage of it. It's very much a fashion trend. In terms of the retail margins, what you're seeing is, first and foremost, mix shift on a global basis, which we had talked about over the last couple of quarters, that as the Asian business has brought on, which has higher gross margins, and as retail in total is becoming a bigger mix of the company, you're seeing the gross margins favorably impacted. And we think that's going to continue to go forward. Again, we've given guidance, and we think that, that guidance is pretty steady. On the operating margin side where you're seeing improvements, again, that's a mix of what you're seeing happen in terms of the Asian businesses, which are more profitable. But you're also seeing us being able to -- as the comps begin to normalize in our business in North America and in Europe, we're going to stop that deleverage that you're seeing. And hopefully, as we get to flat or slightly increased comps, we're going to create leverage. So -- and then I also want to remind you that, we've talked about it many times, unfortunately, as the e-commerce business grows, we have lower gross -- we have lower operating margins in that business. So that's kind of been a headwind for us. We're making progress in that business. We're making progress in improving our operating margins, again, created by velocity and other activities that we're doing internally to help improve that. So I would tell you that we think that the retail business will ultimately grow in the operating margin in the out years, and that will be driven by stabilization of comps, improvement in how we're operating our e-commerce business and ultimately, positive comps which will create leverage for us. But thank you, Randy."

We're definitely seeing business improve in North America. Now that's I think a combination of a few things. I think our product that we're delivering is getting better, and the customer is responding to that. I would say the traffic trends really haven't changed at all, so that's not something that we're seeing as of yet. But we think that our conversion rates continue to accelerate inside of our stores. But there's definitely a slightly better feeling that we're seeing with the consumers coming into the store being a bit more optimistic and I would say also being more excited about fashion and innovation. I've said before that I think our company needed to be more aggressive in its fashion and innovation, and Michael and the design teams have done just a spectacular job with that. So I'd say it again, we're seeing business definitely improve. And I don't think it's a channel that's one channel versus the other. It's just a general -- there's a little bit of uptick that we're feeling, so it gives us some optimism going into the fall season the way that she is responding to newness. And also, I want to leave you with one other thing too. The reduction in promotional activity, what we've seen is that she's not biting us on that. As long as we are giving her the right product, she's responding extremely well. And our 2 best-selling products being Mercer and our smartwatches have basically no sale. There are some limited colors that are on sale on Mercer. But we really have shown that if it's the right product, you do not have to have these aggressive markdowns happening at retail, and I think that's proving to be a real plus for us. Moving on to Jimmy Choo, super excited. I have to tell you that we've now had a number of meetings with the management team. We're heading off there again this afternoon. And Pierre and Sandra and the management team there are just -- I can't tell you how excited we are to have them as part of our organization and family and group. And we really believe in the plan that they've developed and are executing on. And I think it's too early to make any comments about synergies. I have said before, whatever synergies there will be won't be anything significant, that we think that the biggest opportunity in acquiring Jimmy Choo and bringing it into our fashion luxury group is the fact that this company, we very strongly believe, will grow to $1 billion. And if we and the Jimmy Choo management team were able to achieve that, we think that, as Tom had stated earlier, that will add to some very nice accretion for the company in the long term. So if we're able to execute on 2020 and the Jimmy Choo plan rolls out as we anticipate, I think we will have a company that's delivering very significant revenue in totality with some very nice growth and operating earnings and net income earnings that will be growing in the future. Thank you, Lindsay."

I think first, we know from the industry trend that product -- we're in a cycle where more innovation is what the consumer is responding to, and we're not the only company seeing that. You certainly look at many of our luxury -- our European luxury competitors, and they're seeing the same type of response from the end consumer. And given that we are a global luxury brand, we don't just compete in North America, but we compete around the world. And we're sitting on the best streets in the world across from the best -- or next to the best competitors in the world. So we have to really excite the customer because she has choices. And we know that, clearly, in the women's ready-to-wear business where we got off to a little quicker start and being able to get that innovation in front of the consumer, the results have been outstanding. And so now we have actually customers coming in here saying, let's make it a little bigger next year. And we're going to slow, and we're going to be patient about that. We have our own retail teams who are going, wow, let's get more of this in our stores, and we're seeing the consumer respond. We saw that same kind of reaction in this market when we opened up with our accessories collections where our teams and our retail partners walked in and said, wow, this is different, our customer is going to respond to this. So some of this innovation is based on taking the bag like Mercer, which is -- or a group like Mercer, which is very strong and powerful for us, and creating layer-ups in that. Some of this is based upon areas that are very strong in terms of fashion trends like backpacks, we talked about. And some of this is in new groups that we're introducing. A little bit of that will happen, as we said already, in the holiday season. We have new introductions that are going to be coming in, in particular in calendar Q4, which will be right before the holiday season. So we'll get some reactions from that and be able to chase those products where the consumer does react strongly too. So I think that the strategy is across all product categories inside the company. And so that really gives us the feeling that we're on the right track. And again, early results of what we're seeing in some of the newness and innovation, which I talked about in the previous call, in some of the layer-up products and 1 or 2 of the new styles that we introduced have been quite good. So I think the response from our own teams, response from the wholesale accounts and early indications from the end consumer have given us reason to feel that we're on the right track with Runway 2020. It's still going to take time. That being said, we think we've got the right plan in place. Thank you, Omar."

There is a very strong inflection and acceleration happening for the accessories business in China. The consumer is definitely back.

Although the euro is -- the dollar is weakening, and so that gives us some hope that, that consumer will start to come back in a stronger way to North America. So I would say that if we see this weakening of the dollar continue, that could create some activity in North America that we have not seen rebound in the last couple of years. Thank you, Erinn."

We are in an exciting and transformative time for our company.

We are in an exciting and transformative time for our company. We recently announced that Michael Kors Holdings Limited is forming a global fashion luxury group with our acquisition of Jimmy Choo, bringing together 2 iconic companies and creating a platform for future acquisitions. The foundation of our group will be built on fashion authority with craftsmanship and heritage at the core.
Jimmy Choo embodies all of these elements and is an excellent fit for our group. The brand has been a leader in designing glamorous, innovative, expertly crafted footwear and accessories that have resonated with luxury trendsetters for more than 20 years. Under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Pierre Denis and Creative Director Sandra Choi, the company has demonstrated an impressive track record of consistent sales and earnings growth in addition to strong cash flow generation.
We believe Jimmy Choo can reach $1 billion in revenue over time as we partner with Pierre, Sandra and the rest of the talented management team to build the brand's online presence, expand its retail footprint globally and accelerate growth in the accessories and men's categories. Through the formation of a global fashion luxury group, we expect to enhance long-term value for shareholders by growing the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo's businesses, while diversifying our product and geographic mix. 
Now moving to the quarter's performance. This morning, we reported first quarter fiscal 2018 results, which were ahead of our expectations, largely as a result of better-than-anticipated comparable sales performance in our retail segment in North America and Europe. We have also begun to execute our strategic plan, Runway 2020, to reposition our company for future growth. These efforts are expected to drive improved financial performance as we generate even greater appeal for our fashion luxury assortments, deepen consumers' connection with our brand and further elevate exceptional jet-set experience that we offer online and in our stores. It is still early in the process, but we have certainly begun to lay the foundation for future success. While we recognize that it will take time for our initiatives to bear fruit and meaningfully benefit our financial results, it is encouraging that we have already seen early signs that our efforts are resonating with our consumers. 
I will now provide you with an update on the actions we are taking in our focus areas of product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience. Beginning with product innovation. We continue to leverage Michael's fashion luxury leadership and iconic runway heritage to further elevate our accessories product offerings. Importantly, we are also expanding our presence in other key categories, including women's ready-to-wear, footwear, men's sportswear, men's leather goods and ACCESS smartwatches.
In our accessories assortments, the layering and increased fashion innovation that we injected into our offerings elicited excitement among our consumers, with the Mercer collection continuing to be a true favorite. New Mercer styles with feminine novelty detailing, including studs, perforation, crystals and leather inlays, garnered outstanding response. In addition, the hardware branding details we offered on shoulder bags, including the Sloan Editor and Mott collections, were well-received among consumers. Finally, the launch of our iconic Jet Set signature pattern in a smaller size was also a notable success.
We remain pleased with the performance of products that provide opportunities for customization and personalization. Consumers continue to take advantage of the opportunity to personalize their leather goods through our monogramming services, which we offer in our digital flagships and select retail stores. In addition, we continue to see strong response to our customizable product offerings, including our mix-and-match guitar straps as well as our Selma Swap handbag.
Our fall accessories assortments will build on this momentum beginning with the launch of Bancroft from the Michael Kors Collection line. This important new group is a first step in expanding our collection offerings. In addition, we are introducing Sadie into our MICHAEL Michael Kors line. Sadie is a new soft satchel collection with a cool fashion sensibility featuring chain inlay detailing. Both Bancroft and Sadie will be featured in our upcoming fall fashion campaign as part of our efforts to showcase these new collections through a 360-degree marketing effort generating excitement and creating desire for these innovative products.
We also continue to see positive response to our enhanced assortment of women's ready-to-wear and footwear. The increased innovation and elevated positioning of our assortments was well-received, and our expanded dress offerings continued to garner exceptional response from consumers, contributing to growth in our women's ready-to-wear business during the quarter.
Men's sportswear and luxury goods also continued to exhibit positive momentum in the quarter. In sportswear, the consumer responded well to our fashion introductions in woven and knit classifications. Our Greenwich knit polo is now becoming a bestseller at retail. In leather goods, we saw strong response to our expanded offerings, including Bryant and Harrison groups. Backpacks are now the #1-selling silhouette in our collections. In addition, our iconic Jet Set signature collection continues to perform well, and we saw a particularly strong response to our camouflage print as part of our Father's Day gift efforts.
With respect to the watch business. ACCESS smartwatches remain an important and growing category. Consumers continue to respond well to the increased array of styles, plaidings and interchangeable strap options. For the fall season, we are excited to introduce 2 new ACCESS smartwatches styles, Sofie and Grayson. These styles will help fuel our growth of smartwatches, which we anticipate will reach 25% of our overall watch sales by year-end.
We also continued to expand our leadership in fashion wearable technology. During the quarter, we launched My Social, a feature that enables users to link to their Instagram account and set a personal post photo as their watch face. In addition, consumers were highly engaged with our expanded offering of watch dials as we have seen more than 4.5 million watch face changes since April. 
Turning to brand engagement. We continue to leverage Michael's iconic image and fashion leadership as we deepen our bond with consumers and enhance excitement of our brand. Michael's strong presence in the fashion industry was showcased at the Met Gala where an ensemble of celebrities were dressed in his designs, including Kerry Washington, Mandy Moore, Elizabeth Banks, Natasha Poly and Yang Mi. The impressive celebrity lineup garnered significant global print and broadcast media coverage as well as 297 million global impressions across various social media channels.
In June, Michael traveled to London to celebrate the launch of Tatler's English Roses. This multimedia exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery showcases the work of the acclaimed photographer, David Burton. The portfolio features the most exciting, interesting and beautiful women in Britain right now, many of whom were photographed wearing looks from the Fall 2017 Michael Kors Collection. The event generated great global press and digital exposure across the globe.
Finally, turning to customer experience. We continue to focus on elevating the brand experience in our digital flagships and brick-and-mortar stores. As part of these efforts, we continue to expand our global presence with the launch of 12 additional European digital flagships in the quarter. We now serve a total of 23 countries globally. We also launched a number features to support our efforts to grow ready-to-wear and footwear penetration in the channel. These efforts include the launch of our online dress shop as well as the rollout of Kors Style, which allows customers to view Michael's head-to-toe styles of the season and buy them in a single transaction. 
Now turning to the details of the quarter's financial performance. Total revenue was $952 million, a decrease of 3.6%. Retail comparable sales decreased 5.9%. And earnings per share was $0.80, a 3.6% decline year-over-year.
In the Americas, total revenue declined 8.2% in the quarter. We continue to take steps to increase excitement and desire for our assortments, deepening the innovation and layering our offerings. In addition, we remain focused on taking action to elevate our brand positioning as we reduce promotional activity in our digital flagships, lifestyle stores and wholesale channel. In the Americas, retail net sales were flat, with comparable sales declining in the mid-single digits. E-commerce continue to perform well with a double-digit comparable sales increase in the quarter.
In addition, consumers responded well to the more elevated and layered assortments in our digital flagships and retail stores, which helped to drive mid-single-digit increases in AUR for handbags and ready-to-wear in the quarter. However, this was more than offset by the decline in volume as a result of our strategic decision to reduce brand-wide promotional days in our digital flagship and lifestyle stores, which declined 56% as compared to last year.
In the Americas, wholesale net sales declined 19.5%, largely driven by our decision to strategically reduce sell-in and limit promotional activity in this channel. In the first quarter, there were 42 fewer brand-wide promotional days as compared to last year. We believe this is absolutely the right long-term decision for our brand despite the near-term sales pressure. As I mentioned earlier, there was positive consumer response to our more elevated and layered assortments, which helped to drive AUR increases in women's accessories, footwear and ready-to-wear in the quarter in this channel. 
Moving to Europe. Total revenue declined 10.2%. In the retail channel, net sales grew 2.5%, with a comparable sales decline in the low teens on a reported basis and high single digits on a constant-currency basis. Please note, including e-commerce sales and on a constant-currency basis, European comparable sales results would have been modestly positive for the quarter. The sequential improvement in comparable sales performance was partially driven by better tourism trends in the quarter, led by improving performance from Chinese and Russian visitors, although local trends remained soft. European wholesale net sales declined 28.4%, largely as a result of our strategic decision to reduce shipments into the channel as part of our efforts to protect brand health and elevate our positioning. 
Turning to Asia. This region continues to perform well with total revenue growth of 60.2% in the quarter. Asia retail net sales grew 104.8%, largely as a result of the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. Comparable sales, which currently exclude China, decreased in the low single digits on a reported basis, but increased in the low single digits on a constant-currency basis. Including China, comparable sales for Asia increased in the low single digits on a reported basis and in the mid-single digits on a constant-currency basis.
Asia wholesale net sales decreased 47%, primarily as a result of the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment. We continue to see strong performance in Mainland China and Japan, which was partially offset by weaker performance in South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau, which continue to be impacted by the decline in Mainland Chinese tourists. 
Finally, in our licensing business, revenue decreased 5.6% in the quarter. We saw continued strong performance from ACCESS smartwatches, which was offset by declines in fashion watches. We are pleased with the continued strong momentum of ACCESS smartwatches, and we believe they will reach 25% of our total watch sales by year-end.
In fragrance, we added another scent to our Wonderlust collection with the July launch of Wonderlust Essence. The scent is a more intense, richer version of the original. We are also excited to expand the category this fall with the global launch of a major new fragrance, Sexy Ruby. In eyewear, consumers responded well to the Lia open-wire aviators and the Ila, which featured a trendy double-brow feature. 
In conclusion, we are pleased that our first quarter results outperformed our expectations, but continue to believe fiscal 2018 will be a transition year for Michael Kors as we execute on our strategic plan, Runway 2020. We are intently focused on raising the level of fashion luxury innovation, elevating our store experience and expanding our global presence. As I stated earlier, it will take some time before our actions translate into improved financial performance. However, we are encouraged by early indicators of success as well as customer feedback and enhanced engagement. Overall, we are confident that we have the right plan in place and are committed to its successful execution. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom."
143971118,531128427,1275565,"Michael Kors Holdings Limited, Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2017",2017-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Capri Holdings Limited","Executives","Thank you, John. I'd like to cover our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, provide an update on our forward outlook for the second quarter and full year, and conclude with some additional perspective on the Jimmy Choo acquisition. For the firs",1297,"Thank you, John. I'd like to cover our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, provide an update on our forward outlook for the second quarter and full year, and conclude with some additional perspective on the Jimmy Choo acquisition. 
For the first quarter, we reported net income of $125.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share, which was ahead of our expectations, largely due to higher-than-anticipated retail comparable sales results. This represents a 3.6% decline compared to last year, including $11.3 million of onetime costs associated with the acquisition of the Greater China license. Excluding these onetime costs, earnings per share decreased 11.1% in the quarter. 
Moving to top line performance. Total revenue was $952.4 million, a decline of 3.6% compared to last year. Retail net sales increased 10.1%, largely driven by 67 net new store openings and the impact of the acquisition of the Greater China license. This was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 5.9% in the quarter, with North America e-commerce contributing 330 basis points of benefit. 
Wholesale net sales declined 23.0% due to our strategic decision to reduce sell-in in order to protect the long-term health of our brand in North America and Europe as well as the shift of China sales to our company-owned retail segment.
In the licensing segment, revenue decreased 5.6%, primarily due to the absence of licensing revenue associated with the previously licensed business in Greater China, while fashion watch declines were almost entirely offset by increases in ACCESS smartwatch revenue.
Gross margin for the quarter was roughly in line with our expectations at 60.3% compared to 59.9% last year. This year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to the growth of retail sales as a percentage of total revenue. Retail gross margin increased 120 basis points, which was largely due to an increase in international sales as a percentage of the total.
As we anticipated, wholesale gross margin declined 490 basis points. This performance reflected higher allowances related to margin assistance to our wholesale channel partners as well as strategic pricing initiatives designed to create higher sell-throughs on core products. We expect this margin trend will continue through the balance of the year. 
Total adjusted operating expense increased $32.3 million to 44.7% of revenue compared to 39.8% in the prior year. The increase in expense as a percent of revenue was due to both deleverage and the inclusion of our business in Greater China.
Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 15.7% compared to 20.1% in the prior year. Adjusted retail operating margin was 14.9% versus 13.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This year-over-year increase was driven by higher gross margin as adjusted retail operating expense grew roughly in line with sales.
Wholesale operating margin was 14.3% compared to 26.6% in the prior year. This anticipated decrease in wholesale operating margin was primarily the result of expense deleverage on lower sales as well as the decline in wholesale gross margin. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $273.7 million in cash and cash equivalent and a debt balance of $155.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $14.8 million and were related to retail store openings and renovations as well as continued investments in information systems enhancements. Additionally, we spent $157.8 million repurchasing approximately 4.5 million shares and have $842.2 million remaining under our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
Michael Kors generate significant free cash flow, maintains a strong balance sheet and will remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Following the completion of the Jimmy Choo acquisition, we plan to prioritize debt repayment as our primary use of free cash flow to rapidly delever to achieve our target lease adjusted leverage ratio of 2.0x to 2.25x. To support this, we intend to discontinue our share repurchase activity through the balance of this fiscal year. 
Now turning to our guidance. We are raising the full year outlook to reflect the better-than-anticipated first quarter results, partially offset by our decision to stop our share repurchase activity for the remainder of fiscal 2018. For the full year, we now expect total revenue to be approximately $4.275 billion with a mid-single-digit decrease in comparable sales.
Gross margin is still expected to be approximately 60.0%, and operating expense is expected to be approximately 44.0% of total revenue, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 16.0%.
Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $3.62 to $3.72, assuming a tax rate of 17% with 156 million weighted average shares outstanding.
For the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be between $1 billion -- $1.035 billion and $1.055 billion with a mid-single-digit decrease in comparable sales.
Gross margin is expected to be approximately 59.3%, and operating expense is expected to be approximately 45.0% of total revenue, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 14.3%.
Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.84. This assumes a tax rate of approximately 15% and weighted average shares outstanding of 154 million. 
We continue to plan capital expenditures at approximately $200 million, which will be focused on select new store openings, renovations to our retail store fleet and investment in information system enhancements.
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we expect to incur $100 million to $125 million in onetime expenses over the next 2 years as we close between 100 and 125 stores. The guidance I just provided includes assumptions about the ongoing impact to revenue as well as to operating and depreciation and amortization costs, but excludes any onetime costs associated with these plans.
For fiscal 2018, we expect to close between 20 and 40 stores with onetime costs between $40 million and $60 million, predominantly in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the Jimmy Choo acquisition. I'd like to provide some additional thoughts on our expectations for Jimmy Choo as it relates to our financial outlook, transaction and transition costs and foreign exchange risk. Please note that these expectations have not been incorporated into the guidance I just provided as the transaction has not yet been completed.
Based on our internal forecast for Jimmy Choo and assuming a close early in our third fiscal quarter, we expect incremental revenue of approximately $275 million for the second half of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, we expect incremental revenue of approximately $570 million to $580 million.
Based on these assumptions and our anticipated free cash flow generation of Jimmy Choo, we expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive on a cash basis. We expect the acquisition to be dilutive to EPS in the low single-digit percentage range in both fiscal '18 and '19 and accretive in the low single digits in fiscal 2020, the second full year after acquisition. These expectations exclude one-time transaction and transition costs.
With respect to these one-time costs, we forecast transaction costs related to the acquisition to be between $40 million and $50 million and transition costs to be between $20 million and $30 million over the next 2 years as we integrate Jimmy Choo into the broader group.
In addition, to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to the British pound purchase price, we have entered into a foreign exchange hedge. This type of position does not receive hedge accounting treatment, and we will record mark-to-market gains and losses through our income statement until the completion of the transaction.
With respect to financing, we ultimately plan to finance the acquisition through a combination of term loan and longer-term bond, and we anticipated a weighted average cost of 4.25% to 4.75%. We look forward to updating you on the forecast for the combined group following the close of the transaction. 
With that, I will turn it back over to John for closing remarks."

I'll start with your first question and just give some brief updates on the categories. The most exciting thing that happened to us in the quarter was the increase in AUR, which I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as you recall, a",1081,"Thank you, Kimberly. I'll start with your first question and just give some brief updates on the categories. The most exciting thing that happened to us in the quarter was the increase in AUR, which I mentioned in our prepared remarks. So as you recall, a few quarters back, we said that we had made the decision to create a promotional policy for the company that would really increase AURs over time because we felt that there was too much activity of the brand being put on sale, really, just at multiple different time periods. So that has absolutely had a positive impact across our own retail distribution and in the wholesale channel as well. So AURs are definitively up. The second part that has helped the AURs in, again, in our retail channel and the wholesale channel is the fact that we took 5 groups and we focused those 5 groups on price points that we thought would improve full-price sell-throughs. We went back and looked at where was the product going ""out the door"" at and really analyzed where the customers' response was the highest for us. And that obviously has impacted our wholesale gross margins, but we've seen the improved sell-throughs as it relates to that strategy. I might add that what you're going to see happen really comes spring season and through the balance of calendar 2018 is we will now begin to layer up price points in our own stores and the wholesale channel, in particular, in our own stores, we will start that with the Michael Kors Collection handbags. I talked to you about Bancroft, which landed in the stores a few weeks ago, and we've had tremendous sell-throughs on this product which we're very excited about. It's an expensive product, averaging approximately $1,000 on a bag. And that's really been -- showed us the power of the brand and the customer's desire when the product is right. And that product, by the way, is made 100% in Italy. And so we're really going after product that has craftsmanship as we've talked about in our whole brand positioning. So I would tell you that, while the accessories category was down in total, the AURs are up and the full-price sell-throughs are up, and that's exactly where we wanted to be at this point in time. And what I'm also excited about and we've talked about this previously, we're going to put hundreds of millions of dollars less product into the marketplace for Michael Kors handbags. That is going to create a bit more scarcity and we believe a bit more desire. So we feel like we're on the right path there. And then just concluding, obviously, that's a product that we have delivered -- or we are going to deliver for spring season. We're right on track with where we wanted to be with innovation. And as we spoke about that before, they'll be between 65% and 70% newness come spring season on the floors in our stores and in our wholesale accounts. That's all -- that's going to be terrific. In terms of women's ready-to-wear, the business is performing very, very strong. We're comping up over last year and very strong numbers in our own stores, and we're starting to see the same trend in our wholesale distribution both domestically and internationally. And we've made some great changes to that product and brought a lot of innovation. And Michael and the design teams have just kind of, in our opinion, done a spectacular job there, as they are starting to do the same in accessories. So customers responding to that, we feel really good about that. Footwear also is seeing great response. Again, we're one of the leaders, in particular, in the active -- fashion active market, great response there. And we're going to take on some additional categories, in particular, more dress footwear, which is going to go with that ramp-up in our women's ready-to-wear. And as we talked about, on our e-commerce site, we have the ability with Kors Style that she can click through and buy the whole look. That's an important way that we're going to continue to show our fashion leadership. In terms of watches, I think we are not going to call a bottom yet, but we're definitely seeing improvement. Smartwatches are retailing, she is responding. We have 2 great new styles coming for the fall and holiday season. So we're very hopeful that, that acceleration continues for us. And we hope that the category will be reinvigorated, in particular, because of the smartwatch initiatives we're taking. And I might add, we have an incredible partnership with Google that we'll be talking to you more about in our upcoming call. But we are partnering with them on some very significant programs for the fall season that I think will create a lot of consumer engagement, desire and ultimately, sales for us. And then lastly, while it's small, we're getting some really good response to our men's business. We saw very strong comp store increases in the men's business, both at wholesale and at retail. And again, it's not big enough yet to impact our company. But the early indications are over the next few years, this is going to be a powerful business for the company. And again, as we've said, our goal is to rightsize our accessories business and then have it have some low single-digit growth starting next year, and then really have these other categories augment our lifestyle stores and our wholesale distribution and provide a bit more accelerated growth as they're underpenetrated to our total company and in the marketplace in terms of competition. And then lastly, to answer your question on wholesale, it's early days. We are feeling and we are planning with our partners that next calendar year, we will start to see some small increases in the business. And we're hopeful that, that is what's going to happen. We have to get through the holiday season. And -- but the response to what the consumers have seen in our -- or the wholesale customers have seen in our showrooms is quite strong, and I think they're feeling good about where we are executing against our plan with them to reduce promotional activity, bring a greater scarcity level of product, particularly in North American markets and get AURs up in full-price selling. So sorry for the long-winded answer, but thank you, Kimberly."

John, just can you expand upon the -- you had a nice impressive result that you talked about on the AUR inflection. I think it's the first time in a number of years now. You gave some commentary around the full-price sell-through improvement. In the years past, we've also been hurt on AUR because of, I guess, silhouette. Can you just give us some perspective on what you think silhouette changes come through in the next 12 months to impact AUR, either up or down from here? And then the other thing that kind of stood out in the numbers was the inflection in the retail segment margins. I think it was mentioned that the gross margin improved there. Just kind of give some sense of, are we seeing the floor in the retail segment margins? And what can we kind of think about, now we're starting to see some stabilization in your business model -- or business, where the retail operating margins can reshake back out on a normalized basis going forward over the next couple of years? Because it seems like it's starting to kind of move higher, and just want to get some perspective on the drivers of that change going forward."

On the AUR side, the thing that will continue to drive AUR for the next, I'd call it, almost 12 months is going to be the reduction in promotional activity. That will be the single-largest driver. The second driver of that will actually be our introduction of higher price points into the business, and that's not just raising prices, but it's actually delivering fashion that's very evident to the consumer. And we're really working again with Michael and the design teams on innovative materials and workmanship to that product because clearly, the customer wants that. They want something that's going to be -- look different for them and look different with their wardrobe. And then customization will also help to drive AUR. Again, we're seeing a lot of response to monogramming and all the different areas, whether it's the guitar straps we talked about and whatnot. That's going to become a significant part of the business as we move forward for anyone in this category. That's the tailwind. The headwind is, unfortunately, some of the small leather goods business is being impacted, as you see, with payment plans coming on through all different vendors, there's less need for cash and, in some cases, credit cards. So there is some impact in that business that we're experiencing, which does hurt a little bit as smaller wallet sales are becoming more popular as opposed to larger wallet sales. So again, we'll just have to see how that shakes out. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one of the real key drivers in the men's leather goods business is backpacks, and we're seeing the same thing emerge in the women's business. And that's -- it's really shaking out. It's taking a lot of the tote business, and there's a lot shifting into that category. So I would call that neutral, but it's definitely a trend that's happening out at retail, and I think we're right there to take advantage of it. It's very much a fashion trend. In terms of the retail margins, what you're seeing is, first and foremost, mix shift on a global basis, which we had talked about over the last couple of quarters, that as the Asian business has brought on, which has higher gross margins, and as retail in total is becoming a bigger mix of the company, you're seeing the gross margins favorably impacted. And we think that's going to continue to go forward. Again, we've given guidance, and we think that, that guidance is pretty steady. On the operating margin side where you're seeing improvements, again, that's a mix of what you're seeing happen in terms of the Asian businesses, which are more profitable. But you're also seeing us being able to -- as the comps begin to normalize in our business in North America and in Europe, we're going to stop that deleverage that you're seeing. And hopefully, as we get to flat or slightly increased comps, we're going to create leverage. So -- and then I also want to remind you that, we've talked about it many times, unfortunately, as the e-commerce business grows, we have lower gross -- we have lower operating margins in that business. So that's kind of been a headwind for us. We're making progress in that business. We're making progress in improving our operating margins, again, created by velocity and other activities that we're doing internally to help improve that. So I would tell you that we think that the retail business will ultimately grow in the operating margin in the out years, and that will be driven by stabilization of comps, improvement in how we're operating our e-commerce business and ultimately, positive comps which will create leverage for us. But thank you, Randy."

We're definitely seeing business improve in North America. Now that's I think a combination of a few things. I think our product that we're delivering is getting better, and the customer is responding to that. I would say the traffic trends really haven't changed at all, so that's not something that we're seeing as of yet. But we think that our conversion rates continue to accelerate inside of our stores. But there's definitely a slightly better feeling that we're seeing with the consumers coming into the store being a bit more optimistic and I would say also being more excited about fashion and innovation. I've said before that I think our company needed to be more aggressive in its fashion and innovation, and Michael and the design teams have done just a spectacular job with that. So I'd say it again, we're seeing business definitely improve. And I don't think it's a channel that's one channel versus the other. It's just a general -- there's a little bit of uptick that we're feeling, so it gives us some optimism going into the fall season the way that she is responding to newness. And also, I want to leave you with one other thing too. The reduction in promotional activity, what we've seen is that she's not biting us on that. As long as we are giving her the right product, she's responding extremely well. And our 2 best-selling products being Mercer and our smartwatches have basically no sale. There are some limited colors that are on sale on Mercer. But we really have shown that if it's the right product, you do not have to have these aggressive markdowns happening at retail, and I think that's proving to be a real plus for us. Moving on to Jimmy Choo, super excited. I have to tell you that we've now had a number of meetings with the management team. We're heading off there again this afternoon. And Pierre and Sandra and the management team there are just -- I can't tell you how excited we are to have them as part of our organization and family and group. And we really believe in the plan that they've developed and are executing on. And I think it's too early to make any comments about synergies. I have said before, whatever synergies there will be won't be anything significant, that we think that the biggest opportunity in acquiring Jimmy Choo and bringing it into our fashion luxury group is the fact that this company, we very strongly believe, will grow to $1 billion. And if we and the Jimmy Choo management team were able to achieve that, we think that, as Tom had stated earlier, that will add to some very nice accretion for the company in the long term. So if we're able to execute on 2020 and the Jimmy Choo plan rolls out as we anticipate, I think we will have a company that's delivering very significant revenue in totality with some very nice growth and operating earnings and net income earnings that will be growing in the future. Thank you, Lindsay."

I think first, we know from the industry trend that product -- we're in a cycle where more innovation is what the consumer is responding to, and we're not the only company seeing that. You certainly look at many of our luxury -- our European luxury competitors, and they're seeing the same type of response from the end consumer. And given that we are a global luxury brand, we don't just compete in North America, but we compete around the world. And we're sitting on the best streets in the world across from the best -- or next to the best competitors in the world. So we have to really excite the customer because she has choices. And we know that, clearly, in the women's ready-to-wear business where we got off to a little quicker start and being able to get that innovation in front of the consumer, the results have been outstanding. And so now we have actually customers coming in here saying, let's make it a little bigger next year. And we're going to slow, and we're going to be patient about that. We have our own retail teams who are going, wow, let's get more of this in our stores, and we're seeing the consumer respond. We saw that same kind of reaction in this market when we opened up with our accessories collections where our teams and our retail partners walked in and said, wow, this is different, our customer is going to respond to this. So some of this innovation is based on taking the bag like Mercer, which is -- or a group like Mercer, which is very strong and powerful for us, and creating layer-ups in that. Some of this is based upon areas that are very strong in terms of fashion trends like backpacks, we talked about. And some of this is in new groups that we're introducing. A little bit of that will happen, as we said already, in the holiday season. We have new introductions that are going to be coming in, in particular in calendar Q4, which will be right before the holiday season. So we'll get some reactions from that and be able to chase those products where the consumer does react strongly too. So I think that the strategy is across all product categories inside the company. And so that really gives us the feeling that we're on the right track. And again, early results of what we're seeing in some of the newness and innovation, which I talked about in the previous call, in some of the layer-up products and 1 or 2 of the new styles that we introduced have been quite good. So I think the response from our own teams, response from the wholesale accounts and early indications from the end consumer have given us reason to feel that we're on the right track with Runway 2020. It's still going to take time. That being said, we think we've got the right plan in place. Thank you, Omar."

We are pleased to have laid the foundation for our global fashion luxury group, Michael Kors Holdings Limited with the recently completed acquisition of Jimmy Choo. With a rich history as a leading luxury",2003,"Thank you, Christina, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to have laid the foundation for our global fashion luxury group, Michael Kors Holdings Limited with the recently completed acquisition of Jimmy Choo. With a rich history as a leading luxury house renowned worldwide for its glamorous and fashion forward footwear and accessories, Jimmy Choo represents an excellent complement to the Michael Kors fashion house. We believe that bringing together these 2 iconic brands further strengthens our future growth opportunities, increases our product and geographic diversification, and importantly, creates a platform for future acquisitions. 
Turning to the Michael Kors brand. While still early, we made important initial progress on our Runway 2020 strategic plan. As we have discussed in the past, Runway 2020 is centered on 3 focus areas: Product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience. 
Beginning with product innovation. We continue to introduce exceptional new fashion and additional layering into our fall accessories collection, resulting in an approximately 40% increase in new offerings. During the quarter, we launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors Collection line. Handcrafted in Italy, Bancroft marks a meaningful first step in our efforts to expand our collection offerings to increase fashion and luxury layering in our overall accessories assortments. From the MICHAEL Michael Kors line, we introduced Sadie, a new soft satchel that features chain inlay detailing and a cool fashion sensibility. Our Mercer and Sloan editor collections remained favorites among consumers. And we updated these iconic shapes with lux snakeskin and crocodile embossed textures. Finally, we offered a novelty take on our Somma satchel with a limited edition offering of handbag detailed with artful depictions of iconic cities like New York and London. Overall, consumers responded favorably to the continued fashion luxury innovation and increased layering in our accessories assortments. 
The sequential improvement in our accessories global comparative sales performance for the quarter illustrates that we are moving the brand in the right direction. 
In womenâ€™s footwear, we drove double-digit global comparable sales growth in the quarter. Consumers responded favorably to our fall offerings, including key styles featured in our international ad campaign, the boot, and studded cage sandal. Additionally, our new Alice Dolly flat, which features our iconic locks charm, was among our top sellers in the quarter. Lastly, our elevated active assortments continues to resonate with consumers. The [ Alley ] sneaker with its glamorous metallic accent and mixed materials was a strong seller during the quarter. 
Turning to women's ready-to-wear. We continue to make strides in growing this category as we leverage Michael's fashion leadership and runway heritage. Global comparative sales increased double digits in this category during the quarter as consumers continue to respond to our elevated and expanded offerings, including romantic details such as florals, ruffles and lace. Embellishments such as iconic studding details were also well received. In addition, we capitalized on the strong sweater dress trend offering expanded array in the variety of seasonal styles and colors. 
In our men's business, sportswear and luxury leather goods continue to exhibit strength in the quarter. New and unique design elements drove the largest increase in our men's sportswear category. The injection of elevated product across categories, particularly in our knitwear, lightweight sweaters and fine gauge yarns and layering pieces such as jackets and leathers was some of our best sellers. 
In leather goods, backpacks remained the #1 selling silhouette. Our iconic brand, Harrison and [indiscernible] collections continue to be top performers. Men's sportswear and leather goods are an important and growing category for us, and we will continue to build on the positive momentum with the goal of reaching $1 billion in sales over time. 
In the watch category, we continue to drive innovation with the introduction of our new Sofie ACCESS smartwatches during the quarter. Light weight and feminine with a bezel and a full round display, Sofie generated excitement among consumers and is now the top-selling watch in our stores. We believe that the Michael Kors brand is well positioned to be a leader in the fashion smartwatch category as we excite, engage consumers who are interested in incorporating both fashion and technology into their lives. 
Looking ahead to the 2017 holiday season. We will build on the positive momentum in our Bancroft collection introducing new colors and textures. Additional innovation and fashion layering will be injected into the MICHAEL Michael Kors accessories assortments where we expect increase the level of new offerings for holiday to approximately 50%. We will introduce the Bristol group, a top handled bag crafted from rich padded leather and embellished with size and a removable lock and key detail. Bristol will be featured in our national ad campaign. In addition, we will debut our new group the Voyager, which is an evolution of the iconic jet set tote. 
In footwear, holiday offerings will emphasize feminine details and embellishments, including glitter, ruffles, bows and stars. 
Finally, in ready-to-wear, we are excited about the opportunity to build our significant momentum in this category. We broadened our holiday assortments with a mix of feminine and flirty party options as well as a focus on novelty embellishments and shine as our customers dress to celebrate the holiday season. 
Turning to brand engagement. We continue to deepen our connection with consumers and create excitement for our brand globally. In September, Michael debuted his spring 2018 Collection at New York Fashion Week to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Our front row featured a high wattage array of global celebrities, including Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts and Catherine Zeta Jones, as well as our newly appointed brand ambassador, Chinese actress, Yang Mi. As our first ever Michael Kors brand ambassador, Yang Mi is a great fit for our luxury house. She epitomizes effortless glamor. Additionally, she is the influential trendsetters in China right now with more than 70 million followers on [ Wei Bo ] 
Social media is a cornerstone of our communications efforts and remains a principal focus in deepening our connections with consumers. We are pleased with the continued growth in both our total followers and engagements across all social media channels. We now have over 38 million followers across all our social channels. 
Looking ahead, we have an exciting collaboration planned with Google where a 360-degree marketing campaign to support ACCESS smartwatches. The campaign will feature television advertising that will run during the holiday season. This will be amplified by marketing in print, outdoor and digital channels globally. We expect this exciting global marketing campaign will further heighten the demand for our ACCESS smartwatches and ensure they are top of mind during the holiday gifting period. 
Moving to customer experience. We continue to elevate our digital flagships and our store fleets. We are seeing strong momentum in our digital flagships, particularly as we add additional features and capabilities. Earlier this year, we launched our online dress shop with favorable results. In the second quarter, we continue to build on that positive momentum, driving incremental growth of ready-to-wear sales on our digital flagships. 
In our stores, we are in the initial stages of renovating approximately 100 locations globally as part of our Runway 2020 initiatives. Our new retail concept reflects a refined take on glamor and a modern and engaging environment. This new concept will feature salon that showcase our accessories, footwear, womenswear and men's wear collections, while enhancing our sales associates ability to provide consumers with a unique and elevated styling experience. While we have a limited number of stores that reflect this new design concept, we are pleased with the initial response. I look forward to sharing more details about our fleet renovation plans with you in the coming quarters. 
Now turning to the financial highlights from the second quarter. Our results exceeded our expectations. Total revenue was $1.15 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. Retail comparable sales decreased 1.8%, and adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 37% to $1.33. 
In the Americas, total revenue increased approximately 1% in the quarter. Retail net sales in the region were flat with comparable sales declining in the mid-single-digits. The momentum in our digital flagships continued with a double-digit increase in comparable sales in the quarter. Our strategy to reduce promotional activity resulted in 40% fewer days on promotion, which negatively impacted our comparable sales. However, we benefited from increased AURs in our digital flagships and Lifestyle stores driven by mid-single digit growth in accessories and double-digit growth in our ready-to-wear. We attribute the higher AUR to strong consumer response to the elevated product newness and innovation as well as reduced promotional activity. 
Wholesale net sales in the Americas increased 2.3%. We saw increases in AUR across women's accessories, footwear and ready-to-wear, driven by positive consumer response to our more elevated and layered fashion offerings as well as 46 fewer days, brand-wide promotionally as compared to last year. 
Moving to Europe. Total revenue increased 9.2%. In the retail channel, net sales grew 17.5%. Comparable sales were approximately flat on a reported basis and declined in the mid-single-digits on a constant-currency basis. Including e-commerce, sales -- comparable sales would have increased in the low single digits on a constant-currency basis. This performance exceeded our expectations as our elevated fashion offerings generated even greater excitement among consumers than we anticipated. Ready-to-wear and footwear were also well-received in the quarter with comparable sales growing in the double-digit and high single digit ranges, respectively. 
Europe wholesale net sales were essentially flat in the quarter as the continued strategic reduction in shipments related to elevating our brand positioning was offset by favorable foreign exchange rates. 
Turning to Asia. Net sales grew 30.4% in the quarter with retail net sales up 31% driven by new store openings and positive comparable sales growth. Comparable sales, which now include China grew in the mid-single digit range on a reported basis and in the high single digit range on a constant-currency basis. The accessories category performed well in Asia during the quarter. We continue to deepen the level of fashion and luxury layering in our accessories assortments, including the introduction of our Bancroft group from the Michael Kors Collection as well as Sadie from the MICHAEL Michael Kors line. Additionally, Mercer, Selma and Sloan collections continue to be among the most popular styles. In China, our structured crossbodies, including our Sloan, Editor and collections were particularly popular among millennial consumers. Asia wholesale net sales increased 27.2%. 
We continue to see strong performance in Mainland China and Japan. Hong Kong and Macau remained challenged, but began to show signs of improvements in the quarter while South Korea continue to be impacted by the decline in Mainland Chinese tourists. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our Asia business and continue to invest in our retail network as we build on the positive momentum in this growing region. 
Finally, in our licensing business, revenue decreased approximately 2% in the quarter. ACCESS smartwatches continue to perform well particularly the introduction of our new style, Sofie. However, the fashion watch category continues to be challenging, and we expect continued sales declines through the fiscal year in our total watch category. 
In fragrance, we expanded our successful business with the global launch of our new fragrance pillar, Sexy Ruby. 
Finally, in eyewear, we continue to focus on developing our optical collection with a fashion point of view. Sleek metal designs and fresh modern shapes continue to generate excitement among consumers. In sunglasses, mirrored glances continued to be top performers across a variety of shapes, including our iconic aviators. We also saw positive response to an expanded array of shapes, including glamorous oversized squares and cat eyes. 
In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect the traction we are gaining on our Runway 2020 strategic plan. However, fiscal 2018 remains a year of transition for the Michael Kors brand as we are still in the early stages of executing our initiatives, and we look forward to providing you with updates on our progress in the coming quarters. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom."

I will begin by providing details on our second quarter performance followed by our outlook for the third quarter and full year, which incorporates the impact of the Jimmy Choo acquisition. Starting with the second qua",1068,"Thank you, John, and good morning. I will begin by providing details on our second quarter performance followed by our outlook for the third quarter and full year, which incorporates the impact of the Jimmy Choo acquisition. 
Starting with the second quarter. Results exceeded our expectation with adjusted net income of $204.5 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, an increase of 37%. The better-than-expected performance was due to higher retail and wholesale net sales combined with lower operating expense, which was largely related to timing. 
Total second quarter revenue of $1.15 billion increased 5.4% compared to last year. Retail net sales increased 8% largely driven by 56 net new store openings since the end of last year's second quarter, along with the benefit of Europe and Asia e-commerce. This was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 1.8%, or 2.5% decline in constant currency. North America e-commerce benefited comparable sales by 260 basis points. Wholesale net sales increased 2.5% compared to last year. 
During the quarter, seasonal replenishment orders in our accessories and footwear categories were higher than anticipated reflecting better full-price sell-throughs. 
Licensing revenue decreased 2.1% primarily due to declines in fashion watches and jewelry, partially offset by growth in ACCESS smartwatches. While we are pleased with the continued growth of ACCESS smartwatches, the fashion watch business remains challenging, and we expect sales in this category to decline through the second half of this fiscal year. 
Gross margin for the quarter was 60.2% compared to 59.2% last year. Retail gross margin increased 160 basis points, benefiting from an increase in international sales as a percentage of the total as well as lower cost of goods. Wholesale gross margin was roughly flat year-over-year. 
Total adjusted operating expense increased $17.3 million, reflecting continued investments in our digital flagships and marketing initiative as well as new store openings. As a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating expense declined to 39.5% from 40.1% in the prior year, reflecting leverage on higher sales. 
Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 20.7% compared to 19.2% in the prior year. Adjusted retail operating margin was 15.4% compared to 12.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This year-over-year increase was driven by the expansion in gross margins and leverage on higher net sales. Adjusted wholesale operating margin was 27.3% compared to 27.0% in the prior year. 
Turning to our Runway 2020 fleet optimization initiative. During the second quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of $5.9 million related to store closures as well as a noncash charge of $16.3 million for store impairments primarily related to underperforming stores and additional stores we've identified for closure. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $43.1 million and were related to retail store openings and renovations as well as continued investments in information system enhancements. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $178.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. 
Now turning to our guidance. The numbers we are providing today reflect our expectations for our global fashion luxury group, including Jimmy Choo which will be incorporated into our results beginning November 1. Before turning to our outlook, as we have stated, we made the strategic decision to reduce promotional activity around the Michael Kors brand to drive higher AUR and higher full-price sell-through and to protect the long-term image of our brand. I would like to note that in the third quarter, we will be anniversary-ing the highest level of promotional activity in the prior year. 
In retail, our new promotional strategy will result in a 66% reduction in promotional days in our digital flagships and Lifestyle stores compared to the prior year. We anticipate that will be a significant headwind to retail comparable sales. In wholesale, we expect to have 67 fewer promotional days than last year. And as a result, we anticipate that sales will decrease more than our full year expectation of a low-teens decline and wholesale gross margin will decline more than in previous quarters. 
Taking this into account, we expect the following for the third quarter on an adjusted basis: Total revenue to be between $1.355 billion and $1.385 billion, including between $105 million and $110 million of revenue from Jimmy Choo; comparable sales for the Michael Kors brand to decline in the high-single digits; gross margin of approximately 60.5%; operating expense of approximately 43.0% of total revenue, including the impact of a shift in timing of expenses from the second quarter into the second half of the year; and operating margin of approximately 17.5%, a tax rate of approximately 17.5% and weighted average shares outstanding of $155 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.22 to $1.27, including anticipated dilution from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.04. 
For the full year, we now expect the following, all on an adjusted basis: Total revenue of approximately $4.59 billion, including between $215 million and $225 million of revenue from Jimmy Choo; comparable sales for the Michael Kors brand to decline in the mid-single-digits; gross margin of approximately 60.0%; operating expense of roughly 44.0% of total revenue, including the impact of a shift in timing of expenses from the second quarter into the second half of the year; and operating margin of approximately 16.0%, a tax rate of approximately 17.0% and weighted average shares outstanding of $156 million; and finally, diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.85 to $3.95, including anticipated dilution from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.08. 
We anticipate capital expenditures for Michael Kors Holdings Limited of approximately $200 million, including Jimmy Choo, which will be focused on select new store openings, renovations to our retail store fleet and investment in information system enhancements. 
For the full fiscal year 2018, we now expect to close between 40 and 50 stores, with a total expense of $40 million to $60 million. We expect transaction costs related to the acquisition of Jimmy Choo to be approximately $50 million and transition costs to be between $15 million and $20 million as we integrate Jimmy Choo into the broader group. 
Overall, we were please for the second quarter performance and believe we are on track with our Runway 2020 strategic plan. We remain excited about our long-term prospects and also look forward to working with the Jimmy Choo team as we grow our global fashion luxury group. 
Now, I will turn the call back over to John for closing remarks."

Needless to say, we're really excited about the acquisition of Jimmy Choo. We've had an opportunity to spend a fair amount of time with the management team led by Pierre Denis who's the CEO, and Sandra Choi, who is the creative Director and as you may now, Sandra has actually been with the company and found the company 20 years ago. So we've got a great team in place as well as their entire executive team around the world. So we go into this feeling very, very strong about the management. We feel very strong about the brand, as you know, they are the -- one of the leaders in luxury footwear in the world, and really hold an iconic positioning there. So we believe we have a few different areas of opportunity. We stated that we're going to grow that business to over $1 billion, and we think we've got a relatively -- a clear vision on that. Number one, there is an opportunity to open additional stores. And those will be predominantly in Europe and in Asia. Along with that, the e-commerce platform in the business is growing very rapidly, and we see a great opportunity to further enhance that with the team. So that's the first opportunity for us. The second opportunity is to take advantage of the accessories momentum that they already have, and really build that out to a much greater degree. Jimmy Choo has a very, very engaged customer who finds a place in her wardrobe for that product and for the vision of the brand. So you can look to us really over the next 24 months to make a major commitment to the accessories business with Jimmy Choo as we expand that category with them. And third, the men's business is also growing very rapidly inside the Jimmy Choo company. And we see that as a great opportunity to accelerate. They're already doing an outstanding job with that, and we're just going to work together to continue to build on that. So those are the 3 key areas for us that we feel very comfortable and, I would say, that the management team and Jimmy Choo feels very comfortable in executing. With our new formed alliance, they'll be able to move a little quicker on some of these initiatives than they were previously able to. So that's really one of the major advantages to being strategically aligned with us. And of course, we have a pretty deep history in the accessories business so we think we can bring some knowledge there. Let me -- there really will be very little synergies as we stated previously. The Jimmy Choo business is a very different business in terms of where the product is manufactured and how they're structured internally. So I would expect no -- little to no synergies on that situation."

And that's led by product innovation, which you clearly see it if you're following us on Instagram or if you're looking at our e-mails on a daily basis, I think you've seen a marked difference in the way that the company is communicating to consumers. And I want to say, we're leading a little bit more with what we call Kors Style. But Michael is a runway designer. Michael has got many, many years of leading the consumer in terms of a fashion statement and we're taking advantage of that positioning in our company. And so Kors Style is really the cornerstone of our communication to the customers. And then, of course, we've got a very large footwear business that we don't talk a lot about that's growing very nicely, and we see that as a way to really head to toe dress our customers, and that's giving a lot of additional opportunity for our sales associate inside the stores to reach out and talk to our consumers and of course, you're going to see that in some of the new stores that we're building out where we'll be taking a much more a lifestyle approach to the brand, and really highlighting those other strengths inside of our company. In terms of the handbag or accessories business. I don't think there's any secret. In Asia, the business is very, very strong, so I'm going to start from East and go to the West. And that's not only in the Michael Kors business but that's in obviously, the luxury players that are in the marketplace. So very strong reception to the category in that marketplace, driven by I would say, younger millennials and slightly older who are really continuing to find luxury and aspirational luxury for many different companies. So we're extremely pleased with how the category is developing in that marketplace. I would say, Europe, got a little more solid over the last quarter driven again, by I would say, tourists. We saw a significant return or elevation, I would say, in the Chinese tourists traveling to Europe and there has been a return in certain categories of tourists who had declined -- who are starting to come back to Europe. So we're feeling more confident, and you can see that in our results in Europe. I would say, the American marketplace remains relatively muted in the category, if not slightly down. And we've taken the position that the American market, we actually want to shrink in terms of accessories and we've done that through 2 ways. Number one, we are shipping less products into our department store partners as well as our stores in our as own stores in the accessories we're also less promotional significantly as you can see by the amount of days, and again, in Q3, it's going to be very, very dramatic reduction even beyond what we've done so far. And we think that's the right thing for the brand. So again, the customer is going -- it's going to be a little more difficult for them to find a Michael Kors products on sale in the accessories category, and we think that will mute the trend in the marketplace. Again, small bags continue to drive the business also smaller wallets, which affect the AURs, so we're particularly pleased to see the AUR increase we have in the continued light of smaller bags and smaller wallets driving the business. And by the way, that trend is not a North American trend, that trend is a global trend. So that's still a headwind for us as the consumer continues to see that as the fashion quotient, and not necessarily about price."

But we what we need to remain committed to as a company is our own digital flagships, and that being the cornerstone of how we're engaging with the customer and how we are going to move the brand continually forward. It's too early to ascertain whether what the future is with Amazon or any other platform. Right now, our position is that we're focused on our own digital communications with the consumer. And we think that's the right place for us to be, and certainly, we're showing a strong double-digit growth by doing that. And we've got a long way to go until we consider ourselves best-in-class.

Number one, we haven't really talked about it in this call but just as a macro trend issue kind of related back to what Omar was asking. As you probably are aware from walking the streets, et cetera, backpacks are very, very strong, and it's one of our fastest-growing classifications, and we're really pleased about that because of the AUR in backpacks is high, which is good for us. So there's actually little decline in the tote business because it's really shifting to backpacks because of the fashion trend but that being said, what we're doing is really elevating, and you're going to see a whole elevation of totes from us over the next kind of 6 months where we think there is a fashion statement to be made there. It was a bit more utilitarian previously. And now that you've got a lot of people or women coming to work in sneakers and/or trainers, there's just a little less utilitarian use for the tote, so we're trying to make it much more about fashion and I think you're going to see a lot of that coming in the coming quarters. And again, what we're seeing is the more innovation that we're delivering on our accessories, on our ready-to-wear and on our footwear, the more the customer is responding. Again, Michael's got 30 years of leading with fashion runway design and we're going to use that as a real cornerstone of how we're communicating with the customer, in particular, through Kors Style. So thank you very much, Oliver."

We thought that was the right thing to do for the image of our brand. Number one. Number two, we also focused on some iconic groups where we really made sure that they were very, very key in terms of their price points and that was our Mercer, our Selma, our Hamilton, our Cynthia, our Savanna, there were 5 core groups for us that we really -- we wanted to make sure that when the customer came in the store, whether they were on sale or not, it didn't matter. The value is tremendous, not only in terms of the design but price-value relationship. And that's really turned out to be a good strategy across. And in fact, that's one of the reasons why you saw the Wholesale business delivered better than we had anticipated, and that was just based upon our replenishment and what we saw happening there. And then you layer on top of that what's happening with some of the new groups that we added into the category. And so what, I would say, to you is that our partners in the department store community are, I think, very pleased with how our strategy has turned out. I must say to you that in our second quarter, we saw some nice trends happening in the department store environment. So we were very pleased, and I think they were pleased also to see we can sell product at a higher price, we can sell product that isn't on sale, and that the customer is excited about newness and elevation. So that's working well for us. We're very cautious about Q3. I know everyone is concerned about the deceleration between Q2 and Q3 in the way that we're guiding for comparable store sales growth. We're being very cautious because as Tom pointed out, in our own stores it's about 66% less promotional activity, that's tremendous amount. So I can't say to you, which inning we're in. But what I can say to you is that the initial indications from both product and from our reduction in promotional cadence is going well. So I would tell you that we're pleased. This is going to carry on all the way through Q4 even though we will, ""lap"" in the second half of Q4, there's still going to be settlement that has to happen in terms of where the inventories end up arriving. And I remember, I mentioned this on one of the other calls, we will still have a decline, as you look forward, it will flatten out somewhat in 2019, fiscal, but there'll still be some decline heading into the first part of that because as we sell at a higher AUR, you need less inventory in there to mark down. Again, that's all good. That's very healthy for the business. So we view, I think we'll be able to have a better assessment on where we are coming out of Q3/sort of midway through Q4, and hopefully, we'll be reporting to you that we're continuing to make progress."

Maybe you can just touch on the reduction in promotional days both in wholesale and retail in the second quarter and how that compares to the third quarter? It sounded like there was a greater reduction in Q3, but not materially enough for such a differential in the sales results. Is it just that during the holiday season, when you're less promotional, there's a greater negative impact on sales because everybody else is so promotional?

Let me start out by reiterating to everyone that we have raised our guidance for the year. So I want to complement our company that we are flowing through a significant part of the beat in Q2 for the year. The second thing is, and Tom will talk about this in a little bit, but part of what you're seeing in that to give guidance is expenses that have shifted from the -- that Tom spoke about in his prepared remarks, from Q2 to Q3. So that's impacting some of the EPS. But overall for the year, as you can see, we're still taking the year up for the company. We always knew internally that we would be at a higher comp store decline in Q3 than any other quarter. I know that some of the models that are out there didn't indicate that, but we knew because again, as you can see for the year, we're guiding for overall mid-single digit comp store decline for the year. And so we'll have a little worse in Q3, and we'll have a little better in Q4, if you look at the model. And by the way, our stores are not trending a whole lot different from what we're seeing in the department store environment. The reason why you're seeing the delta so high in Q3 is number one, it was the most amount of days we were on promotion of any of the 4 quarters. And secondly, it is the largest dollar volume quarter. So because when you have those 2 things happening at retail, you're going to have the largest impact to all of the factors that are happening around in the business. So as I said to you before, we actually had a very nice Q2 with our department store partners here in North America. And I think we were all pleased, they were, and we were, by the performance that we saw relative to our sales plans and relative to the fact that we were ahead of our mutually agreed to sales plan. Again, we are trying to take the business down at retail in our Q3. And that's because we want less product out there to be not only on promotion with less promotional days, but then mark down at the end of the season because we're dealing with that situation in Europe, which we've talked about. We want to end the season with less promotional product for the customer when we begin our final sale periods upon. So I think this is all going exactly according to plan, and may be slightly better. We hope that we'll have a good holiday season. And if we do, again, we might do better than what we have guided to, if we do have a better-than-anticipated holiday season. But that being case, I think we're taking a very prudent view of the environment and, in particular, our promotional policy. So remember, it's the largest amount of days of all the quarters and secondly, it is the biggest of the 4 quarters that we have in terms of retail sales. But let me turn it over to Tom so he can talk to you a little bit about the expense movement, which affects the modeling."

So that part, we did not flow through to the full year. The other addition was the expected dilution from Jimmy Choo around $0.08. So that in total, that's how we were looking at it and as John mentioned, Q3 a little more conservative based on the reduction in promotional days, but overall, this is very much in line with our prior guidance of mid-single digit declines in comp sales across the year and in line with that thinking."

B, less promotions; or C, mix from higher average unit retail offerings like the Bancroft collection? And just years there. And Tom, could you give us some perspective on putting the gross margin for the third quarter and beyond.

Randy, on the AUR side, we don't report how much it has gone down from its peak. But in it is down for sure. Part of that was self-inflicted, a couple of years ago when we were looking for higher units per transaction, and therefore, we went up for categories, jewelry and, et cetera to bring up that and that started to lower some of the AUR and then we saw originally some of the bag sizing shift, which wasn't something that we had anticipated. To be honest with you, we've had set an internal goal, don't know whether we'll achieve it or not, but we've kind of used the number 10%, that's what we're just shooting as a benchmark and we're not going to report on that little quarterly basis. I'm just telling you, giving some color of that that's a number that you picked out and said you want to try and achieve that over time. And that's for us, when we look at that, remember that's aggregated between accessories and women's ready-to-wear and footwear. So we're looking at that as an overall, I would almost say it's to our average transaction and AURs as well, so that will drift up and down in categories depending on different things that we're doing at different times in the various categories. So as a good example, in the booty category, in footwear, we sharpened our price points in booties, and that's really helped our business tremendously, affected our average AUR at this point in time, during the year because booties obviously are pretty significant, but it helped AURs dramatically. So there's going to be different things we're going to do during the quarter but overall, we know that from the pullback in promotional activity, we're going to sell last units and therefore, we're going to need to take our AUR up and obviously, that's a very important part of our long-term success for returning to comp store sales.

Brian, as Tom presented in our Investor Day, we have said, and we continue to believe that 2019 fiscal will be your growth in revenue and earnings per share. I think we further view that our operating income is going to be returning to growth as well. So I think that's a very important inflection point for the company because we know that over the last couple of years, our operating income has declined, and we're vigorous about our opportunity to turn that around both from the Michael Kors brand standpoint and also don't forget that, that's going to be impacted by Jimmy Choo at least on the operating income, which will be very nicely positive for the company. So we are also looking at all the different levers inside the company as we're kind of rebalancing the organization. You know we have a fleet optimization program that's going on, and we look to, as we close these approximately 100 stores over the next 2 years, but that will have an impact on our operating margin as well and create some leverage on the OpEx [ side ] Again, we're very encouraged about what the future lies ahead for us. Good indications for Runway 2020. We're kind of -- believe that we are seeing the initial results that we had hoped. And if those continue to flow through, we think our objectives for 2019 will be very much in our sights and our ability to deliver on that. Secondly, in terms of the fashion watch business, it was a fairly sizable impact to our comp store sales, we don't break that out, but it was very sizable. So we do not see that turning around as we said in the prepared remarks for the balance of the year. The smartwatch business is mitigating that to some degree, but not enough to offset the decline in the fashion watch business. So therefore, that's one of the reasons, and we said that to you some months ago at the Investor Day, we are very focused on our footwear business and our women's ready-to-wear business as categories to offset that decline and as the accessories business stabilizes, that will really be the balance that will begin to return us to positive comp store sales.

We are pleased to have laid the foundation for our global fashion luxury group, Michael Kors Holdings Limited, with the recently completed acquisition of Jimmy Choo. With a rich history as a leading luxury house renowned worldwide for its glamorous and fashion-forward footwear and accessories, Jimmy Choo represents an excellent complement to the Michael Kors fashion house. We believe that bringing together these 2 iconic brands further strengthens our future growth opportunities; increases our product and geographic diversification; and importantly, creates a platform for future acquisitions.
Turning to the Michael Kors brand. While still early, we made important initial progress on our Runway 2020 strategic plan. As we have discussed in the past, Runway 2020 is centered on 3 focus areas: product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience.
Beginning with product innovation. We continued to introduce exceptional new fashion and additional layering into our fall accessories collection, resulting in an approximately 40% increase in new offerings. During the quarter, we launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors Collection line. Handcrafted in Italy, Bancroft marks a meaningful first step in our efforts to expand our collection offerings to increase fashion and luxury layering in our overall accessories assortments. From the MICHAEL Michael Kors line, we introduced Sadie, a new soft satchel that features chain inlay detailing and a cool fashion sensibility. Our Mercer and Sloan Editor collections remained favorites among consumers, and we updated these iconic shapes and luxe -- with luxe snakeskin and crocodile-embossed textures. Finally, we offered a novelty take on our Selma satchel with a limited-edition offering of handbag detailed with artful depictions of iconic cities like New York and London. Overall, consumers responded favorably to the continued fashion luxury innovation and increased layering in our accessories assortments. 
The sequential improvement in our accessories' global comparative sales performance for the quarter illustrates that we are moving the brand in the right direction.
In women's footwear, we drove double-digit global comparable sales growth in the quarter. Consumers responded favorably to our fall offerings, including key styles featured in our international ad campaign, the Lori boot and Sherry studded caged sandal. Additionally, our new Alice ballet flat, which features our iconic locks charm, was among our top sellers in the quarter. Lastly, our elevated active assortments continues to resonate with consumers. The Allie sneaker, with its glamorous metallic accents and mixed materials, was a strong seller during the quarter.
Turning to women's ready to wear. We continued to make strides in growing this category as we leveraged Michael's fashion leadership and runway heritage. Global comparative sales increased double digits in this category during the quarter as consumers continued to respond to our elevated and expanded offerings, including romantic details such as florals, ruffles and lace. Embellishments such as iconic studding details were also well received. In addition, we capitalized on the strong sweater dress trend, offering an expanded array in the variety of seasonal styles and colors.
In our men's business, sportswear and luxury leather goods continued to exhibit strength in the quarter. New and unique design elements drove the largest increase in our men's sportswear category. The injection of elevated product across categories, particularly in our knitwear, lightweight sweaters and fine gauge yarns; and layering pieces such as jackets and Napa leathers were some of our best sellers. In leather goods, backpacks remain the #1 selling silhouette. Our iconic Bryant, Harrison and Odin leather collections continue to be top performers. Men's sportswear and leather goods are an important and growing category for us, and we will continue to build on the positive momentum, with the goal of reaching $1 billion in sales over time.
In the watch category, we continued to drive innovation with the introduction of our new Sofie access smartwatches during the quarter. Lightweight and feminine with a pavÃ© bezel and a full round display, Sofie generated excitement among consumers and is now the top-selling watch in our stores. We believe that the Michael Kors brand is well positioned to be a leader in the fashion smartwatch category as we excite and engage consumers who are interested in incorporating both fashion and technology into their lives.
Looking ahead to the 2017 holiday season. We will build on the positive momentum in our Bancroft collection, introducing new colors and textures. Additional innovation and fashion layering will be injected into the MICHAEL Michael Kors accessories assortments, where we expect to increase the level of new offerings for holiday to approximately 50%. We will introduce the Bristol group, a top-handled bag crafted from rich-pebbled leather and embellished with grommeted side ties and a removable lock-and-key detail. Bristol will be featured in our national ad campaign. In addition, we will debut our new tote group, the Voyager, which is an evolution of the iconic Jet Set tote. In footwear, holiday offerings will emphasize feminine details and embellishments, including glitter, ruffles, sequined bows and stars. Finally, in ready to wear, we are excited about the opportunity to build our significant momentum in this category. We broadened our holiday assortments with a mix of feminine and flirty party options as well as a focus on novelty embellishments and shine as our customers dress to celebrate the holiday season.
Turning to brand engagement. We continued to deepen our connection with consumers and create excitement for our brand globally. In September, Michael debuted his spring 2018 collection at New York Fashion Week to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Our front row featured a high-wattage array of global celebrities, including Nicole Kidman; Naomi Watts; and Catherine Zeta-Jones; as well as our newly appointed brand ambassador, Chinese actress Yang Mi. As our first-ever Michael Kors brand ambassador, Yang Mi is a great fit for our luxury house. She epitomizes effortless glamor. Additionally, she is one of the most influential trendsetters in China right now, with more than 70 million followers on WeiBo.
Social media is a cornerstone of our communications efforts and remains a principal focus in deepening our connection with consumers. We are pleased with the continued growth in both our total followers and engagements across all social media channels. We now have over 38 million followers across all our social channels. Looking ahead, we have an exciting collaboration plan with Google for a 360-degree marketing campaign to support access smartwatches. The campaign will feature television advertising that will run during the holiday season. This will be amplified by marketing in print, outdoor and digital channels globally. We expect this exciting global marketing campaign will further heighten the demand for our access smartwatches and ensure they are top of mind during the holiday gifting period.
Moving to customer experience. We continued to elevate our digital flagships and our store fleet. We are seeing strong momentum in our digital flagships, particularly as we add additional features and capabilities. Earlier this year, we launched our online dress shop, with favorable results. In the second quarter, we continued to build on that positive momentum, driving incremental growth of ready-to-wear sales on our digital flagships. In our stores, we are in the initial stages of renovating approximately 100 locations globally as part of our Runway 2020 initiatives. Our new retail concept reflects a refined take on glamor in a modern and engaging environment. This new concept will feature salons that showcase our accessories, footwear, womenswear and men's wear collections while enhancing our sales associates' ability to provide consumers with a unique and elevated styling experience. While we have a limited number of stores that reflect this new design concept, we are pleased with the initial response. I look forward to sharing more details about our fleet renovation plans with you in the coming quarters.
Now turning to the financial highlights from the second quarter.
Our results exceeded our expectations. Total revenue was $1.15 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. Retail comparable sales decreased 1.8%. And adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 37% to $1.33.
In the Americas, total revenue increased approximately 1% in the quarter. Retail net sales in the region were flat, with comparable sales declining in the mid-single digits. The momentum in our digital flagships continued with a double-digit increase in comparable sales in the quarter. Our strategy to reduce promotional activity resulted in 40% fewer days on promotion, which negatively impacted our comparable sales. However, we benefited from increased AURs in our digital flagships and lifestyle stores driven by mid-single-digit growth in accessories and double-digit growth in our ready to wear. We attribute the higher AUR to strong consumer response to the elevated product newness and innovation as well as reduced promotional activity. Wholesale net sales in the Americas increased 2.3%. We saw increases in AUR across women's accessories, footwear and ready to wear driven by positive consumer response to our more elevated and layered fashion offerings; as well as 46 fewer days brand-wide promotionally, as compared to last year. 
Moving to Europe. Total revenue increased 9.2%. In the retail channel, net sales grew 17.5%. Comparable sales were approximately flat on a reported basis and declined in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. Including e-commerce, sales, comparable sales, would have increased in the low single digits on a constant currency basis. This performance exceeded our expectations, as our elevated fashion offerings generated even greater excitement among consumers than we anticipated. Ready-to-wear and footwear offerings were also well received in the quarter, with comparable sales growing in the double-digit and high single-digit ranges, respectively. Europe wholesale net sales were essentially flat in the quarter, as the continued strategic reduction in shipments related to elevating our brand positioning was offset by favorable foreign exchange rates.
Turning to Asia. Net sales grew 30.4% in the quarter; with retail net sales up 31%, driven by new store openings and positive comparable sales growth. Comparable sales, which now include China, grew in the mid-single-digit range on a reported basis and in the high single-digit range on a constant currency basis. The accessories category performed well in Asia during the quarter. We continued to deepen the level of fashion and luxury layering in our accessories assortments, including the introduction of our Bancroft group from the Michael Kors Collection as well as Sadie from the MICHAEL Michael Kors line. Additionally, Mercer, Selma and Sloan collections continued to be among the most popular styles. In China, our structured crossbodies, including our Sloan Editor and Mott collections, were particularly popular among millennial consumers. Asia wholesale net sales increased 27.2%.
We continued to see strong performance in Mainland China and Japan. Hong Kong and Macau remained challenged but began to show signs of improvements in the quarter, while South Korea continued to be impacted by the decline in Mainland Chinese tourists. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our Asia business and continue to invest in our retail network as we build on the positive momentum in this growing region.
Finally, in our licensing business revenue decreased approximately 2% in the quarter. Access smartwatches continued to perform well, particularly the introduction of our new style Sofie. However, the fashion watch category continues to be challenging, and we expect continued sales declines through the fiscal year in our total watch category. In the -- in fragrance, we expanded our successful business with the global launch of our new fragrance pillar Sexy Ruby. Finally, in eyewear, we continued to focus on developing our optical collection with a fashion point of view. Sleek metal designs; and fresh, modern shapes continued to generate excitement among consumers. In sunglasses, mirrored lenses continued to be top performers across a variety of shapes, including our iconic aviators. We also saw a positive response to an expanded array of shapes, including glamorous oversized squares and cat eyes.
In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect the traction we are gaining on our Runway 2020 strategic plan. However, fiscal 2018 remains a year of transition for the Michael Kors brand, as we are still in the early stages of executing our initiatives. And we look forward to providing you with updates on our progress in the coming quarters.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom."

And good morning.I will begin by providing details on our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the third quarter and full year, which incorporates the impact of the Jimmy Choo acquisition.Starting with the second qu",1072,"Thank you, John. And good morning.
I will begin by providing details on our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the third quarter and full year, which incorporates the impact of the Jimmy Choo acquisition.
Starting with the second quarter. Results exceeded our expectation with adjusted net income of $204.5 million or $1.33 per diluted share, an increase of 37%. The better-than-expected performance was due to higher retail and wholesale net sales combined with lower operating expense which was largely related to timing. Total second quarter revenue of $1.15 billion increased 5.4% compared to last year. Retail net sales increased 8%, largely driven by 56 net new store openings since the end of last year's second quarter, along with the benefit of Europe and Asia e-commerce. This was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 1.8% or a 2.5% decline in constant currency. North America e-commerce benefited comparable sales by 260 basis points. Wholesale net sales increased 2.5% compared to last year.
During the quarter, seasonal replenishment orders in our accessories and footwear categories were higher than anticipated, reflecting better full-price sell-throughs. Licensing revenue decreased 2.1% primarily due to declines in fashion watches and jewelry, partially offset by growth in access smartwatches. While we are pleased with the continued growth of access smartwatches, the fashion watch business remains challenging. And we expect sales in this category to decline through the second half of this fiscal year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 60.2% compared to 59.2% last year. Retail gross margin increased 160 basis points, benefiting from an increase in international sales as a percentage of the total as well as lower cost of goods. Wholesale gross margin was roughly flat year-over-year. Total adjusted operating expense increased $17.3 million, reflecting continued investments in our digital flagships and marketing initiatives as well as new store openings. As a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating expense declined to 39.5% from 40.1% in the prior year, reflecting leverage on higher sales. Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 20.7% compared to 19.2% in the prior year. Adjusted retail operating margin was 15.4% compared to 12.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This year-over-year increase was driven by the expansion in gross margin and leverage on higher net sales. Adjusted wholesale operating margin was 27.3% compared to 27.0% in the prior year.
Turning to our Runway 2020 fleet optimization initiative. During the second quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of $5.9 million related to store closures, as well as a noncash charge of $16.3 million for store impairments primarily related to underperforming stores and additional stores we have identified for closure.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $43.1 million and were related to retail store openings and renovations as well as continued investments in information system enhancements.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $178.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt.
 
Now turning to our guidance. The numbers we are providing today reflect our expectations for our global fashion luxury group including Jimmy Choo, which will be incorporated into our results beginning November 1. Before turning to our outlook: As we have stated, we made the strategic decision to reduce promotional activity around the Michael Kors brand to drive higher AUR and higher full-price sell-through and to protect the long-term image of our brands. I would like to note that, in the third quarter, we will be anniversary-ing the highest level of promotional activity in the prior year. In retail, our new promotional strategy will result in a 66% reduction in promotional days in our digital flagships and lifestyle stores compared to the prior year. We anticipate that will be a significant headwind to retail comparable sales. In wholesale, we expect to have 67 fewer promotional days than last year. And as a result, we anticipate that sales will decrease more than our full year expectation of a low-teens decline, and wholesale gross margin will decline more than in previous quarters.
Taking this into account, we expect the following for the third quarter on an adjusted basis: total revenue to be between $1.355 billion and $1.385 billion, including between $105 million and $110 million of revenue from Jimmy Choo; comparable sales for the Michael Kors brand to decline in the high single digits; gross margin of approximately 60.5%; operating expense of approximately 43.0% of total revenue, including the impact of a shift in timing of expenses from the second quarter into the second half of the year; an operating margin of approximately 17.5%; a tax rate of approximately 17.5%; and weighted average shares outstanding of 155 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.22 to $1.27, including anticipated dilution from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.04.
For the full year, we now expect the following, all on an adjusted basis: total revenue of approximately $4.59 billion, including between $215 million and $225 million of revenue from Jimmy Choo; comparable sales for the Michael Kors brand to decline in the mid-single digits; gross margin of approximately 60.0%; operating expense of roughly 44.0% of total revenue, including the impact of a shift in timing of expenses from the second quarter into the second half of the year; an operating margin of approximately 16.0%; a tax rate of approximately 17.0%; and weighted average shares outstanding of 156 million; and finally, diluted earnings per share in a range of $3.85 to $3.95, including anticipated dilution from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.08.
We anticipate capital expenditures for Michael Kors Holdings Limited of approximately $200 million, including Jimmy Choo, which will be focused on select new store openings, renovations to our retail store fleet and investments in information systems enhancements. For the full fiscal year 2018, we now expect to close between 40 and 50 stores, with a total expense of $40 million to $60 million. We expect transaction costs related to the acquisition of Jimmy Choo to be approximately $50 million and transition costs to be between $15 million and $20 million as we integrate Jimmy Choo into the broader group.
Overall, we were pleased with our second quarter performance and believe we are on track with our Runway 2020 strategic plans. We remain excited about our long-term prospects and also look forward to working with the Jimmy Choo team as we grow our global fashion luxury group.
Now I will turn the call back over to John for closing remarks."

Needless to say we're really excited about the acquisition of Jimmy Choo. We've had an opportunity to spend a fair amount of time with the management team led by Pierre Denis, who is the CEO; and Sandra Choi, who is the Creative Director. And as you may know, Sandra has actually been with the company and found the company 20 years ago. So we've got a great team in place as well as their entire executive team around the world, so we go into this feeling very, very strong about the management. We feel very strong about the brand. As you know, they are the -- one of the leaders in luxury footwear in the world and really hold an iconic positioning there. So we believe we have a few different areas of opportunity. We've stated that we're going to grow that business to over $1 billion, and we think we've got a relatively -- a clear vision on that. Number one, there is an opportunity to open additional stores, and those will be predominantly in Europe and in Asia. Along with that, the e-commerce platform in the business is growing very rapidly, and we see a great opportunity to further enhance that with the team. So that's the first opportunity for us. The second opportunity is to take advantage of the accessories momentum that they already have and really build that out to a much greater degree. Jimmy Choo has a very, very engaged customer who finds a place in her wardrobe for that product and for the vision of the brand, so you can look to us really over the next 24 months to make a major commitment to the accessories business with Jimmy Choo as we expand that category with them. And third, the men's business is also growing very rapidly inside the Jimmy Choo company, and we see that as a great opportunity to accelerate. They're already doing an outstanding job with that, and we're just going to work together to continue to build on that. So those are the 3 key areas for us that we're -- we feel very comfortable and I would say the management team at Jimmy Choo feels very comfortable in executing. With our new-formed alliance, they'll be able to move a little quicker on some of these initiatives than they were previously able to, so that's really one of the major advantages to being strategically aligned with us. And of course, we have a pretty deep history in the accessories business, so we think we can bring some knowledge there..."

And that's led by product innovation, which is you clearly see it in -- if you're following us on Instagram or if you're looking at our e-mails on a daily basis, I think you could -- you've seen a marked difference in the way that the company is communicating to consumers. And I want to say we're leading a little bit more with what we call Kors Style. So Michael is a runway designer. Michael has got many, many years of leading the consumer in terms of a fashion statement. And we're taking advantage of that positioning in our company, and so Kors Style is really the cornerstone of our communication to the customers. And then of course, we've got a very large footwear business that we don't talk a lot about, but it's growing very nicely. And we see that as a way to really head-to-toe dress our customer, and that's giving a lot of additional opportunity for our sales associates inside the stores to reach out and talk to our consumers. And of course, you're going to see that in some of the new stores that we're building out where we're taking a much more lifestyle approach to the brand and really highlighting those other strengths inside of our company. In terms of the handbag or accessories business, I don't think there's any secret. In Asia, the business is very, very strong. So I'm going to start from the East and go to the West. And that's not only in the Michael Kors business, but that's in the -- in obviously the luxury players that are in the marketplace. So very strong reception to the category in that marketplace driven by, I would say, younger millennials and slightly older who are really continuing to find luxury and aspirational luxury for many different companies. So we're extremely pleased with how the category is developing in that marketplace. I would say Europe got a little more solid over the last quarter, driven again by, I would say, tourists. We saw a significant return -- or elevation, I would say, in the Chinese tourists traveling to Europe. And there has been a return in certain categories of tourists who had declined -- or who are starting to come back to Europe. So we're feeling more confident, and you can see that in our results in Europe. I would say the American marketplace remains relatively muted in the category, if not slightly down. And we've taken the position that, the American market, we actually want to shrink in terms of accessories; and we've done that through 2 ways. Number one, we are shipping less product into our department store partners as well as our own stores in the accessories category. And as a result, we're also less promotional significantly, as you can see by the amount of days. And again, in Q3, it's going to be very, very dramatic reduction, even beyond what we've done so far. And we think that's the right thing for the brand. So again, the customer is going -- it's going to be a little more difficult for them to find Michael Kors product on sale in the accessories category, and we think that will mute the trend in that marketplace. Again, small bags continue to drive the business, smaller bags; also smaller wallets, which affect the AURs. So we're particularly pleased to see the AUR increase we have in the continued light of smaller bags and smaller wallets driving the business. And by the way, that trend is not a North American trend. That trend is a global trend, so that's still a headwind for us as the consumer continues to see that as the fashion quotient and not necessarily about price. Thank you, Omar."

And it's one of our fastest-growing classifications. And we're really pleased about that because of the AUR in backpacks is high, which is good for us. So there is actually little decline in the tote business because it's really shifting to backpacks because of the fashion trend, but that being said, what we're doing is we're really elevating. And you're going to see a whole elevation of totes from us over the next kind of 6 months, where we think there is a fashion statement to be made there. It was a bit more utilitarian previously, and now that you've got a lot of people or women coming to work in sneakers and/or trainers, there's just a little less utilitarian use for the tote. So we're trying to make it much more about fashion, and I think you're going to see a lot of that coming in the coming quarters. And again, what we're seeing is, the more innovation that we're delivering on our accessories, on our ready to wear and on our footwear, the more the customer is responding.

So Simeon, I want to first point out that we mentioned a few calls ago that we had taken a point of view to be less promotional. We thought that was the right thing to do for the image of our brand, number one. Number two, we also focused on some iconic groups where we really made sure that they were very, very key in terms of their price points. And that was our Mercer, our Selma, our Hamilton, our Cynthia, our Savannah. They were the 5 core groups for us that we -- really we wanted to make sure that, when the customer came in the store, whether they were on sale or not, it didn't matter. The value was tremendous not only in terms of the design but also the price-value relationship. And that's really turned out to be a very good strategy for us. And in fact, that's one of the reasons why you saw the wholesale business deliver better than we had anticipated, and that was just based upon our replenishment and what we saw happening there. And then you layer on top of that what's happening with some of the new groups that we've added into the category. And so what I would say to you is that our partners in the department store community are, I think, very pleased with how our strategy has turned out. I must say to you that, in our second quarter, we saw some nice trends happening in the department store environment. So we were very pleased, and I think they were pleased also, to see we can sell product at a higher price, we can sell product that isn't on sale and that the customer is excited about newness and elevation. So that's working well for us. We're very cautious about Q3. I know everyone is concerned about the deceleration between Q2 and Q3 in the way that we're guiding for comparable store sales growth. We're being very cautious because, as Tom pointed out, in our own stores it's about 66% less promotional activity. That's a tremendous amount. So I can't say to you which inning we're in, but what I can say to you is that the initial indications from both product and from our reduction in promotional cadence is going well. So I would tell you that we're pleased. This is going to carry on all the way through Q4. Even though we will ""lap"" in the second half of Q4, there's still going to be settlement that has to happen in terms of where the inventories end up arriving. And I remember I mentioned this in one of the other calls. We will still have a decline as you look forward. It'll flatten out somewhat in 2019 fiscal, but there'll still be some decline heading into the first part of that because, as we sell at a higher AUR, you need less inventory in there to mark down. And again, that's all good. That's all very healthy for the business. So we view -- I think we'll be able to have a better assessment on where we are coming out of Q3/sort of midway through Q4, and hopefully, we'll be reporting to you that we're continuing to make progress."

And then we're just, in your discussion with Simeon, struggling with somewhat the same thing: understanding what happened in the second quarter and the very strong results in the second quarter and how that leads to such a conservative third quarter guide. Maybe you can just touch on the reduction in promotional days both in wholesale and retail in the second quarter and how that compares to the third quarter. It did -- it sounded like there were the -- a greater reduction in Q3 but not materially enough for such a differential in the sales results. Is it just that, during the holiday season, when you're less promotional, there's a greater negative impact on sales because everybody else is so promotional? Maybe you could just help us understand a little bit better."

Let me start out by reiterating to everyone that we have raised our guidance for the year. So I want to compliment our company, that we are flowing through a significant part of the beat in Q2 for the year. The second thing is -- and Tom will talk about this in a little bit, but part of what you're seeing in the Q2 guidance is expenses that have shifted from -- that Tom spoke about in his prepared remarks, from Q2 to Q3. So that's impacting some of the EPS, but overall for the year, as you can see, we're still taking the year up for the company. We always knew internally that we would be at a higher comp store decline in Q3 than any other quarter. I know that some of the models that are out there didn't indicate that, but we knew because, again as you can see for the year, we're guiding for overall mid-single-digit comp store decline for the year. And so we'll have a little worse in Q3 and we'll have a little better in Q4, if you look at the model. So for -- and by the way, the -- our stores are not trending a whole lot different from what we're seeing in the department store environment. The reason why you're seeing the delta so high in Q3 is, number one, it was the most amount of days we were on promotion of any of the 4 quarters. And secondly, it is the largest dollar volume quarter. So because when you have those 2 things happening at retail, you're going to have the largest impact to all of the factors that are happening around in the business. So as I said to you before, we actually had a very nice Q2 with our department store partners here in North America. And I think we were all pleased, they were and we were, by the performance that we saw relative to our sales plans and relative to the fact that we were ahead of our mutually agreed-to sales plans. Again, we are trying to take the business down at retail in our Q3, and that's because we want less product out there to be not only on promotion, with less promotional days, but then marked down at the end of the season. Because we're dealing with that situation in Europe which we've talked about. We want to end the season with less promotional product for the customer when we begin our final sale periods [ of time ]. So again, we think this is all going exactly according to plan and maybe slightly better. We hope that we'll have a good holiday season. And if we do -- again, we might do better than what we have guided to if we do have a better-than-anticipated holiday season, but that being case, I think we're taking a very prudent view of the environment and in particular our promotional policy. So remember it's the largest amount of days of all the quarters. And secondly, it is the biggest of the 4 quarters that we have in terms of retail sales, but let me turn it over to Tom so he can talk to you a little bit about the expense movement which affects the modeling."

So that part, we did not flow through to the full year. The other addition was the expected dilution from Jimmy Choo of around $0.08. So that in total is how we were looking at it. And as John mentioned, Q3 a little more conservative based on the reduction in promotional days, but overall this is very much in line with our prior guidance of mid-single-digit declines in comp sales across the year and in line with that thinking."

And what's the realistic, in your view, recapture rate on AUR to go back up because of, a, small bag size is stabilizing or price is going up within that category; b, less promotions; or C, mix from higher average unit retail offerings, like the Bancroft collection? So I'm just curious there. And then if, Tom, could you give us some perspective on putting the gross margin for the third quarter and beyond. Given the less promotionalities, simply the gross margin pull back a little bit even though it's going to be up. Is that from the inclusion of Jimmy Choo in the model on the gross margin side? So I'm just curious there."

Randy, on the AUR side, we don't report how much it has gone down from the -- its peak, but it is down, for sure. And part of that was self inflicted a couple years ago when we were looking for higher units per transaction and therefore we went after categories like jewelry and et cetera to bring up that and that started to lower some of the AUR. And then we saw originally some of the bag sizing shifts, which wasn't something that we had anticipated. To be honest with you, we've set an internal goal, don't know whether we'll achieve it or not, but we've kind of used the number 10%. That's what we're just shooting for as a benchmark. And again, we're not going to report on that on a quarterly basis. I'm just telling you, giving you some color that that's a number that we've picked out and said we want to try and achieve that over time. So -- and that's -- for us, when we look at that, remember that's aggregated between accessories and women's ready to wear and footwear, so we're looking at that as an overall. I would almost say it's to our average transaction and AUR as well. So that'll drift up and down in categories, depending on different things that we're doing at different times in the various categories. So as a good example, in the booty category in footwear, we sharpened our price points in booties, and that's really helped our business tremendously. It's affected our average AUR at this point in time during the year, which because booties obviously are fairly significant, but it's helped our sell-throughs dramatically. So there's going to be different things we're going to do during the quarters, but overall we know that from the pullback in promotional activity we're going to sell less units. And therefore, we're going to need to take our AUR up, and obviously that's a very important part of our long-term success for returning to comp store sales. I'll turn it over to Tom for the second part of the question."

And we mentioned in the prepared remarks, wholesale, we'd expect the wholesale gross margin to be a little lower than what we've seen in the first half really just due to the lower volume that we've discussed. With regard to Jimmy Choo: Jimmy Choo runs a slightly higher gross margin, so within our guidance that is included. And for the portion of the year that they're with us, that is a slight benefit to the gross margin.

Brian, as Tom presented in our Investor Day, we have said and we continue to believe that 2019 fiscal will be your growth in revenue and in earnings per share. I think we further view that our operating income is going to be returning to growth as well. So I think that's a very important inflection point for the company because we know that, over the last couple years, our operating income has declined. And we're vigorous about our opportunity to turn that around both from the Michael Kors brand standpoint. And also, don't forget that that's going to be impacted by Jimmy Choo, at least on the operating income, which will be very nicely positive for the company. So we are also looking at all the different levers inside the company as we're kind of rebalancing the organization. We have a fleet optimization program that's going on. And we look to as we close these approximately 100 stores over the next 2 years, but that will have an impact on our operating margin as well and create some leverage on the OpEx [ side ]. So again, we're very encouraged about what the future lies ahead for us, good indications for Runway 2020. We're kind of -- believe that we're seeing the initial results that we had hoped. And if those continue to flow through, we think our objectives for 2019 will be very much in our sights, and our ability to deliver on that. Secondly, in terms of the fashion watch business, it was a fairly sizable impact to our comp store sales. We don't break that out, but it was very sizable. It -- so we do not see that turning around, as we said in the prepared remarks, for the balance of the year. The smartwatch business is mitigating that to some degree but not enough to offset the decline in the fashion watch business. We -- so therefore, that's one of the reasons, and we've said that to you some months ago, at the Investor Day, we are very focused on our footwear business and our women's ready-to-wear business as categories to offset that decline. And as the accessories business stabilizes, that will really be the balance that will begin to return us to positive comp store sales. Thank you, Brian."

We are pleased to have laid the foundation for our global fashion luxury group, Michael Kors Holdings Limited, with the recently completed acquisition of Jimmy Choo. With a rich history as a leading luxury house renowned worldwide for its glamorous and fashion-forward footwear and accessories, Jimmy Choo represents an excellent complement to the Michael Kors fashion house. We believe that bringing together these 2 iconic brands further strengthens our future growth opportunities; increases our product and geographic diversification; and importantly, creates a platform for future acquisitions.
Turning to the Michael Kors brand. While still early, we made important initial progress on our Runway 2020 strategic plan. As we have discussed in the past, Runway 2020 is centered on 3 focused areas: product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience.
Beginning with product innovation. We continued to introduce exceptional new fashion and additional layering into our fall accessories collection, resulting in an approximately 40% increase in new offerings. During the quarter, we launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors Collection line. Handcrafted in Italy, Bancroft marks a meaningful first step in our efforts to expand our collection offerings to increase fashion and luxury layering in our overall accessories assortments. From the MICHAEL Michael Kors line, we introduced Sadie, a new soft satchel that features chain inlay detailing and a cool fashion sensibility. Our Mercer and Sloan Editor collections remain favorites among consumers, and we updated these iconic shapes and luxe -- with luxe snakeskin and crocodile-embossed textures. Finally, we offered a novelty take on our Selma satchel with a limited-edition offering of handbag detailed with artful depictions of iconic cities like New York and London. Overall, consumers responded favorably to the continued fashion luxury innovation and increased layering in our accessories assortments. 
The sequential improvement in our accessories' global comparative sales performance for the quarter illustrates that we are moving the brand in the right direction.
In women's footwear, we drove double-digit global comparable sales growth in the quarter. Consumers responded favorably to our fall offerings, including key styles featured in our national ad campaign, the Lori boot and Sherry studded caged sandal. Additionally, our new Alice ballet flat, which features our iconic locks charm, was among our top sellers in the quarter. Lastly, our elevated active assortments continues to resonate with consumers. The Allie sneaker, with its glamorous metallic accents and mixed materials, was a strong seller during the quarter.
Turning to women's ready to wear. We continued to make strides in growing this category as we leveraged Michael's fashion leadership and runway heritage. Global comparative sales increased double digits in this category during the quarter as consumers continued to respond to our elevated and expanded offerings, including romantic details such as florals, ruffles and lace. Embellishments such as iconic studding details were also well received. In addition, we capitalized on the strong sweater dress trend, offering an expanded array in the variety of seasonal styles and colors.
In our men's business, sportswear and luxury leather goods continued to exhibit strength in the quarter. New and unique design elements drove the largest increase in our men's sportswear category. The injection of elevated product across categories, particularly in our knitwear, lightweight sweaters and fine gauge yarns; and layering pieces such as jackets and Napa leathers were some of our best sellers. In leather goods, backpacks remain the #1 selling silhouette. Our iconic Bryant, Harrison and Odin leather collections continue to be top performers. Men's sportswear and leather goods are an important and growing category for us, and we will continue to build on the positive momentum, with the goal of reaching $1 billion in sales over time.
In the watch category, we continued to drive innovation with the introduction of our new Sofie access smartwatches during the quarter. Lightweight and feminine with a pavÃ© bezel and a full round display, Sofie generated excitement among consumers and is now the top-selling watch in our stores. We believe that the Michael Kors brand is well positioned to be a leader in the fashion smartwatch category as we excite and engage consumers who are interested in incorporating both fashion and technology into their lives.
Looking ahead to the 2017 holiday season. We will build on the positive momentum in our Bancroft collection, introducing new colors and textures. Additional innovation and fashion layering will be injected into the MICHAEL Michael Kors accessories assortments, where we expect to increase the level of new offerings for holiday to approximately 50%. We will introduce the Bristol group, a top-handled bag crafted from rich-pebbled leather and embellished with grommeted side ties and a removable lock-and-key detail. Bristol will be featured in our national ad campaign. In addition, we will debut our new tote group, the Voyager, which is an evolution of the iconic Jet Set tote. In footwear, holiday offerings will emphasize feminine details and embellishments, including glitter, ruffles, sequined bows and stars. Finally, in ready to wear, we are excited about the opportunity to build our significant momentum in this category. We broadened our holiday assortments with a mix of feminine and flirty party options as well as a focus on novelty embellishments and shine as our customers dress to celebrate the holiday season.
Turning to brand engagement. We continued to deepen our connection with consumers and create excitement for our brand globally. In September, Michael debuted his spring 2018 collection at New York Fashion Week to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Our front row featured a high-wattage array of global celebrities, including Nicole Kidman; Naomi Watts; and Catherine Zeta-Jones; as well as our newly appointed brand ambassador, Chinese actress Yang Mi. As our first-ever Michael Kors brand ambassador, Yang Mi is a great fit for our luxury house. She epitomizes effortless glamor. Additionally, she is one of the most influential trendsetters in China right now, with more than 70 million followers on WeiBo.
Social media is a cornerstone of our communications efforts and remains a principal focus in deepening our connection with consumers. We are pleased with the continued growth in both our total followers and engagements across all social media channels. We now have over 38 million followers across all our social channels. Looking ahead, we have an exciting collaboration plan with Google for a 360-degree marketing campaign to support access smartwatches. The campaign will feature television advertising that will run during the holiday season. This will be amplified by marketing in print, outdoor and digital channels globally. We expect this exciting global marketing campaign will further heighten the demand for our access smartwatches and ensure they are top of mind during the holiday gifting period.
Moving to customer experience. We continued to elevate our digital flagships and our store fleet. We are seeing strong momentum in our digital flagships, particularly as we add additional features and capabilities. Earlier this year, we launched our online dress shop with favorable results. In the second quarter, we continued to build on that positive momentum, driving incremental growth of ready-to-wear sales on our digital flagships. In our stores, we are in the initial stages of renovating approximately 100 locations globally as part of our Runway 2020 initiatives. Our new retail concept reflects a refined take on glamor in a modern and engaging environment. This new concept will feature salons that showcase our accessories, footwear, womenswear and menswear collections, while enhancing our sales associates' ability to provide consumers with a unique and elevated styling experience. While we have a limited number of stores that reflect this new design concept, we are pleased with the initial response. I look forward to sharing more details about our fleet renovation plans with you in the coming quarters.
Now turning to the financial highlights from the second quarter.
Our results exceeded our expectations. Total revenue was $1.15 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. Retail comparable sales decreased 1.8%. And adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 37% to $1.33.
In the Americas, total revenue increased approximately 1% in the quarter. Retail net sales in the region were flat, with comparable sales declining in the mid-single digits. The momentum in our digital flagships continued with a double-digit increase in comparable sales in the quarter. Our strategy to reduce promotional activity resulted in 40% fewer days on promotion, which negatively impacted our comparable sales. However, we benefited from increased AURs in our digital flagships and lifestyle stores driven by mid-single-digit growth in accessories and double-digit growth in our ready to wear. We attribute the higher AUR to strong consumer response to the elevated product newness and innovation as well as reduced promotional activity. Wholesale net sales in the Americas increased 2.3%. We saw increases in AUR across women's accessories, footwear and ready to wear driven by positive consumer response to our more elevated and layered fashion offerings; as well as 46 fewer days brand-wide promotionally, as compared to last year. 
Moving to Europe. Total revenue increased 9.2%. In the retail channel, net sales grew 17.5%. Comparable sales were approximately flat on a reported basis and declined in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. Including e-commerce sales, comparable sales would have increased in the low single digits on a constant currency basis. This performance exceeded our expectations, as our elevated fashion offerings generated even greater excitement among consumers than we anticipated. Ready-to-wear and footwear offerings were also well received in the quarter, with comparable sales growing in the double-digit and high single-digit ranges, respectively. Europe wholesale net sales were essentially flat in the quarter, as the continued strategic reduction in shipments related to elevating our brand positioning was offset by favorable foreign exchange rates.
Turning to Asia. Net sales grew 30.4% in the quarter; with retail net sales up 31%, driven by new store openings and positive comparable sales growth. Comparable sales, which now include China, grew in the mid-single-digit range on a reported basis and in the high single-digit range on a constant currency basis. The accessories category performed well in Asia during the quarter. We continued to deepen the level of fashion and luxury layering in our accessories assortments, including the introduction of our Bancroft group from the Michael Kors Collection as well as Sadie from the MICHAEL Michael Kors line. Additionally, Mercer, Selma and Sloan collections continued to be among the most popular styles. In China, our structured crossbodies, including our Sloan Editor and Mott collections, were particularly popular among millennial consumers. Asia wholesale net sales increased 27.2%.
We continued to see strong performance in Mainland China and Japan. Hong Kong and Macau remained challenged but began to show signs of improvements in the quarter, while South Korea continued to be impacted by the decline in Mainland Chinese tourists. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our Asia business and continue to invest in our retail network as we build on the positive momentum in this growing region.
Finally, in our licensing business revenue decreased approximately 2% in the quarter. Access smartwatches continued to perform well, particularly the introduction of our new style Sofie. However, the fashion watch category continues to be challenging, and we expect continued sales declines through the fiscal year in our total watch category. In the -- in fragrance, we expanded our successful business with the global launch of our new fragrance pillar Sexy Ruby. Finally, in eyewear, we continued to focus on developing our optical collection with a fashion point of view. Sleek metal designs and fresh, modern shapes continued to generate excitement among consumers. In sunglasses, mirrored lenses continued to be top performers across a variety of shapes, including our iconic aviators. We also saw a positive response to an expanded array of shapes, including glamorous oversized squares and cat eyes.
In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect the traction we are gaining on our Runway 2020 strategic plan. However, fiscal 2018 remains a year of transition for the Michael Kors brand, as we are still in the early stages of executing our initiatives. And we look forward to providing you with updates on our progress in the coming quarters.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom."

And good morning.I will begin by providing details on our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the third quarter and full year, which incorporates the impact of the Jimmy Choo acquisition.Starting with the second qu",1072,"Thank you, John. And good morning.
I will begin by providing details on our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the third quarter and full year, which incorporates the impact of the Jimmy Choo acquisition.
Starting with the second quarter. Results exceeded our expectation with adjusted net income of $204.5 million or $1.33 per diluted share, an increase of 37%. The better-than-expected performance was due to higher retail and wholesale net sales combined with lower operating expense, which was largely related to timing. Total second quarter revenue of $1.15 billion increased 5.4% compared to last year. Retail net sales increased 8%, largely driven by 56 net new store openings since the end of last year's second quarter, along with the benefit of Europe and Asia e-commerce. This was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 1.8% or a 2.5% decline in constant currency. North America e-commerce benefited comparable sales by 260 basis points. Wholesale net sales increased 2.5% compared to last year.
During the quarter, seasonal replenishment orders in our accessories and footwear categories were higher than anticipated, reflecting better full-price sell-throughs. Licensing revenue decreased 2.1% primarily due to declines in fashion watches and jewelry, partially offset by growth in access smartwatches. While we are pleased with the continued growth of access smartwatches, the fashion watch business remains challenging. And we expect sales in this category to decline through the second half of this fiscal year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 60.2% compared to 59.2% last year. Retail gross margin increased 160 basis points, benefiting from an increase in international sales as a percentage of the total as well as lower cost of goods. Wholesale gross margin was roughly flat year-over-year. Total adjusted operating expense increased $17.3 million, reflecting continued investments in our digital flagships and marketing initiatives as well as new store openings. As a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating expense declined to 39.5% from 40.1% in the prior year, reflecting leverage on higher sales. Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 20.7% compared to 19.2% in the prior year. Adjusted retail operating margin was 15.4% compared to 12.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This year-over-year increase was driven by the expansion in gross margin and leverage on higher net sales. Adjusted wholesale operating margin was 27.3% compared to 27.0% in the prior year.
Turning to our Runway 2020 fleet optimization initiative. During the second quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of $5.9 million related to store closures, as well as a noncash charge of $16.3 million for store impairments primarily related to underperforming stores and additional stores we have identified for closure.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $43.1 million and were related to retail store openings and renovations as well as continued investments in information system enhancements.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $178.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt.
 
Now turning to our guidance. The numbers we are providing today reflect our expectations for our global fashion luxury group including Jimmy Choo, which will be incorporated into our results beginning November 1. Before turning to our outlook: As we have stated, we made the strategic decision to reduce promotional activity around the Michael Kors brand to drive higher AUR and higher full-price sell-through and to protect the long-term image of our brands. I would like to note that, in the third quarter, we will be anniversary-ing the highest level of promotional activity in the prior year. In retail, our new promotional strategy will result in a 66% reduction in promotional days in our digital flagships and lifestyle stores compared to the prior year. We anticipate that will be a significant headwind to retail comparable sales. In wholesale, we expect to have 67 fewer promotional days than last year. And as a result, we anticipate that sales will decrease more than our full year expectation of a low-teens decline, and wholesale gross margin will decline more than in previous quarters.
Taking this into account, we expect the following for the third quarter on an adjusted basis: total revenue to be between $1.355 billion and $1.385 billion, including between $105 million and $110 million of revenue from Jimmy Choo; comparable sales for the Michael Kors brand to decline in the high single digits; gross margin of approximately 60.5%; operating expense of approximately 43.0% of total revenue, including the impact of a shift in timing of expenses from the second quarter into the second half of the year; an operating margin of approximately 17.5%; a tax rate of approximately 17.5%; and weighted average shares outstanding of 155 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.22 to $1.27, including anticipated dilution from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.04.
For the full year, we now expect the following, all on an adjusted basis: total revenue of approximately $4.59 billion, including between $215 million and $225 million of revenue from Jimmy Choo; comparable sales for the Michael Kors brand to decline in the mid-single digits; gross margin of approximately 60.0%; operating expense of roughly 44.0% of total revenue, including the impact of a shift in timing of expenses from the second quarter into the second half of the year; an operating margin of approximately 16.0%; a tax rate of approximately 17.0%; and weighted average shares outstanding of 156 million; and finally, diluted earnings per share in a range of $3.85 to $3.95, including anticipated dilution from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.08.
We anticipate capital expenditures for Michael Kors Holdings Limited of approximately $200 million, including Jimmy Choo, which will be focused on select new store openings, renovations to our retail store fleet and investments in information systems enhancements. For the full fiscal year 2018, we now expect to close between 40 and 50 stores, with a total expense of $40 million to $60 million. We expect transaction costs related to the acquisition of Jimmy Choo to be approximately $50 million and transition costs to be between $15 million and $20 million as we integrate Jimmy Choo into the broader group.
Overall, we were pleased with our second quarter performance and believe we are on track with our Runway 2020 strategic plans. We remain excited about our long-term prospects and also look forward to working with the Jimmy Choo team as we grow our global fashion luxury group.
Now I will turn the call back over to John for closing remarks."

Needless to say, we're really excited about the acquisition of Jimmy Choo. We've had an opportunity to spend a fair amount of time with the management team led by Pierre Denis, who is the CEO; and Sandra Choi, who is the Creative Director. And as you may know, Sandra has actually been with the company and helped found the company 20 years ago. So we've got a great team in place as well as their entire executive team around the world, so we go into this feeling very, very strong about the management. We feel very strong about the brand. As you know, they are the -- one of the leaders in luxury footwear in the world and really hold an iconic positioning there. So we believe we have a few different areas of opportunity. We've stated that we're going to grow that business to over $1 billion, and we think we've got a relatively -- a clear vision on that. Number one, there is an opportunity to open additional stores, and those will be predominantly in Europe and in Asia. Along with that, the e-commerce platform in the business is growing very rapidly, and we see a great opportunity to further enhance that with the team. So that's the first opportunity for us. The second opportunity is to take advantage of the accessories momentum that they already have and really build that out to a much greater degree. Jimmy Choo has a very, very engaged customer who finds a place in her wardrobe for that product and for the vision of the brand, so you can look to us really over the next 24 months to make a major commitment to the accessories business with Jimmy Choo as we expand that category with them. And third, the men's business is also growing very rapidly inside the Jimmy Choo company, and we see that as a great opportunity to accelerate. They're already doing an outstanding job with that, and we're just going to work together to continue to build on that. So those are the 3 key areas for us that we're -- we feel very comfortable and I would say that the management team at Jimmy Choo feels very comfortable in executing. With our new-formed alliance, they'll be able to move a little quicker on some of these initiatives than they were previously able to, so that's really one of the major advantages to being strategically aligned with us. And of course, we have a pretty deep history in the accessories business, so we think we can bring some knowledge there..."

And that's led by product innovation, which is you clearly see it in -- if you're following us on Instagram or if you're looking at our e-mails on a daily basis, I think you could -- you've seen a marked difference in the way that the company is communicating to consumers. And I want to say we're leading a little bit more with what we call Kors Style. So Michael is a runway designer. Michael has got many, many years of leading the consumer in terms of a fashion statement. And we're taking advantage of that positioning in our company, and so Kors Style is really the cornerstone of our communication to the customers. And then of course, we've got a very large footwear business that we don't talk a lot about, but it's growing very nicely. And we see that as a way to really head-to-toe dress our customer, and that's giving a lot of additional opportunity for our sales associates inside the stores to reach out and talk to our consumers. And of course, you're going to see that in some of the new stores that we're building out where we're taking a much more lifestyle approach to the brand and really highlighting those other strengths inside of our company. In terms of the handbag or accessories business, I don't think there's any secret. In Asia, the business is very, very strong. So I'm going to start from the East and go to the West. And that's not only in the Michael Kors business, but that's in the -- in obviously the luxury players that are in the marketplace. So very strong reception to the category in that marketplace driven by, I would say, younger millennials and slightly older who are really continuing to find luxury and aspirational luxury for many different companies. So we're extremely pleased with how the category is developing in that marketplace. I would say Europe got a little more solid over the last quarter, driven again by, I would say, tourists. We saw a significant return -- or elevation, I would say, in the Chinese tourists traveling to Europe. And there has been a return in certain categories of tourists who had declined -- who are starting to come back to Europe. So we're feeling more confident, and you can see that in our results in Europe. I would say the American marketplace remains relatively muted in the category, if not slightly down. And we've taken the position that the American market, we actually want to shrink in terms of accessories; and we've done that through 2 ways. Number one, we are shipping less product into our department store partners as well as our own stores in the accessories category. And as a result, we're also less promotional significantly, as you can see by the amount of days. And again, in Q3, it's going to be very, very dramatic reduction, even beyond what we've done so far. And we think that's the right thing for the brand. So again, the customer is going -- it's going to be a little more difficult for them to find Michael Kors product on sale in the accessories category, and we think that will mute the trend in that marketplace. Again, small bags continue to drive the business, smaller bags; also smaller wallets, which affect the AURs. So we're particularly pleased to see the AUR increase we have in the continued light of smaller bags and smaller wallets driving the business. And by the way, that trend is not a North American trend. That trend is a global trend, so that's still a headwind for us as the consumer continues to see that as the fashion quotient and not necessarily about price. Thank you, Omar."

It's too early to ascertain whether -- what the future is with Amazon or any other platform. Right now our position is that we're focused on our own digital communications with the consumer.

And it's one of our fastest-growing classifications. And we're really pleased about that because of the AUR in backpacks is high, which is good for us. So there is actually little decline in the tote business because it's really shifting to backpacks because of the fashion trend, but that being said, what we're doing is we're really elevating. And you're going to see a whole elevation of totes from us over the next kind of 6 months, where we think there is a fashion statement to be made there. It was a bit more utilitarian previously, and now that you've got a lot of people or women coming to work in sneakers and/or trainers, there's just a little less utilitarian use for the tote. So we're trying to make it much more about fashion, and I think you're going to see a lot of that coming in the coming quarters. And again, what we're seeing is the more innovation that we're delivering on our accessories, on our ready to wear and on our footwear, the more the customer is responding. Again, Michael's got 30 years of leading with fashion runway design; and we're going to use that as a real cornerstone of how we're communicating with the customer, in particular through Kors Style.

So Simeon, I want to first point out that we mentioned a few calls ago that we had taken a point of view to be less promotional. We thought that was the right thing to do for the image of our brand, number one. Number two, we also focused on some iconic groups where we really made sure that they were very, very key in terms of their price points. And that was our Mercer, our Selma, our Hamilton, our Cynthia, our Savannah. They were the 5 core groups for us that we really -- we wanted to make sure that when the customer came in the store, whether they were on sale or not, it didn't matter. The value was tremendous not only in terms of the design but also the price-value relationship. And that's really turned out to be a very good strategy for us. And in fact, that's one of the reasons why you saw the wholesale business deliver better than we had anticipated, and that was just based upon our replenishment and what we saw happening there. And then you layer on top of that what's happening with some of the new groups that we've added into the category. And so what I would say to you is that our partners in the department store community are, I think, very pleased with how our strategy has turned out. I must say to you that, in our second quarter, we saw some nice trends happening in the department store environment. So we were very pleased, and I think they were pleased also, to see we can sell product at a higher price, we can sell product that isn't on sale and that the customer is excited about newness and elevation. So that's working well for us. We're very cautious about Q3. I know everyone is concerned about the deceleration between Q2 and Q3 in the way that we're guiding for comparable store sales growth. We're being very cautious because, as Tom pointed out, in our own stores it's about 66% less promotional activity. That's a tremendous amount. So I can't say to you which inning we're in, but what I can say to you is that the initial indications from both product and from our reduction in promotional cadence is going well. So I would tell you that we're pleased. This is going to carry on all the way through Q4. Even though we will ""lap"" in the second half of Q4, there's still going to be settlement that has to happen in terms of where the inventories end up arriving. And I remember I mentioned this in one of the other calls. We will still have a decline as you look forward. It'll flatten out somewhat in 2019 fiscal, but there'll still be some decline heading into the first part of that because, as we sell at a higher AUR, you need less inventory in there to mark down. And again, that's all good. That's all very healthy for the business. So we view -- I think we'll be able to have a better assessment on where we are coming out of Q3/sort of midway through Q4, and hopefully, we'll be reporting to you that we're continuing to make progress."

And then we're just, in your discussion with Simeon, struggling with somewhat the same thing: understanding what happened in the second quarter and the very strong results in the second quarter and how that leads to such a conservative third quarter guide. Maybe you can just touch on the reduction in promotional days both in wholesale and retail in the second quarter and how that compares to the third quarter. It did -- it sounded like there were the -- a greater reduction in Q3 but not materially enough for such a differential in the sales results. Is it just that, during the holiday season, when you're less promotional, there's a greater negative impact on sales because everybody else is so promotional?

Let me start out by reiterating to everyone that we have raised our guidance for the year. So I want to compliment our company, that we are flowing through a significant part of the beat in Q2 for the year. The second thing is -- and Tom will talk about this in a little bit, but part of what you're seeing in the Q2 guidance is expenses that have shifted from -- that Tom spoke about in his prepared remarks, from Q2 to Q3. So that's impacting some of the EPS, but overall for the year, as you can see, we're still taking the year up for the company. We always knew internally that we would be at a higher comp store decline in Q3 than any other quarter. I know that some of the models that are out there didn't indicate that, but we knew because, again as you can see for the year, we're guiding for overall mid-single-digit comp store decline for the year. And so we'll have a little worse in Q3 and we'll have a little better in Q4, if you look at the model. So for -- and by the way, the -- our stores are not trending a whole lot different from what we're seeing in the department store environment. The reason why you're seeing the delta so high in Q3 is, number one, it was the most amount of days we were on promotion of any of the 4 quarters. And secondly, it is the largest dollar volume quarter. So because when you have those 2 things happening at retail, you're going to have the largest impact to all of the factors that are happening around in the business. So as I said to you before, we actually had a very nice Q2 with our department store partners here in North America. And I think we were all pleased, they were and we were, by the performance that we saw relative to our sales plans and relative to the fact that we were ahead of our mutually agreed-to sales plans. Again, we are trying to take the business down at retail in our Q3, and that's because we want less product out there to be not only on promotion, with less promotional days, but then marked down at the end of the season. Because we're dealing with that situation in Europe which we've talked about. We want to end the season with less promotional product for the customer when we begin our final sale periods of time. So again, we think this is all going exactly according to plan and maybe slightly better. We hope that we'll have a good holiday season. And if we do -- again, we might do better than what we have guided to if we do have a better-than-anticipated holiday season, but that being case, I think we're taking a very prudent view of the environment and in particular our promotional policy. So remember it's the largest amount of days of all the quarters. And secondly, it is the biggest of the 4 quarters that we have in terms of retail sales, but let me turn it over to Tom so he can talk to you a little bit about the expense movement which affects the modeling."

So that part, we did not flow through to the full year. The other addition was the expected dilution from Jimmy Choo of around $0.08. So that in total is how we were looking at it. And as John mentioned, Q3 a little more conservative based on the reduction in promotional days, but overall this is very much in line with our prior guidance of mid-single-digit declines in comp sales across the year and in line with that thinking."

Randy, on the AUR side, we don't report how much it has gone down from the -- its peak, but it is down, for sure. And part of that was self inflicted a couple years ago when we were looking for higher units per transaction and therefore we went after categories like jewelry and et cetera to bring up that and that started to lower some of the AUR. And then we saw originally some of the bag sizing shifts, which wasn't something that we had anticipated. To be honest with you, we've set an internal goal, don't know whether we'll achieve it or not, but we've kind of used the number 10%. That's what we're just shooting for as a benchmark. And again, we're not going to report on that on a quarterly basis. I'm just telling you, giving you some color that, that's a number that we've picked out and said we want to try and achieve that over time. So -- and that's -- for us, when we look at that, remember that's aggregated between accessories and women's ready to wear and footwear, so we're looking at that as an overall. I would almost say it's to our average transaction and AUR as well. So that'll drift up and down in categories, depending on different things that we're doing at different times in the various categories. So as a good example, in the bootie category in footwear, we sharpened our price points in booties, and that's really helped our business tremendously. It's affected our average AUR at this point in time during the year, which because booties obviously are fairly significant, but it's helped our sell-throughs dramatically. So there's going to be different things we're going to do during the quarters, but overall we know that from the pullback in promotional activity we're going to sell less units. And therefore, we're going to need to take our AUR up, and obviously that's a very important part of our long-term success for returning to comp store sales. I'll turn it over to Tom for the second part of the question."

And that's consistent with our full year outlook and unchanged from how we've been looking at it over the course of the last couple of quarters. From a first half to second half, directionally I'd say that we'll be consistent with -- we've seen growth on the retail side. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks, wholesale, we'd expect the wholesale gross margin to be a little lower than what we've seen in the first half really just due to the lower volume that we've discussed. With regard to Jimmy Choo: Jimmy Choo runs a slightly higher gross margin, so within our guidance that is included. And for the portion of the year that they're with us, that is a slight benefit to the gross margin. And as we get into our full year guidance next year, when we provide it, we'll -- and talk about Jimmy Choo results more directly as we move forward, we'll look forward to talking more about their margins and their great growth prospects."

Brian, as Tom presented in our Investor Day, we have said and we continue to believe that 2019 fiscal will be your growth in revenue and in earnings per share. I think we further view that our operating income is going to be returning to growth as well. So I think that's a very important inflection point for the company, because we know that over the last couple years our operating income has declined. And we're vigorous about our opportunity to turn that around both from the Michael Kors brand standpoint. And also, don't forget that, that's going to be impacted by Jimmy Choo, at least on the operating income, which will be very nicely positive for the company. So we are also looking at all the different levers inside the company as we're kind of rebalancing the organization. We have a fleet optimization program that's going on. And we look to as we close these approximately 100 stores over the next 2 years, but that will have an impact on our operating margin as well and create some leverage on the OpEx line. So again, we're very encouraged about what the future lies ahead for us, good indications for Runway 2020. We're kind of -- believe that we're seeing the initial results that we had hoped. And if those continue to flow through, we think our objectives for 2019 will be very much in our sights, and our ability to deliver on that. Secondly, in terms of the fashion watch business, it was a fairly sizable impact to our comp store sales. We don't break that out, but it was very sizable. It -- so we do not see that turning around, as we said in the prepared remarks, for the balance of the year. The smartwatch business is mitigating that to some degree but not enough to offset the decline in the fashion watch business. We -- so therefore, that's one of the reasons, and we've said that to you some months ago, at the Investor Day, we are very focused on our footwear business and our women's ready-to-wear business as categories to offset that decline. And as the accessories business stabilizes, that will really be the balance that will begin to return us to positive comp store sales. Thank you, Brian."

We are pleased to have laid the foundation for our global fashion luxury group, Michael Kors Holdings Limited, with the recently completed acquisition of Jimmy Choo. With a rich history as a leading luxury house renowned worldwide for its glamorous and fashion-forward footwear and accessories, Jimmy Choo represents an excellent complement to the Michael Kors fashion house. We believe that bringing together these 2 iconic brands further strengthens our future growth opportunities; increases our product and geographic diversification; and importantly, creates a platform for future acquisitions.
Turning to the Michael Kors brand. While still early, we made important initial progress on our Runway 2020 strategic plan. As we have discussed in the past, Runway 2020 is centered on 3 focused areas: product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience.
Beginning with product innovation. We continued to introduce exceptional new fashion and additional layering into our fall accessories collection, resulting in an approximately 40% increase in new offerings. During the quarter, we launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors Collection line. Handcrafted in Italy, Bancroft marks a meaningful first step in our efforts to expand our collection offerings to increase fashion and luxury layering in our overall accessories assortments. From the MICHAEL Michael Kors line, we introduced Sadie, a new soft satchel that features chain inlay detailing and a cool fashion sensibility. Our Mercer and Sloan Editor collections remain favorites among consumers, and we updated these iconic shapes and luxe -- with luxe snakeskin and crocodile-embossed textures. Finally, we offered a novelty take on our Selma satchel with a limited-edition offering of handbag detailed with artful depictions of iconic cities like New York and London. Overall, consumers responded favorably to the continued fashion luxury innovation and increased layering in our accessories assortments. 
The sequential improvement in our accessories' global comparative sales performance for the quarter illustrates that we are moving the brand in the right direction.
In women's footwear, we drove double-digit global comparable sales growth in the quarter. Consumers responded favorably to our fall offerings, including key styles featured in our national ad campaign, the Lori boot and Sherry studded caged sandal. Additionally, our new Alice ballet flat, which features our iconic locks charm, was among our top sellers in the quarter. Lastly, our elevated active assortments continues to resonate with consumers. The Allie sneaker, with its glamorous metallic accents and mixed materials, was a strong seller during the quarter.
Turning to women's ready to wear. We continued to make strides in growing this category as we leveraged Michael's fashion leadership and runway heritage. Global comparative sales increased double digits in this category during the quarter as consumers continued to respond to our elevated and expanded offerings, including romantic details such as florals, ruffles and lace. Embellishments such as iconic studding details were also well received. In addition, we capitalized on the strong sweater dress trend, offering an expanded array in the variety of seasonal styles and colors.
In our men's business, sportswear and luxury leather goods continued to exhibit strength in the quarter. New and unique design elements drove the largest increase in our men's sportswear category. The injection of elevated product across categories, particularly in our knitwear, lightweight sweaters and fine gauge yarns; and layering pieces such as jackets and Napa leathers were some of our best sellers. In leather goods, backpacks remain the #1 selling silhouette. Our iconic Bryant, Harrison and Odin leather collections continue to be top performers. Men's sportswear and leather goods are an important and growing category for us, and we will continue to build on the positive momentum, with the goal of reaching $1 billion in sales over time.
In the watch category, we continued to drive innovation with the introduction of our new Sofie access smartwatches during the quarter. Lightweight and feminine with a pavÃ© bezel and a full round display, Sofie generated excitement among consumers and is now the top-selling watch in our stores. We believe that the Michael Kors brand is well positioned to be a leader in the fashion smartwatch category as we excite and engage consumers who are interested in incorporating both fashion and technology into their lives.
Looking ahead to the 2017 holiday season. We will build on the positive momentum in our Bancroft collection, introducing new colors and textures. Additional innovation and fashion layering will be injected into the MICHAEL Michael Kors accessories assortments, where we expect to increase the level of new offerings for holiday to approximately 50%. We will introduce the Bristol group, a top-handled bag crafted from rich-pebbled leather and embellished with grommeted side ties and a removable lock-and-key detail. Bristol will be featured in our national ad campaign. In addition, we will debut our new tote group, the Voyager, which is an evolution of the iconic Jet Set tote. In footwear, holiday offerings will emphasize feminine details and embellishments, including glitter, ruffles, sequined bows and stars. Finally, in ready to wear, we are excited about the opportunity to build our significant momentum in this category. We broadened our holiday assortments with a mix of feminine and flirty party options as well as a focus on novelty embellishments and shine as our customers dress to celebrate the holiday season.
Turning to brand engagement. We continued to deepen our connection with consumers and create excitement for our brand globally. In September, Michael debuted his spring 2018 collection at New York Fashion Week to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Our front row featured a high-wattage array of global celebrities, including Nicole Kidman; Naomi Watts; and Catherine Zeta-Jones; as well as our newly appointed brand ambassador, Chinese actress Yang Mi. As our first-ever Michael Kors brand ambassador, Yang Mi is a great fit for our luxury house. She epitomizes effortless glamor. Additionally, she is one of the most influential trendsetters in China right now, with more than 70 million followers on WeiBo.
Social media is a cornerstone of our communications efforts and remains a principal focus in deepening our connection with consumers. We are pleased with the continued growth in both our total followers and engagements across all social media channels. We now have over 38 million followers across all our social channels. Looking ahead, we have an exciting collaboration plan with Google for a 360-degree marketing campaign to support access smartwatches. The campaign will feature television advertising that will run during the holiday season. This will be amplified by marketing in print, outdoor and digital channels globally. We expect this exciting global marketing campaign will further heighten the demand for our access smartwatches and ensure they are top of mind during the holiday gifting period.
Moving to customer experience. We continued to elevate our digital flagships and our store fleet. We are seeing strong momentum in our digital flagships, particularly as we add additional features and capabilities. Earlier this year, we launched our online dress shop with favorable results. In the second quarter, we continued to build on that positive momentum, driving incremental growth of ready-to-wear sales on our digital flagships. In our stores, we are in the initial stages of renovating approximately 100 locations globally as part of our Runway 2020 initiatives. Our new retail concept reflects a refined take on glamor in a modern and engaging environment. This new concept will feature salons that showcase our accessories, footwear, womenswear and menswear collections, while enhancing our sales associates' ability to provide consumers with a unique and elevated styling experience. While we have a limited number of stores that reflect this new design concept, we are pleased with the initial response. I look forward to sharing more details about our fleet renovation plans with you in the coming quarters.
Now turning to the financial highlights from the second quarter.
Our results exceeded our expectations. Total revenue was $1.15 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. Retail comparable sales decreased 1.8%. And adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 37% to $1.33.
In the Americas, total revenue increased approximately 1% in the quarter. Retail net sales in the region were flat, with comparable sales declining in the mid-single digits. The momentum in our digital flagships continued with a double-digit increase in comparable sales in the quarter. Our strategy to reduce promotional activity resulted in 40% fewer days on promotion, which negatively impacted our comparable sales. However, we benefited from increased AURs in our digital flagships and lifestyle stores driven by mid-single-digit growth in accessories and double-digit growth in our ready to wear. We attribute the higher AUR to strong consumer response to the elevated product newness and innovation as well as reduced promotional activity. Wholesale net sales in the Americas increased 2.3%. We saw increases in AUR across women's accessories, footwear and ready to wear driven by positive consumer response to our more elevated and layered fashion offerings; as well as 46 fewer days brand-wide promotionally, as compared to last year. 
Moving to Europe. Total revenue increased 9.2%. In the retail channel, net sales grew 17.5%. Comparable sales were approximately flat on a reported basis and declined in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. Including e-commerce sales, comparable sales would have increased in the low single digits on a constant currency basis. This performance exceeded our expectations, as our elevated fashion offerings generated even greater excitement among consumers than we anticipated. Ready-to-wear and footwear offerings were also well received in the quarter, with comparable sales growing in the double-digit and high single-digit ranges, respectively. Europe wholesale net sales were essentially flat in the quarter, as the continued strategic reduction in shipments related to elevating our brand positioning was offset by favorable foreign exchange rates.
Turning to Asia. Net sales grew 30.4% in the quarter; with retail net sales up 31%, driven by new store openings and positive comparable sales growth. Comparable sales, which now include China, grew in the mid-single-digit range on a reported basis and in the high single-digit range on a constant currency basis. The accessories category performed well in Asia during the quarter. We continued to deepen the level of fashion and luxury layering in our accessories assortments, including the introduction of our Bancroft group from the Michael Kors Collection as well as Sadie from the MICHAEL Michael Kors line. Additionally, Mercer, Selma and Sloan collections continued to be among the most popular styles. In China, our structured crossbodies, including our Sloan Editor and Mott collections, were particularly popular among millennial consumers. Asia wholesale net sales increased 27.2%.
We continued to see strong performance in Mainland China and Japan. Hong Kong and Macau remained challenged but began to show signs of improvements in the quarter, while South Korea continued to be impacted by the decline in Mainland Chinese tourists. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our Asia business and continue to invest in our retail network as we build on the positive momentum in this growing region.
Finally, in our licensing business revenue decreased approximately 2% in the quarter. Access smartwatches continued to perform well, particularly the introduction of our new style Sofie. However, the fashion watch category continues to be challenging, and we expect continued sales declines through the fiscal year in our total watch category. In the -- in fragrance, we expanded our successful business with the global launch of our new fragrance pillar Sexy Ruby. Finally, in eyewear, we continued to focus on developing our optical collection with a fashion point of view. Sleek metal designs and fresh, modern shapes continued to generate excitement among consumers. In sunglasses, mirrored lenses continued to be top performers across a variety of shapes, including our iconic aviators. We also saw a positive response to an expanded array of shapes, including glamorous oversized squares and cat eyes.
In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect the traction we are gaining on our Runway 2020 strategic plan. However, fiscal 2018 remains a year of transition for the Michael Kors brand, as we are still in the early stages of executing our initiatives. And we look forward to providing you with updates on our progress in the coming quarters.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom."

And good morning.I will begin by providing details on our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the third quarter and full year, which incorporates the impact of the Jimmy Choo acquisition.Starting with the second qu",1072,"Thank you, John. And good morning.
I will begin by providing details on our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the third quarter and full year, which incorporates the impact of the Jimmy Choo acquisition.
Starting with the second quarter. Results exceeded our expectation with adjusted net income of $204.5 million or $1.33 per diluted share, an increase of 37%. The better-than-expected performance was due to higher retail and wholesale net sales combined with lower operating expense, which was largely related to timing. Total second quarter revenue of $1.15 billion increased 5.4% compared to last year. Retail net sales increased 8%, largely driven by 56 net new store openings since the end of last year's second quarter, along with the benefit of Europe and Asia e-commerce. This was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 1.8% or a 2.5% decline in constant currency. North America e-commerce benefited comparable sales by 260 basis points. Wholesale net sales increased 2.5% compared to last year.
During the quarter, seasonal replenishment orders in our accessories and footwear categories were higher than anticipated, reflecting better full-price sell-throughs. Licensing revenue decreased 2.1% primarily due to declines in fashion watches and jewelry, partially offset by growth in access smartwatches. While we are pleased with the continued growth of access smartwatches, the fashion watch business remains challenging. And we expect sales in this category to decline through the second half of this fiscal year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 60.2% compared to 59.2% last year. Retail gross margin increased 160 basis points, benefiting from an increase in international sales as a percentage of the total as well as lower cost of goods. Wholesale gross margin was roughly flat year-over-year. Total adjusted operating expense increased $17.3 million, reflecting continued investments in our digital flagships and marketing initiatives as well as new store openings. As a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating expense declined to 39.5% from 40.1% in the prior year, reflecting leverage on higher sales. Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 20.7% compared to 19.2% in the prior year. Adjusted retail operating margin was 15.4% compared to 12.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This year-over-year increase was driven by the expansion in gross margin and leverage on higher net sales. Adjusted wholesale operating margin was 27.3% compared to 27.0% in the prior year.
Turning to our Runway 2020 fleet optimization initiative. During the second quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of $5.9 million related to store closures, as well as a noncash charge of $16.3 million for store impairments primarily related to underperforming stores and additional stores we have identified for closure.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $43.1 million and were related to retail store openings and renovations as well as continued investments in information system enhancements.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $178.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt.
 
Now turning to our guidance. The numbers we are providing today reflect our expectations for our global fashion luxury group including Jimmy Choo, which will be incorporated into our results beginning November 1. Before turning to our outlook: As we have stated, we made the strategic decision to reduce promotional activity around the Michael Kors brand to drive higher AUR and higher full-price sell-through and to protect the long-term image of our brands. I would like to note that, in the third quarter, we will be anniversary-ing the highest level of promotional activity in the prior year. In retail, our new promotional strategy will result in a 66% reduction in promotional days in our digital flagships and lifestyle stores compared to the prior year. We anticipate that will be a significant headwind to retail comparable sales. In wholesale, we expect to have 67 fewer promotional days than last year. And as a result, we anticipate that sales will decrease more than our full year expectation of a low-teens decline, and wholesale gross margin will decline more than in previous quarters.
Taking this into account, we expect the following for the third quarter on an adjusted basis: total revenue to be between $1.355 billion and $1.385 billion, including between $105 million and $110 million of revenue from Jimmy Choo; comparable sales for the Michael Kors brand to decline in the high single digits; gross margin of approximately 60.5%; operating expense of approximately 43.0% of total revenue, including the impact of a shift in timing of expenses from the second quarter into the second half of the year; an operating margin of approximately 17.5%; a tax rate of approximately 17.5%; and weighted average shares outstanding of 155 million; and lastly, diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.22 to $1.27, including anticipated dilution from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.04.
For the full year, we now expect the following, all on an adjusted basis: total revenue of approximately $4.59 billion, including between $215 million and $225 million of revenue from Jimmy Choo; comparable sales for the Michael Kors brand to decline in the mid-single digits; gross margin of approximately 60.0%; operating expense of roughly 44.0% of total revenue, including the impact of a shift in timing of expenses from the second quarter into the second half of the year; an operating margin of approximately 16.0%; a tax rate of approximately 17.0%; and weighted average shares outstanding of 156 million; and finally, diluted earnings per share in a range of $3.85 to $3.95, including anticipated dilution from Jimmy Choo of approximately $0.08.
We anticipate capital expenditures for Michael Kors Holdings Limited of approximately $200 million, including Jimmy Choo, which will be focused on select new store openings, renovations to our retail store fleet and investments in information systems enhancements. For the full fiscal year 2018, we now expect to close between 40 and 50 stores, with a total expense of $40 million to $60 million. We expect transaction costs related to the acquisition of Jimmy Choo to be approximately $50 million and transition costs to be between $15 million and $20 million as we integrate Jimmy Choo into the broader group.
Overall, we were pleased with our second quarter performance and believe we are on track with our Runway 2020 strategic plans. We remain excited about our long-term prospects and also look forward to working with the Jimmy Choo team as we grow our global fashion luxury group.
Now I will turn the call back over to John for closing remarks."

Needless to say, we're really excited about the acquisition of Jimmy Choo. We've had an opportunity to spend a fair amount of time with the management team led by Pierre Denis, who is the CEO; and Sandra Choi, who is the Creative Director. And as you may know, Sandra has actually been with the company and helped found the company 20 years ago. So we've got a great team in place as well as their entire executive team around the world, so we go into this feeling very, very strong about the management. We feel very strong about the brand. As you know, they are the -- one of the leaders in luxury footwear in the world and really hold an iconic positioning there. So we believe we have a few different areas of opportunity. We've stated that we're going to grow that business to over $1 billion, and we think we've got a relatively -- a clear vision on that. Number one, there is an opportunity to open additional stores, and those will be predominantly in Europe and in Asia. Along with that, the e-commerce platform in the business is growing very rapidly, and we see a great opportunity to further enhance that with the team. So that's the first opportunity for us. The second opportunity is to take advantage of the accessories momentum that they already have and really build that out to a much greater degree. Jimmy Choo has a very, very engaged customer who finds a place in her wardrobe for that product and for the vision of the brand, so you can look to us really over the next 24 months to make a major commitment to the accessories business with Jimmy Choo as we expand that category with them. And third, the men's business is also growing very rapidly inside the Jimmy Choo company, and we see that as a great opportunity to accelerate. They're already doing an outstanding job with that, and we're just going to work together to continue to build on that. So those are the 3 key areas for us that we're -- we feel very comfortable and I would say that the management team at Jimmy Choo feels very comfortable in executing. With our new-formed alliance, they'll be able to move a little quicker on some of these initiatives than they were previously able to, so that's really one of the major advantages to being strategically aligned with us. And of course, we have a pretty deep history in the accessories business, so we think we can bring some knowledge there..."

As you noted, our women's ready-to-wear business is absolutely -- it's really, really strong right now, so we're very pleased. And that's led by product innovation, which is you clearly see it in -- if you're following us on Instagram or if you're looking at our e-mails on a daily basis, I think you could -- you've seen a marked difference in the way that the company is communicating to consumers. And I want to say we're leading a little bit more with what we call Kors Style. So Michael is a runway designer. Michael has got many, many years of leading the consumer in terms of a fashion statement. And we're taking advantage of that positioning in our company, and so Kors Style is really the cornerstone of our communication to the customers. And then of course, we've got a very large footwear business that we don't talk a lot about, but it's growing very nicely. And we see that as a way to really head-to-toe dress our customer, and that's giving a lot of additional opportunity for our sales associates inside the stores to reach out and talk to our consumers. And of course, you're going to see that in some of the new stores that we're building out where we're taking a much more lifestyle approach to the brand and really highlighting those other strengths inside of our company. In terms of the handbag or accessories business, I don't think there's any secret. In Asia, the business is very, very strong. So I'm going to start from the East and go to the West. And that's not only in the Michael Kors business, but that's in the -- in obviously the luxury players that are in the marketplace. So very strong reception to the category in that marketplace driven by, I would say, younger millennials and slightly older who are really continuing to find luxury and aspirational luxury for many different companies. So we're extremely pleased with how the category is developing in that marketplace. I would say Europe got a little more solid over the last quarter, driven again by, I would say, tourists. We saw a significant return -- or elevation, I would say, in the Chinese tourists traveling to Europe. And there has been a return in certain categories of tourists who had declined -- who are starting to come back to Europe. So we're feeling more confident, and you can see that in our results in Europe. I would say the American marketplace remains relatively muted in the category, if not slightly down. And we've taken the position that the American market, we actually want to shrink in terms of accessories; and we've done that through 2 ways. Number one, we are shipping less product into our department store partners as well as our own stores in the accessories category. And as a result, we're also less promotional significantly, as you can see by the amount of days. And again, in Q3, it's going to be very, very dramatic reduction, even beyond what we've done so far. And we think that's the right thing for the brand. So again, the customer is going -- it's going to be a little more difficult for them to find Michael Kors product on sale in the accessories category, and we think that will mute the trend in that marketplace. Again, small bags continue to drive the business, smaller bags; also smaller wallets, which affect the AURs. So we're particularly pleased to see the AUR increase we have in the continued light of smaller bags and smaller wallets driving the business. And by the way, that trend is not a North American trend. That trend is a global trend, so that's still a headwind for us as the consumer continues to see that as the fashion quotient and not necessarily about price. Thank you, Omar."

It's too early to ascertain whether -- what the future is with Amazon or any other platform. Right now our position is that we're focused on our own digital communications with the consumer. And we think that's the right place for us to be, and certainly we're showing a strong double-digit growth by doing that.

Number one, we haven't really talked about it in this call at all, but just as a macro trend issue kind of related back to what Omar was asking, as you probably are aware from walking the streets et cetera, backpacks are very, very strong. And it's one of our fastest-growing classifications. And we're really pleased about that because of the AUR in backpacks is high, which is good for us. So there is actually little decline in the tote business because it's really shifting to backpacks because of the fashion trend, but that being said, what we're doing is we're really elevating. And you're going to see a whole elevation of totes from us over the next kind of 6 months, where we think there is a fashion statement to be made there. It was a bit more utilitarian previously, and now that you've got a lot of people or women coming to work in sneakers and/or trainers, there's just a little less utilitarian use for the tote. So we're trying to make it much more about fashion, and I think you're going to see a lot of that coming in the coming quarters. And again, what we're seeing is the more innovation that we're delivering on our accessories, on our ready to wear and on our footwear, the more the customer is responding. Again, Michael's got 30 years of leading with fashion runway design; and we're going to use that as a real cornerstone of how we're communicating with the customer, in particular through Kors Style.

So Simeon, I want to first point out that we mentioned a few calls ago that we had taken a point of view to be less promotional. We thought that was the right thing to do for the image of our brand, number one. Number two, we also focused on some iconic groups where we really made sure that they were very, very key in terms of their price points. And that was our Mercer, our Selma, our Hamilton, our Cynthia, our Savannah. They were the 5 core groups for us that we really -- we wanted to make sure that when the customer came in the store, whether they were on sale or not, it didn't matter. The value was tremendous not only in terms of the design but also the price-value relationship. And that's really turned out to be a very good strategy for us. And in fact, that's one of the reasons why you saw the wholesale business deliver better than we had anticipated, and that was just based upon our replenishment and what we saw happening there. And then you layer on top of that what's happening with some of the new groups that we've added into the category. And so what I would say to you is that our partners in the department store community are, I think, very pleased with how our strategy has turned out. I must say to you that, in our second quarter, we saw some nice trends happening in the department store environment. So we were very pleased, and I think they were pleased also, to see we can sell product at a higher price, we can sell product that isn't on sale and that the customer is excited about newness and elevation. So that's working well for us. We're very cautious about Q3. I know everyone is concerned about the deceleration between Q2 and Q3 in the way that we're guiding for comparable store sales growth. We're being very cautious because, as Tom pointed out, in our own stores it's about 66% less promotional activity. That's a tremendous amount. So I can't say to you which inning we're in, but what I can say to you is that the initial indications from both product and from our reduction in promotional cadence is going well. So I would tell you that we're pleased. This is going to carry on all the way through Q4. Even though we will ""lap"" in the second half of Q4, there's still going to be settlement that has to happen in terms of where the inventories end up arriving. And I remember I mentioned this in one of the other calls. We will still have a decline as you look forward. It'll flatten out somewhat in 2019 fiscal, but there'll still be some decline heading into the first part of that because, as we sell at a higher AUR, you need less inventory in there to mark down. And again, that's all good. That's all very healthy for the business. So we view -- I think we'll be able to have a better assessment on where we are coming out of Q3/sort of midway through Q4, and hopefully, we'll be reporting to you that we're continuing to make progress."

And then we're just, in your discussion with Simeon, struggling with somewhat the same thing: understanding what happened in the second quarter and the very strong results in the second quarter and how that leads to such a conservative third quarter guide. Maybe you can just touch on the reduction in promotional days both in wholesale and retail in the second quarter and how that compares to the third quarter. It did -- it sounded like there were the -- a greater reduction in Q3 but not materially enough for such a differential in the sales results. Is it just that, during the holiday season, when you're less promotional, there's a greater negative impact on sales because everybody else is so promotional? Maybe you could just help us understand a little bit better."

Let me start out by reiterating to everyone that we have raised our guidance for the year. So I want to compliment our company, that we are flowing through a significant part of the beat in Q2 for the year. The second thing is -- and Tom will talk about this in a little bit, but part of what you're seeing in the Q2 guidance is expenses that have shifted from -- that Tom spoke about in his prepared remarks, from Q2 to Q3. So that's impacting some of the EPS, but overall for the year, as you can see, we're still taking the year up for the company. We always knew internally that we would be at a higher comp store decline in Q3 than any other quarter. I know that some of the models that are out there didn't indicate that, but we knew because, again as you can see for the year, we're guiding for overall mid-single-digit comp store decline for the year. And so we'll have a little worse in Q3 and we'll have a little better in Q4, if you look at the model. So for -- and by the way, the -- our stores are not trending a whole lot different from what we're seeing in the department store environment. The reason why you're seeing the delta so high in Q3 is, number one, it was the most amount of days we were on promotion of any of the 4 quarters. And secondly, it is the largest dollar volume quarter. So because when you have those 2 things happening at retail, you're going to have the largest impact to all of the factors that are happening around in the business. So as I said to you before, we actually had a very nice Q2 with our department store partners here in North America. And I think we were all pleased, they were and we were, by the performance that we saw relative to our sales plans and relative to the fact that we were ahead of our mutually agreed-to sales plans. Again, we are trying to take the business down at retail in our Q3, and that's because we want less product out there to be not only on promotion, with less promotional days, but then marked down at the end of the season. Because we're dealing with that situation in Europe which we've talked about. We want to end the season with less promotional product for the customer when we begin our final sale periods of time. So again, we think this is all going exactly according to plan and maybe slightly better. We hope that we'll have a good holiday season. And if we do -- again, we might do better than what we have guided to if we do have a better-than-anticipated holiday season, but that being case, I think we're taking a very prudent view of the environment and in particular our promotional policy. So remember it's the largest amount of days of all the quarters. And secondly, it is the biggest of the 4 quarters that we have in terms of retail sales, but let me turn it over to Tom so he can talk to you a little bit about the expense movement which affects the modeling."

And looking at, as John mentioned, the full year, we've raised guidance and on a Michael Kors brand basis really flowed through all of the upside and beat in Q2 from a revenue perspective. So we see that coming through as a full year increase in our overall guidance. On the expense side, we will see some expenses moving into the second half across various items and areas. So that part, we did not flow through to the full year. The other addition was the expected dilution from Jimmy Choo of around $0.08. So that in total is how we were looking at it. And as John mentioned, Q3 a little more conservative based on the reduction in promotional days, but overall this is very much in line with our prior guidance of mid-single-digit declines in comp sales across the year and in line with that thinking."

So we're now in this -- a couple quarters through, a few quarters through of this AUR inflection, so maybe it would be helpful if you gave us some perspective on, if we look at current AUR today, how far below is it from peak AUR? And what's the realistic, in your view, recapture rate on AUR to go back up because of, a, small bag size is stabilizing or price is going up within that category; b, less promotions; or C, mix from higher average unit retail offerings, like the Bancroft collection? So I'm just curious there. And then if, Tom, could you give us some perspective on putting the gross margin for the third quarter and beyond. Given the less promotionalities, simply the gross margin pull back a little bit even though it's going to be up. Is that from the inclusion of Jimmy Choo in the model on the gross margin side? So I was just curious there."

Randy, on the AUR side, we don't report how much it has gone down from the -- its peak, but it is down, for sure. And part of that was self-inflicted a couple years ago when we were looking for higher units per transaction and therefore we went after categories like jewelry and et cetera to bring up that and that started to lower some of the AUR. And then we saw originally some of the bag sizing shifts, which wasn't something that we had anticipated. To be honest with you, we've set an internal goal, don't know whether we'll achieve it or not, but we've kind of used the number 10%. That's what we're just shooting for as a benchmark. And again, we're not going to report on that on a quarterly basis. I'm just telling you, giving you some color that, that's a number that we've picked out and said we want to try and achieve that over time. So -- and that's -- for us, when we look at that, remember that's aggregated between accessories and women's ready to wear and footwear, so we're looking at that as an overall. I would almost say it's to our average transaction and AUR as well. So that'll drift up and down in categories, depending on different things that we're doing at different times in the various categories. So as a good example, in the bootie category in footwear, we sharpened our price points in booties, and that's really helped our business tremendously. It's affected our average AUR at this point in time during the year, which because booties obviously are fairly significant, but it's helped our sell-throughs dramatically. So there's going to be different things we're going to do during the quarters, but overall we know that from the pullback in promotional activity we're going to sell less units. And therefore, we're going to need to take our AUR up, and obviously that's a very important part of our long-term success for returning to comp store sales. I'll turn it over to Tom for the second part of the question."

And that's consistent with our full year outlook and unchanged from how we've been looking at it over the course of the last couple of quarters. From a first half to second half, directionally I'd say that we'll be consistent with -- we've seen growth on the retail side. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks, wholesale, we'd expect the wholesale gross margin to be a little lower than what we've seen in the first half really just due to the lower volume that we've discussed. With regard to Jimmy Choo: Jimmy Choo runs a slightly higher gross margin, so within our guidance that is included. And for the portion of the year that they're with us, that is a slight benefit to the gross margin. And as we get into our full year guidance next year, when we provide it, we'll -- and talk about Jimmy Choo results more directly as we move forward, we'll look forward to talking more about their margins and their great growth prospects."

Brian, as Tom presented in our Investor Day, we have said and we continue to believe that 2019 fiscal will be your growth in revenue and in earnings per share. I think we further view that our operating income is going to be returning to growth as well. So I think that's a very important inflection point for the company, because we know that over the last couple years our operating income has declined. And we're vigorous about our opportunity to turn that around both from the Michael Kors brand standpoint. And also, don't forget that, that's going to be impacted by Jimmy Choo, at least on the operating income, which will be very nicely positive for the company. So we are also looking at all the different levers inside the company as we're kind of rebalancing the organization. We have a fleet optimization program that's going on. And we look to as we close these approximately 100 stores over the next 2 years, but that will have an impact on our operating margin as well and create some leverage on the OpEx line. So again, we're very encouraged about what the future lies ahead for us, good indications for Runway 2020. We're kind of -- believe that we're seeing the initial results that we had hoped. And if those continue to flow through, we think our objectives for 2019 will be very much in our sights, and our ability to deliver on that. Secondly, in terms of the fashion watch business, it was a fairly sizable impact to our comp store sales. We don't break that out, but it was very sizable. It -- so we do not see that turning around, as we said in the prepared remarks, for the balance of the year. The smartwatch business is mitigating that to some degree but not enough to offset the decline in the fashion watch business. We -- so therefore, that's one of the reasons, and we've said that to you some months ago, at the Investor Day, we are very focused on our footwear business and our women's ready-to-wear business as categories to offset that decline. And as the accessories business stabilizes, that will really be the balance that will begin to return us to positive comp store sales. Thank you, Brian."
