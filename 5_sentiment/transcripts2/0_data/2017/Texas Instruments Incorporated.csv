For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
As usual, Kevin March, TI's, Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. Also, with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1. Rafael joined TI in 2001 and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a Masters in Business Administration from Stanford University.
As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year. During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown an average of 13% annually. Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%. We've all benefited and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI shares get a good return on their investment. Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael. 
I don't want to get too sentimental. But as this is Kevin's finals earning call -- final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him. TI's clearly a better company because of his leadership. I will say he has an outstanding successor. I worked with Rafael over the past decade and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO. 
With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8, at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy. In today's earnings call, Rafael will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks, and Kevin and I will cover the rest. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market. The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continued. Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year ago. I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.02 and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that has long lived in diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases. 
Turning to our segments. Analog revenue grew 10% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased due to Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing increased 6% from a year-ago quarter due to processors and Microcontrollers. Connectivity also grew. In our Other segment, revenue declined 9% from a year-ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products, DLP products and calculators were about even. For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%. Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI's revenue for the year. 
We recently simplified the product lines inside our 2 business segments, Analog and Embedded, to align by product categories our customers think about, making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial. Analog is now comprised of 3 product lines instead of 4. These are: power, signal chain and High Volume Analog & Logic. 
Embedded goes from 3 product lines to 2. Connected MCU, which merges Connectivity and Microcontrollers, and Processors, which is essentially unchanged. All of these changes are at the product line level. Nothing changes at the segment level. 
To help you understand the structure, for 2016, within our Analog business, Power would've been about 45% of Analog revenue. Signal chain would have been about 35% and High Volume and Analog & Logic would have been the remaining 20%. Inside our Embedded business, connected MCU would've been about 55% of Embedded revenue, with Processors comprising the remaining 45%. Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we'll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments. 
Now let me describe our performance by end market for 2016. Just as a reminder, we annually provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market. We break these into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators. 
Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points. Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points. Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6%, respectively, both even to last year, while Other was about 4%. We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016. 
For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we've been highly focused on a strategy where we've been allocating our capital and we've been driving initiatives to increase our market share in industrial and automotive. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide the diversity and longevity of product, which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio.
In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI's revenue, up from 44% just 2 years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied and are continuing to make improvements such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

Gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year-ago, gross profit margin increased 400 basis points. 
Operating expenses were $754 million or 22.1% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.37 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Restructuring charges and Other was a $20 million net benefit, which included a gain related to an intellectual property agreement and a charge associated with the realignment of our product lines, which Dave previously mentioned. 
Operating profit was $1.32 billion or 38.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42.8%, up from 38.0% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 28.2%, an improvement of 480 basis points from a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Also, we signed several intellectual property agreements, which had a total benefit of $228 million in the quarter. We recognized $188 million in other income and expense or OI&E, and $40 million in the restructuring charges and Other. Neither revenue nor gross profit was impacted by these agreements.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or $1.02 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit for items not in our prior outlook. These included a $0.14 benefit for several intellectual property agreements, a $0.01 tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock compensation, and a $0.01 restructuring charge. 
This quarter, we adopted a new GAAP standard that changes where we report the tax consequences of employee stock compensation. When an employee stock options are exercised or when a restricted stock [indiscernible], either an excess tax benefit or deficiency may be generated. The previous standard required that amount to be recognized in equity on the balance sheet. The new standard requires that amount to be recognized in income taxes on the income statement, impacting net income and EPS. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, this created a benefit of $0.01 per share, and for the year, a benefit of $0.13 per share. I will also note, this accounting standard increases the diluted share count calculation by about 5 million shares.
I'll now ask Rafael to comment on our capital management results."

Let me start with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.39 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days.

Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $4.61 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $531 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. This includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. 
Free cash flow for the year was $4.08 billion or 30.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 6% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. This commitment is unchanged. 
In the fourth quarter, we paid $499 million in dividends and repurchased $475 million of our stock, for a total return of $974 million. Total cash returned to owners in 2016 was $3.78 billion. This combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.65 billion in dividends or 40% of trailing 12 months free cash flow. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter, year-on-year, for 51 consecutive quarters.
In the fourth quarter, we passed an important milestone: reducing our outstanding share count to fewer than 1 billion shares or more specifically, 996 million shares. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
I will now turn this back to Kevin to close out our prepared remarks."

We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88, which includes a $0.04 tax benefit related to the adoption of the new GAAP standard that I mentioned earlier. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges will remain about even and [indiscernible] about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. 
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2017 is about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2016 was moderate again this year. However, our advantages in manufacturing of technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse of all new products, enabled important milestone for the year. This includes solid revenue growth in our core business of Analog and Embedded, the expansion of 300-millimeter Analog and production. Gross margin improvement of 300 basis points, operating improvement of 300 basis points. Free cash flow margin improvement of 90 basis points and continued free cash flow per share growth. 
We will continue to feed our advantages through disciplined capital allocation by focusing on the best built opportunities, which I believe will enable us to deliver free cash flow growth for a very long time to come. Before I turn it back to Dave and start the Q&A, I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. I thank you for the time you've invested in understanding TI's performance and strategy, and I wish you all the best. While you'll continue to have the benefit of working with our industry's finest Investor Relations director, I'm confident when I say that you will also come to appreciate Rafael's integrity and intelligence as our new CFO, and you'll come to truly enjoy working with him as well as I have over these years.

Margin drivers going forward. I think that there'll be several things happening. I think, we've enjoyed last couple of years depreciation coming down. At the same time, the 300-millimeter starts going up. Those have clearly been tailwinds for us in the last couple of years. As we go forward, depreciation is probably going to flatten out the bit quarter-to-quarter basis. It will still be down next year versus 2016, but not nearly as much as we've seen. What was a lot more important is the continued expansion of 300-millimeter production as well as the continued improvement of the mix of products that we are shipping. You've heard us again talk for a number of years about focusing our investments in auto and industrial. And frankly, the margin opportunities in those spaces are very attractive. And so between the mix of products, but importantly, the increasing starts of products on 300-millimeter capacity, there's still room for us to continue to see overall margin growth. And as before we even talked about revenue growth, of course, revenue growth this gives us leverage on the capacity that we've invested in for these couple of years. And with the depreciation being as long as I was talking about, what that really means is underutilization charges are negligible and so really it's just about fall through from revenue to the bottom line and that will especially happen to cash flow."

And that is really going to be picking up pace more and for the new products that were released and being release on 300-millimeter. And the economics, as you're well aware are very compelling. I mean, the bottom line is the chip costs are about 40% less on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So the total finished products is about 20% less, which adds meaningfully not only to gross margins, but especially to free cash flow. That's a small straight through unimpeded. So again our starts continue to increase.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
As usual, Kevin March, TI's, Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. Also, with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1. Rafael joined TI in 2001 and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a Masters in Business Administration from Stanford University.
As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year. During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown an average of 13% annually. Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%. We've all benefited and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI shares get a good return on their investment. Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael. 
I don't want to get too sentimental. But as this is Kevin's finals earning call -- final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him. TI's clearly a better company because of his leadership. I will say he has an outstanding successor. I worked with Rafael over the past decade and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO. 
With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8, at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy. In today's earnings call, Rafael will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks, and Kevin and I will cover the rest. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market. The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continued. Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year ago. I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.02 and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that has long lived in diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases. 
Turning to our segments. Analog revenue grew 10% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased due to Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing increased 6% from a year-ago quarter due to processors and Microcontrollers. Connectivity also grew. In our Other segment, revenue declined 9% from a year-ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products, DLP products and calculators were about even. For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%. Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI's revenue for the year. 
We recently simplified the product lines inside our 2 business segments, Analog and Embedded, to align by product categories our customers think about, making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial. Analog is now comprised of 3 product lines instead of 4. These are: power, signal chain and High Volume Analog & Logic. 
Embedded goes from 3 product lines to 2. Connected MCU, which merges Connectivity and Microcontrollers, and Processors, which is essentially unchanged. All of these changes are at the product line level. Nothing changes at the segment level. 
To help you understand the structure, for 2016, within our Analog business, Power would've been about 45% of Analog revenue. Signal chain would have been about 35% and High Volume and Analog & Logic would have been the remaining 20%. Inside our Embedded business, connected MCU would've been about 55% of Embedded revenue, with Processors comprising the remaining 45%. Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we'll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments. 
Now let me describe our performance by end market for 2016. Just as a reminder, we annually provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market. We break these into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators. 
Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points. Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points. Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6%, respectively, both even to last year, while Other was about 4%. We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016. 
For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we've been highly focused on a strategy where we've been allocating our capital and we've been driving initiatives to increase our market share in industrial and automotive. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide the diversity and longevity of product, which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio.
In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI's revenue, up from 44% just 2 years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied and are continuing to make improvements such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

Gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year-ago, gross profit margin increased 400 basis points. 
Operating expenses were $754 million or 22.1% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.37 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Restructuring charges and Other was a $20 million net benefit, which included a gain related to an intellectual property agreement and a charge associated with the realignment of our product lines, which Dave previously mentioned. 
Operating profit was $1.32 billion or 38.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42.8%, up from 38.0% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 28.2%, an improvement of 480 basis points from a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Also, we signed several intellectual property agreements, which had a total benefit of $228 million in the quarter. We recognized $188 million in other income and expense or OI&E, and $40 million in the restructuring charges and Other. Neither revenue nor gross profit was impacted by these agreements.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or $1.02 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit for items not in our prior outlook. These included a $0.14 benefit for several intellectual property agreements, a $0.01 tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock compensation, and a $0.01 restructuring charge. 
This quarter, we adopted a new GAAP standard that changes where we report the tax consequences of employee stock compensation. When an employee stock options are exercised or when a restricted stock [indiscernible], either an excess tax benefit or deficiency may be generated. The previous standard required that amount to be recognized in equity on the balance sheet. The new standard requires that amount to be recognized in income taxes on the income statement, impacting net income and EPS. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, this created a benefit of $0.01 per share, and for the year, a benefit of $0.13 per share. I will also note, this accounting standard increases the diluted share count calculation by about 5 million shares.
I'll now ask Rafael to comment on our capital management results."

In 2016, cash flow from operations was $4.61 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $531 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. This includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. 
Free cash flow for the year was $4.08 billion or 30.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 6% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. This commitment is unchanged. 
In the fourth quarter, we paid $499 million in dividends and repurchased $475 million of our stock, for a total return of $974 million. Total cash returned to owners in 2016 was $3.78 billion. This combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.65 billion in dividends or 40% of trailing 12 months free cash flow. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter, year-on-year, for 51 consecutive quarters.
In the fourth quarter, we passed an important milestone: reducing our outstanding share count to fewer than 1 billion shares or more specifically, 996 million shares. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
I will now turn this back to Kevin to close out our prepared remarks."

We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88, which includes a $0.04 tax benefit related to the adoption of the new GAAP standard that I mentioned earlier. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and holds about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2017 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2016 was moderate again this year. However, our advantages in manufacturing of technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse of all new products, enabled important milestone for the year. This includes solid revenue growth in our core business of Analog and Embedded, the expansion of 300-millimeter Analog and production. Gross margin improvement of 300 basis points, operating improvement of 300 basis points. Free cash flow margin improvement of 90 basis points and continued free cash flow per share growth. 
We will continue to feed our advantages through disciplined capital allocation by focusing on the best built opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a very long time to come. 
Before I turn it back to Dave and start the Q&A, I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. I thank you for the time you've invested in understanding TI's performance and strategy, and I wish you all the best. 
While you'll continue to have the benefit of working with our industry's finest Investor Relations Director, I'm confident when I say that you will also come to appreciate Rafael's integrity and intelligence as our new CFO, and you will come to truly enjoy working with him as well, just as I have for all these years.

I think, we've enjoyed the last couple of years, depreciation coming down at the same time that the 300-millimeter starts have been going up. Those have clearly been tailwinds for us in the last couple of years. As we go forward, depreciation is probably going to begin to flatten out a bit on a quarter-over-quarter basis. It will still be down next year versus 2016, but not nearly as much as we've seen. What's a lot more important is the continued expansion of 300-millimeter production as well as the continued improvement of the mix of products that we are shipping. You've heard us, again, talk for a number of years about focusing our investments in auto and industrial. And frankly, the margin opportunities in those spaces are very attractive. And so, between the mix of products, but importantly, the increasing starts of products on 300-millimeter capacity, there's still room for us to continue to see overall margin growth. And as before we even talk about revenue growth. Of course, revenue growth just gives us leverage on that capacity that we've been investing in for these past couple of years. And with depreciation being as low as I was talking about, what that really means is underutilization charges are negligible, and so really it's just about follow through from revenue, straight to the bottom line. And that will especially happen to cash flow. Do you have a follow-on?"

That'll continue for the next couple of quarters, and then begin to stabilize. And I would expect in 2017, all things being equal, we'll still operate around 23% of OpEx to revenue. Keep in mind that on the long haul, we expect our OpEx to probably fluctuate between 20% and 30%. So in very weak markets, it might be as high as 30%, and in very strong markets, it might be as low as 20%. In kind of stable markets we're in right now, I think the kind of OpEx percent you've seen the last 2 years is what you should expect going forward for the next year or 2."

And that is really going to be picking up pace more the new products that were released and are being release on 300-millimeter. And the economics, as you are well aware are very compelling. I mean, the bottom line is the chip costs are about 40% less on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So the total finished product is about 20% less, which adds meaningfully not only to gross margins, but especially to free cash flow, because that just falls straight through unimpeded. So again our starts continue to increase. We continue to have a lot of capacity available to us, but more importantly, we have a lot of new devices in the pipeline being released on the 300-millimeter.

Kevin, I guess, my first question is just looking at the op margins on the Embedded business. You did a great job throughout calendar '16 as you grew that business to drive leverage and upside to the operating margins. But there's still a pretty healthy gap between the op margins and Embedded in those and Analog. Is that still just a matter of getting more scale in the Embedded business? Or how do we think about those op margins closing over time?"

And then we readjusted the investment, especially for the base station marketplaces. And since then, we think we've got the investment levels about right. So it really is a question of continuing to get leverage from revenue growth falling all the way through to op margins as you point out, but again, what we focus on it falls through unimpeded to free cash flow. And that's the real focus there. So there's nothing inherent that keeps it from continuing to improve. In fact, I would not be surprised to see if the team there continued to improve on that as they completely understand the leverage capability they have on the invested -- investment base they have right now."

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
As usual, Kevin March, TI's, Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. Also, with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1. Rafael joined TI in 2001 and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a Masters in Business Administration from Stanford University.
As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year. During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown an average of 13% annually. Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%. We've all benefited and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI shares get a good return on their investment. Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael. 
I don't want to get too sentimental. But as this is Kevin's final earning call -- final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him. TI's clearly a better company because of his leadership. I will say he has an outstanding successor. I worked with Rafael over the past decade and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO. 
With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8, at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy. In today's earnings call, Rafael will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks, and Kevin and I will cover the rest. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market. The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continued. Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year ago. I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.02 and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases. 
Turning to our segments. Analog revenue grew 10% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased due to Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing increased 6% from a year-ago quarter due to processors and Microcontrollers. Connectivity also grew. In our Other segment, revenue declined 9% from a year-ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products, DLP products and calculators were about even. For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%. Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI's revenue for the year. 
We recently simplified the product lines inside our 2 business segments, Analog and Embedded, to align by product categories our customers think about, making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial. Analog is now comprised of 3 product lines instead of 4. These are: power, signal chain and High Volume Analog & Logic. 
Embedded goes from 3 product lines to 2. Connected MCU, which merges Connectivity and Microcontrollers, and Processors, which is essentially unchanged. All of these changes are at the product line level. Nothing changes at the segment level. 
To help you understand the structure, for 2016, within our Analog business, Power would've been about 45% of Analog revenue. Signal chain would have been about 35% and High Volume and Analog & Logic would have been the remaining 20%. Inside our Embedded business, connected MCU would've been about 55% of Embedded revenue, with Processors comprising the remaining 45%. Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we'll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments. 
Now let me describe our performance by end market for 2016. Just as a reminder, we annually provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market. We break these into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators. 
Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points. Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points. Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6%, respectively, both even to last year, while Other was about 4%. We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016. 
For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we've been highly focused on a strategy where we've been allocating our capital and we've been driving initiatives to increase our market share in industrial and automotive. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide the diversity and longevity of product, which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio.
In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI's revenue, up from 44% just 2 years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied and are continuing to make improvements such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

Gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year-ago, gross profit margin increased 400 basis points. 
Operating expenses were $754 million or 22.1% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.37 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Restructuring charges and Other was a $20 million net benefit, which included a gain related to an intellectual property agreement and a charge associated with the realignment of our product lines, which Dave previously mentioned. 
Operating profit was $1.32 billion or 38.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42.8%, up from 38.0% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 28.2%, an improvement of 480 basis points from a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Also, we signed several intellectual property agreements, which had a total benefit of $228 million in the quarter. We recognized $188 million in other income and expense or OI&E, and $40 million in the restructuring charges and Other. Neither revenue nor gross profit was impacted by these agreements.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or $1.02 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit for items not in our prior outlook. These included a $0.14 benefit for several intellectual property agreements, a $0.01 tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock compensation, and a $0.01 restructuring charge. 
This quarter, we adopted a new GAAP standard that changes where we report the tax consequences of employee stock compensation. When an employee stock options are exercised or when a restricted stock units vest, either an excess tax benefit or deficiency may be generated. The previous standard required that amount to be recognized in equity on the balance sheet. The new standard requires that amount to be recognized in income taxes on the income statement, impacting net income and EPS. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, this created a benefit of $0.01 per share, and for the year, a benefit of $0.13 per share. I will also note, this accounting standard increases the diluted share count calculation by about 5 million shares.
I'll now ask Rafael to comment on our capital management results."

Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $4.61 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $531 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. This includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. 
Free cash flow for the year was $4.08 billion or 30.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 6% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. This commitment is unchanged. 
In the fourth quarter, we paid $499 million in dividends and repurchased $475 million of our stock, for a total return of $974 million. Total cash returned to owners in 2016 was $3.78 billion. This combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.65 billion in dividends or 40% of trailing 12 months free cash flow. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter, year-on-year, for 51 consecutive quarters.
In the fourth quarter, we passed an important milestone: reducing our outstanding share count to fewer than 1 billion shares or more specifically, 996 million shares. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
I will now turn this back to Kevin to close out our prepared remarks."

We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88, which includes a $0.04 tax benefit related to the adoption of the new GAAP standard that I mentioned earlier. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2017 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2016 was moderate again this year. However, our advantages in manufacturing of technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse of all new products positions, enabled important milestone for the year. This includes: solid revenue growth in our core business of Analog and Embedded; the expansion of 300-millimeter Analog production; gross margin improvement of 300 basis points; operating improvement of 300 basis points; free cash flow margin improvement of 90 basis points and continued free cash flow per share growth. 
We will continue to feed our advantages through disciplined capital allocation by focusing on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a very long time to come. 
Before I turn it back to Dave and start the Q&A, I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. I thank you for the time you've invested in understanding TI's performance and strategy, and I wish you all the best. 
While you'll continue to have the benefit of working with our industry's finest Investor Relations Director, I'm confident when I say that you will also come to appreciate Rafael's integrity and intelligence as our new CFO, and you will come to truly enjoy working with him as well, just as I have for all these years.

Margin drivers going forward. I think that there'll be several things happening. I think, we've enjoyed the last couple of years, depreciation coming down at the same time that the 300-millimeter starts have been going up. Those have clearly been tailwinds for us in the last couple of years. As we go forward, depreciation is probably going to begin to flatten out a bit on a quarter-over-quarter basis. It will still be down next year versus 2016, but not nearly as much as we've seen. What's a lot more important is the continued expansion of 300-millimeter production as well as the continued improvement of the mix of products that we are shipping. You've heard us, again, talk for a number of years about focusing our investments in auto and industrial. And frankly, the margin opportunities in those spaces are very attractive. And so, between the mix of products, but importantly, the increasing starts of products on 300-millimeter capacity, there's still room for us to continue to see overall margin growth. And as before we even talk about revenue growth. Of course, revenue growth just gives us leverage on that capacity that we've been investing in for these past couple of years. And with depreciation being as low as I was talking about, what that really means is underutilization charges are negligible, and so really it's just about follow through from revenue, straight to the bottom line. And that will especially happen to cash flow. Do you have a follow-on?"

Keep in mind that on the long haul, we expect our OpEx to probably fluctuate between 20% and 30%. So in very weak markets, it might be as high as 30%, and in very strong markets, it might be as low as 20%.

And that is really going to be picking up pace. More and more of the new products that we're releasing are being released on 300-millimeter. And the economics, as you are well aware are very compelling. I mean, the bottom line is the chip costs are about 40% less on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So the total finished product is about 20% less, which adds meaningfully not only to gross margins, but especially to free cash flow, because that just falls straight through unimpeded. So again our starts continue to increase. We continue to have a lot of capacity available to us, but more importantly, we have a lot of new devices in the pipeline being released on the 300-millimeter.

So we continue to believe that we are operating in a very similar macro environment that we have -- that we have been. If you look at inside of the quarter, demand came in stronger, really across most markets and businesses. The only notable exception as I talked about before was personal electronics came in about as we expected. And to your point, we've seen choppiness in particular markets. And some of that more recently has been driven by one large customer. You can roll back the clock not too long ago into last year. We saw some choppiness in comms equipment. Before that, we had a PC XP refresh cycle that came to an end. And none of those were really tied to the overall economy. They were just very specific things going on within specific markets. So that's really the environment that we think that we're operating in now."

And that's the real focus there. So there's nothing inherent that keeps it from continuing to improve.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
As usual, Kevin March, TI's, Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. Also, with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1. Rafael joined TI in 2001 and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a Master’s in Business Administration from Stanford University.
As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year. During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown an average of 13% annually. Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%. We've all benefited and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI shares get a good return on their investment. Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael. 
I don't want to get too sentimental. But as this is Kevin's final earning call -- final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him. TI's clearly a better company because of his leadership. I will say he has an outstanding successor. I worked with Rafael over the past decade and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO. 
With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8, at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy. In today's earnings call, Rafael will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks, and Kevin and I will cover the rest. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market. The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continued. Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year ago. I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.02 and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases. 
Turning to our segments. Analog revenue grew 10% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased due to Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing increased 6% from a year-ago quarter due to processors and Microcontrollers. Connectivity also grew. In our Other segment, revenue declined 9% from a year-ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products, DLP products and calculators were about even. For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%. Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI's revenue for the year. 
We recently simplified the product lines inside our 2 business segments, Analog and Embedded, to align by product categories our customers think about, making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial. Analog is now comprised of 3 product lines instead of 4. These are: power, signal chain and High Volume Analog & Logic. 
Embedded goes from 3 product lines to 2. Connected MCU, which merges Connectivity and Microcontrollers, and Processors, which is essentially unchanged. All of these changes are at the product line level. Nothing changes at the segment level. 
To help you understand the structure, for 2016, within our Analog business, Power would've been about 45% of Analog revenue. Signal chain would have been about 35% and High Volume and Analog & Logic would have been the remaining 20%. Inside our Embedded business, connected MCU would've been about 55% of Embedded revenue, with Processors comprising the remaining 45%. Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we'll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments. 
Now let me describe our performance by end market for 2016. Just as a reminder, we annually provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market. We break these into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators. 
Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points. Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points. Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6%, respectively, both even to last year, while Other was about 4%. We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016. 
For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we've been highly focused on a strategy where we've been allocating our capital and we've been driving initiatives to increase our market share in industrial and automotive. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide the diversity and longevity of product, which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio.
In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI's revenue, up from 44% just 2 years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied and are continuing to make improvements such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

Gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year-ago, gross profit margin increased 400 basis points. 
Operating expenses were $754 million or 22.1% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.37 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Restructuring charges and Other was a $20 million net benefit, which included a gain related to an intellectual property agreement and a charge associated with the realignment of our product lines, which Dave previously mentioned. 
Operating profit was $1.32 billion or 38.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42.8%, up from 38.0% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 28.2%, an improvement of 480 basis points from a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Also, we signed several intellectual property agreements, which had a total benefit of $228 million in the quarter. We recognized $188 million in other income and expense or OI&E, and $40 million in the restructuring charges and Other. Neither revenue nor gross profit was impacted by these agreements.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or $1.02 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit for items not in our prior outlook. These included a $0.14 benefit for several intellectual property agreements, a $0.01 tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock compensation, and a $0.01 restructuring charge. 
This quarter, we adopted a new GAAP standard that changes where we report the tax consequences of employee stock compensation. When an employee stock options are exercised or when a restricted stock units vest, either an excess tax benefit or deficiency may be generated. The previous standard required that amount to be recognized in equity on the balance sheet. The new standard requires that amount to be recognized in income taxes on the income statement, impacting net income and EPS. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, this created a benefit of $0.01 per share, and for the year, a benefit of $0.13 per share. I will also note, this accounting standard increases the diluted share count calculation by about 5 million shares.
I'll now ask Rafael to comment on our capital management results."

Let me start with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.39 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 20",404,"Thanks, Kevin. Let me start with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.39 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $4.61 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $531 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. This includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. 
Free cash flow for the year was $4.08 billion or 30.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 6% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. This commitment is unchanged. 
In the fourth quarter, we paid $499 million in dividends and repurchased $475 million of our stock, for a total return of $974 million. Total cash returned to owners in 2016 was $3.78 billion. This combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.65 billion in dividends or 40% of trailing 12 months free cash flow. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter, year-on-year, for 51 consecutive quarters.
In the fourth quarter, we passed an important milestone: reducing our outstanding share count to fewer than 1 billion shares or more specifically, 996 million shares. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
I will now turn this back to Kevin to close out our prepared remarks."

We expect TI revenue to be in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion in the first quarter. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88, which includes a $0.04 tax benefit related to the adoption of the new GAAP standard that I mentioned earlier. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2017 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2016 was moderate again this year. However, our advantages in manufacturing of technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse of all new products positions, enabled important milestone for the year. This includes: solid revenue growth in our core business of Analog and Embedded; the expansion of 300-millimeter Analog production; gross margin improvement of 300 basis points; operating improvement of 300 basis points; free cash flow margin improvement of 90 basis points and continued free cash flow per share growth. 
We will continue to feed our advantages through disciplined capital allocation by focusing on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a very long time to come. 
Before I turn it back to Dave and start the Q&A, I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. I thank you for the time you've invested in understanding TI's performance and strategy, and I wish you all the best. 
While you'll continue to have the benefit of working with our industry's finest Investor Relations Director, I'm confident when I say that you will also come to appreciate Rafael's integrity and intelligence as our new CFO, and you will come to truly enjoy working with him as well, just as I have for all these years.

Margin drivers going forward. I think that there'll be several things happening. I think, we've enjoyed the last couple of years, depreciation coming down at the same time that the 300-millimeter starts have been going up. Those have clearly been tailwinds for us in the last couple of years. As we go forward, depreciation is probably going to begin to flatten out a bit on a quarter-over-quarter basis. It will still be down next year versus 2016, but not nearly as much as we've seen. What's a lot more important is the continued expansion of 300-millimeter production as well as the continued improvement of the mix of products that we are shipping. You've heard us, again, talk for a number of years about focusing our investments in auto and industrial. And frankly, the margin opportunities in those spaces are very attractive. And so, between the mix of products, but importantly, the increasing starts of products on 300-millimeter capacity, there's still room for us to continue to see overall margin growth. And as before we even talk about revenue growth. Of course, revenue growth just gives us leverage on that capacity that we've been investing in for these past couple of years. And with depreciation being as low as I was talking about, what that really means is underutilization charges are negligible, and so really it's just about follow through from revenue, straight to the bottom line. And that will especially happen to cash flow. Do you have a follow-on?"

Keep in mind that on the long haul, we expect our OpEx to probably fluctuate between 20% and 30%. So in very weak markets, it might be as high as 30%, and in very strong markets, it might be as low as 20%.

Stacy, I think that we have talked about between the Richardson factory, which we call RFAB and DMOS6, the Dallas location. Combined, we have about $8 billion in revenue-generating capacity in those factories combined. We have continued to increase starts meaningfully on 300-millimeter for Analog. And that is really going to be picking up pace. More and more of the new products that we're releasing are being released on 300-millimeter. And the economics, as you are well aware are very compelling. I mean, the bottom line is the chip costs are about 40% less on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So the total finished product is about 20% less, which adds meaningfully not only to gross margins, but especially to free cash flow, because that just falls straight through unimpeded. So again our starts continue to increase. We continue to have a lot of capacity available to us, but more importantly, we have a lot of new devices in the pipeline being released on the 300-millimeter. And that all coming together will probably continue to accelerate the rate of starts. And therefore, the rate of fall-through that we'll get from that manufacturing line."

And it seems to be included in both the earnings as well as the share count. The diluted share count went up this quarter for the first time in forever, but it sounds like it was boosted by 5 million shares or so as you said by the accounting change. So how should we think about that I guess, going through 2017? Is it still something like a $0.03 or $0.04 per quarter benefit that's going to sort of sustain kind of into perpetuity? And in terms of the share count, was this sort of like a kind of onetime step up? And should we still think about shares declining going forward even given, I guess, the increased dividends that reduced buybacks?"

It's going to impact all companies, beginning -- who haven't already implemented beginning with first quarter 2017 reported. So we basically early adopted by one quarter. The idea is try to help with better comparability for 2016 and '17. That being said, it does cause reported earnings to increase because of this tax benefit. It also mathematically requires that you compute your diluted [ph] share count differently and to add about 5 million shares to our diluted [ph] share count just compliant to the new calculation rules. In 2016, had we applied the same GAAP at the beginning of the year, it would have added $0.04 to the first quarter, $0.03 to the second quarter, $0.04 in the fourth quarter and added $0.01 -- excuse me, $0.04 in the third quarter and added $0.01 to the fourth quarter for a total of $0.13 for the year. The way that we would recommend that you model this for purposes of analyzing the company going forward, is similar to what we're doing and that is just look at what happened last year and use that same set of assumptions for next year. I'm pretty sure it'll wind up being different when we close the books on those assumptions. But that's the best way to model. So consequently, we had $0.04 that would have occurred in the first quarter of 2016. And the guidance that we've just offered for the first quarter of 2017, we've included $0.04 and we will suggest that you do the same thing."

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
As usual, Kevin March, TI's, Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. Also, with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1. Rafael joined TI in 2001 and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a Master’s in Business Administration from Stanford University.
As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year. During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown an average of 13% annually. Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%. We've all benefited and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI shares get a good return on their investment. Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael. 
I don't want to get too sentimental. But as this is Kevin's final earning call -- final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him. TI's clearly a better company because of his leadership. I will say he has an outstanding successor. I worked with Rafael over the past decade and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO. 
With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8, at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy. In today's earnings call, Rafael will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks, and Kevin and I will cover the rest. 
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market. The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continued. Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year ago. I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.02 and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago. 
We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases. 
Turning to our segments. Analog revenue grew 10% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased due to Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing increased 6% from a year-ago quarter due to processors and Microcontrollers. Connectivity also grew. In our Other segment, revenue declined 9% from a year-ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products, DLP products and calculators were about even. For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%. Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI's revenue for the year. 
We recently simplified the product lines inside our 2 business segments, Analog and Embedded, to align by product categories our customers think about, making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial. Analog is now comprised of 3 product lines instead of 4. These are: power, signal chain and High Volume Analog & Logic. 
Embedded goes from 3 product lines to 2. Connected MCU, which merges Connectivity and Microcontrollers, and Processors, which is essentially unchanged. All of these changes are at the product line level. Nothing changes at the segment level. 
To help you understand the structure, for 2016, within our Analog business, Power would've been about 45% of Analog revenue. Signal chain would have been about 35% and High Volume and Analog & Logic would have been the remaining 20%. Inside our Embedded business, connected MCU would've been about 55% of Embedded revenue, with Processors comprising the remaining 45%. Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we'll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments. 
Now let me describe our performance by end market for 2016. Just as a reminder, we annually provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market. We break these into 6 categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators. 
Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points. Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points. Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6%, respectively, both even to last year, while Other was about 4%. We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016. 
For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we've been highly focused on a strategy where we've been allocating our capital and we've been driving initiatives to increase our market share in industrial and automotive. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide the diversity and longevity of product, which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio.
In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI's revenue, up from 44% just 2 years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied and are continuing to make improvements such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.13 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year-ago, gross profit margin increased 400 basis",424,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.13 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year-ago, gross profit margin increased 400 basis points. 
Operating expenses were $754 million or 22.1% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we've invested $1.37 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Restructuring charges and Other was a $20 million net benefit, which included a gain related to an intellectual property agreement and a charge associated with the realignment of our product lines, which Dave previously mentioned. 
Operating profit was $1.32 billion or 38.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42.8%, up from 38.0% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 28.2%, an improvement of 480 basis points from a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Also, we signed several intellectual property agreements, which had a total benefit of $228 million in the quarter. We recognized $188 million in other income and expense or OI&E, and $40 million in the restructuring charges and Other. Neither revenue nor gross profit was impacted by these agreements.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or $1.02 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit for items not in our prior outlook. These included a $0.14 benefit for several intellectual property agreements, a $0.01 tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock compensation, and a $0.01 restructuring charge. 
This quarter, we adopted a new GAAP standard that changes where we report the tax consequences of employee stock compensation. When an employee stock options are exercised or when a restricted stock units vest, either an excess tax benefit or deficiency may be generated. The previous standard required that amount to be recognized in equity on the balance sheet. The new standard requires that amount to be recognized in income taxes on the income statement, impacting net income and EPS. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, this created a benefit of $0.01 per share, and for the year, a benefit of $0.13 per share. I will also note, this accounting standard increases the diluted share count calculation by about 5 million shares.
I'll now ask Rafael to comment on our capital management results."

Let me start with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.39 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 20",404,"Thanks, Kevin. Let me start with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.39 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $4.61 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $531 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. This includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity. 
Free cash flow for the year was $4.08 billion or 30.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 6% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Our intent over time remains to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. This commitment is unchanged. 
In the fourth quarter, we paid $499 million in dividends and repurchased $475 million of our stock, for a total return of $974 million. Total cash returned to owners in 2016 was $3.78 billion. This combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.65 billion in dividends or 40% of trailing 12 months free cash flow. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter, year-on-year, for 51 consecutive quarters.
In the fourth quarter, we passed an important milestone: reducing our outstanding share count to fewer than 1 billion shares or more specifically, 996 million shares. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
I will now turn this back to Kevin to close out our prepared remarks."

We expect TI revenue to be in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion in the first quarter. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88, which includes a $0.04 tax benefit related to the adoption of the new GAAP standard that I mentioned earlier. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for 2 additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2017 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. 
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2016 was moderate again this year. However, our advantages in manufacturing of technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse of all new products positions, enabled important milestone for the year. This includes: solid revenue growth in our core business of Analog and Embedded; the expansion of 300-millimeter Analog production; gross margin improvement of 340 basis points; operating improvement of 300 basis points; free cash flow margin improvement of 90 basis points and continued free cash flow per share growth. 
We will continue to feed our advantages through disciplined capital allocation by focusing on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a very long time to come. 
Before I turn it back to Dave and start the Q&A, I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. I thank you for the time you've invested in understanding TI's performance and strategy, and I wish you all the best. 
While you'll continue to have the benefit of working with our industry's finest Investor Relations Director, I'm confident when I say that you will also come to appreciate Rafael's integrity and intelligence as our new CFO, and you will come to truly enjoy working with him as well, just as I have for all these years.

Margin drivers going forward. I think that there'll be several things happening. I think, we've enjoyed the last couple of years, depreciation coming down at the same time that the 300-millimeter starts have been going up. Those have clearly been tailwinds for us in the last couple of years. As we go forward, depreciation is probably going to begin to flatten out a bit on a quarter-over-quarter basis. It will still be down next year versus 2016, but not nearly as much as we've seen. What's a lot more important is the continued expansion of 300-millimeter production as well as the continued improvement of the mix of products that we are shipping. You've heard us, again, talk for a number of years about focusing our investments in auto and industrial. And frankly, the margin opportunities in those spaces are very attractive. And so between the mix of products, but importantly, the increasing starts of products on 300-millimeter capacity, there's still room for us to continue to see overall margin growth. And as before we even talk about revenue growth. Of course, revenue growth just gives us leverage on that capacity that we've been investing in for these past couple of years. And with depreciation being as low as I was talking about, what that really means is underutilization charges are negligible, and so really it's just about follow through from revenue, straight to the bottom line.

So in very weak markets, it might be as high as 30%, and in very strong markets, it might be as low as 20%.

Stacy, I think that we have talked about between the Richardson factory, which we call RFAB and DMOS6, the Dallas location. Combined, we have about $8 billion in revenue-generating capacity in those factories combined. We have continued to increase starts meaningfully on 300-millimeter for Analog. And that is really going to be picking up pace. More and more of the new products that we're releasing are being released on 300-millimeter. And the economics, as you are well aware are very compelling. I mean, the bottom line is the chip costs are about 40% less on 300-millimeter versus 200-millimeter. So the total finished product is about 20% less, which adds meaningfully not only to gross margins, but especially to free cash flow, because that just falls straight through unimpeded. So again our starts continue to increase. We continue to have a lot of capacity available to us, but more importantly, we have a lot of new devices in the pipeline being released on the 300-millimeter. And that all coming together will probably continue to accelerate the rate of starts. And therefore, the rate of fall-through that we'll get from that manufacturing line."

The idea is try to help with better comparability for 2016 and '17. That being said, it does cause reported earnings to increase because of this tax benefit. It also mathematically requires that you compute your diluted [ph] share count differently and to add about 5 million shares to our diluted [ph] share count just compliant to the new calculation rules. In 2016, had we applied the same GAAP at the beginning of the year, it would have added $0.04 to the first quarter, $0.03 to the second quarter, $0.04 in the fourth quarter and added $0.01 -- excuse me, $0.04 in the third quarter and added $0.01 to the fourth quarter for a total of $0.13 for the year. The way that we would recommend that you model this for purposes of analyzing the company going forward, is similar to what we're doing and that is just look at what happened last year and use that same set of assumptions for next year. I'm pretty sure it'll wind up being different when we close the books on those assumptions. But that's the best way to model.

This call is bein",600,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter '17 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding the forward-looking statements contained in earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. Personal electronics also grew compared with the weak year ago quarter. 
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 20% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. 
Earnings per share were $0.97, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. 
With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $795 million, and we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.7% of revenue, up from 29.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and our opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. 
From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 20% due to growth in all 3 product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and Connected Microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $57 million from a year ago primarily due to a move of royalties to OINE, which Rafael will explain later. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew compared with the weak year ago quarter. Communications equipment grew slightly from the year-ago and sequential period. And then lastly, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive market, which are where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they will provide diversity and longevity of product, which translates to a high terminal value of portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $808 million or 23.8% of revenue. And on a trailing 12-month basis, there were 22.8% of revenue in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.25 billion or 36.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 41.4%, up from 36.6% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 29.9%, up from 25.7% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was [ $4.76 billion ], up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue. Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. This combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12 months free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year-on-year for [ 52 ] consecutive quarters. 
In March, we retired $250 million of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. 
Before moving to Q&A, there are 3 changes that I want to explain to, to help -- to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. The first is to remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adapted a new GAAP standard that impact the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation. While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our perspective tax rate and earnings per share. To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions under impact. We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance just as we did this quarter. 
To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be [ about ] 30%, unchanged from previous guidance. This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and is what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer-term models. 
Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rates, which include discrete tax items, translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models. If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year. I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter as the size of discrete tax items varies quarter-to-quarter, particularly in the first quarter. We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for this discrete task items as well as their retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti.com/ir. Hopefully, providing this discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard. 
The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension cost in Other income and expense or OINE that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue. This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue. A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website. 
The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impact how we handle the royalties. We will no longer recognize royalties and revenue. Instead, they will be recorded as income in Other income and expense. As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue. There were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017 about what they were a year ago. We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future. However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded at Other income and expense rather than in revenue as of our first quarter 2017 results. I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results. 
Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So it's diverse not only in the products that we sell into, but it's diverse across customers, across geos. So we feel very good about our position in automotive. And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in the car today, I think, most people will put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1% or a little more than 1% of the sales price of the car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year time frame have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's why we continue to invest in it and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far."

Industrial demand was strong across almost every sector that we shipped into. And just as a reminder, we've got 14 different sectors there. I won't put everybody to asleep by going through them, but we do have quite a number of sectors that are inside of that. Literally hundreds of end equipment that's inside of that, so it's very, very broad-based. Personal electronics decreased. You usually see that seasonally. And then enterprise systems was above the even. So when we look at our guidance for the second quarter, if we're looking at that sequentially, the low end of our guidance would suggest that revenues will be flat. The high end of the guidance suggest that it will be [ up 9 ]. But if you look at that, John, on a year-over-year basis, the low end will be up 4 and the high end will be up 13.

The efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300-millimeter. As you probably recall from the capital management strategy, I walked through why 300-millimeter is such a competitive advantage and that's because the cost of that shift is significantly less. In fact, it's 40% less at the chip level than on 200-millimeter. So what that translates to is not just higher gross margin, but more importantly, higher free cash flow.

You saw that, that business last quarter had grown at over 20%. It's been growing very strongly for some time. And again, that business and that growth isn't built on just one OEM or 1 car model or 1 end markets. So it's very, very diverse and we feel good about that positioning. When you look at the industrial market, that strength has continued to build. So we're seeing that come in nicely. We thought we already talked about the personal electronics market and some of the other markets in detail. So again, that strength, as you pointed out, is broad-based. Others are seeing it as well. So kind of on the other thing is your question, are we double ordering or seeing the inventories build? I just made a comment that overall, the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So we have no indications that inventories are growing or double the ordering. But I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see. I mentioned earlier our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility in the distribution inventory. And as I commented earlier, that remained steady about 4 weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago, so we think that's been in real good shape. Our visibility in the customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So I'm consigned OEM, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, especially our inventory. They pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there. So things like expedite and things like that, that would a just that there's an issue overall. And our visibility into inventory, of course, beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course, is very low. So as we've been doing for a long time, with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focused on keeping lead time steady and delivery metrics very high because that's ultimately what this customers confidence that they can support from us when they need it.

And now, over half of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive. So those investments are paying off. On your first part of your question, I would take you back to my earlier comment. We like our stated goal or our model is 20% to 30% OpEx. I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there and we think of as investment. Investment in sales, in the sales force and TI.com and a few other things that help with building those competitive advantages. So OpEx, 20% to 30%. In stable times, 22 -- in the bottom half of that, so 20% to 25%, and we have been running like that for now 27 ] months. So you should think about that way when you're modeling our OpEx.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. 
Revenue for the first quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. Personal electronics also grew compared with the weak year ago quarter. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 20% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses.  Earnings per share were $0.97, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $795 million, and we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.7% of revenue, up from 29.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and our opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 20% due to growth in all 3 product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago, due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $57 million from a year ago, primarily due to a move of royalties to OI&E, which Rafael will explain later. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew compared with the weak year ago quarter. Communications equipment grew slightly from the year ago and sequential period. And then, lastly, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, which are where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they will provide diversity and longevity of product, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $808 million or 23.8% of revenue. And on a trailing 12-month basis, there were 22.8% of revenue in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.25 billion or 36.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 41.4%, up from 36.6% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 29.9%, up from 25.7% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.76 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue. Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12 months free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year-on-year for 52 consecutive quarters. 
In March, we retired $250 million of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. 
Before moving to Q&A, there are 3 changes that I want to explain to, to help to better -- to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. The first is to remind you that, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adapted a new GAAP standard that impact the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation. While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our respective tax rate and earnings per share. To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions and their impacts. We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance, just as we did this quarter. 
To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be about 30%, unchanged from previous guidance. This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and is what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer-term models. 
Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rates, which include discrete tax items, translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models. If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year. I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter, as the size of discrete tax items vary quarter-to-quarter, particularly in first quarter. We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for these discrete task items as well as their retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti.com/ir. Hopefully, providing these discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard. 
The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension costs in Other income and expense, or OI&E, that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue. This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter, with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue. A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website. 
The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impacts how we handle royalties. We will no longer recognize royalties in revenue. Instead, they will be recorded as income in Other income and expense. As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue. There were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017, about what they were a year ago. We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future. However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded as Other income and expense, rather than in revenue, as of our first quarter 2017 results. I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results. 
Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline of designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in a car today, I think, most people will put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1% of -- a little more than 1% of the sales price of the car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year time frame have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's why we continue to invest in it and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far."

So there's some exceptions to that, of course, on some older technologies that don't make sense to do, but the vast majority of them have been released there. So as you think about the Analog business growing, you can think of that incremental growth essentially being built on 300-millimeter.

If I just kind of comment on the other markets sequentially, automotive market, as we said, continued to be strong and increased with most of the sectors growing. Industrial demand was strong across almost every sector that we shipped into. And just as a reminder, we've got 14 different sectors there. I won't put everybody to sleep by going through them, but we do have quite a number of sectors that are inside of that and literally hundreds of end equipment that's inside of that. So it's very, very broad-based. Personal electronics decreased. You usually see that seasonally. And then enterprise systems was about even. So when we look at our guidance for second quarter, if we're looking at that sequentially, the low end of our guidance would suggest that revenues would be flat.

Now beyond revenue growth, then we have 300-millimeter manufacturing, the efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300-millimeter. As you probably recall from the capital management strategy, I walked through why 300-millimeter is such a competitive advantage. And that's because the cost of the chip is significantly less. In fact, it's 40% less at the chip level than on 200-millimeter. So what that translates to is not just higher gross margin, but more importantly, higher free cash flow.

You saw that, that business last quarter had grown at over 20%. It's been growing very strongly for some time. And again, that business and that growth isn't built on just 1 OEM or 1 car model or 1 end market. So it's very, very diverse, and we feel good about that positioning. When you look at the industrial market, that strength has continued to build. So we're seeing that come in nicely. We talked -- already talked about the personal electronics markets and some of the other markets in detail. So again, that strength, and as you pointed out, is broad-based. Others are seeing it as well. So kind of on the other thing is, to your question, are we double-ordering or seeing inventories build? I'll just make the comment that, overall, the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So we have no indications that inventories are growing or double-ordering. But I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see. I mentioned earlier, our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility in the distribution inventory. And as I commented earlier, that remained steady, about 4 weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago. So we think that's been in really good shape. Our visibility in the customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So on consigned OEMs, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, actually our inventory. They pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there, so things like expedites and things like that, that would suggest that there's an issue overall. And our visibility into inventory, of course, beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course, is very low. So as we've been doing for a long time, with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focus on keeping lead time steady and delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence that they can get support from us when they need it.

We like our stated goal or our model is 20% to 30% OpEx. I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investment. There are investments in sales, in the sales force and ti.com and a few other things that help build those competitive advantages. So OpEx, 20% to 30%. In stable times, 22 -- in the bottom half of that, so 20% to 25%. And we have been running like that for now 27 months. So you should think about that way when you're modeling our OpEx.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. 
Revenue for the first quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. Personal electronics also grew compared with the weak year ago quarter. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 20% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses.  Earnings per share were $0.97, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $795 million, and we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.7% of revenue, up from 29.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and our opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 20% due to growth in all 3 product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago, due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $57 million from a year ago, primarily due to a move of royalties to OI&E, which Rafael will explain later. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew compared with the weak year-ago quarter. Communications equipment grew slightly from the year-ago and sequential period. And then, lastly, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, which are where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they will provide diversity and longevity of product, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $808 million or 23.8% of revenue. And on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.8% of revenue in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.25 billion or 36.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 41.4%, up from 36.6% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 29.9%, up from 25.7% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.76 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue. Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12 months free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year-on-year for 52 consecutive quarters. 
In March, we retired $250 million of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. 
Before moving to Q&A, there are 3 changes that I want to explain to-- to help to better -- to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. The first is to remind you that, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adapted a new GAAP standard that impact the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation. While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our respective tax rate and earnings per share. To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions and their impacts. We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance, just as we did this quarter. 
To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be about 30%, unchanged from previous guidance. This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and is what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer-term models. 
Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rates, which include discrete tax items, translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models. If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year. I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter, as the size of discrete tax items vary quarter-to-quarter, particularly in first quarter. We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for these discrete task items as well as their retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti.com/ir. Hopefully, providing these discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard. 
The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension costs in Other income and expense, or OI&E, that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue. This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter, with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue. A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website. 
The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impacts how we handle royalties. We will no longer recognize royalties in revenue. Instead, they will be recorded as income in Other income and expense. As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue. There were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017, about what they were a year ago. We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future. However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded as Other income and expense, rather than in revenue, as of our first quarter 2017 results. I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results. 
Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline of designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in a car today, I think, most people would put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1% of -- a little more than 1% of the sales price of the car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year time frame have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's why we continue to invest in it and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far."

So there's some exceptions to that, of course, on some older technologies that don't make sense to do, but the vast majority of them have been released there. So as you think about the Analog business growing, you can think of that incremental growth essentially being built on 300-millimeter.

I won't put everybody to sleep by going through them, but we do have quite a number of sectors that are inside of that and literally hundreds of end equipment that sits inside of that. So it's very, very broad-based. Personal electronics decreased. You usually see that seasonally. And then enterprise systems was about even. So when we look at our guidance for second quarter, if we're looking at that sequentially, the low end of our guidance would suggest that revenues would be flat. The high end of the guidance suggest that it would be up 9%. But -- and if you look at that, John, on a year-on-year basis, it's -- the low end would be up 4% and the high end would be up 13%.

I'll just make the comment that, overall, the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So we have no indications that inventories are growing or double-ordering. But I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see. I mentioned earlier, our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility in the distribution inventory. And as I commented earlier, that remained steady, about 4 weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago. So we think that's in real good shape. Our visibility in the customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So on consigned OEMs, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, it's actually our inventory. They pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there, so things like expedites and things like that, that would suggest that there's an issue overall. And our visibility into inventory, of course, beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course, is very low. So as we've been doing for a long time, with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focus on keeping lead time steady and delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence that they can get support from us when they need it. Do you have a follow-on?"

There are investments in sales, in the sales force and ti.com and a few other things that help us build those competitive advantages. So OpEx, 20% to 30%.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. 
Revenue for the first quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. Personal electronics also grew compared with the weak year ago quarter. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 20% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses.  Earnings per share were $0.97, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $795 million, and we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.7% of revenue, up from 29.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and our opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 20% due to growth in all 3 product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago, due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $57 million from a year ago, primarily due to a move of royalties to OI&E, which Rafael will explain later. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew compared with the weak year-ago  quarter. Communications equipment grew slightly from the year-ago  and sequential period. And then, lastly, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, which are where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they will provide diversity and longevity of product, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $808 million or 23.8% of revenue. And on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.8% of revenue in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.25 billion or 36.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 41.4%, up from 36.6% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 29.9%, up from 25.7% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.76 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue. Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12 months free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year-on-year for 52 consecutive quarters. 
In March, we retired $250 million of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. 
Before moving to Q&A, there are 3 changes that I want to explain to-- to help to better -- to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. The first is to remind you that, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adapted a new GAAP standard that impact the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation. While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our respective tax rate and earnings per share. To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions and their impacts. We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance, just as we did this quarter. 
To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be about 30%, unchanged from previous guidance. This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and is what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer-term models. 
Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rates, which include discrete tax items, translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models. If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year. I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter, as the size of discrete tax items vary quarter-to-quarter, particularly in first quarter. We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for these discrete task items as well as their retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti.com/ir. Hopefully, providing these discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard. 
The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension costs in Other income and expense, or OI&E, that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue. This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter, with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue. A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website. 
The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impacts how we handle royalties. We will no longer recognize royalties in revenue. Instead, they will be recorded as income in Other income and expense. As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue. There were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017, about what they were a year ago. We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future. However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded as Other income and expense, rather than in revenue, as of our first quarter 2017 results. I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results. 
Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. 
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So it's diverse not only in the products that we sell into, but it's diverse across customers, across geos. So we feel very good about our position in automotive. And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline of designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in a car today, I think, most people would put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1% of -- a little more than 1% of the sales price of the car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year time frame have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's why we continue to invest in it and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far."

But we think of our strategy, as stated out in the capital management strategy for many years, is that we want to add capacity well ahead of demand. And that's because this is an asymmetrical bet. This capacity, we can buy. When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment, we can buy pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal. But the upside potential is tremendous for reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall-through that we get to free cash flow. So we're thinking longer term, 10, 15 years out when we're making capacity decisions."

So I guess, kind of 2 parts here. One, how do you fill the gap between what -- I know there's content gains in semis, but between what some of the end markets are doing, do you think -- what's your perspective as you look out the rest of the year? Do you think the semi market is a little ahead of itself? And then, I guess, as you look at your June guidance, did you guys apply any sort of conservatism to that guidance to account for anything along those lines?"

You saw that, that business last quarter had grown at over 20%. It's been growing very strongly for some time. And again, that business and that growth isn't built on just 1 OEM or 1 car model or 1 end market. So it's very, very diverse, and we feel good about that positioning. When you look at the industrial market, that strength has continued to build. So we're seeing that come in nicely. We talked -- already talked about the personal electronics markets and some of the other markets in detail. So again, that strength, and as you pointed out, is broad-based. Others are seeing it as well. So kind of on the other thing is, to your question, are we double-ordering or seeing inventories build? I'll just make the comment that, overall, the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So we have no indications that inventories are growing or double-ordering. But I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see. I mentioned earlier, our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility in the distribution inventory. And as I commented earlier, that remained steady, about 4 weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago. So we think that's  in real good shape. Our visibility in the customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So on consigned OEMs, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, it's actually our inventory. They pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there, so things like expedites and things like that, that would suggest that there's an issue overall. And our visibility into inventory, of course, beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course, is very low. So as we've been doing for a long time, with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focus on keeping lead time steady and delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence that they can get support from us when they need it. Do you have a follow-on?"

We like our stated goal or our model is 20% to 30% OpEx. I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investment. There are investments in sales, in the sales force and ti.com and a few other things that help us build those competitive advantages. So OpEx, 20% to 30%.

A replay will be available through the web. This call will include the forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. In our core businesses. Analog revenue grew 18% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.03. With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $917 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.0 billion and free cash flow margin was 28.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 18%, primarily due to growth in Power and Signal Chain, each of which grew about the same amount. High Volume also grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, Processors and Microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $60 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and a move of royalties to OI&E beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double-digit. Industrial demand continued to strengthen, with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double-digit. Personal electronics grew, while results vary by customer. Lastly, communications equipment grew and enterprise systems was about even. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive market, which are the end markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on our belief is that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they'll provide diversity and longevity of product, which translate to a high turnover value of the portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

From a year ago, the gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $812 million, and in a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.3% of revenue, which is in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.48 billion or 40.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 31% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 44.7%, up from 38.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, was 31.2%, up from 25.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions, enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $1.06 billion, or $1.03 per share, which included a $28 million discrete tax benefit, above what we expected. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $917 million in the quarter. You will see that while net income was significantly higher than a year ago, that increase was more than offset by a higher tax payment that was driven by our outlook for higher profitability this year. Inventory days were 133, even with our year ago and within our range. Capital expenditures were $151 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.56 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $527 million or about 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term, and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In the second quarter, we paid $498 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.05 billion. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.88 billion in dividends. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.2% over the past 12 months, and has been reduced by 42% since the [indiscernible] before when we initiated a program designed to reduce the share count. This combined returns of dividends and repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and commitment to return excess cash to owners. In the quarter, we retired $375 million of debt, and year-to-date, we have retired $625 million. In addition, we issue $600 million of debt in 2 tranches: $300 million each in 4-year and the 7-year notes. This leaves total debt of $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entity owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.18, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our annual operating tax report 2017 is now about 31% compared with our prior expectation of about 30% due to our outlook for higher profitability this year. This annual operating tax rate assume no discrete tax, no discrete items and is what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer-term model. Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $20 million and $10 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, translate to about 29% and 30% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rate you should use for your 2017 models. I will also remind analysts who are beginning to work with 2018 models that we would expect the discrete tax benefit in 1Q '18 to be higher than what we are projecting for the third and fourth quarters of 2017, but lower than 1Q '17. To estimate a 2018 annual operating tax rate, start with 2017 PDP tax of 31% and apply a 35% tax rate to any incremental profit. Then, model discrete tax benefits by quarter, knowing that first quarter is expected to be higher than the others. Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term, and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. With that, let me turn it over to Dave."

So I would attribute that to our early focus on that market, the breadth of our technologies and really just the overall diversity of our position. So we've got 5 sectors inside of automotive that we're investing in, so that includes infotainment; safety systems; ADAS or advanced driver assist systems; PowerTrain, which include easy and hybrid; and body, electronics and lighting. So we're seeing good growth across those specters that bit inside the automotive market. And really also diversity across subsystem suppliers across car companies across geographical regions. So we feel really good about that. Very similar story inside of industrial, very broad-based growth. I won't speak to whether they'll be connected through economic cycles or not. But both do have increasing content, so I'd be a little cautious to think that, that's increasing content could offset a correction that we may see in a near term in any 1 given quarter or even in any 1 given year.

And that can move in both directions pretty quickly, right? So even though we've got great visibility there, things can strengthen or weaken very quickly on us. But we do have very, very good visibility for that 60% of our revenue. And the rest of that, we look at -- we do look at the backlog, we look at order patterns. Our sales teams provide forecasts as well so we go through a bottoms-up and a top-down approach. So the revenue guidance that we gave you for the third quarter is our best estimate of what we think we'll do."

This call is bei",570,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter '17 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web, and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 18%, and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.03.
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $917 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.0 billion, and free cash flow margin was 28.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 18%, primarily due to growth in power and signal chain, each of which grew about the same amount. High volume also grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $60 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digit. Industrial demand continued to strengthen, with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digit. Personal electronics grew, while results vary by customer. Lastly, communications equipment grew and enterprise systems was about even. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive market, which are the end markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they'll provide diversity and longevity of product, which translate to a high turnover value of the portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.37 billion or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, the gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points.

From a year ago, the gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $812 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.3% of revenue, which is in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation.
Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.48 billion or 40.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 31% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 44.7%, up from 38.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, was 31.2%, up from 25.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.06 billion, or $1.03 per share, which included a $28 million discrete tax benefit, above what we expected.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $917 million in the quarter. You will see that while net income was significantly higher than a year ago, that increase was more than offset by a higher tax payment that was driven by our outlook for higher profitability this year. Inventory days were 133, even with our year ago and within our range. Capital expenditures were $151 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.56 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $527 million or about 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In the second quarter, we paid $498 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.05 billion. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.88 billion in dividends. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.2% over the past 12 months, and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. This combined returns of dividends and repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and commitment to return excess cash to owners. In the quarter, we retired $375 million of debt, and year-to-date, we have retired $625 million. In addition, we issue $600 million of debt in 2 tranches: $300 million each in 4-year and 7-year notes. This leaves total debt of $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entity owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.18, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our annual operating tax rate for 2017 is now about 31% compared with our prior expectation of about 30% due to our outlook for higher profitability this year. This annual operating tax rate assume no discrete tax -- no discrete items and is what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer-term model. Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $20 million and $10 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, translate to about 29% and 30% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rate you should use for your 2017 models. I will also remind analysts who are beginning to work with 2018 models that we would expect the discrete tax benefit in 1Q '18 to be higher than what we are projecting for the third and fourth quarters of 2017, but lower than 1Q '17. To estimate a 2018 annual operating tax rate, start with 2017 PBT tax of 31% and apply a 35% tax rate to any incremental profit. Then, model discrete tax benefits by quarter, knowing that first quarter is expected to be higher than the others.
Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

We look at OpEx as a model, and our model is 20 -- to be between 20% and 30% of revenue and in stable times to be at the lower half of that. In fact, that's where we've been in the last 2.5 years or so, 23% to 22%. Now we're running at 22% of revenue. And again, in stable times, we think we can operate there. Now inside of that, there -- both in R&D and actually in SG&A, we have various investments that are strengthening our competitive advantages. On the R&D font, we continue to focus on industrial and automotive to continue to broaden our portfolio. On the SG&A side, we invested on -- to increase the reach of our channels, ti.com in particular. So we are thinking that we're going to continue to make those investments to strengthen the company."

So the strength that we've seen inside of automotive is something that we've seen for, probably, greater than 4 years now. So I would attribute that to our early focus on that market, the breadth of our technologies and really just the overall diversity of our position. So we've got 5 sectors inside of automotive that we're investing in, so that includes infotainment; safety systems; ADAS or advanced driver assist systems; PowerTrain, which include EV and hybrid; and body, electronics and lighting. So we're seeing good growth across those comms vectors that sit inside of the automotive market. And really also diversity across subsystem suppliers across car companies across geographical regions. So we feel really good about that. Very similar story inside of industrial, very broad-based growth. I won't speak to whether they'll be connected through economic cycles or not. But both do have increasing content. So I'd be a little cautious to think that, that increasing content could offset a correction that we may see in a near term in any 1 given quarter or even in any 1 given year. But we believe that there will be more content there over the longer term when you're looking 5 and 10 years, and that's why our investments are higher there. Do you have a follow-on?"

And clearly, the -- I would think it's well known that SC content has grown faster inside of autos, and geez, if you just go down into a showroom, you can see that pretty clearly in any car today versus even just a few years ago. So we're more confident that, that trend will continue. And we've also seen the announcements. Like you've mentioned, that some care companies have reduced their build plan. We certainly continue to monitor those markets overall. But we're confident in our long-term position there, and we'll continue to make those investments."

In embedded, I'd say those investments are down versus where they were maybe 5 years ago.

Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is bei",570,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter '17 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web, and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 18%, and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.03.
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $917 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.0 billion, and free cash flow margin was 28.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 18%, primarily due to growth in power and signal chain, each of which grew about the same amount. High volume also grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $60 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digit. Industrial demand continued to strengthen, with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digit. Personal electronics grew, while results vary by customer. Lastly, communications equipment grew and enterprise systems was about even. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive market, which are the end markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they'll provide diversity and longevity of product, which translate to a high turnover value of the portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.37 billion or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, the gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points.

From a year ago, the gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $812 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.3% of revenue, which is in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation.
Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.48 billion or 40.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 31% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 44.7%, up from 38.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, was 31.2%, up from 25.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.06 billion, or $1.03 per share, which included a $28 million discrete tax benefit, above what we expected.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $917 million in the quarter. You will see that while net income was significantly higher than a year ago, that increase was more than offset by a higher tax payment that was driven by our outlook for higher profitability this year. Inventory days were 133, even with our year ago and within our range. Capital expenditures were $151 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.56 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $527 million or about 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In the second quarter, we paid $498 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.05 billion. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.88 billion in dividends. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.2% over the past 12 months, and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. This combined returns of dividends and repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and commitment to return excess cash to owners. In the quarter, we retired $375 million of debt, and year-to-date, we have retired $625 million. In addition, we issued $600 million of debt in 2 tranches: $300 million each in 4-year and 7-year notes. This leaves total debt of $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entity owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.18, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our annual operating tax rate for 2017 is now about 31% compared with our prior expectation of about 30% due to our outlook for higher profitability this year. This annual operating tax rate assume no discrete tax -- no discrete items and is what you will need to use as the starting point for your longer-term model. Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $20 million and $10 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, translate to about 29% and 30% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rate you should use for your 2017 models. I will also remind analysts who are beginning to work with 2018 models that we would expect the discrete tax benefit in 1Q '18 to be higher than what we are projecting for the third and fourth quarters of 2017, but lower than 1Q '17. To estimate a 2018 annual operating tax rate, start with 2017 PBT tax of 31% and apply a 35% tax rate to any incremental profit. Then, model discrete tax benefits by quarter, knowing that first quarter is expected to be higher than the others.
Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So we're seeing good growth across those comms vectors that sit inside of the automotive market. And really also diversity across subsystem suppliers across car companies across geographical regions. So we feel really good about that. Very similar story inside of industrial, very broad-based growth. I won't speak to whether they'll be connected through economic cycles or not.

But when we look at our competitive advantages -- and I'd just say, just as a reminder, all 4 of those working together and the investments that we're making, and that includes the manufacturing and technology, the most visible one there is the 300-millimeter advantage that we have, the broad product portfolio and just the tens of thousands of products that we've got the opportunity to sell more products to more customers, the reach of the channel market, including ti.com that Rafael had mentioned earlier, as well as our sales force, and then, just the diverse and long-lived positions, all those working together, I think, gives us confidence that in the future that we can continue to gain share in that range of 30 to 40 basis points."

And then, the other piece is a 300-millimeter Analog, as I stated earlier, that is 40% more cost-efficient than 200-millimeter.

With communications equipment, I would say that we've got some caveats depending on which business we're looking at. In embedded, I'd say those investments are down versus where they were maybe 5 years ago. But on the same view, inside of Analog, they're actually up because of some of the complexity that's being developed inside of the radio. So we do believe that, that market will continue to provide great opportunities for us for a very long period of time. But we just don't believe that there's going to be significant growth.

This call is bei",570,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter '17 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web, and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 18%, and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.03.
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $917 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.0 billion, and free cash flow margin was 28.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 18%, primarily due to growth in power and signal chain, each of which grew about the same amount. High volume also grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers, by about the same amount. In our Other segment, revenue declined $60 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digit. Industrial demand continued to strengthen, with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digit. Personal electronics grew, while results vary by customer. Lastly, communications equipment grew and enterprise systems was about even. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive market, which are the end markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they'll provide diversity and longevity of product, which translate to a high turnover value of the portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?"

From a year ago, the gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $812 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.3% of revenue, which is in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation.
Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.48 billion or 40.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 31% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 44.7%, up from 38.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, was 31.2%, up from 25.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.06 billion, or $1.03 per share, which included a $28 million discrete tax benefit, above what we expected.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $917 million in the quarter. You will see that while net income was significantly higher than a year ago, that increase was more than offset by a higher tax payment that was driven by our outlook for higher profitability this year. Inventory days were 133, even with our year ago and within our range. Capital expenditures were $151 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.56 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $527 million or about 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In the second quarter, we paid $498 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.05 billion. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.88 billion in dividends. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.2% over the past 12 months, and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. This combined returns of dividends and repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and commitment to return excess cash to owners. In the quarter, we retired $375 million of debt, and year-to-date, we have retired $625 million. In addition, we issued $600 million of debt in 2 tranches: $300 million each in 4-year and 7-year notes. This leaves total debt of $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entity owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
Turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.18, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our annual operating tax rate for 2017 is now about 31% compared with our prior expectation of about 30% due to our outlook for higher profitability this year. This annual operating tax rate assume no discrete tax -- no discrete items and is what you will need to use as the starting point for your longer-term model. Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $20 million and $10 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, translate to about 29% and 30% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rate you should use for your 2017 models. I will also remind analysts who are beginning to work with 2018 models that we would expect the discrete tax benefit in 1Q '18 to be higher than what we are projecting for the third and fourth quarters of 2017, but lower than 1Q '17. To estimate a 2018 annual operating tax rate, start with 2017 PBT tax of 31% and apply a 35% tax rate to any incremental profit. Then, model discrete tax benefits by quarter, knowing that first quarter is expected to be higher than the others.
Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave."

So we're seeing good growth across those comms vectors that sit inside of the automotive market. And really also diversity across subsystem suppliers across car companies across geographical regions. So we feel really good about that. Very similar story inside of industrial, very broad-based growth. I won't speak to whether they'll be connected through economic cycles or not. But both do have increasing content. So I'd be a little cautious to think that, that increasing content could offset a correction that we may see in a near term in any 1 given quarter or even in any 1 given year.

It's more than half of that end market by itself, so probably somewhere in the mid-single digits as a percentage of our revenue. And there, I think, when we look at incremental dollars of where we're investing, if I refer you back to our capital management call that we gave back in February, we talked about the fact that we wanted to increase incrementally dollars in both the industrial and automotive markets because that's where we believe the growth will be. With communications equipment, I would say that we've got some caveats depending on which business we're looking at. In embedded, I'd say those investments are down versus where they were maybe 5 years ago. But on the same view, inside of Analog, they're actually up because of some of the complexity that's being developed inside of the radio. So we do believe that, that market will continue to provide great opportunities for us for a very long period of time. But we just don't believe that there's going to be significant growth. We don't know of any carriers that want to take up their CapEx over the next 5 and 10 years over a longer period of time. So thank you for that question, Craig, and thank you all for joining us tonight. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening."

Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is bein",598,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 12% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 16% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share was $1.26. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion and free cash flow margin was 29.0% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12 month period, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increased our share repurchase authorization by $6 billion, which together, reflect our commitment to return all our free cash flow to our owners. 
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 16% due to growth in Power and Signal Chain. High-Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 17% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined $70 million from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E which began in the first quarter of 2017. 
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Industrial demand remains strong with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digits. Automotive demand remains strong with most sectors growing double digits. Personal electronics was about even with results varying by customer. Communications equipment grew while results varied by customer. And finally, enterprise systems grew primarily due to servers. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide diversity and longevity of products, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in t",813,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $787 million. And on a trailing 12 month basis, we're 22% of revenue. 
We've seen our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.79 billion or 43.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 41.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, was 34.9%, up from 28.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. 
Net income in the third quarter was $1.29 billion or $1.26 per share. This included a $38 million discrete tax benefit that was $18 million higher than our original guidance for the quarter, adding about $0.02 to our earnings per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.72 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $186 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.82 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $574 million or about 4% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectation. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.25 billion or 29% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we will increase our dividend by 24% and also increase our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.50 per share to $0.62 per share or $2.48 annualized. This is our 14th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past 5 years, we have increased the dividend by a compounded average rate of 24%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $10 billion at the end of the third quarter. For the third quarter, we paid $495 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.99 billion in dividend or about 47% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.32 billion. This combined return of dividends and repurchases and the recent announcement increase the dividend and share repurchase authorizations demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. 
Our balance sheet remain strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S. entities. This is consistent with our long-term objective to have onshore cash readily available for multiple uses. Inventory days were 119, up 1 day from a year ago and within our expected range. Our total debt is unchanged at $3.6 billion, with a weighted-average coupon rate of 1.93%. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.87 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.15, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our expected annual operating tax rate for 2017 continues to be about 31%. For the fourth quarter 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 29%, which includes about $20 million of discrete tax items, up from our previous guidance of $10 million. This is the rate you should use for your model for fourth quarter. For 2018, we are providing you with our quarterly tax rate expectations for both the operating and effective tax rates. You can find this detail on our Investor Relations website, under the Financial Summary data section. 
Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. With that, let me turn back to Dave."

Now of course, OpEx -- to us, OpEx are investments. And obviously, that goes for R&D. But even inside of G&A, we think of a large portion there as investments. So in R&D, of course we are focusing on industrial and automotive because that's the best markets where the semiconductor growth is happening.

So we've got really good visibility into our distributor's inventory and that remains about 4 weeks. It's even both sequentially and year-on-year. Our visibility in customer inventories will vary, depending if we are on consignment or not. So for our consignment OEMs, we hold that inventory on our balance sheet.

But then the other one is just growing to top line at the same margin, right? So that's the key message that -- the key objective that we're trying to achieve."

They are channel advantages which includes the size of our sales force in ti.com and then just the diversity and longevity of our -- across markets and sectors and customers and products which I think leads for investors' high confidence and a high terminal value that product portfolio. But why 300-millimeter matters is that we've got a structural cost advantage. So with that larger wafer size, we get 40% lower cost on the chip when we manufacture that and most chips in the industry are built on 200 millimeters. So we started this year, we've had about 25% of our 300-millimeter capacity footprint utilized. Essentially most of the Analog growth this year, and as we have seen for several years, is supported by 300-millimeter. Lastly, we'll give an update to that in our February capital management call on what the precise numbers are. But that revenue continues to grow on 300-millimeter. And we continue to see the benefit. So thank you for that question, C.J."

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 12% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 16% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share was $1.26. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, and free cash flow margin was 29.0% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion, which together reflect our commitment to return all our free cash flow to our owners.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 16% due to growth in Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 17% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined $70 million from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E, which began in the first quarter of 2017. 
Now we'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Industrial demand remains strong with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digits. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double digits. Personal electronics was about even with results varying by customer. Communications equipment grew while results varied by customer. And finally, enterprise systems grew primarily due to servers. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive market where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide diversity and longevity of products, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $787 million and, on a trailing 12-month basis, were 22% of revenue, within our range of expectation. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.79 billion or 43.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 41.2% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing was 34.9%, up from 28.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best, sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the third quarter was $1.29 billion or $1.26 per share. This included a $38 million discrete tax benefit that was $18 million higher than our original guidance for the quarter, adding about $0.02 to our earnings per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.72 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $186 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.82 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $574 million or about 4% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectation. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.25 billion or 29% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increase our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.50 per share to $0.62 per share or $2.48 annualized. This is our 14th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past 5 years, we have increased the dividend by a compounded average rate of 24%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $10 billion at the end of third quarter. 
For the third quarter, we paid $495 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.99 billion in dividend or about 47% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.32 billion. These combined returns of dividends and repurchases and our recent announcement to increase the dividend and share repurchase authorizations demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to all owners. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S. entities. This is consistent with our long-term objective to have onshore cash readily available for multiple uses. Inventory days were 119, up 1 day from a year ago and within our expected range. Our total debt is unchanged at $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.87 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.15, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our expected annual operating tax rate for 2017 continues to be about 31%. For fourth quarter 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 29%, which includes about $20 million of discrete tax items, up from our previous guidance of $10 million. This is the rate you should use for your model for fourth quarter. For 2018, we're providing you with our quarterly tax rate expectations for both the operating and effective tax rates. You can find this detail on our Investor Relations website, under the Financial summary data section. 
Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. 
With that, let me turn back to Dave."

So we've got really good visibility into our distributors' inventory and that remains at about 4 weeks. It's even both sequentially and year-on-year. Our visibility in customer inventories will vary depending if we're on consignment or not. So for our consignment OEMs, we hold that inventory on our balance sheet.

So those changes were -- began implementation 3 years ago for any accounts where we had direct TI resources that represented about 80% of the TAM. And then later last year, we implemented changes with the remaining 20%. So I'd say a good portion of that is worked through and we won't be -- it's not significant enough that it's going to make any of these earnings conference calls.

And I think if I bring you back to our 4 competitive advantages, just that diversity and longevity, we'll benefit from ADAS systems being deployed as the industry marches forward to autonomous driving or the mix of EVs. Those are things we'll benefit from, but our business model isn't dependent on them. So we're really excited with the diversity of the design wins that we have there, and we think we've got a lot of runway there as well as inside of industrial.

This call is being",599,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our Third Quarter '17 Earnings Conference Call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 12% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the Industrial and Automotive market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 16% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share was $1.26. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, and free cash flow margin was 29.0% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion, which together reflect our commitment to return all our free cash flow to our owners.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 16% due to growth in Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 17% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined $70 million from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E, which began in the first quarter of 2017. 
Now we'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Industrial demand remains strong with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digits. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double digits. Personal electronics was about even with results varying by customer. Communications equipment grew while results varied by customer. And finally, enterprise systems grew primarily due to servers. 
We continue to focus our strategy on the Industrial and Automotive market where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that Industrial and Automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide diversity and longevity of products, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in t",812,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $787 million and, on a trailing 12-month basis, were 22% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.79 billion or 43.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 41.2% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing, was 34.9%, up from 28.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best, sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the third quarter was $1.29 billion or $1.26 per share. This included a $38 million discrete tax benefit that was $18 million higher than our original guidance for the quarter, adding about $0.02 to our earnings per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.72 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $186 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.82 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $574 million or about 4% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectation. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.25 billion or 29% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increase our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.50 per share to $0.62 per share or $2.48 annualized. This is our 14th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past 5 years, we have increased the dividend by a compounded average rate of 24%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $10 billion at the end of third quarter. 
For the third quarter, we paid $495 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.99 billion in dividend or about 47% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.32 billion. This combined returns of dividends and repurchases and our recent announcement to increase the dividend and share repurchase authorizations demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S. entities. This is consistent with our long-term objective to have onshore cash readily available for multiple uses. Inventory days were 118, up 1 day from a year ago and within our expected range. Our total debt is unchanged at $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.87 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.15, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our expected annual operating tax rate for 2017 continues to be about 31%. For fourth quarter 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 29%, which includes about $20 million of discrete tax items, up from our previous guidance of $10 million. This is the rate you should use for your model for fourth quarter. For 2018, we're providing you with our quarterly tax rate expectations for both the operating and effective tax rates. You can find this detail on our Investor Relations website, under the Financial summary data section. 
Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. 
With that, let me turn back to Dave."

In any one quarter, that fall-through can be a little different. Now, for example, in the comparison versus a year ago, which arguably -- I would argue it's more relevant and to have more time obviously in between, that was close to an 85% fall-through, right. The increase in gross margin was 240 basis points, just as an example, as a comparison to the sequential basis."

So John, I think that if you look at general market conditions, they're similar to 90 days ago and certainly continue to remain strong. However, I think it's still yet to be seen how long that will extend, over how long of a period of time. So we've got no indications of inventories growing or double ordering. And like I pointed out last quarter, history suggests we never really see that -- those types of things ahead of time. But I think, again, it's important to qualify what we can see. So we've got really good visibility into our distributors' inventory and that remains at about 4 weeks. It's even both sequentially and year-on-year. Our visibility in customer inventories will vary depending if we're on consignment or not. So for our consignment OEMs, we hold that inventory on our balance sheet. And we don't see any unusual signals or other things like expedites that would suggest that there's issues inside of that. And our visibility, of course, in inventory beyond that and down our customers' channels, we just can't see that, of course. So we just remain focused as we have for a long time, focusing on both our internal manufacturing and internal inventory strategies. And we're focused on trying to keep lead times steady, which they have, delivery metrics really high, because that's what gives customers confidence that they can get the product when they need it. So do you have a follow-on, John?"

But why 300-millimeter matters is that we've got a structural cost advantage. So with that larger wafer size, we get 40% lower cost on the chip when we manufacture that, and most chips in the industry are built on 200 millimeters. So when we started this year, we've had about 25% of our 300-millimeter capacity footprint utilized. Essentially, most of the Analog growth this year and as we have seen for several years is supported by 300-millimeter. We'll actually give an update to that in our February capital management call on what the precise numbers are. But that revenue continues to grow on 300-millimeter and we continue to see the benefit.

For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 12% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the Industrial and Automotive market. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 16% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share was $1.26. 
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, and free cash flow margin was 29.0% of revenue. 
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion, which together reflect our commitment to return all our free cash flow to our owners.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 16% due to growth in Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 17% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined $70 million from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E, which began in the first quarter of 2017. 
Now we'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Industrial demand remains strong with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digits. Automotive demand remained strong with most sectors growing double digits. Personal electronics was about even with results varying by customer. Communications equipment grew while results varied by customer. And finally, enterprise systems grew primarily due to servers. 
We continue to focus our strategy on the Industrial and Automotive market where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that Industrial and Automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide diversity and longevity of products, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. 
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."

Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in t",812,"Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $787 million and, on a trailing 12-month basis, were 22% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. 
Operating profit was $1.79 billion or 43.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 41.2% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing, was 34.9%, up from 28.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best, sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the third quarter was $1.29 billion or $1.26 per share. This included a $38 million discrete tax benefit that was $18 million higher than our original guidance for the quarter, adding about $0.02 to our earnings per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.72 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $186 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.82 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $574 million or about 4% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectation. 
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.25 billion or 29% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. 
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increase our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.50 per share to $0.62 per share or $2.48 annualized. This is our 14th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past 5 years, we have increased the dividend by a compounded average rate of 24%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $10 billion at the end of third quarter. 
For the third quarter, we paid $495 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our stock for a total return of $1.15 billion in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.99 billion in dividend or about 47% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.32 billion. This combined returns of dividends and repurchases and our recent announcement to increase the dividend and share repurchase authorizations demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. 
Our balance sheet remains strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S. entities. This is consistent with our long-term objective to have onshore cash readily available for multiple uses. Inventory days were 118, up 1 day from a year ago and within our expected range. Our total debt is unchanged at $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. 
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.87 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.15, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. Our expected annual operating tax rate for 2017 continues to be about 31%. For fourth quarter 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 29%, which includes about $20 million of discrete tax items, up from our previous guidance of $10 million. This is the rate you should use for your model for fourth quarter. For 2018, we're providing you with our quarterly tax rate expectations for both the operating and effective tax rates. You can find this detail on our Investor Relations website, under the Financial summary data section. 
Now to wrap up. We remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. 
With that, let me turn back to Dave."

Now of course, OpEx -- to us, OpEx are investments. And obviously, that goes for R&D. But even inside of G&A, we think of a large portion there as investments. So in R&D, of course, we're focusing on Industrial and Automotive because those are the best markets where the semiconductor growth is happening. But on the G&A front, we have many investments there on ti.com and the demand creation just to continue building on our reach of channels, reach of markets, competitive advantage that we have talked about.

So we've got really good visibility into our distributors' inventory and that remains at about 4 weeks. It's even both sequentially and year-on-year. Our visibility in customer inventories will vary depending if we're on consignment or not. So for our consignment OEMs, we hold that inventory on our balance sheet.

I think C.J. asked that question, there are probably callers on the line and listening that aren't unfamiliar. But we've got 4 competitive advantages, the first of which is our manufacturing and technology, and I think the 300-millimeter is a good example of that strength. The other 3, just quickly, are the breadth of the product portfolio; the -- our channel advantages, which includes the size of our sales force in ti.com; and then just the diversity and longevity of our -- across markets and sectors and customers and products, which I think leads for investors' high confidence and a high terminal value of that product portfolio. But why 300-millimeter matters is that we've got a structural cost advantage. So with that larger wafer size, we get 40% lower cost on the chip when we manufacture that, and most chips in the industry are built on 200 millimeters. So when we started this year, we've had about 25% of our 300-millimeter capacity footprint utilized. Essentially, most of the Analog growth this year and as we have seen for several years is supported by 300-millimeter. We'll actually give an update to that in our February capital management call on what the precise numbers are. But that revenue continues to grow on 300-millimeter and we continue to see the benefit. So thank you for that question, C.J."

And I think if you look at that strength inside of Industrial and Automotive, I think as we look at third quarter, as it has for some time, that strength has been very broad-based. So we've got 14 sectors inside of Industrial. Most of those have been growing double digits for some time. We continue to direct our investments across those 14. So it's a very intentional investment and return; same thing in Automotive. So we've got diversity across 5 different sectors. All 5 of those are contributing to growth, and that diversity is across the product lines. It's across geographies. So we feel really good about that strength. Do you have a follow-on?"

And I think if I bring you back to our 4 competitive advantages, just that diversity and longevity, we'll benefit from ADAS systems being deployed as the industry marches forward to autonomous driving or the mix of EVs. Those are things we'll benefit from, but our business model isn't dependent on them.
