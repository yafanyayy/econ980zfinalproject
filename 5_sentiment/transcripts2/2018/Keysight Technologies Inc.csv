We delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding our guidance and we're pleased with our performance in growing leadership position in the market. I'll focus my formal c",1233,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding our guidance and we're pleased with our performance in growing leadership position in the market. I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, 2018 is off to a great start, and we delivered a strong quarter across-the-board. Our better-than-expected results this quarter were driven by robust order growth as well as the strength of our execution. Second, customers are increasing their R&D investments in the next-generation technologies, and we have continued to build momentum across multiple end markets, contributing to 4 consecutive quarters of accelerating order growth. And third, Keysight's transformation strategy is delivering results. With our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. Additionally, our order growth in backlog expansion over the past several quarters has established a strong foundation to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. 
Let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.51 per share, which was $0.15 above the midpoint of our guidance and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. We delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 39% in total, or 16% on a core basis to reach a new first quarter record. Q1 revenue increased by 18% to reach $856 million, which was also above our guidance. 
Our better-than-expected results were driven by our strong order growth and execution, including our ability to recover from the Northern California wildfires faster than expected. With the teams' diligence, focus and hard work, our Santa Rosa production capacity is running above pre-fire levels. We still have work to do in order to fully recover but bringing production back to pre-fire levels at this site was essential, especially as customer demand for our solutions continue to grow. 
At the same time, we were working to recover from the wildfires in Santa Rosa, we achieved another major operational milestone in the quarter by completing the integration of Ixia's people, systems and processes. This was a significant undertaking, and now we are able to book, build, ship and invoice Ixia sales on Keysight's ERP. We completed this integration in 9 months, once against through the strong execution of our team. This milestone is a key enabler in realizing the committed Ixia cost synergies and we remain on track to deliver $40 million in annual run rate savings beginning in Q3 of this year. 
When I look back on everything we accomplished in the quarter, I continue to be proud of and inspired by the team's tremendous efforts and resiliency. The team was tested, rose above the challenges and delivered. We believe our execution during the quarter is even more impressive when considering the magnitude of circumstances. In addition to supporting our employees through a terrible tragedy, we achieved above-market order growth, recovered production capability faster than planned and completed the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Once again, we thank each and every member of the Keysight worldwide team for their commitment and diligence. 
Moving to our markets. We continue to see increased investments in emerging technologies and overall healthy dynamics. Our strategic areas of focus, including our first-to-market position in leading edge technologies and our solutions centric portfolio are helping fuel our momentum resulting in above-market growth as customers increase their development activities and investments. 
The first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth and second consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. Order demand was broad-based and balanced across our markets, geographies and channels. We saw particularly strong order growth in our commercial communications end market with orders reaching the highest level since forming Keysight. Overall, we are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions in key segments of the market that are undergoing technology transformations such as 5G, next-generation WiFi, electronic warfare and high-value automotive. 
In 5G, we are seeing growing R&D investment across networks, chipsets and devices. Winning in 5G is a cornerstone to our strategy to transform Keysight for growth. With targeted investments, early partnerships with key industry innovators around the globe and groundbreaking first-to-market solutions, we have established a strong leadership position in 5G. Our 5G performance in the quarter was exceptional with R&D Communications orders growing to a new record. In December, we brought together key industry players to advance 5G innovation and demonstrate our 5G new radio network emulation software within days of publication of the first 5G new radio specifications. We continue to further advance our 5G solutions with the goal of enabling industry first innovation. At Mobile World Congress this week, we are proud to have enabled multiple industry-leading customers to showcase their 5G readiness with Keysight solutions. 
Automotive Electronics and Communications is another exciting area where we are seeing growth as technology advancements transform the market. During the quarter, R&D investment at major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers was robust across a broad set of electronic applications, including wireless connectivity and power solutions. With our continued focus on developing our solutions portfolio for this evolving market, Keysight has achieved double-digit order growth with our automotive and energy solutions for 5 consecutive quarters. 
In the Aerospace & Defense end market, electronic warfare and defending against malicious actors looking to take advantage of security gaps in electronic communications continue to grow in importance. Keysight provides the industry's most advanced electronic warfare and radar testing solutions, and has been a long-standing leader in this market. For the second quarter in a row, Aerospace & Defense orders grew approximately 20%, although versus a soft compare. Over the long term, we remain confident in our outlook and market position in this market. However, in the near term, we expect the timing of U.S. orders to be weighted toward the end of the year given the delayed budget approvals over the past several months. 
Moving beyond our end-markets, software is a key component of our solution centric go-to-market approach and strategy to transform Keysight. Our long history of innovation and leadership gives Keysight critical insight into measurement needs resulting in software that helps customers accelerate innovation and bring their products to market faster. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio, and in the first quarter, orders for our software solutions grew double digits organically. 
Further expanding our software offerings, in January, we unveiled [ Path Wave ] the industry's first software platform that integrates simulation, design and test workflows across the entire product development life cycle from early concept through manufacturing and deployment. This disruptive innovation bridges the gaps between development point that were once discrete and is an important milestone on our multiyear journey to expand our software capabilities and solutions. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our execution and results in the first quarter. We're well aligned with growing market trends where customers are investing in next-generation electronic technologies. And our-first-to-market advantage and solution-centrics model is differentiating Keysight in the marketplace. With our accelerated order growth, expanding backlog and strong operational execution, we are poised to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. We have an exciting line up for you at our Investor Day and look forward to sharing more with you next week on March 6. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Neil."
247017859,552282663,1408213,"Keysight Technologies, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2018",2018-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Keysight Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron discussed, we delivered a very good quarter even as we managed through several events that included accelerating customer demand, recovering from the wildfires and completing the integration of Ixia into Keysigh",1143,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron discussed, we delivered a very good quarter even as we managed through several events that included accelerating customer demand, recovering from the wildfires and completing the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Needless to say, the past 3 months were extremely busy for Keysight. I would like to start today by discussing orders as given the ongoing production recovery, orders are the best indicator of the underlying business strength. 
In Q1, we delivered strong 39% order growth with core orders growing 16%. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth. Ramping capacity to meet this high level of demand can be complicated in and of itself, and is even more challenging when production and shipments are impacted by unforeseen circumstances like the Northern California wildfires as Ron mentioned, we were pleased with our ability to recover faster-than-expected and production capacity is now above pre-fire levels. It is worth noting that we have not had a single customer order cancellation as a result of the fire, and we have grown our backlog by $226 million over the past 2 quarters. We've made solid progress but still have a lot of work to do to increase our shipment levels and clear our growing backlog, which was over $1 billion at quarter-end. 
Moving to revenue. As we discussed last quarter, we expected the disruption from the wildfires to impact the seasonality of revenue and therefore, focus our guidance on the first half of 2018. As predicted, seasonality was difficult to forecast as we finished the quarter with non-GAAP revenue of $856 million, up 18% with a 2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. While Q1 revenue was significantly above our expectations, it was still down 2% year-over-year on a core basis. We expect a significant revenue ramp in Q2 as the production recovery continues. 
Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported gross margin of 60.1% and operating expenses of $383 million, resulting in operating margin of 15.4%. We reported net income of $97 million and $0.51 in earnings per share, which was $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 189 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. CSG includes 2 primary end markets: Commercial Communications and the aerospace/defense and government. In the Communications end market, orders grew at a strong double-digit rate as the underlying business remains strong. While, in contrast  revenue of $245 million was down 4% year-over-year as we work to reramp production. Order growth was driven by 5G R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem and early investment in next-generation 400G and PAM-4 network test. As Ron mentioned, aerospace/defense and government orders grew approximately 20%, however, this end market generated revenue $175 million in Q1 compared with $180 million in the same quarter last year. Total CSG revenue for the quarter was $420 million with 60.9% gross margin and 14% operating margin. 
Our Electronic, Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first quarter revenue of $203 million, up 6% from last year. Growth was led by automotive and energy and semiconductor measurement solutions, offset by a slight decline in general electronic measurement. EISG reported gross margin of 59% and operating margin of 18.5%. 
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, generated revenue of $127 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 14.5%. Gross margin in this business was unfavorably impacted by a one-time inventory clean up tied to the ERP integration and cut over. ISG revenue was above our expectations for the quarter as they saw an increase in shipments for their high-speed 400G Ethernet test solutions and overall, support renewals reached a new record. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG revenue, grew 6% year-over-year to reach $106 million. Revenue growth for SSG was driven by an increase in sales of remarketed solutions and calibration with overall regional strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific. SSG reported gross margin of 40.3% and operating margin of 15.6%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $980 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated $171 million in cash flow from operations. Our operational cash flows were strengthened by significant timing related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery, which we expect to balance out during the remainder of the first half. In Q1, we invested $24 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $147 million, or 18% of revenue, which was atypical for the first quarter and again, will even out over the half. 
Before we move to guidance, I will provide an overview of the impact of U.S. tax reform on our business. We expect the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and shift to a modified territorial tax system to lower our overall tax rate and provide much greater access to our global cash generation. While some provisions of the new legislation are subject to interpretation, which may change over the coming months and impact our initial estimates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate will drop 200 basis points to 15% beginning this quarter. The new U.S. tax law includes a deemed repatriation on existing offshore cash balances and historic foreign earnings. We currently estimate that this provision will result in Keysight paying cash taxes totaling $95 million over an 8-year period, while providing a one-time U.S. cash influx of greater than $500 million. We are currently exploring different strategies to best optimize our balance sheet, and we are committed to acting in the best interest of our shareholders and maximizing shareholder value over the long term. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Balancing our strong order growth, the current market dynamics, our better-than-expected Q1 results and the continued recovery from the wildfires, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. We now expect first half revenue in the range of $1,805,000,000 to $1,835,000,000, and first half earnings per share in the range of $1.27 to $1.37. At the midpoint, our first half guidance represents 4% core revenue growth, a greater than 40% year-over-year core operating margin incremental and 10% EPS growth. The midpoint of our first half guidance implies Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $964 million and second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. Building on our positive momentum, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the first half and as result of our strong backlog position, we are now expecting full year core revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

None of our customer has canceled any orders that they had on the books with us. And what we've seen primarily is a rush to be first in 5G by our customers. And that has driven them to want to purchase more of our equipment and purchase more of our equipment sooner. Now some of the players in R&D have placed very sizable orders in order to use that equipment throughout the year. But there wasn't any mention on -- any mention at all of fires for any reason for the order momentum. And we saw that across a broad, broad spectrum of businesses, regions and channels. As was mentioned earlier, we not only saw the fantastic results with regards to 5G in commercial communications, we also saw double-digit software growth, we saw services growth that was in the high-single digits. We saw automotive growth, which was another double-digit growth quarter. So the momentum is very, very abroad. It's across multiple regions around the world. It's across different businesses, and it's also across both of our channels, our direct channel and our indirect channel. I think that our strategy from 4 years ago to focus on being first in the market and to invest our R&D dollars and really utilize our talent and expertise and work on standards committees and be their first is paying off. And we're seeing it. And if you look at our results versus the competition, we're very pleased with how we're doing."

But now that we are in control of our own destiny, we're a focused measurement company, we have been doing this since day 1, and we're seeing great results. Another example is, we needed to go ahead and to pull together solutions, and we realized where we had some gaps. So we went out and acquired Anite, which has a lot of a softer expertise in the protocol area. And we have come up with solutions for 5G using products or technology that was developed at classic Keysight at Anite on the software levels, and then AT4 wireless also over in Spain.

Clearly, the industry acceleration of 5G was on broad display here at Mobile World Congress. Multiple operators declaring accelerated plans, really creates a pool in the ecosystem something that we predicted a little bit ago, and we have been continuing to invest with a platform approach that scales for the broad ecosystem. And I know you referenced some press releases, but this goes beyond press releases. Our platform and solutions has enabled many industry first. So if you were at the Qualcomm booth, for example, you would have seen high-frequency 28 gigahertz demonstration with a Qualcomm X50 modem. If you were on the Intel booth, on display was our solution that helps showcase a 4K video demonstration amongst others. And if you were at the China Mobile booth, you would have seen our newest acquisition, [indiscernible] solution on display for 5G. So these are couple examples of the scale, which our solutions are being adopted and we view this acceleration trend as a positive driver and most evidenced by the fact that we have a strong order performance in our commercial communications segment in the most recent quarter.

So in the short term, we all know that we're waiting for the U.S. defense budget to be signed later this month, and when that does occur, if it does, we should see some orders begin to flow, probably toward the latter part of our fiscal year just like we did last year. Long term, we have a very good position as we continue to see investments being made in modernizing the technology from electronic warfare to radar, and we're in a very good position to continue to capture that business.

So first, as it relates to ISG, you'll notice that the gross margin in that business had been running around 77%, and they dipped about 1.5 this quarter and it's roughly $100 million a quarter business, a little bit more than that. So that size, it was less than $2 million with the size of the inventory clean up and again, one-time related to the ERP migration that we did. On the EISG side, the gross margin change is really about mix, right? They sell a wide range of products in that business, and we see mix shift. I think one of the bigger changes there. While our semi business remained relatively strong, we really saw 2 main products into semiconductor, first is [indiscernible] is a little bit on the higher-margin side and then we saw some laser positioning systems, so still good margins but not quite up to parametric test levels, and so we saw that mix -- that semi mix was a little bit put some downward pressure on margins in EISG."

And as we think about your revenue growth that you provided for the year, Neil, 5% to 7%, and we think about double-digit or the trends the last 2 quarters, accelerating order trends overall. Can you help us understand that I guess, the disconnect between the order growth rate revenue, are you inferring that future order growth rate is going to decelerate below that 5% to 7% growth rate? Was there a leg effect because you have more software content, you already talked about the military orders having kind of longer duration and I believe that your 5G orders are tied more to long-term R&D relationships."

So as you start to think about hitting the 5% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and that's -- our first half guide implied 4% core revenue growth, so we're definitely seeing accelerating revenue growth into the second half. But as you noted, we are seeing lengthening of our order to revenue conversion cycle. If you look on our balance sheet, you'll see increasing deferred revenue balance as we have increasing both in the software and services space, time -- revenue -- or excuse me, orders that have time-based revenue recognition. The solution sale tends to have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle than the typical product sale. And as you mentioned within aerospace defense as we sell systems and there are installation and customer signoff requirements associated with those sales, that can also lengthen that period of time. So as we look at the course of the second half, we're definitely seeing a production -- strong production ramp and a strong revenue ramp as we move from Q1 to Q2. As you go to the back half of the year, certainly, the typical seasonality in this business is that you would see Q4 revenue being our strongest quarter of the year with Q3 being a relatively weaker point. At the high level, we think that, that basic seasonality probably still continues, but it's probably muted a bit because of the strong backlog position, the production recovery that we're having. So we still see Q4 above Q3. But may be with a slightly less of an increase given the strong backlog position that remains."

Obviously, we've had our revenues and shipments are a bit more volatile here in the first half than you typically expect given what's going on with production. But as I noted in the guide, the guidance that you provided for the half does deliver 4% core growth, and it delivers a core incremental that is above 40%, which is our promise incremental on core growth. So as you think about modeling margins for the second half, I would anchor on that. We talked about second half core growth in the 5% to 7% range for the full year. So obviously, off of what, 4% in the first half, we'll be growing it better than that in the second half, and focus on meeting that 40% incremental. We also, from a margin perspective, in the second half, see significant improvement from the Ixia cost synergies. Of some that are in their own right now, but it was really the integration into the ERP that is the big triggering mechanism to allow us to start taking cost out of Ixia and so we'll be doing a lot of that work this quarter such that by Q3, we're in a $10 million per quarter run rate, or $40 million annually, for our Ixia synergies."

We delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding our guidance and we're pleased with our performance in growing leadership position in the market. I'll focus my formal",1230,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding our guidance and we're pleased with our performance in growing leadership position in the market. 
I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. 
First, 2018 is off to a great start, and we delivered a strong quarter across the board. Our better-than-expected results this quarter were driven by robust order growth as well as the strength of our execution. 
Second, customers are increasing their R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we have continued to build momentum across multiple end markets, contributing to 4 consecutive quarters of accelerating order growth. 
And third, Keysight's transformation strategy is delivering results. With our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. Additionally, our order growth and backlog expansion over the past several quarters has established a strong foundation to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. 
Let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.51 per share, which was $0.15 above the midpoint of our guidance and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. 
We delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 39% in total, or 16% on a core basis, to reach a new first quarter record. Q1 revenue increased by 18% to reach $856 million, which was also above our guidance. 
Our better-than-expected results were driven by our strong order growth and execution, including our ability to recover from the Northern California wildfires faster than expected. With the team's diligence, focus and hard work, our Santa Rosa production capacity is running above pre-fire levels. We still have work to do in order to fully recover, but bringing production back to pre-fire levels at this site was essential, especially as customer demand for our solutions continue to grow. 
At the same time we were working to recover from the wildfires in Santa Rosa, we achieved another major operational milestone in the quarter by completing the integration of Ixia's people, systems and processes. This was a significant undertaking, and now we are able to book, build, ship and invoice Ixia sales on Keysight's ERP. We completed this integration in 9 months, once again, through the strong execution of our team. This milestone is a key enabler in realizing the committed Ixia cost synergies, and we remain on track to deliver $40 million in annual run rate savings beginning in Q3 of this year. 
When I look back on everything we accomplished in the quarter, I continue to be proud of and inspired by the team's tremendous efforts and resiliency. The team was tested, rose above the challenges, and delivered. We believe our execution during the quarter is even more impressive when considering the magnitude of the circumstances. In addition to supporting our employees through a terrible tragedy, we achieved above-market order growth, recovered production capability faster than planned and completed the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Once again, we thank each and every member of the Keysight worldwide team for their commitment and diligence. 
Moving to our markets. We continue to see increased investments in emerging technologies and overall healthy dynamics. Our strategic areas of focus, including our first-to-market position in leading-edge technologies and our solutions-centric portfolio are helping fuel our momentum, resulting in above-market growth as customers increase their development activities and investments. 
The first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth and second consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. Order demand was broad-based and balanced across our markets, geographies and channels. We saw a particularly strong order growth in our commercial communications end market with orders reaching the highest level since forming Keysight. Overall, we are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions in key segments of the market that are undergoing technology transformations such as 5G, next-generation WiFi, electronic warfare and high-value automotive. 
In 5G, we are seeing growing R&D investment across networks, chipsets and devices. Winning in 5G is a cornerstone to our strategy to transform Keysight for growth. With targeted investments, early partnerships with key industry innovators around the globe and groundbreaking first-to-market solutions, we have established a strong leadership position in 5G. Our 5G performance in the quarter was exceptional with R&D Communications orders growing to a new record. In December, we brought together key industry players to advance 5G innovation and demonstrate our 5G new radio network emulation software within days of publication of the first 5G new radio specifications. We continue to further advance our 5G solutions with the goal of enabling industry-first innovation. At Mobile World Congress this week, we are proud to have enabled multiple industry-leading customers to showcase their 5G readiness with Keysight solutions. 
automotive electronics and communications is another exciting area where we are seeing growth as technology advancements transform the market. During the quarter, R&D investment at major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers was robust across a broad set of electronic applications, including wireless connectivity and power solutions. With our continued focus on developing our solutions portfolio for this evolving market, Keysight has achieved double-digit order growth with our automotive and energy solutions for 5 consecutive quarters. 
In the aerospace and defense end market, electronic warfare and defending against malicious actors looking to take advantage of security gaps in electronic communications continue to grow in importance. Keysight provides the industry's most advanced electronic warfare and radar testing solutions, and has been a long-standing leader in this market. For the second quarter in a row, aerospace and defense orders grew approximately 20%, although versus a soft compare. Over the long term, we remain confident in our outlook and market position in this market. However, in the near term, we expect the timing of U.S. orders to be weighted toward the end of the year given the delayed budget approvals over the past several months. 
Moving beyond our end-markets, software is a key component of our solution-centric go-to-market approach and strategy to transform Keysight. Our long history of innovation and leadership gives Keysight critical insight into measurement needs resulting in software that helps customers accelerate innovation and bring their products to market faster. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio, and in the first quarter, orders for our software solutions grew double digits organically. 
Further expanding our software offerings, in January, we unveiled PathWave the industry's first software platform that integrates simulation, design and test workflows across the entire product development life cycle from early concept through manufacturing and deployment. This disruptive innovation bridges the gaps between development points that were once discrete and is an important milestone on our multiyear journey to expand our software capabilities and solutions. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our execution and results in the first quarter. We are well-aligned with growing market trends where customers are investing in next-generation electronic technologies. And our first-to-market advantage and solution-centric model is differentiating Keysight in the marketplace. With our accelerating order growth, expanding backlog and strong operational execution, we are poised to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. We have an exciting line up for you at our Investor Day and look forward to sharing more with you next week on March 6. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Neil."
247017859,552282663,1408446,"Keysight Technologies, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2018",2018-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Keysight Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron discussed, we delivered a very good quarter even as we managed through several events that included accelerating customer demand, recovering from the wildfires and completing the integration of Ixia into Keysigh",1149,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron discussed, we delivered a very good quarter even as we managed through several events that included accelerating customer demand, recovering from the wildfires and completing the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Needless to say, the past 3 months were extremely busy for Keysight. I would like to start today by discussing orders, as given the ongoing production recovery, orders are the best indicator of the underlying business strength. 
In Q1, we delivered strong 39% order growth with core orders growing 16%. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth. Ramping capacity to meet this high level of demand can be complicated in and of itself, and is even more challenging when production and shipments are impacted by unforeseen circumstances like the Northern California wildfires. As Ron mentioned, we were pleased with our ability to recover faster than expected and production capacity is now above pre-fire levels. It is worth noting that we have not had a single customer order cancellation as a result of the fire, and we have grown our backlog by $226 million over the past 2 quarters. We have made solid progress but still have a lot of work to do to increase our shipment levels and clear our growing backlog, which was over $1 billion at quarter-end. 
Moving to revenue. As we discussed last quarter, we expected the disruption from the wildfires to impact the seasonality of revenue and therefore, focused our guidance on the first half of 2018. As predicted, seasonality was difficult to forecast as we finished the quarter with non-GAAP revenue of $856 million, up 18%, with a 2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. While Q1 revenue was significantly above our expectations, it was still down 2% year-over-year on a core basis. We expect a significant revenue ramp in Q2 as the production recovery continues. 
Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported gross margin of 60.1% and operating expenses of $383 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.4%. We reported net income of $97 million and $0.51 in earnings per share, which was $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 189 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. CSG includes 2 primary end markets: Commercial Communications and the aerospace defense in government. In the Communications end market, orders grew at a strong double-digit rate as the underlying business remains strong. While in contrast  revenue of $245 million was down 4% year-over-year as we worked to reramp production. Order growth was driven by 5G R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem and early investment in next-generation 400G and PAM-4 network test. 
As Ron mentioned, aerospace defense in government orders grew approximately 20%, however, this end market generated revenue of $175 million in Q1 compared with $180 million in the same quarter last year. Total CSG revenue for the quarter was $420 million with 60.9% gross margin and 14% operating margin. 
Our Electronic, Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first quarter revenue of $203 million, up 6% from last year. Growth was led by automotive and energy and semiconductor measurement solutions, offset by a slight decline in general electronics measurement. EISG reported gross margin of 59% and operating margin of 18.5%. 
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, generated revenue of $127 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 14.5%. Gross margin in this business was unfavorably impacted by a one-time inventory clean up tied to the ERP integration and cutover. ISG revenue was above our expectations for the quarter as they saw an increase in shipments for their high-speed 400G Ethernet test solutions, and overall, support renewals reached a new record. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG revenue, grew 6% year-over-year to reach $106 million. Revenue growth for SSG was driven by an increase in sales of remarketed solutions and calibration with overall regional strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific. SSG reported gross margin of 40.3% and operating margin of 15.6%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $980 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated $171 million in cash flow from operations. Our operational cash flows were strengthened by significant timing related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery, which we expect to balance out during the remainder of the first half. In Q1, we invested $24 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $147 million, or 18% of revenue, which was atypical for the first quarter, and again, will even out over the half. 
Before we move to guidance, I will provide an overview of the impact of U.S. tax reform on our business. We expect to lower U.S. corporate tax rate and shift to a modified territorial tax system to lower our overall tax rate and provide much greater access to our global cash generation. While some provisions of the new legislation are subject to interpretation, which may change over the coming months and impact our initial estimates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate will drop 200 basis points to 15% beginning this quarter. The new U.S. tax law includes a deemed repatriation on existing offshore cash balances and historic foreign earnings. We currently estimate that this provision will result in Keysight paying cash taxes totaling $95 million over an 8-year period, while providing a one-time U.S. cash influx of greater than $500 million. We are currently exploring different strategies to best optimize our balance sheet, and we are committed to acting in the best interest of our shareholders and maximizing shareholder value over the long term. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Balancing our strong order growth, the current market dynamics, our better-than-expected Q1 results and the continued recovery from the wildfires, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. We now expect first half revenue in the range of $1,805,000,000 to $1,835,000,000, and first half earnings per share in the range of $1.27 to $1.37. At the midpoint, our first half guidance represents 4% core revenue growth, a greater than 40% year-over-year core operating margin incremental and 10% EPS growth. The midpoint of our first half guidance implies Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $964 million and second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. Building on our positive momentum, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the first half, and as result of our strong backlog position, we are now expecting full year core revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

None of our customers canceled any orders that they had on the books with us. And what we've seen primarily is a rush to be first in 5G by our customers. And that has driven them to want to purchase more of our equipment and purchase more of our equipment sooner. Now some of the players in R&D have placed very sizable orders in order to use that equipment throughout the year. But there wasn't any mention on -- any mention at all of the fires for any reason for the order momentum. And we saw that across the broad, broad spectrum of businesses, regions and channels. As was mentioned earlier, we not only saw the fantastic results with regards to 5G in commercial communications, we also saw double-digit software growth, we saw services growth that was in the high-single digits. We saw automotive growth, which was another double-digit growth quarter. So the momentum is very, very broad. It's across multiple regions around the world. It's across different businesses. And it's also across both of our channels, our direct channel and our indirect channel. I think that our strategy from 4 years ago to focus on being first in the market and to invest our R&D dollars and really utilize our talent and expertise and work on standards committees and be there first is paying off. And we're seeing it. And if you look at our results versus the competition, we're very pleased with how we're doing."

But now that we are in control of our own destiny, we're a focused measurement company, we have been doing this since day 1, and we're seeing great results. Another example is we needed to go ahead and to pull together solutions, and we realized where we had some gaps. So we went out and acquired Anite, which has a lot of a software expertise in the protocol area. And we have come up with solutions for 5G using products or technology that was developed at classic Keysight at Anite on the software levels, and then AT4 wireless also over in Spain.

Clearly, the industry acceleration of 5G was on broad display here at Mobile World Congress. Multiple operators declaring accelerated plans really creates a pull in the ecosystem, something that we predicted a little bit ago, and we've been continuing to invest with a platform approach that scales for the broad ecosystem. And I know you referenced some press releases, but this goes beyond press releases. Our platform and solutions has enabled many industry firsts. So if you were at the Qualcomm booth, for example, you would've seen high-frequency 28 gigahertz demonstration with a Qualcomm X50 modem. If you were at the Intel booth, on display was our solution that helps showcase a 4K video demonstration amongst others. And if you were at the China Mobile booth, you would've seen our newest acquisition, Ixia  Solution, on display for 5G. So these are powerful examples of the scale at which our solutions are being adopted and we view this acceleration trend as a positive driver, most evidenced by the fact that we had a strong order performance in our commercial communications segment in the most recent quarter.

As Ron and Neil mentioned in their prepared comments, we saw strong rebound in aerospace defense orders in Q1, following a very strong Q4. So we're very pleased with both of those quarters at nearly 20%. We see strong demand from our customers in the U.S. government and contractors, but we also see continuing strong growth and demand from our international business. And for many years, this has been a fairly stable business for us, and this diversity of opportunities coming to Keysight is one of the things that drives that. So in the short term, we all know that we're waiting for the U.S. defense budget to be signed later this month, and when that does occur, if it does, we should see some orders begin to flow, probably toward the latter part of our fiscal year just like we did last year. Long term, we have a very good position as we continue to see investments being made in modernizing the technology from electronic warfare to radar, and we're in a very good position to continue to capture that business. And then I just want to underscore the automotive initiative. 5 quarters in a row of double-digit growth. The R&D spend is continuing to expand. And we have really started making some traction in expanding our presence with the Tier 1 OEMs as a result of the Scienlab acquisition, the company in Bochum, Germany that we're using to help us get into the battery test solutions for the Tier 1 OEMs as well."

So that size, it was less than $2 million with the size of the inventory cleanup and, again, one-time related to the ERP migration that we did. On the EISG side, the gross margin change is really about mix, right? They sell a wide range of products in that business, and we see a mix shift. I think one of the bigger changes there is while our semi business remained relatively strong, we really saw 2 main products into semiconductor. First is parametric test. This tends to be a little bit on the higher-margin side. And then we saw some laser positioning systems. They're still good margins, but not quite up to parametric test levels. And so we saw that mix -- that semi mix was a little bit -- put some downward pressure on margins in the EISG."

Are you inferring that future order growth rate is going to decelerate below that 5% to 7% growth rate? Was there a lag effect because you have more software content.

So as you start to think about hitting the 5% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and that's -- our first half guide implied 4% core revenue growth, so we're definitely seeing accelerating revenue growth into the second half. But as you noted, we are seeing a lengthening of our order to revenue conversion cycle. If you look on our balance sheet, you'll see increasing deferred revenue balance as we have increasing both in the software and services space, time -- revenue -- or excuse me, orders that have time-based revenue recognition. The solution sale tends to have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle than the typical product sale. And as you mentioned within aerospace defense, as we sell systems and there are installation and customer signoff requirements associated with those sales, that can also lengthen that period of time. So as we look at the course of the second half, we're definitely seeing a production -- strong production ramp and a strong revenue ramp as we move from Q1 to Q2. As you go to the back half of the year, certainly, the typical seasonality in this business is that you would see Q4 revenue being our strongest quarter of the year with Q3 being a relatively weaker point. At the high level, we think that, that basic seasonality probably still continues, but it's probably muted a bit because of the strong backlog position, the production recovery that we're having. So we still see Q4 above Q3, but maybe with a slightly less of an increase given the strong backlog position that remains."

So as we look at the Ixia business, there's obviously more software there. Some of it's still classified as being part of the instrument, but there are application packs that, effectively, are added to their instrumentation. And we've just unveiled a brand-new software platform that encompasses the whole product development, and all the way to operations life cycle. And again, this is a platform we'll be building on for years. It's more all-encompassing than anything that exists in the industry. It will also be able to take plug-ins from other people's software in certain areas. But whether or not you are going ahead and you are doing research and development, or whether or not you're doing operations, you'll be able to tie those results together to save time. That will help our software portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, our software grew double digits, and we are continuing to accelerate that. Services is a relatively small part of our business. As you know, it's less than 15%. But we still see a great opportunity for that. But again, we're not going to waste cash and overpay for acquisitions. We'll take our time and build it ourselves, but that will also help us as we move to recurring revenue. But the move to R&D and the move to software will continue to help us on the gross margin line."

Our strategy of differentiation is based around providing solutions. We not only provide hardware, we have a fab that goes ahead creates high-performance components and makes high-performance measurements to provide great, let's just say, measurement integrity. But we also provide software. We are the largest software provider. But with our new platform that we'll be expanding over years, we're going to be continuing to take that further. But the third part of our overall solution is our people. We have the most technical depth, not only because of our size, but because of the numbers of years we've been in the core part of our market, when you look at the wireless market, that's infiltrating everything, from automotive to everything that we see in our Communications group. That's an area where customers come to us for solutions, whether it's helping with standards or whether it's devising solutions or consulting before the sale, during the sale and after the sale. So our big differentiation is providing solutions in our key markets. We're not going to overpay for an acquisition and get an acquisition, or do an acquisition that won't return above the cost of capital. And we're going to do everything we can to further our differentiation in total solutions. And when we provide those solutions, we're helping our customers really get to market more quickly, and beat their competition and be very, very effective in the marketplace. So we have seen -- we have a robust M&A process, and we look at that. Right now, our priority is on making sure we are successful with Ixia. We have Anite. We've integrated that, and we're winning a lot of R&D 5G business to do the components and the parts of the solutions from Anite as well as from the rest of the company. And in Ixia, we just completed the integration into our systems in 9 months. And we've expanded our SAM, and we're going much further. We've also done other acquisitions, which also help us, such as we said our stated goal was to win in automotive, so we made an acquisition of Scienlab, and we're very, very pleased with that. That was the firm in Germany that was mentioned earlier today on the call. But we will do small M&As, but right now, we are focused on making the investments that we made pay off even greater than we thought, and delevering."

Obviously, we've had -- our revenues and shipments are a bit more volatile here in the first half than you would typically expect given what's going on with production. But as I noted in the guide, the guidance that we provided for the half does deliver 4% core growth, and it delivers a core incremental that is above 40%, which is our promise incremental on core growth. So as you think about modeling margins for the second half, I would anchor on that. We've talked about second half core growth in the 5% to 7% range for the full year. So obviously, off of, what, 4% in the first half. We'll be growing it better than that in the second half, and focused on meeting that 40% incremental. We also, from a margin perspective, will, in the second half, see significant improvement from the Ixia cost synergies. So we have some that are in the run rate now, but it was really this integration into the ERP that is the big triggering mechanism to allow us to start taking cost out of Ixia, and so we'll be doing a lot of that work this quarter such that by Q3, we're at a $10 million per quarter run rate, or $40 million annually, for our Ixia synergies."

We delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding our guidance and we're pleased with our performance and growing leadership position in the market. I'll focus my forma",1230,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding our guidance and we're pleased with our performance and growing leadership position in the market. 
I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. 
First, 2018 is off to a great start, and we delivered a strong quarter across the board. Our better-than-expected results this quarter were driven by robust order growth as well as the strength of our execution. 
Second, customers are increasing their R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we have continued to build momentum across multiple end markets, contributing to 4 consecutive quarters of accelerating order growth. 
And third, Keysight's transformation strategy is delivering results. With our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. Additionally, our order growth and backlog expansion over the past several quarters has established a strong foundation to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. 
Let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.51 per share, which was $0.15 above the midpoint of our guidance and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. 
We delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 39% in total, or 16% on a core basis, to reach a new first quarter record. Q1 revenue increased by 18% to reach $856 million, which was also above our guidance. 
Our better-than-expected results were driven by our strong order growth and execution, including our ability to recover from the Northern California wildfires faster than expected. With the team's diligence, focus and hard work, our Santa Rosa production capacity is running above pre-fire levels. We still have work to do in order to fully recover, but bringing production back to pre-fire levels at this site was essential, especially as customer demand for our solutions continue to grow. 
At the same time we were working to recover from the wildfires in Santa Rosa, we achieved another major operational milestone in the quarter by completing the integration of Ixia's people, systems and processes. This was a significant undertaking, and now we are able to book, build, ship and invoice Ixia sales on Keysight's ERP. We completed this integration in 9 months, once again, through the strong execution of our team. This milestone is a key enabler in realizing the committed Ixia cost synergies, and we remain on track to deliver $40 million in annual run rate savings beginning in Q3 of this year. 
When I look back on everything we accomplished in the quarter, I continue to be proud of and inspired by the team's tremendous efforts and resiliency. The team was tested, rose above the challenges, and delivered. We believe our execution during the quarter is even more impressive when considering the magnitude of the circumstances. In addition to supporting our employees through a terrible tragedy, we achieved above-market order growth, recovered production capability faster than planned and completed the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Once again, we thank each and every member of the Keysight worldwide team for their commitment and diligence. 
Moving to our markets. We continue to see increased investments in emerging technologies and overall healthy dynamics. Our strategic areas of focus, including our first-to-market position in leading-edge technologies and our solutions-centric portfolio are helping fuel our momentum, resulting in above-market growth as customers increase their development activities and investments. 
The first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth and second consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. Order demand was broad-based and balanced across our markets, geographies and channels. We saw a particularly strong order growth in our commercial communications end market with orders reaching the highest level since forming Keysight. Overall, we are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions in key segments of the market that are undergoing technology transformations such as 5G, next-generation WiFi, electronic warfare and high-value automotive. 
In 5G, we are seeing growing R&D investment across networks, chipsets and devices. Winning in 5G is a cornerstone to our strategy to transform Keysight for growth. With targeted investments, early partnerships with key industry innovators around the globe and groundbreaking first-to-market solutions, we have established a strong leadership position in 5G. Our 5G performance in the quarter was exceptional with R&D Communications orders growing to a new record. In December, we brought together key industry players to advance 5G innovation and demonstrate our 5G new radio network emulation software within days of publication of the first 5G new radio specifications. We continue to further advance our 5G solutions with the goal of enabling industry-first innovation. At Mobile World Congress this week, we are proud to have enabled multiple industry-leading customers to showcase their 5G readiness with Keysight solutions. 
Automotive electronics and communications is another exciting area where we are seeing growth as technology advancements transform the market. During the quarter, R&D investment at major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers was robust across a broad set of electronic applications, including wireless connectivity and power solutions. With our continued focus on developing our solutions portfolio for this evolving market, Keysight has achieved double-digit order growth with our automotive and energy solutions for 5 consecutive quarters. 
In the aerospace and defense end market, electronic warfare and defending against malicious actors looking to take advantage of security gaps in electronic communications continue to grow in importance. Keysight provides the industry's most advanced electronic warfare and radar testing solutions, and has been a long-standing leader in this market. For the second quarter in a row, aerospace and defense orders grew approximately 20%, although versus a soft compare. Over the long term, we remain confident in our outlook and market position in this market. However, in the near term, we expect the timing of U.S. orders to be weighted toward the end of the year given the delayed budget approvals over the past several months. 
Moving beyond our end-markets, software is a key component of our solution-centric go-to-market approach and strategy to transform Keysight. Our long history of innovation and leadership gives Keysight critical insight into measurement needs resulting in software that helps customers accelerate innovation and bring their products to market faster. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio, and in the first quarter, orders for our software solutions grew double digits organically. 
Further expanding our software offerings, in January, we unveiled PathWave the industry's first software platform that integrates simulation, design and test workflows across the entire product development life cycle from early concept through manufacturing and deployment. This disruptive innovation bridges the gaps between development points that were once discrete and is an important milestone on our multiyear journey to expand our software capabilities and solutions. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our execution and results in the first quarter. We are well-aligned with growing market trends where customers are investing in next-generation electronic technologies. And our first-to-market advantage and solution-centric model is differentiating Keysight in the marketplace. With our accelerating order growth, expanding backlog and strong operational execution, we are poised to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. We have an exciting line up for you at our Investor Day and look forward to sharing more with you next week on March 6. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Neil."
247017859,552282663,1409623,"Keysight Technologies, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2018",2018-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Keysight Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron discussed, we delivered a very good quarter even as we managed through several events that included accelerating customer demand, recovering from the wildfires and completing the integration of Ixia into Keysigh",1148,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron discussed, we delivered a very good quarter even as we managed through several events that included accelerating customer demand, recovering from the wildfires and completing the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Needless to say, the past 3 months were extremely busy for Keysight. I would like to start today by discussing orders, as given the ongoing production recovery, orders are the best indicator of the underlying business strength. 
In Q1, we delivered strong 39% order growth with core orders growing 16%. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth. Ramping capacity to meet this high level of demand can be complicated in and of itself, and is even more challenging when production and shipments are impacted by unforeseen circumstances like the Northern California wildfires. As Ron mentioned, we were pleased with our ability to recover faster than expected and production capacity is now above pre-fire levels. It is worth noting that we have not had a single customer order cancellation as a result of the fire, and we have grown our backlog by $226 million over the past 2 quarters. We have made solid progress but still have a lot of work to do to increase our shipment levels and clear our growing backlog, which was over $1 billion at quarter-end. 
Moving to revenue. As we discussed last quarter, we expected the disruption from the wildfires to impact the seasonality of revenue and therefore, focused our guidance on the first half of 2018. As predicted, seasonality was difficult to forecast as we finished the quarter with non-GAAP revenue of $856 million, up 18%, with a 2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. While Q1 revenue was significantly above our expectations, it was still down 2% year-over-year on a core basis. We expect a significant revenue ramp in Q2 as the production recovery continues. 
Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported gross margin of 60.1% and operating expenses of $383 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.4%. We reported net income of $97 million and $0.51 in earnings per share, which was $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 189 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. CSG includes 2 primary end markets: Commercial Communications and Aerospace, Defense, and Government. In the Communications end market, orders grew at a strong double-digit rate as the underlying business remains strong. While in contrast  revenue of $245 million was down 4% year-over-year as we worked to reramp production. Order growth was driven by 5G R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem and early investment in next-generation 400G and PAM-4 network test. 
As Ron mentioned, Aerospace, Defense, and Government orders grew approximately 20%, however, this end market generated revenue of $175 million in Q1 compared with $180 million in the same quarter last year. Total CSG revenue for the quarter was $420 million with 60.9% gross margin and 14% operating margin. 
Our Electronic, Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first quarter revenue of $203 million, up 6% from last year. Growth was led by automotive and energy and semiconductor measurement solutions, offset by a slight decline in general electronics measurement. EISG reported gross margin of 59% and operating margin of 18.5%. 
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, generated revenue of $127 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 14.5%. Gross margin in this business was unfavorably impacted by a one-time inventory clean up tied to the ERP integration and cutover. ISG revenue was above our expectations for the quarter as they saw an increase in shipments for their high-speed 400G Ethernet test solutions, and overall, support renewals reached a new record. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG revenue, grew 6% year-over-year to reach $106 million. Revenue growth for SSG was driven by an increase in sales of remarketed solutions and calibration with overall regional strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific. SSG reported gross margin of 40.3% and operating margin of 15.6%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $980 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated $171 million in cash flow from operations. Our operational cash flows were strengthened by significant timing related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery, which we expect to balance out during the remainder of the first half. In Q1, we invested $24 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $147 million, or 18% of revenue, which was atypical for the first quarter, and again, will even out over the half. 
Before we move to guidance, I will provide an overview of the impact of U.S. tax reform on our business. We expect to lower U.S. corporate tax rate and shift to a modified territorial tax system to lower our overall tax rate and provide much greater access to our global cash generation. While some provisions of the new legislation are subject to interpretation, which may change over the coming months and impact our initial estimates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate will drop 200 basis points to 15% beginning this quarter. The new U.S. tax law includes a deemed repatriation on existing offshore cash balances and historic foreign earnings. We currently estimate that this provision will result in Keysight paying cash taxes totaling $95 million over an 8-year period, while providing a one-time U.S. cash influx of greater than $500 million. We are currently exploring different strategies to best optimize our balance sheet, and we are committed to acting in the best interest of our shareholders and maximizing shareholder value over the long term. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Balancing our strong order growth, the current market dynamics, our better-than-expected Q1 results and the continued recovery from the wildfires, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. We now expect first half revenue in the range of $1,805,000,000 to $1,835,000,000, and first half earnings per share in the range of $1.27 to $1.37. At the midpoint, our first half guidance represents 4% core revenue growth, a greater than 40% year-over-year core operating margin incremental and 10% EPS growth. The midpoint of our first half guidance implies Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $964 million and second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. Building on our positive momentum, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the first half, and as result of our strong backlog position, we are now expecting full year core revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

None of our customers canceled any orders that they had on the books with us. And what we've seen primarily is a rush to be first in 5G by our customers. And that has driven them to want to purchase more of our equipment and purchase more of our equipment sooner. Now some of the players in R&D have placed very sizable orders in order to use that equipment throughout the year. But there wasn't any mention on -- any mention at all of the fires for any reason for the order momentum. And we saw that across the broad, broad spectrum of businesses, regions and channels. As was mentioned earlier, we not only saw the fantastic results with regards to 5G in commercial communications, we also saw double-digit software growth, we saw services growth that was in the high-single digits. We saw automotive growth, which was another double-digit growth quarter. So the momentum is very, very broad. It's across multiple regions around the world. It's across different businesses. And it's also across both of our channels, our direct channel and our indirect channel. I think that our strategy from 4 years ago to focus on being first in the market and to invest our R&D dollars and really utilize our talent and expertise and work on standards committees and be there first is paying off. And we're seeing it. And if you look at our results versus the competition, we're very pleased with how we're doing."

I will say though, in 4G, it wasn't our lack of performance or not being able to compete in 4G.

But now that we are in control of our own destiny, we're a focused measurement company, we have been doing this since day 1, and we're seeing great results. Another example is we needed to go ahead and to pull together solutions, and we realized where we had some gaps. So we went out and acquired Anite, which has a lot of a software expertise in the protocol area. And we have come up with solutions for 5G using products or technology that was developed at classic Keysight at Anite on the software levels, and then AT4 wireless also over in Spain.

Clearly, the industry acceleration of 5G was on broad display here at Mobile World Congress. Multiple operators declaring accelerated plans really creates a pull in the ecosystem, something that we predicted a little bit ago, and we've been continuing to invest with a platform approach that scales for the broad ecosystem. And I know you referenced some press releases, but this goes beyond press releases. Our platform and solutions has enabled many industry firsts. So if you were at the Qualcomm booth, for example, you would've seen high-frequency 28 gigahertz demonstration with a Qualcomm X50 modem. If you were at the Intel booth, on display was our solution that helps showcase a 4K video demonstration amongst others. And if you were at the China Mobile booth, you would've seen our newest acquisition, Ixia  Solution, on display for 5G. So these are powerful examples of the scale at which our solutions are being adopted and we view this acceleration trend as a positive driver, most evidenced by the fact that we had a strong order performance in our commercial communications segment in the most recent quarter.

We see strong demand from our customers in the U.S. government and contractors, but we also see continuing strong growth and demand from our international business. And for many years, this has been a fairly stable business for us, and this diversity of opportunities coming to Keysight is one of the things that drives that. So in the short term, we all know that we're waiting for the U.S. defense budget to be signed later this month, and when that does occur, if it does, we should see some orders begin to flow, probably toward the latter part of our fiscal year just like we did last year. Long term, we have a very good position as we continue to see investments being made in modernizing the technology from electronic warfare to radar, and we're in a very good position to continue to capture that business. And then I just want to underscore the automotive initiative. 5 quarters in a row of double-digit growth. The R&D spend is continuing to expand.

On the EISG side, the gross margin change is really about mix, right? They sell a wide range of products in that business, and we see a mix shift. I think one of the bigger changes there is while our semi business remained relatively strong, we really sell 2 main products into semiconductor. First is parametric test. This tends to be a little bit on the higher-margin side. And then we saw some laser positioning systems. They're still good margins, but not quite up to parametric test levels.

So as you start to think about hitting the 5% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and that's -- our first half guide implied 4% core revenue growth, so we're definitely seeing accelerating revenue growth into the second half. But as you noted, we are seeing a lengthening of our order to revenue conversion cycle. If you look on our balance sheet, you'll see increasing deferred revenue balance as we have increasing both in the software and services space, time -- revenue -- or excuse me, orders that have time-based revenue recognition. The solution sale tends to have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle than the typical product sale. And as you mentioned within aerospace defense, as we sell systems and there are installation and customer signoff requirements associated with those sales, that can also lengthen that period of time. So as we look at the course of the second half, we're definitely seeing a production -- strong production ramp and a strong revenue ramp as we move from Q1 to Q2. As you go to the back half of the year, certainly, the typical seasonality in this business is that you would see Q4 revenue being our strongest quarter of the year with Q3 being a relatively weaker point. At the high level, we think that, that basic seasonality probably still continues, but it's probably muted a bit because of the strong backlog position, the production recovery that we're having. So we still see Q4 above Q3, but maybe with a slightly less of an increase given the strong backlog position that remains."

The overall business is performing incredibly well, but the Ixia assets, I think, continued to underperform, whether it's relative to growth targets in the proxy or consensus expectations prior to the acquisitions. So can you help us understand whether the underperformance is all from the 100G slowdown in the core layer 2, 3 test business? And how investors might think about that duration as 4G, you already talked about is growing off of a small base? Or is this also visibility business that's seen slowing growth as well, because we've heard challenges from many of your competitors.

Our customers are having to tool up for 5G. In many cases, it's platforms that have to be upgraded to new equipment, as Ron referenced. And for Keysight, we also have -- are participating in more test insertions in 5G than we've ever done before. The acquisitions of Anite, and most lately, Ixia, give us an additional capability to offer more comprehensive solution to our customers.

We have the most technical depth, not only because of our size, but because of the numbers of years we've been in the core part of our market, when you look at the wireless market, that's infiltrating everything, from automotive to everything that we see in our Communications group. That's an area where customers come to us for solutions, whether it's helping with standards or whether it's devising solutions or consulting before the sale, during the sale and after the sale. So our big differentiation is providing solutions in our key markets. We're not going to overpay for an acquisition and get an acquisition, or do an acquisition that won't return above the cost of capital.

And in Ixia, we just completed the integration into our systems in 9 months. And we've expanded our SAM, and we're going much further.

So as you think about modeling margins for the second half, I would anchor on that. We've talked about second half core growth in the 5% to 7% range for the full year. So obviously, off of, what, 4% in the first half. We'll be growing it better than that in the second half, and focused on meeting that 40% incremental. We also, from a margin perspective, will, in the second half, see significant improvement from the Ixia cost synergies. So we have some that are in the run rate now, but it was really this integration into the ERP that is the big triggering mechanism to allow us to start taking cost out of Ixia, and so we'll be doing a lot of that work this quarter such that by Q3, we're at a $10 million per quarter run rate, or $40 million annually, for our Ixia synergies."

We delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding our guidance and we're pleased with our performance and growing leadership position in the market. I'll focus my forma",1230,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding our guidance and we're pleased with our performance and growing leadership position in the market. 
I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. 
First, 2018 is off to a great start, and we delivered a strong quarter across the board. Our better-than-expected results this quarter were driven by robust order growth as well as the strength of our execution. 
Second, customers are increasing their R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we have continued to build momentum across multiple end markets, contributing to 4 consecutive quarters of accelerating order growth. 
And third, Keysight's transformation strategy is delivering results. With our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. Additionally, our order growth and backlog expansion over the past several quarters has established a strong foundation to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. 
Let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.51 per share, which was $0.15 above the midpoint of our guidance and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. 
We delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 39% in total, or 16% on a core basis, to reach a new first quarter record. Q1 revenue increased by 18% to reach $856 million, which was also above our guidance. 
Our better-than-expected results were driven by our strong order growth and execution, including our ability to recover from the Northern California wildfires faster than expected. With the team's diligence, focus and hard work, our Santa Rosa production capacity is running above pre-fire levels. We still have work to do in order to fully recover, but bringing production back to pre-fire levels at this site was essential, especially as customer demand for our solutions continue to grow. 
At the same time we were working to recover from the wildfires in Santa Rosa, we achieved another major operational milestone in the quarter by completing the integration of Ixia's people, systems and processes. This was a significant undertaking, and now we are able to book, build, ship and invoice Ixia sales on Keysight's ERP. We completed this integration in 9 months, once again, through the strong execution of our team. This milestone is a key enabler in realizing the committed Ixia cost synergies, and we remain on track to deliver $40 million in annual run rate savings beginning in Q3 of this year. 
When I look back on everything we accomplished in the quarter, I continue to be proud of and inspired by the team's tremendous efforts and resiliency. The team was tested, rose above the challenges, and delivered. We believe our execution during the quarter is even more impressive when considering the magnitude of the circumstances. In addition to supporting our employees through a terrible tragedy, we achieved above-market order growth, recovered production capability faster than planned and completed the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Once again, we thank each and every member of the Keysight worldwide team for their commitment and diligence. 
Moving to our markets. We continue to see increased investments in emerging technologies and overall healthy dynamics. Our strategic areas of focus, including our first-to-market position in leading-edge technologies and our solutions-centric portfolio are helping fuel our momentum, resulting in above-market growth as customers increase their development activities and investments. 
The first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth and second consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. Order demand was broad-based and balanced across our markets, geographies and channels. We saw a particularly strong order growth in our commercial communications end market with orders reaching the highest level since forming Keysight. Overall, we are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions in key segments of the market that are undergoing technology transformations such as 5G, next-generation WiFi, electronic warfare and high-value automotive. 
In 5G, we are seeing growing R&D investment across networks, chipsets and devices. Winning in 5G is a cornerstone to our strategy to transform Keysight for growth. With targeted investments, early partnerships with key industry innovators around the globe and groundbreaking first-to-market solutions, we have established a strong leadership position in 5G. Our 5G performance in the quarter was exceptional with R&D Communications orders growing to a new record. In December, we brought together key industry players to advance 5G innovation and demonstrate our 5G new radio network emulation software within days of publication of the first 5G new radio specifications. We continue to further advance our 5G solutions with the goal of enabling industry-first innovation. At Mobile World Congress this week, we are proud to have enabled multiple industry-leading customers to showcase their 5G readiness with Keysight solutions. 
Automotive electronics and communications is another exciting area where we are seeing growth as technology advancements transform the market. During the quarter, R&D investment at major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers was robust across a broad set of electronic applications, including wireless connectivity and power solutions. With our continued focus on developing our solutions portfolio for this evolving market, Keysight has achieved double-digit order growth with our automotive and energy solutions for 5 consecutive quarters. 
In the aerospace and defense end market, electronic warfare and defending against malicious actors looking to take advantage of security gaps in electronic communications continue to grow in importance. Keysight provides the industry's most advanced electronic warfare and radar testing solutions, and has been a long-standing leader in this market. For the second quarter in a row, aerospace and defense orders grew approximately 20%, although versus a soft compare. Over the long term, we remain confident in our outlook and market position in this market. However, in the near term, we expect the timing of U.S. orders to be weighted toward the end of the year given the delayed budget approvals over the past several months. 
Moving beyond our end-markets, software is a key component of our solution-centric go-to-market approach and strategy to transform Keysight. Our long history of innovation and leadership gives Keysight critical insight into measurement needs resulting in software that helps customers accelerate innovation and bring their products to market faster. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio, and in the first quarter, orders for our software solutions grew double digits organically. 
Further expanding our software offerings, in January, we unveiled PathWave the industry's first software platform that integrates simulation, design and test workflows across the entire product development life cycle from early concept through manufacturing and deployment. This disruptive innovation bridges the gaps between development points that were once discrete and is an important milestone on our multiyear journey to expand our software capabilities and solutions. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our execution and results in the first quarter. We are well-aligned with growing market trends where customers are investing in next-generation electronic technologies. And our first-to-market advantage and solution-centric model is differentiating Keysight in the marketplace. With our accelerating order growth, expanding backlog and strong operational execution, we are poised to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. We have an exciting line up for you at our Investor Day and look forward to sharing more with you next week on March 6. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Neil."
247017859,552282663,1409938,"Keysight Technologies, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2018",2018-03-01,"Earnings Calls","Keysight Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron discussed, we delivered a very good quarter even as we managed through several events that included accelerating customer demand, recovering from the wildfires and completing the integration of Ixia into Keysigh",1148,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron discussed, we delivered a very good quarter even as we managed through several events that included accelerating customer demand, recovering from the wildfires and completing the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Needless to say, the past 3 months were extremely busy for Keysight. I would like to start today by discussing orders, as given the ongoing production recovery, orders are the best indicator of the underlying business strength. 
In Q1, we delivered strong 39% order growth with core orders growing 16%. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth. Ramping capacity to meet this high level of demand can be complicated in and of itself, and is even more challenging when production and shipments are impacted by unforeseen circumstances like the Northern California wildfires. As Ron mentioned, we were pleased with our ability to recover faster than expected and production capacity is now above pre-fire levels. It is worth noting that we have not had a single customer order cancellation as a result of the fire, and we have grown our backlog by $226 million over the past 2 quarters. We have made solid progress but still have a lot of work to do to increase our shipment levels and clear our growing backlog, which was over $1 billion at quarter-end. 
Moving to revenue. As we discussed last quarter, we expected the disruption from the wildfires to impact the seasonality of revenue and therefore, focused our guidance on the first half of 2018. As predicted, seasonality was difficult to forecast as we finished the quarter with non-GAAP revenue of $856 million, up 18%, with a 2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. While Q1 revenue was significantly above our expectations, it was still down 2% year-over-year on a core basis. We expect a significant revenue ramp in Q2 as the production recovery continues. 
Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported gross margin of 60.1% and operating expenses of $383 million, resulting in an operating margin of 15.4%. We reported net income of $97 million and $0.51 in earnings per share, which was $0.08 above the high end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 189 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. CSG includes 2 primary end markets: Commercial Communications and Aerospace, Defense, and Government. In the Communications end market, orders grew at a strong double-digit rate as the underlying business remains strong. While in contrast  revenue of $245 million was down 4% year-over-year as we worked to reramp production. Order growth was driven by 5G R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem and early investment in next-generation 400G and PAM-4 network test. 
As Ron mentioned, Aerospace, Defense, and Government orders grew approximately 20%, however, this end market generated revenue of $175 million in Q1 compared with $180 million in the same quarter last year. Total CSG revenue for the quarter was $420 million with 60.9% gross margin and 14% operating margin. 
Our Electronic, Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first quarter revenue of $203 million, up 6% from last year. Growth was led by automotive and energy and semiconductor measurement solutions, offset by a slight decline in general electronics measurement. EISG reported gross margin of 59% and operating margin of 18.5%. 
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, generated revenue of $127 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 14.5%. Gross margin in this business was unfavorably impacted by a one-time inventory clean up tied to the ERP integration and cutover. ISG revenue was above our expectations for the quarter as they saw an increase in shipments for their high-speed 400G Ethernet test solutions, and overall, support renewals reached a new record. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG revenue, grew 6% year-over-year to reach $106 million. Revenue growth for SSG was driven by an increase in sales of remarketed solutions and calibration with overall regional strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific. SSG reported gross margin of 40.3% and operating margin of 15.6%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $980 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated $171 million in cash flow from operations. Our operational cash flows were strengthened by significant timing related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery, which we expect to balance out during the remainder of the first half. In Q1, we invested $24 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $147 million, or 18% of revenue, which was atypical for the first quarter, and again, will even out over the half. 
Before we move to guidance, I will provide an overview of the impact of U.S. tax reform on our business. We expect to lower U.S. corporate tax rate and shift to a modified territorial tax system to lower our overall tax rate and provide much greater access to our global cash generation. While some provisions of the new legislation are subject to interpretation, which may change over the coming months and impact our initial estimates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate will drop 200 basis points to 15% beginning this quarter. The new U.S. tax law includes a deemed repatriation on existing offshore cash balances and historic foreign earnings. We currently estimate that this provision will result in Keysight paying cash taxes totaling $95 million over an 8-year period while providing a one-time U.S. cash influx of greater than $500 million. We are currently exploring different strategies to best optimize our balance sheet, and we are committed to acting in the best interest of our shareholders and maximizing shareholder value over the long term. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Balancing our strong order growth, the current market dynamics, our better-than-expected Q1 results and the continued recovery from the wildfires, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. We now expect first half revenue in the range of $1,805,000,000 to $1,835,000,000, and first half earnings per share in the range of $1.27 to $1.37. At the midpoint, our first half guidance represents 4% core revenue growth, a greater than 40% year-over-year core operating margin incremental and 10% EPS growth. The midpoint of our first half guidance implies Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $964 million and second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. Building on our positive momentum, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the first half, and as result of our strong backlog position, we are now expecting full year core revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

None of our customers canceled any orders that they had on the books with us. And what we've seen primarily is a rush to be first in 5G by our customers. And that has driven them to want to purchase more of our equipment and purchase more of our equipment sooner. Now some of the players in R&D have placed very sizable orders in order to use that equipment throughout the year. But there wasn't any mention on -- any mention at all of the fires for any reason for the order momentum. And we saw that across the broad, broad spectrum of businesses, regions and channels. As was mentioned earlier, we not only saw the fantastic results with regards to 5G in commercial communications, we also saw double-digit software growth, we saw services growth that was in the high-single digits. We saw automotive growth, which was another double-digit growth quarter. So the momentum is very, very broad. It's across multiple regions around the world. It's across different businesses. And it's also across both of our channels, our direct channel and our indirect channel. I think that our strategy from 4 years ago to focus on being first in the market and to invest our R&D dollars and really utilize our talent and expertise and work on standards committees and be there first is paying off.

I will say though, in 4G, it wasn't our lack of performance or not being able to compete in 4G. Our role as part of  Agilent was to provide more cash generation, so we did not invest in 4G like we needed to in order to be the top leader. On top of that, we did not invest early enough.

And we have come up with solutions for 5G using products or technology that was developed at classic Keysight at Anite on the software levels, and then AT4 wireless also over in Spain. And we put those things together to really accelerate our offering and be first. Now Satish Dhanasekaran is on the phone at Mobile World Congress. He won't be commenting on competitors, but he can share with everybody what he is seeing there from our Keysight customers."

Clearly, the industry acceleration of 5G was on broad display here at Mobile World Congress. Multiple operators declaring accelerated plans really creates a pull in the ecosystem, something that we predicted a little bit ago, and we've been continuing to invest with a platform approach that scales for the broad ecosystem. And I know you referenced some press releases, but this goes beyond press releases. Our platform and solutions has enabled many industry firsts. So if you were at the Qualcomm booth, for example, you would've seen high-frequency 28 gigahertz demonstration with a Qualcomm X50 modem. If you were at the Intel booth, on display was our solution that helps showcase a 4K video demonstration amongst others. And if you were at the China Mobile booth, you would've seen our newest acquisition, Ixia  Solution, on display for 5G. So these are powerful examples of the scale at which our solutions are being adopted and we view this acceleration trend as a positive driver, most evidenced by the fact that we had a strong order performance in our commercial communications segment in the most recent quarter. Thanks, Ron."

With regards to automotive, we're seeing much more technology adoption with not just electric vehicles, but autonomous vehicles and all the wireless communications that are in the actual vehicles. It's also important to note that we only play in the high-value auto. We play in parts that are very high tech, that are new and breakthroughs for this market.

As Ron and Neil mentioned in their prepared comments, we saw strong rebound in aerospace defense orders in Q1, following a very strong Q4. So we're very pleased with both of those quarters at nearly 20%. We see strong demand from our customers in the U.S. government and contractors, but we also see continuing strong growth and demand from our international business. And for many years, this has been a fairly stable business for us, and this diversity of opportunities coming to Keysight is one of the things that drives that. So in the short term, we all know that we're waiting for the U.S. defense budget to be signed later this month, and when that does occur, if it does, we should see some orders begin to flow, probably toward the latter part of our fiscal year just like we did last year. Long term, we have a very good position as we continue to see investments being made in modernizing the technology from electronic warfare to radar, and we're in a very good position to continue to capture that business. And then I just want to underscore the automotive initiative. 5 quarters in a row of double-digit growth. The R&D spend is continuing to expand. And we have really started making some traction in expanding our presence with the Tier 1 OEMs as a result of the Scienlab acquisition, the company in Bochum, Germany that we're using to help us get into the battery test solutions for the Tier 1 OEMs as well."

So that size, it was less than $2 million was the size of the inventory cleanup and, again, one-time related to the ERP migration that we did. On the EISG side, the gross margin change is really about mix, right? They sell a wide range of products in that business, and we see a mix shift. I think one of the bigger changes there is while our semi business remained relatively strong, we really sell 2 main products into semiconductor. First is parametric test. This tends to be a little bit on the higher-margin side. And then we saw some laser positioning systems. They're still good margins, but not quite up to parametric test levels. And so we saw that mix -- that semi mix was a little bit -- put some downward pressure on margins in the EISG."

Can you help us understand the, I guess, the disconnect between the order growth rate and revenue? Are you inferring that future order growth rate is going to decelerate below that 5% to 7% growth rate? Was there a lag effect because you have more software content? You already talked about the military orders having kind of longer duration. And I believe that your 5G orders are also tied more to long-term R&D relationships."

So as you start to think about hitting the 5% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and that's -- our first half guide implied 4% core revenue growth, so we're definitely seeing accelerating revenue growth into the second half. But as you noted, we are seeing a lengthening of our order to revenue conversion cycle. If you look on our balance sheet, you'll see increasing deferred revenue balance as we have increasing both in the software and services space, time -- revenue -- or excuse me, orders that have time-based revenue recognition. The solution sale tends to have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle than the typical product sale. And as you mentioned within aerospace defense, as we sell systems and there are installation and customer signoff requirements associated with those sales, that can also lengthen that period of time. So as we look at the course of the second half, we're definitely seeing a production -- strong production ramp and a strong revenue ramp as we move from Q1 to Q2. As you go to the back half of the year, certainly, the typical seasonality in this business is that you would see Q4 revenue being our strongest quarter of the year with Q3 being a relatively weaker point. At the high level, we think that, that basic seasonality probably still continues, but it's probably muted a bit because of the strong backlog position, the production recovery that we're having. So we still see Q4 above Q3, but maybe with a slightly less of an increase given the strong backlog position that remains."

But whether or not you are going ahead and you are doing research and development, or whether or not you're doing operations, you'll be able to tie those results together to save time. That will help our software portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, our software grew double digits, and we are continuing to accelerate that. Services is a relatively small part of our business. As you know, it's less than 15%. But we still see a great opportunity for that. But again, we're not going to waste cash and overpay for acquisitions. We'll take our time and build it ourselves, but that will also help us as we move to recurring revenue. But the move to R&D and the move to software will continue to help us on the gross margin line."

Our strategy of differentiation is based around providing solutions. We not only provide hardware, we have a fab that goes ahead creates high-performance components and makes high-performance measurements to provide great, let's just say, measurement integrity. But we also provide software. We are the largest software provider. But with our new platform that we'll be expanding over years, we're going to be continuing to take that further. But the third part of our overall solution is our people. We have the most technical depth, not only because of our size, but because of the numbers of years we've been in the core part of our market, when you look at the wireless market, that's infiltrating everything, from automotive to everything that we see in our Communications group. That's an area where customers come to us for solutions, whether it's helping with standards or whether it's devising solutions or consulting before the sale, during the sale and after the sale. So our big differentiation is providing solutions in our key markets. We're not going to overpay for an acquisition and get an acquisition, or do an acquisition that won't return above the cost of capital. And we're going to do everything we can to further our differentiation in total solutions. And when we provide those solutions, we're helping our customers really get to market more quickly, and beat their competition and be very, very effective in the marketplace. So we have seen -- we have a robust M&A process, and we look at that. Right now, our priority is on making sure we are successful with Ixia. We have Anite. We've integrated that, and we're winning a lot of R&D 5G business due to the components and the parts of the solutions from Anite as well as from the rest of the company. And in Ixia, we just completed the integration into our systems in 9 months. And we've expanded our SAM, and we're going much further. We've also done other acquisitions, which also help us, such as we said our stated goal was to win in automotive, so we made an acquisition of Scienlab, and we're very, very pleased with that. That was the firm in Germany that was mentioned earlier today on the call. But we will do small M&As, but right now, we are focused on making the investments that we made pay off even greater than we thought, and delevering."

Obviously, we've had -- our revenues and shipments are a bit more volatile here in the first half than you would typically expect given what's going on with production. But as I noted in the guide, the guidance that we provided for the half does deliver 4% core growth, and it delivers a core incremental that is above 40%, which is our promised incremental on core growth. So as you think about modeling margins for the second half, I would anchor on that. We've talked about second half core growth in the 5% to 7% range for the full year. So obviously, off of, what, 4% in the first half. We'll be growing it better than that in the second half, and focused on meeting that 40% incremental. We also, from a margin perspective, will, in the second half, see significant improvement from the Ixia cost synergies. So we have some that are in the run rate now, but it was really this integration into the ERP that is the big triggering mechanism to allow us to start taking cost out of Ixia, and so we'll be doing a lot of that work this quarter such that by Q3, we're at a $10 million per quarter run rate, or $40 million annually, for our Ixia synergies."

Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, revenue grew to a record $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. We also achieved earnings of $0.83 per share,",1161,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, revenue grew to a record $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. We also achieved earnings of $0.83 per share, which was $0.02 above our guidance midpoint. Second, Keysight's core revenue and orders grew double digits, and we achieved double-digit order and revenue growth in our communications, electronic industrial and Services Solutions groups as demand for Keysight solutions in 5G, automotive and services continue. And third, we are raising our outlook for the year. 
Let's now take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.83 per share and delivered strong order growth. Orders grew 23% in total or 10% on a core basis. Broad-based demands across our markets, geographies and channels drove our third consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. Q2 revenue grew 32% or 18% on a core basis to reach $999 million. Core revenue grew double digits across all regions, including our emerging markets. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that the shipment disruption from the wildfires is now behind us. This was completed one quarter earlier than expected and without a single order cancellation. 
During the quarter, we completed Phase II of the Ixia integration. We've invested significant resources upgrading their systems and processes for long-term value creation. This included integration of all procurement, contract manufacturing, trade and logistics activities to leverage Keysight's scale. In addition, we consolidated 28 sites to drive operational alignment and cost savings and absorb many management and administrative functions for efficiency. This was an enormous effort, and stabilization took longer than expected, impacting ISG's Q2 results. Many of these integration issues are now resolved, and we will deliver the committed cost synergies in the current quarter. 
Ixia's leadership in next-generation technologies is integral to our solutions and software strategy. Our acquisitions of both Ixia and Anite bring Keysight into the software layers of the design and test market. With our combined technology portfolios, we are able to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow. Our solutions road map for the next several years is very exciting, especially as 5G provides new ways to connect people with their devices, cars and things. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, is making great contributions in the wireless portion of 5G, and ISG is addressing the network part of the ecosystem. We have had several significant wins for evolved packet core upgrades with major carriers. Major 5G network investments in the U.S. are expected to begin in the second half of the year as carriers introduce new services. 
Moving to our markets. We continue to see increased investments in our emerging technologies and overall healthy market dynamics. Our technology leadership, solutions and industry-focused approach to the market continues to advance our growth and footprint in key segments. Customers are increasingly looking to Keysight to solve their design challenges, and we are empowering them to bring their leading-edge innovations to market faster. This quarter, we saw a particularly strong revenue growth in our commercial communications end market following Q1's record order performance. 5G-related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystem, which includes networks, chipsets and devices. In Q2, we achieved strong double-digit 5G order growth. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of double or triple digit order growth for our 5G solutions, which we believe confirms our early leadership position. 
As another example of our leadership, in April, we announced the industry's first 5G New Radio-ready channel emulation solution, which has already been adopted by 5 major communications customers. This new solution, based on technology acquired from Anite, offers state-of-the-art capability and enables customers to validate the end-to-end performance of their designs. Additionally, we delivered our first-to-market 5G millimeter wave channel sounding solution to NTT DOCOMO, Japan's leading mobile operator. Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter, delivering our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth. The global race to deploy hybrid and electric vehicles, connected cars and autonomous driving capability as soon as practically possible is driving ongoing customer investments across a broad range of technologies. Investments for battery and electric drivetrain test are growing in strategic importance. Our ability to differentiate solutions with the acquisition of Scienlab is proving to be a critical enabler to capturing this market opportunity. 
General economic conditions in industrial electronics were strong in the quarter despite some modest slowing in semiconductor investment growth. We saw steady order growth for our general electronics measurement end market and improved demand in the education market in the U.S. and Europe. This market is an important avenue for building long-lasting relationships with future engineers. 
In the aerospace, defense and government end market, we delivered very healthy double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter and saw Q2 revenue increase by 27%, driven by continued broad-based demand worldwide. 
Moving beyond our end markets. Software and services are key components to our solutions-centric, go-to-market approach. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio. And in the second quarter, orders for our software solutions grew double digits organically. Our new PathWave software platform, which we introduced in January, is a foundational element of our strategy to deliver software-centric solutions to our customers around the world. We have already won our first orders for PathWave analytics and are encouraged by the many deals we see in the funnel. Additionally, Q2 revenue for our services segment grew 15% year-over-year to reach an all-time record. Our services expansion included growth in the managed services business with the introduction of PathWave Asset Advisor. This cloud-based software has already been enabled at multiple large customers and is assisting them with proactive lifecycle management of their test equipment. PathWave is a key part of Keysight's leading-edge technology strategy under the Keysight Leadership Model, or KLM. This model encompasses our guiding principles as a company, enables us to deliver greater value to customers, shareholders and employees. KLM is centered around customer success in providing leading-edge technology, solutions and insights. We believe that staying true to this mission and the core values of KLM has and will continue to drive long-term business value. Corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is one of these core values. Demonstrating our commitment to this endeavor, we released our CSR report in May. This report details the company's environmental, social and governance initiatives worldwide. It also includes several company impact goals to help build a better planet, strengthen communities and foster education. While corporate social responsibility has always been a part of Keysight's DNA, these measures provide a beacon to drive our efforts, measure our progress and support stakeholder expectations. We look forward to sharing with you the success of this effort in the quarters and years to come. 
I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

We delivered an exceptional top line quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in the core areas of our business. Given the impact of the quarterly seasonality of our revenue due to the disruption from the wildfire, I will comment today on both our second quarter and first half results. 
For the first half of 2018, we delivered 8% core revenue growth, a year-over-year core operating margin incremental above 40% and 11% EPS growth overall. In addition, first half orders grew 30% in total or 13% on a core basis, enabling us to exit Q2 in a strong backlog position. As expected, we saw a significant revenue ramp in Q2. We reported Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. This brought our revenue for the first half to $1.9 billion, up 25% year-over-year, which includes a 2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. 
Looking at our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 60.3% and operating expenses of $399 million, resulting in operating margin of 20.4%. We reported net income of $158 million and $0.83 in earnings per share on a weighted average diluted share count of 190 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. As you may recall, our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. Total CSG revenue for the first half was $956 million, up 11% over last year, while delivering gross margin of 61.3% and operating margin of 19.3%. In Q2, CSG delivered revenue of $536 million, up 27% year-over-year, driven by 5G-related R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem, early investment in next-generation 400-gig and PAM-4 network test and strong 27% year-over-year growth in our aerospace, defense and government end market. 
Our Electronic, Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first half revenue of $458 million, up 11% from last year, gross margin of 60.3% and operating margin of 22.7%. Q2 EISG revenue was $255 million, up 16% year-over-year, driven by automotive and energy and general electronics measurement while revenue for our semiconductor Measurement Solutions was in line with Q2 of last year. 
As Ron mentioned, second quarter ISG results were impacted by our extensive integration efforts. ISG reported Q2 revenue of $90 million, gross margin of 75.8% and an 8.4% operating margin loss. We've resolved many of the integration issues and expect ISG will deliver solid profitability in the second half. In addition, our annualized cost synergies will ramp to the committed $40 million run rate in Q3. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 11% in the first half to reach $224 million while delivering 40.5% gross margin and operating margin of 15.5%. Q2's record services revenue of $118 million grew 15% year-over-year and was driven by double-digit growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with $784 million in cash and cash equivalents. We generated $111 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $282 million on the half as a significant Q1 timing-related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery began to balance out. In Q2, we invested $34 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $77 million and $224 million for the first half, which represents 12% of revenue and 88% of adjusted net income. As we outlined at our Analyst Day, our capital allocation priorities are to reinvest in our business to drive profitable organic growth, to delever following the acquisition of Ixia and strike a balance between future M&A and return of capital. Consistent with these priorities, in Q2, we repaid the final $260 million of the $540 million prepayable debt that was put in place to find the Ixia acquisition, and we actively repurchased stock during the quarter under the $350 million share repurchase program we announced in March. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 770,000 shares at an average price of approximately $52 per share for a total of $40 million. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect third quarter revenue to be in the range of $942 million to $972 million and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.82 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. While we do not typically provide full year guidance, building on our positive momentum and strong backlog position, we now expect to deliver full year core revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8%, which is above our prior estimate of 5% to 7%. And we continue to expect to deliver a 40% core operating margin incremental for the full year. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

I think if you look at the puts and takes, obviously, there was a bit of an unfavorable mix shift with the relative weakness in ICG. Obviously, a strong gross margin business. At the same time, we're seeing great strength in our core business. I think the other thing is we've emphasized in the past the importance of our flexible operating model and the flexible nature of our cost structure. Core component of that is obviously the fact that 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with business performance. The formula is linked to both organic growth and operating margin, both of which were obviously at high levels for Keysight compared to the historic averages. And so we did see a significant increase in our variable payouts in the quarter, which was expected, and it provides an opportunity for our employees to align themselves with our investor base and sharing the upside while at the same time providing us great protection on the downside. At the same time, we're investing to obviously continue to make sure we maintain leadership position in core technologies around 5G and automotive."

Well, just -- again, just to repeat, we invested significant resources obviously to try to bring our systems together because our job was to integrate the businesses and get the cost and revenue synergies sooner. And in particular, we moved Ixia on to Keysight's Oracle ERP system. We went ahead and changed or integrated the forecasting processes, procurement processes. We set up customers where we've set up over 90 different customers on brand-new contracts, which we had to negotiate one by one, obviously starting with the bigger customers. And we also changed our manufacturing location where we moved contract manufacturers. And on top of that, trading logistics processes change. So all that took a little bit more time than we thought, but we are on track with the cost synergies. We're also on track with the revenue synergies. A matter of fact, as I had mentioned, we're seeing a lot of technology sharing, and we saw some of that just come to fruition, for instance, with the Anite acquisition that Satish has been working on at CSG. And we're at the beginning elements of that, seeing that start to work also in Ixia as we just had our Keysight Technical Conference, the biggest conference that we have every 2 years. And we brought Ixia and the Keysight classic folks together to do that. So we still feel very confident in the revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, and I'll let Neil talk to the overall model."

We were able to accelerate that and obviously pull those shipments in the second quarter. That, coupled with the orders strength in the core, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in the quarter, we're obviously net positive even relative to the guidance that we put out. On the flip side, Ixia, we had expected some softness and some slowing of the incoming order rate as a result of this significant integration effort, but they -- the ability to ramp sales back did take longer than expected, so there was some downside there relative to what was baked into our guidance."

The one that was opened in Detroit is up and running, and it's doing very well. We plan to open another center in Shanghai, China soon. And we have plans for another one in Japan as well. So this is just a further articulation of the commitment and strategy around automotive. And as I mentioned before, the acquisition of Scienlab has really allowed us to expand our solutions into the battery and charging infrastructure space. We won some business already in Q2, and we expect to see that continue, especially as the OEMs invest more heavily in R&D along with the overall supply chain. So I think, in general, we're seeing the continued strength. As far as semiconductor, it really serves all industries. So it's hard to do a compare there, but it is something we are continuing to be successful in. And as a reminder, we have a pretty diverse portfolio of solutions into semiconductor from nano positioning tools, to wafer test tools, to general testing measurement products as well as services. So that's another key area. And again, it feeds into all of the other industries that we service as well."

So specific to our business, we've invested early in 5G a few years ago, made strategic acquisitions like Anite. And it takes a couple of years to start to roll out those platforms. Now these platforms are with customers, and you're starting to see the success, 10 straight quarters of double or triple-digit growth in our 5G business. With 400G, we've obviously been well positioned with 100G, you've probably -- if you followed us, heard us on earnings calls, talked about the ramp that occurred in 2016 through mid-2017. And since then, 100G has really tapered off a little bit as people have started to consume the capacity that's in place, and we start to now see a buildup in 400G. Even this quarter, we had strong orders for 400G in R&D and some early orders for 400G in manufacturing. So we see both these things play out concurrently and synergistically. And this is why we manage our portfolio with focusing on all of these technology evolutions that gives us a pretty good diversity as things play out."

When you think about the order pattern in aerospace and defense, and I know this has come up on a couple of last calls, just in terms of the order strength, and I guess, pent-up demand or the actual procurement cycles, at least our defense analyst is thinking about this as being upside in terms of pent-up spending cycle and things coming in ahead of expectations. Is that part -- or how significant is that? Or how conservative do you think we should be as we think about that potential given the last 3 quarters -- I guess, the strength of the last couple of quarters?"

Again, the third quarter in a row of double-digit order growth. And that was before any of the funding really started to flow from this year's budget. That takes time to work through the appropriation process. So a lot of that was the pent-up demand. But really, I think what I look at is the underlying driver for this is the investments that are being made around the world, and especially in the U.S., to upgrade technology for information warfare and as well as the continuing shift of the prime contractors to be outsourcing more of this work, right? So strong demand from the U.S. government and contractors. As the budget moves its way through that process, we'll start to see some of that upside occur again toward the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year. And again, the encouraging thing is we see strengths outside of the U.S. as well, again around the same things and investments in solution for EW, information warfare, radar and et cetera. So I would say it's more about that than pent-up demand, which I think has more sustainability to it over a longer period of time."

As we look forward, as Ron has already mentioned, we have a very strong funnel entering the quarter. We have many of the issues that we run into are now behind us. The business is ramping back towards normal. I would say we're cautiously optimistic as we look forward to Q3 that things will return to more normal kinds of levels. I think, as you look at Q3 -- at that kind of the gap in revenue in Q2, some of that will be lost, and there's some potential that some of that will be recovered."

When you compound that with 48 operators in 33 countries that have announced plans for 5G, it's pretty clear that this industry is accelerating this technology. Again, a trend that we saw and planned for quite some time ago. Our focus is on higher-value added parts of the market, early R&D. And our contributions are increasingly through software, which should give us a better margin profile, and Neil will probably pick up on that. But at the end of the day, for us, it's about offering our customers an advantage, and we do that by offering end-to-end solutions. We provide a single-stop shop now with the -- with our ability to have not only the physical layer tools, but also go higher on the software stack. And with Ixia, we now have the total solution for the entire ecosystem. And we feel good about where we are in that 5G journey. In terms of the life cycle, you're correct that we're still in the early phases. Our customers are still in the first vintage of products that are used in trials. Next will be continued R&D investments for next couple of years in order for them to satisfy the need of the operators that I just referenced."

Our professional services were up, and a lot of the professional services are tied to our equipment sales as we provide start-up assistance for more and more of our customers as they deploy more complex solutions. So there's a close tie there. And as has been the case for some time, our remarketed solutions continue to be very strong. We have the right mix of inventory, and we're seeing continued demand from some of the same end-user segments, such as wireless, for our remarketed solutions.

First, revenue grew to a record $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. We also achieved earnings of $0.83 per share, which was $0.02 above our guidance midpoint. 
Second, Keysight's core revenue and orders grew double digits, and we achieved double-digit order and revenue growth in our Communications, Electronic Industrial and Services Solutions groups as demand for Keysight solutions in 5G, automotive and services continue. 
And third, we are raising our outlook for the year. 
Let's now take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.83 per share and delivered strong order growth. Orders grew 23% in total or 10% on a core basis. Broad-based demands across our markets, geographies and channels drove our third consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. 
Q2 revenue grew 32% or 18% on a core basis to reach $999 million. Core revenue grew double digits across all regions, including our emerging markets. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that the shipment disruption from the wildfires is now behind us. This was completed 1 quarter earlier than expected and without a single order cancellation. 
During the quarter, we completed Phase 2 of the Ixia integration. We've invested significant resources upgrading their systems and processes for long-term value creation. This included integration of all procurement, contract manufacturing, trade and logistics activities to leverage Keysight's scale. In addition, we consolidated 28 sites to drive operational alignment and cost savings and absorb many management and administrative functions for efficiency. This was an enormous effort, and stabilization took longer than expected, impacting ISG's Q2 results. Many of these integration issues are now resolved, and we will deliver the committed cost synergies in the current quarter. 
Ixia's leadership in next-generation technologies is integral to our solutions and software strategy. Our acquisitions of both Ixia and Anite bring Keysight into the software layers of the design and test market. With our combined technology portfolios, we are able to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow. Our solutions road map for the next several years is very exciting, especially as 5G provides new ways to connect people with their devices, cars and things. 
Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, is making great contributions in the wireless portion of 5G, and ISG is addressing the network part of the ecosystem. We have had several significant wins for evolved packet core upgrades with major carriers. Major 5G network investments in the U.S. are expected to begin in the second half of the year as carriers introduce new services. 
Moving to our markets. We continue to see increased investments in our emerging technologies and overall healthy market dynamics. Our technology leadership, solutions and industry-focused approach to the market continues to advance our growth and footprint in key segments. Customers are increasingly looking to Keysight to solve their design challenges, and we are empowering them to bring their leading-edge innovations to market faster. 
This quarter, we saw a particularly strong revenue growth in our commercial communications end market following Q1's record order performance. 5G-related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystem, which includes networks, chipsets and devices. In Q2, we achieved strong double-digit 5G order growth. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of double or triple digit order growth for our 5G solutions, which we believe confirms our early leadership position. 
As another example of our leadership, in April we announced the industry's first 5G New Radio-ready channel emulation solution, which has already been adopted by 5 major communications customers. This new solution, based on technology acquired from Anite, offers state-of-the-art capability and enables customers to validate the end-to-end performance of their designs. Additionally, we delivered our first-to-market 5G millimeter wave channel sounding solution to NTT DOCOMO, Japan's leading mobile operator. 
Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter, delivering our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth. The global race to deploy hybrid and electric vehicles, connected cars and autonomous driving capability as soon as practically possible is driving ongoing customer investments across a broad range of technologies. 
Investments for battery and electric drivetrain test are growing in strategic importance. Our ability to differentiate solutions with the acquisition of Scienlab is proving to be a critical enabler to capturing this market opportunity. 
General economic conditions in industrial electronics were strong in the quarter despite some modest slowing in semiconductor investment growth. We saw steady order growth for our general electronics measurement end market and improved demand in the education market in the U.S. and Europe. This market is an important avenue for building long-lasting relationships with future engineers. 
In the aerospace, defense and government end market, we delivered very healthy double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter and saw our Q2 revenue increase by 27%, driven by continued broad-based demand worldwide. 
Moving beyond our end markets. Software and services are key components to our solution-centric go-to-market approach. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio. And in the second quarter, orders for our software solutions grew double digits organically. Our new PathWave software platform, which we introduced in January, is a foundational element of our strategy to deliver software-centric solutions to our customers around the world. We have already won our first orders for PathWave Analytics and are encouraged by the many deals we see in the funnel. Additionally, Q2 revenue for our services segment grew 15% year-over-year to reach an all-time record. 
Our services expansion included growth in the managed services business with the introduction of PathWave Asset Advisor. This cloud-based software has already been enabled at multiple large customers and is assisting them with proactive lifecycle management of their test equipment. 
PathWave is a key part of Keysight's leading-edge technology strategy under the Keysight Leadership Model, or KLM. This model encompasses our guiding principles as a company, enables us to deliver greater value to customers, shareholders and employees. KLM is centered around customer success in providing leading-edge technology, solutions and insights. We believe that staying true to this mission and the core values of KLM has and will continue to drive long-term business value. 
Corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is one of these core values. Demonstrating our commitment to this endeavor, we released our CSR report in May. This report details the company's environmental, social and governance initiatives worldwide. It also includes several company impact goals to help build a better planet, strengthen communities and foster education. While corporate social responsibility has always been a part of Keysight's DNA, these measures provide a beacon to drive our efforts, measure our progress and support stakeholder expectations. We look forward to sharing with you the success of this effort in the quarters and years to come. 
I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

We delivered an exceptional top line quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business. Given the impact of the quarterly seasonality of our revenue due to the disruption from the wildfire, I will comment today on both our second quarter and first half results. 
For the first half of 2018, we delivered 8% core revenue growth, a year-over-year core operating margin incremental above 40% and 11% EPS growth overall. In addition, first half orders grew 30% in total or 13% on a core basis, enabling us to exit Q2 in a strong backlog position. As expected, we saw a significant revenue ramp in Q2. We reported Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. This brought our revenue for the first half to $1.9 billion, up 25% year-over-year, which includes a 2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. 
Looking at our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 60.3% and operating expenses of $399 million, resulting in operating margin of 20.4%. We reported net income of $158 million and $0.83 in earnings per share on a weighted average diluted share count of 190 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. As you may recall, our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. Total CSG revenue for the first half was $956 million, up 11% over last year, while delivering gross margin of 61.3% and operating margin of 19.3%. 
In Q2, CSG delivered revenue of $536 million, up 27% year-over-year, driven by 5G-related R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem, early investment in next-generation 400-gig and PAM-4 network tests and strong 27% year-over-year growth in our aerospace, defense and government end market. 
Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first half revenue of $458 million, up 11% from last year, gross margin of 60.3% and operating margin of 22.7%. Q2 EISG revenue was $255 million, up 16% year-over-year, driven by automotive and energy and general electronics measurement, while revenue for our semiconductor Measurement Solutions was in line with Q2 of last year. 
As Ron mentioned, second quarter ISG results were impacted by our extensive integration efforts. ISG reported Q2 revenue of $90 million, gross margin of 75.8% and an 8.4% operating margin loss. We've resolved many of the integration issues and expect ISG will deliver solid profitability in the second half. In addition, our annualized cost synergies will ramp to the committed $40 million run rate in Q3. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 11% in the first half to reach $224 million while delivering 40.5% gross margin and operating margin of 15.5%. Q2's record services revenue of $118 million grew 15% year-over-year and was driven by double-digit growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with $784 million in cash and cash equivalents. We generated $111 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $282 million on the half as the significant Q1 timing-related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery began to balance out. 
In Q2, we invested $34 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $77 million and $224 million for the first half, which represents 12% of revenue and 88% of adjusted net income. 
As we outlined at our Analyst Day, our capital allocation priorities are to reinvest in our business to drive profitable organic growth, to delever following the acquisition of Ixia and strike a balance between future M&A and return of capital. Consistent with these priorities, in Q2, we repaid the final $260 million of the $540 million prepayable debt that was put in place to fund the Ixia acquisition, and we actively repurchased stock during the quarter under the $350 million share repurchase program we announced in March. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 770,000 shares at an average price of approximately $52 per share for a total of $40 million. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect third quarter revenue to be in the range of $942 million to $972 million and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.82 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. While we do not typically provide full year guidance, building on our positive momentum and our strong backlog position, we now expect to deliver full year core revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8%, which is above our prior estimate of 5% to 7%. And we continue to expect to deliver a 40% core operating margin incremental for the full year. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

While at the same time, we're seeing great strength in our core business. I think the other thing is we've emphasized in the past the importance of our flexible operating model and the flexible nature of our cost structure. A core component of that is obviously the fact that 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with business performance. The formula is linked to both organic growth and operating margin, both of which were obviously at high levels for Keysight compared to the historic averages. And so we did see a significant increase in our variable payouts in the quarter, which was expected, and it provides an opportunity for our employees to align themselves with our investor base and sharing the upside while at the same time providing us great protection on the downside. At the same time, we're investing to obviously continue to make sure we maintain a leadership position in core technologies around 5G and automotive."

Well, just -- again, just to repeat, we invested significant resources obviously to try to bring our systems together because our job was to integrate the businesses and get to the cost and revenue synergies sooner. And in particular, we moved Ixia on to Keysight's Oracle ERP system. We went ahead and changed or integrated the forecasting processes, procurement processes. We set up customers where we've set up over 90 different customers on brand-new contracts, which we had to negotiate one by one, obviously starting with the bigger customers. And we also changed our manufacturing location, where we moved contract manufacturers. And on top of that, trading logistics processes changed. So all that took a little bit more time than we thought, but we are on track with the cost synergies. We're also on track with the revenue synergies. A matter of fact, as I had mentioned, we're seeing a lot of technology sharing, and we saw some of that just come to fruition, for instance, with the Anite acquisition that Satish has been working on in CSG. And we're at the beginning elements of that, seeing that start to work also in Ixia as we just had our Keysight Technical Conference, the biggest conference that we have every 2 years. And we brought Ixia and the Keysight classic folks together to do that. So we still feel very confident in the revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, and I'll let Neil talk to the overall model."

The one that was opened in Detroit is up and running, and it's doing very well. We plan to open another center in Shanghai, China soon. And we have plans for another one in Japan as well. So this is just a further articulation of the commitment and strategy around automotive. And as I mentioned before, the acquisition of Scienlab has really allowed us to expand our solutions into the battery and charging infrastructure space. We won some business already in Q2, and we expect to see that continue, especially as the OEMs invest more heavily in R&D along with the overall supply chain. So I think, in general, we're seeing the continued strength. As far as semiconductor, it really serves all industries, so it's hard to do a compare there, but it is something we are continuing to be successful in. And as a reminder, we have a pretty diverse portfolio of solutions into semiconductor from nano positioning tools, to wafer test tools, to general test and measurement products as well as services.

And therefore, having 400G type of technologies roll out is crucial, and we see that playing out both in data centers and in telecom markets. So specific to our business, we've invested early in 5G a few years ago, made strategic acquisitions like Anite. And it takes a couple of years to start to roll out those platforms. Now these platforms are with customers, and you're starting to see the success, 10 straight quarters of double or triple-digit growth in our 5G business. With 400G, we've obviously been well positioned with 100G. You've probably -- if you followed us, heard us on earnings calls talk about the ramp that occurred in 2016 through mid-2017. And since then, 100G has really tapered off a little bit as people have started to consume the capacity that's in place, and we start to now see a buildup in 400G. Even this quarter, we had strong orders for 400G in R&D and some early orders for 400G in manufacturing. So we see both these things play out concurrently and synergistically.

So we're really looking at this overall communications ecosystem and other ecosystems in our markets, and that provides the diversity for our business and provides more earnings, let's just say, stability, for our investors."

I guess just another question. When you think about the order pattern in aerospace and defense, and I know this has come up on a couple of last calls, just in terms of the order strength, and I guess, pent-up demand or the actual procurement cycles, at least our defense analyst is thinking about this as being upside in terms of a pent-up spending cycle and things coming in ahead of expectations. Is that part -- or how significant is that? Or how conservative do you think we should be as we think about that potential given the last 3 quarters -- I guess, the strength of the last couple of quarters?"

Again, the third quarter in a row of double-digit order growth. And that was before any of the funding really started to flow from this year's budget. That takes time to work through the appropriation process. So a lot of that was the pent-up demand. But really, I think what I look at as the underlying driver for this is the investments that are being made around the world, and especially in the U.S., to upgrade technology for information warfare and as well as the continuing shift of the prime contractors to be outsourcing more of this work, right? So strong demand from the U.S. government and contractors. As the budget moves its way through that process, we'll start to see some of that upside occur again toward the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year. And again, the encouraging thing is we see strengths outside of the U.S. as well, again around the same things and investments in solutions for EW, information warfare, radar and et cetera. So I would say it's more about that than pent-up demand, which I think has more sustainability to it over a longer period of time."

The ramp back to volume took longer than expected, and so we did have lower revenues here in the second quarter than what was baked into our original guide. As we look forward, as Ron has already mentioned, we have a very strong funnel entering the quarter. We have many of the issues that we run into are now behind us. The business is ramping back towards normal. I would say we're cautiously optimistic as we look forward to Q3 that things will return to more normal kinds of levels. I think as you look at Q3  or at that kind of the gap in revenue in Q2, some of that will be lost, and there's some potential that some of that will be recovered."

So whether you believe it's late 2018 or early 2019, that's a pretty significant number. When you compound that with 48 operators in 33 countries that have announced plans for 5G, it's pretty clear that this industry is accelerating this technology, again, a trend that we saw and planned for quite some time ago. Our focus is on higher-value added parts of the market, early R&D. And our contributions are increasingly through software, which should give us a better margin profile, and Neil will probably pick up on that. But at the end of the day, for us, it's about offering our customers an advantage, and we do that by offering end-to-end solutions. We provide a single-stop shop now with the -- with our ability to have not only the physical layer tools but also go higher on the software stack. And with Ixia, we now have the total solution for the entire ecosystem. And we feel good about where we are in that 5G journey. In terms of the life cycle, you're correct that we're still in the early phases. Our customers are still in the first vintage of products that are used in trials. Next will be continued R&D investments for the next couple of years in order for them to satisfy the need of the operators that I just referenced."

And a lot of the professional services are tied to our equipment sales as we provide startup assistance for more and more of our customers as they deploy more complex solutions. So there's a close tie there. And as has been the case for some time, our remarketed solutions continue to be very strong. We have the right mix of inventory, and we're seeing continued demand from some of the same end-user segments, such as wireless, for our remarketed solutions.

First, revenue grew to a record $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. We also achieved earnings of $0.83 per share, which was $0.02 above our guidance midpoint. 
Second, Keysight's core revenue and orders grew double digits, and we achieved double-digit order and revenue growth in our Communications, Electronic Industrial and Services Solutions groups as demand for Keysight solutions in 5G, automotive and services continued. 
And third, we are raising our outlook for the year. 
Let's now take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.83 per share and delivered strong order growth. Orders grew 23% in total or 10% on a core basis. Broad-based demands across our markets, geographies and channels drove our third consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. 
Q2 revenue grew 32% or 18% on a core basis to reach $999 million. Core revenue grew double digits across all regions, including our emerging markets. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that the shipment disruption from the wildfires is now behind us. This was completed 1 quarter earlier than expected and without a single order cancellation. 
During the quarter, we completed Phase 2 of the Ixia integration. We've invested significant resources upgrading their systems and processes for long-term value creation. This included integration of all procurement, contract manufacturing, trade and logistics activities to leverage Keysight's scale. In addition, we consolidated 28 sites to drive operational alignment and cost savings and absorb many management and administrative functions for efficiency. This was an enormous effort, and stabilization took longer than expected, impacting ISG's Q2 results. Many of these integration issues are now resolved, and we will deliver the committed cost synergies in the current quarter. 
Ixia's leadership in next-generation technologies is integral to our solutions and software strategy. Our acquisitions of both Ixia and Anite bring Keysight into the software layers of the design and test market. With our combined technology portfolios, we are able to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow. Our solutions road map for the next several years is very exciting, especially as 5G provides new ways to connect people with their devices, cars and things. 
Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, is making great contributions in the wireless portion of 5G, and ISG is addressing the network part of the ecosystem. We have had several significant wins for evolved packet core upgrades with major carriers. Major 5G network investments in the U.S. are expected to begin in the second half of the year as carriers introduce new services. 
Moving to our markets. We continue to see increased investments in our emerging technologies and overall healthy market dynamics. Our technology leadership, solutions and industry-focused approach to the market continues to advance our growth and footprint in key segments. Customers are increasingly looking to Keysight to solve their design challenges, and we are empowering them to bring their leading-edge innovations to market faster. 
This quarter, we saw particularly strong revenue growth in our commercial communications end market following Q1's record order performance. 5G-related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystem, which includes networks, chipsets and devices. In Q2, we achieved strong double-digit 5G order growth. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of double or triple digit order growth for our 5G solutions, which we believe confirms our early leadership position. 
As another example of our leadership, in April we announced the industry's first 5G New Radio-ready channel emulation solution, which has already been adopted by 5 major communications customers. This new solution, based on technology acquired from Anite, offers state-of-the-art capability and enables customers to validate the end-to-end performance of their designs. Additionally, we delivered our first-to-market 5G millimeter wave channel sounding solution to NTT DOCOMO, Japan's leading mobile operator. 
Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter, delivering our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth. The global race to deploy hybrid and electric vehicles, connected cars and autonomous driving capability as soon as practically possible is driving ongoing customer investments across a broad range of technologies. 
Investments for battery and electric drivetrain test are growing in strategic importance. Our ability to differentiate solutions with the acquisition of Scienlab is proving to be a critical enabler to capturing this market opportunity. 
General economic conditions in industrial electronics were strong in the quarter despite some modest slowing in semiconductor investment growth. We saw steady order growth for our general electronics measurement end market and improved demand in the education market in the U.S. and Europe. This market is an important avenue for building long-lasting relationships with future engineers. 
In the aerospace, defense and government end market, we delivered very healthy double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter and saw Q2 revenue increase by 27%, driven by continued broad-based demand worldwide. 
Moving beyond our end markets. Software and services are key components to our solution-centric go-to-market approach. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio. And in the second quarter, orders for our software solutions grew double digits organically. Our new PathWave software platform, which we introduced in January, is a foundational element of our strategy to deliver software-centric solutions to our customers around the world. We have already won our first orders for PathWave Analytics and are encouraged by the many deals we see in the funnel. Additionally, Q2 revenue for our services segment grew 15% year-over-year to reach an all-time record. 
Our services expansion included growth in the managed services business with the introduction of PathWave Asset Advisor. This cloud-based software has already been enabled at multiple large customers and is assisting them with proactive lifecycle management of their test equipment. 
PathWave is a key part of Keysight's leading-edge technology strategy under the Keysight Leadership Model, or KLM. This model encompasses our guiding principles as a company, enables us to deliver greater value to customers, shareholders and employees. KLM is centered around customer success in providing leading-edge technology, solutions and insights. We believe that staying true to this mission and the core values of KLM has and will continue to drive long-term business value. 
Corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is one of these core values. Demonstrating our commitment to this endeavor, we released our CSR report in May. This report details the company's environmental, social and governance initiatives worldwide. It also includes several company impact goals to help build a better planet, strengthen communities and foster education. While corporate social responsibility has always been a part of Keysight's DNA, these measures provide a beacon to drive our efforts, measure our progress and support stakeholder expectations. We look forward to sharing with you the success of this effort in the quarters and years to come. 
I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

We delivered an exceptional top line quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business. Given the impact of the quarterly seasonality of our revenue due to the disruption from the wildfire, I will comment today on both our second quarter and first half results. 
For the first half of 2018, we delivered 8% core revenue growth, a year-over-year core operating margin incremental above 40% and 11% EPS growth overall. In addition, first half orders grew 30% in total or 13% on a core basis, enabling us to exit Q2 in a strong backlog position. As expected, we saw a significant revenue ramp in Q2. We reported Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. This brought our revenue for the first half to $1.9 billion, up 25% year-over-year, which includes a 2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. 
Looking at our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 60.3% and operating expenses of $399 million, resulting in operating margin of 20.4%. We reported net income of $158 million and $0.83 in earnings per share on a weighted average diluted share count of 190 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. As you may recall, our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. Total CSG revenue for the first half was $956 million, up 11% over last year, while delivering gross margin of 61.3% and operating margin of 19.3%. 
In Q2, CSG delivered revenue of $536 million, up 27% year-over-year, driven by 5G-related R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem, early investment in next-generation 400-gig and PAM-4 network test and strong 27% year-over-year growth in our aerospace, defense and government end market. 
Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first half revenue of $458 million, up 11% from last year, gross margin of 60.3% and operating margin of 22.7%. Q2 EISG revenue was $255 million, up 16% year-over-year, driven by automotive and energy and general electronics measurement, while revenue for our Semiconductor Measurement Solutions was in line with Q2 of last year. 
As Ron mentioned, second quarter ISG results were impacted by our extensive integration efforts. ISG reported Q2 revenue of $90 million, gross margin of 75.8% and an 8.4% operating margin loss. We've resolved many of the integration issues and expect ISG will deliver solid profitability in the second half. In addition, our annualized cost synergies will ramp to the committed $40 million run rate in Q3. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 11% in the first half to reach $224 million while delivering 40.5% gross margin and operating margin of 15.5%. Q2's record services revenue of $118 million grew 15% year-over-year and was driven by double-digit growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with $784 million in cash and cash equivalents. We generated $111 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $282 million on the half as the significant Q1 timing-related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery began to balance out. 
In Q2, we invested $34 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $77 million and $224 million for the first half, which represents 12% of revenue and 88% of adjusted net income. 
As we outlined at our Analyst Day, our capital allocation priorities are to reinvest in our business to drive profitable organic growth, to delever following the acquisition of Ixia and strike a balance between future M&A and return of capital. Consistent with these priorities, in Q2, we repaid the final $260 million of the $540 million prepayable debt that was put in place to fund the Ixia acquisition, and we actively repurchased stock during the quarter under the $350 million share repurchase program we announced in March. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 770,000 shares at an average price of approximately $52 per share for a total of $40 million. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect third quarter revenue to be in the range of $942 million to $972 million and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.82 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. While we do not typically provide full year guidance, building on our positive momentum and our strong backlog position, we now expect to deliver full year core revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8%, which is above our prior estimate of 5% to 7%. And we continue to expect to deliver a 40% core operating margin incremental for the full year. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

Obviously, a strong gross margin business while at the same time, we were seeing great strength in our core business. I think the other thing is we've emphasized in the past the importance of our flexible operating model and the flexible nature of our cost structure. A core component of that is obviously the fact that 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with business performance. The formula is linked to both organic growth and operating margin, both of which were obviously at high levels for Keysight compared to historic averages. And so we did see a significant increase in our variable payouts in the quarter, which was expected, and it provides an opportunity for our employees to align themselves with our investor base and share in the upside while at the same time providing us great protection on the downside. At the same time, we're investing to obviously continue to make sure we maintain a leadership position in core technologies around 5G and automotive."

Well, just -- again, just to repeat, we invested significant resources obviously to try to bring our systems together because our job was to integrate the businesses and get to the cost and revenue synergies sooner. And in particular, we moved Ixia onto Keysight's Oracle ERP system. We went ahead and changed or integrated the forecasting processes, procurement processes. We set up customers where we've set up over 90 different customers on brand-new contracts, which we had to negotiate one by one, obviously starting with the bigger customers. And we also changed our manufacturing location, where we moved contract manufacturers. And on top of that, trade and logistics processes changed. So all that took a little bit more time than we thought, but we are on track with the cost synergies. We're also on track with the revenue synergies. A matter of fact, as I had mentioned, we're seeing a lot of technology sharing, and we saw some of that just come to fruition, for instance, with the Anite acquisition that Satish has been working on in CSG. And we're at the beginning elements of that, seeing that start to work also in Ixia as we just had our Keysight Technical Conference, the biggest conference that we have every 2 years. And we brought Ixia and the Keysight classic folks together to do that. So we still feel very confident in the revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, and I'll let Neil talk to the overall model."

The one that was opened in Detroit is up and running, and it's doing very well. We plan to open another center in Shanghai, China soon. And we have plans for another one in Japan as well. So this is just a further articulation of the commitment and strategy around automotive. And as I mentioned before, the acquisition of Scienlab has really allowed us to expand our solutions into the battery and charging infrastructure space. We won some business already in Q2, and we expect to see that continue, especially as the OEMs invest more heavily in R&D along with the overall supply chain. So I think, in general, we're seeing the continued strength. As far as the semiconductor, it really serves all industries, so it's hard to do a compare there, but it is something we are continuing to be successful in. And as a reminder, we have a pretty diverse portfolio of solutions into semiconductor from nano positioning tools, to wafer test tools, to general test and measurement products as well as services. So that's another key area. And again, it feeds into all of the other industries that we service as well."

And therefore, having 400G type of technologies roll out is crucial, and we see that playing out both in data centers and in telecom markets. So specific to our business, we invested early in 5G a few years ago, made strategic acquisitions like Anite. And it takes a couple of years to start to roll out those platforms. Now these platforms are with customers, and you're starting to see the success, 10 straight quarters of double or triple-digit growth in our 5G business. With 400G, we've obviously been well positioned with 100G. You've probably -- if you followed us, heard us on earnings calls talk about the ramp that occurred in 2016 through mid-2017. And since then, 100G has really tapered off a little bit as people have started to consume the capacity that's in place, and we start to now see a buildup in 400G. Even this quarter, we had strong orders for 400G in R&D and some early orders for 400G in manufacturing. So we see both these things play out concurrently and synergistically.

Again, the third quarter in a row of double-digit order growth. And that was before any of the funding really started to flow from this year's budget. That takes time to work through the appropriation process. So a lot of that was the pent-up demand. But really, I think what I look at as the underlying driver for this is the investments that are being made around the world, and especially in the U.S., to upgrade technology for information warfare and as well as the continuing shift of the prime contractors to be outsourcing more of this work, right? So strong demand from the U.S. government and contractors. As the budget moves its way through that process, we'll start to see some of that upside occur again toward the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year. And again, the encouraging thing is we see strengths outside the U.S. as well, again around the same things and investments in solutions for EW, information warfare, radar and et cetera. So I would say it's more about that than pent-up demand, which I think has more sustainability to it over a longer period of time."

We had to obviously take into account the impact of the integration, investments and effort that we were going on. The ramp back to volume took longer than expected, and so we did have lower revenues here in the second quarter than was baked into our original guide. As we look forward, as Ron has already mentioned, we have a very strong funnel entering the quarter. We have many of the issues that we run into are now behind us. The business is ramping back towards normal. I would say we're cautiously optimistic as we look forward to Q3 that things will return to more normal kinds of levels. I think as you look at Q3  or at the, kind of the gap in revenue in Q2, some of that will be lost, and there's some potential that some of that will be recovered."

So whether you believe it's late 2018 or early 2019, that's a pretty significant number. When you compound that with 48 operators in 33 countries that have announced plans for 5G, it's pretty clear that this industry is accelerating this technology, again, a trend that we saw and planned for quite some time ago. Our focus is on higher-value-added parts of the market, early R&D. And our contributions are increasingly through software, which should give us a better margin profile, and Neil will probably pick up on that. But at the end of the day, for us, it's about offering our customers an advantage, and we do that by offering end-to-end solutions. We provide a single-stop shop now with the -- with our ability to have not only the physical layer tools but also go higher on the software stack. And with Ixia, we now have the total solution for the entire ecosystem. And we feel good about where we are in that 5G journey. In terms of the life cycle, you're correct that we're still in the early phases. Our customers are still in the first vintage of products that are used in trials. Next will be continued R&D investments for the next couple of years in order for them to satisfy the need of the operators that I just referenced."

So this is going into a new set of customers, the contract manufacturers and ODMs, and we're going to continue to build on that going forward.

And a lot of the professional services are tied to our equipment sales as we provide startup assistance for more and more of our customers as they deploy more complex solutions. So there's a close tie there. And as has been the case for some time, our remarketed solutions continue to be very strong. We have the right mix of inventory, and we're seeing continued demand from some of the same end-user segments, such as wireless, for our remarketed solutions. The last thing I'll mention here, too, which is the strength that we're seeing today from the solutions and product sales should help us fuel services sales in the next year to 2 years.

First, revenue grew to a record $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. We also achieved earnings of $0.83 per share, which was $0.02 above our guidance midpoint. 
Second, Keysight's core revenue and orders grew double digits, and we achieved double-digit order and revenue growth in our Communications, Electronic Industrial and Services Solutions groups as demand for Keysight solutions in 5G, automotive and services continued. 
And third, we are raising our outlook for the year. 
Let's now take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.83 per share and delivered strong order growth. Orders grew 23% in total or 10% on a core basis. Broad-based demands across our markets, geographies and channels drove our third consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. 
Q2 revenue grew 32% or 18% on a core basis to reach $999 million. Core revenue grew double digits across all regions, including our emerging markets. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that the shipment disruption from the wildfires is now behind us. This was completed 1 quarter earlier than expected and without a single order cancellation. 
During the quarter, we completed Phase 2 of the Ixia integration. We've invested significant resources upgrading their systems and processes for long-term value creation. This included integration of all procurement, contract manufacturing, trade and logistics activities to leverage Keysight's scale. In addition, we consolidated 28 sites to drive operational alignment and cost savings and absorb many management and administrative functions for efficiency. This was an enormous effort, and stabilization took longer than expected, impacting ISG's Q2 results. Many of these integration issues are now resolved, and we will deliver the committed cost synergies in the current quarter. 
Ixia's leadership in next-generation technologies is integral to our solutions and software strategy. Our acquisitions of both Ixia and Anite bring Keysight into the software layers of the design and test market. With our combined technology portfolios, we are able to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow. Our solutions road map for the next several years is very exciting, especially as 5G provides new ways to connect people with their devices, cars and things. 
Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, is making great contributions in the wireless portion of 5G, and ISG is addressing the network part of the ecosystem. We have had several significant wins for evolved packet core upgrades with major carriers. Major 5G network investments in the U.S. are expected to begin in the second half of the year as carriers introduce new services. 
Moving to our markets. We continue to see increased investments in our emerging technologies and overall healthy market dynamics. Our technology leadership, solutions and industry-focused approach to the market continues to advance our growth and footprint in key segments. Customers are increasingly looking to Keysight to solve their design challenges, and we are empowering them to bring their leading-edge innovations to market faster. 
This quarter, we saw particularly strong revenue growth in our commercial communications end market following Q1's record order performance. 5G-related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystem, which includes networks, chipsets and devices. In Q2, we achieved strong double-digit 5G order growth. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of double or triple digit order growth for our 5G solutions, which we believe confirms our early leadership position. 
As another example of our leadership, in April we announced the industry's first 5G New Radio-ready channel emulation solution, which has already been adopted by 5 major communications customers. This new solution, based on technology acquired from Anite, offers state-of-the-art capability and enables customers to validate the end-to-end performance of their designs. Additionally, we delivered our first-to-market 5G millimeter wave channel sounding solution to NTT DOCOMO, Japan's leading mobile operator. 
Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter, delivering our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth. The global race to deploy hybrid and electric vehicles, connected cars and autonomous driving capability as soon as practically possible is driving ongoing customer investments across a broad range of technologies. 
Investments for battery and electric drivetrain test are growing in strategic importance. Our ability to differentiate solutions with the acquisition of Scienlab is proving to be a critical enabler to capturing this market opportunity. 
General economic conditions in industrial electronics were strong in the quarter despite some modest slowing in semiconductor investment growth. We saw steady order growth for our general electronics measurement end market and improved demand in the education market in the U.S. and Europe. This market is an important avenue for building long-lasting relationships with future engineers. 
In the aerospace, defense and government end market, we delivered very healthy double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter and saw Q2 revenue increase by 27%, driven by continued broad-based demand worldwide. 
Moving beyond our end markets. Software and services are key components to our solution-centric go-to-market approach. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio. And in the second quarter, orders for our software solutions grew double digits organically. Our new PathWave software platform, which we introduced in January, is a foundational element of our strategy to deliver software-centric solutions to our customers around the world. We have already won our first orders for PathWave Analytics and are encouraged by the many deals we see in the funnel. Additionally, Q2 revenue for our services segment grew 15% year-over-year to reach an all-time record. 
Our services expansion included growth in the managed services business with the introduction of PathWave Asset Advisor. This cloud-based software has already been enabled at multiple large customers and is assisting them with proactive lifecycle management of their test equipment. 
PathWave is a key part of Keysight's leading-edge technology strategy under the Keysight Leadership Model, or KLM. This model encompasses our guiding principles as a company, enables us to deliver greater value to customers, shareholders and employees. KLM is centered around customer success in providing leading-edge technology, solutions and insights. We believe that staying true to this mission and the core values of KLM has and will continue to drive long-term business value. 
Corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is one of these core values. Demonstrating our commitment to this endeavor, we released our CSR report in May. This report details the company's environmental, social and governance initiatives worldwide. It also includes several company impact goals to help build a better planet, strengthen communities and foster education. While corporate social responsibility has always been a part of Keysight's DNA, these measures provide a beacon to drive our efforts, measure our progress and support stakeholder expectations. We look forward to sharing with you the success of this effort in the quarters and years to come. 
I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

We delivered an exceptional top line quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business. Given the impact of the quarterly seasonality of our revenue due to the disruption from",808,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. We delivered an exceptional top line quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business. Given the impact of the quarterly seasonality of our revenue due to the disruption from the wildfire, I will comment today on both our second quarter and first half results. 
For the first half of 2018, we delivered 8% core revenue growth, a year-over-year core operating margin incremental above 40% and 11% EPS growth overall. In addition, first half orders grew 30% in total or 13% on a core basis, enabling us to exit Q2 in a strong backlog position. As expected, we saw a significant revenue ramp in Q2. We reported Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. This brought our revenue for the first half to $1.9 billion, up 25% year-over-year, which includes a 2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. 
Looking at our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 60.3% and operating expenses of $399 million, resulting in operating margin of 20.4%. We reported net income of $158 million and $0.83 in earnings per share on a weighted average diluted share count of 190 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. As you may recall, our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. Total CSG revenue for the first half was $956 million, up 11% over last year, while delivering gross margin of 61.3% and operating margin of 19.3%. 
In Q2, CSG delivered revenue of $536 million, up 27% year-over-year, driven by 5G-related R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem, early investment in next-generation 400-gig and PAM-4 network test and strong 27% year-over-year growth in our aerospace, defense and government end market. 
Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first half revenue of $458 million, up 11% from last year, gross margin of 60.3% and operating margin of 22.7%. Q2 EISG revenue was $255 million, up 16% year-over-year, driven by automotive and energy and general electronics measurement, while revenue for our Semiconductor Measurement Solutions was in line with Q2 of last year. 
As Ron mentioned, second quarter ISG results were impacted by our extensive integration efforts. ISG reported Q2 revenue of $90 million, gross margin of 75.8% and an 8.4% operating margin loss. We've resolved many of the integration issues and expect ISG will deliver solid profitability in the second half. In addition, our annualized cost synergies will ramp to the committed $40 million run rate in Q3. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 11% in the first half to reach $224 million while delivering 40.5% gross margin and operating margin of 15.5%. Q2's record services revenue of $118 million grew 15% year-over-year and was driven by double-digit growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with $784 million in cash and cash equivalents. We generated $111 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $282 million on the half as the significant Q1 timing-related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery began to balance out. 
In Q2, we invested $34 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $77 million and $224 million for the first half, which represents 12% of revenue and 88% of adjusted net income. 
As we outlined at our Analyst Day, our capital allocation priorities are to reinvest in our business to drive profitable organic growth, to delever following the acquisition of Ixia and strike a balance between future M&A and return of capital. Consistent with these priorities, in Q2, we repaid the final $260 million of the $540 million prepayable debt that was put in place to fund the Ixia acquisition, and we actively repurchased stock during the quarter under the $350 million share repurchase program we announced in March. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 770,000 shares at an average price of approximately $52 per share for a total of $40 million. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect third quarter revenue to be in the range of $942 million to $972 million and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.82 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. While we do not typically provide full year guidance, building on our positive momentum and our strong backlog position, we now expect to deliver full year core revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8%, which is above our prior estimate of 5% to 7%. And we continue to expect to deliver a 40% core operating margin incremental for the full year.

Obviously, a strong gross margin business while at the same time, we were seeing great strength in our core business. I think the other thing is we've emphasized in the past the importance of our flexible operating model and the flexible nature of our cost structure. A core component of that is obviously the fact that 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with business performance. The formula is linked to both organic growth and operating margin, both of which were obviously at high levels for Keysight compared to historic averages. And so we did see a significant increase in our variable payouts in the quarter, which was expected, and it provides an opportunity for our employees to align themselves with our investor base and share in the upside while at the same time providing us great protection on the downside.

Well, just -- again, just to repeat, we invested significant resources obviously to try to bring our systems together because our job was to integrate the businesses and get to the cost and revenue synergies sooner. And in particular, we moved Ixia onto Keysight's Oracle ERP system. We went ahead and changed or integrated the forecasting processes, procurement processes. We set up customers where we've set up over 90 different customers on brand-new contracts, which we had to negotiate one by one, obviously starting with the bigger customers. And we also changed our manufacturing location, where we moved contract manufacturers. And on top of that, trade and logistics processes changed. So all that took a little bit more time than we thought, but we are on track with the cost synergies. We're also on track with the revenue synergies. A matter of fact, as I had mentioned, we're seeing a lot of technology sharing, and we saw some of that just come to fruition, for instance, with the Anite acquisition that Satish has been working on in CSG. And we're at the beginning elements of that, seeing that start to work also in Ixia as we just had our Keysight Technical Conference, the biggest conference that we have every 2 years. And we brought Ixia and the Keysight classic folks together to do that. So we still feel very confident in the revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, and I'll let Neil talk to the overall model."

So as I mentioned earlier, our growth initiative is really well on track, 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit order growth. And it's really being fueled by the investments being made, and really, the race for autonomous driving, electric hybrid vehicles and connected cars.

The one that was opened in Detroit is up and running, and it's doing very well. We plan to open another center in Shanghai, China soon. And we have plans for another one in Japan as well. So this is just a further articulation of the commitment and strategy around automotive. And as I mentioned before, the acquisition of Scienlab has really allowed us to expand our solutions into the battery and charging infrastructure space. We won some business already in Q2, and we expect to see that continue, especially as the OEMs invest more heavily in R&D along with the overall supply chain. So I think, in general, we're seeing the continued strength. As far as the semiconductor, it really serves all industries, so it's hard to do a compare there, but it is something we are continuing to be successful in. And as a reminder, we have a pretty diverse portfolio of solutions into semiconductor from nano positioning tools, to wafer test tools, to general test and measurement products as well as services. So that's another key area. And again, it feeds into all of the other industries that we service as well."

Obviously, there's the front-end piece, the wireless piece and 5G with the standards that you're referencing. And that has to work together. And therefore, having 400G type of technologies roll out is crucial, and we see that playing out both in data centers and in telecom markets. So specific to our business, we invested early in 5G a few years ago, made strategic acquisitions like Anite. And it takes a couple of years to start to roll out those platforms. Now these platforms are with customers, and you're starting to see the success, 10 straight quarters of double or triple-digit growth in our 5G business. With 400G, we've obviously been well positioned with 100G. You've probably -- if you followed us, heard us on earnings calls talk about the ramp that occurred in 2016 through mid-2017. And since then, 100G has really tapered off a little bit as people have started to consume the capacity that's in place, and we start to now see a buildup in 400G. Even this quarter, we had strong orders for 400G in R&D and some early orders for 400G in manufacturing. So we see both these things play out concurrently and synergistically.

Again, the third quarter in a row of double-digit order growth. And that was before any of the funding really started to flow from this year's budget. That takes time to work through the appropriation process. So a lot of that was the pent-up demand. But really, I think what I look at as the underlying driver for this is the investments that are being made around the world, and especially in the U.S., to upgrade technology for information warfare and as well as the continuing shift of the prime contractors to be outsourcing more of this work, right? So strong demand from the U.S. government and contractors. As the budget moves its way through that process, we'll start to see some of that upside occur again toward the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year. And again, the encouraging thing is we see strengths outside the U.S. as well, again around the same things and investments in solutions for EW, information warfare, radar and et cetera.

We had to obviously take into account the impact of the integration, investments and effort that we were going on. The ramp back to volume took longer than expected, and so we did have lower revenues here in the second quarter than was baked into our original guide. As we look forward, as Ron has already mentioned, we have a very strong funnel entering the quarter. We have many of the issues that we run into are now behind us. The business is ramping back towards normal. I would say we're cautiously optimistic as we look forward to Q3 that things will return to more normal kinds of levels. I think as you look at Q3  or at the, kind of the gap in revenue in Q2, some of that will be lost, and there's some potential that some of that will be recovered."

So whether you believe it's late 2018 or early 2019, that's a pretty significant number. When you compound that with 48 operators in 33 countries that have announced plans for 5G, it's pretty clear that this industry is accelerating this technology, again, a trend that we saw and planned for quite some time ago. Our focus is on higher-value-added parts of the market, early R&D. And our contributions are increasingly through software, which should give us a better margin profile, and Neil will probably pick up on that. But at the end of the day, for us, it's about offering our customers an advantage, and we do that by offering end-to-end solutions. We provide a single-stop shop now with the -- with our ability to have not only the physical layer tools but also go higher on the software stack. And with Ixia, we now have the total solution for the entire ecosystem. And we feel good about where we are in that 5G journey. In terms of the life cycle, you're correct that we're still in the early phases. Our customers are still in the first vintage of products that are used in trials. Next will be continued R&D investments for the next couple of years in order for them to satisfy the need of the operators that I just referenced."

We introduced PathWave, and we've gotten our first order for PathWave Analytics. That's a brand-new platform. It didn't exist before Q2, right? So this is going into a new set of customers, the contract manufacturers and ODMs, and we're going to continue to build on that going forward. So I think the investment cycles that we're seeing with the early R&D and 5G, with the early stages of what's happening with automotive as well as other technologies that are feeding into the connectivity across the world are going to continue to give us opportunities beyond FY '18."

And a lot of the professional services are tied to our equipment sales as we provide startup assistance for more and more of our customers as they deploy more complex solutions. So there's a close tie there. And as has been the case for some time, our remarketed solutions continue to be very strong. We have the right mix of inventory, and we're seeing continued demand from some of the same end-user segments, such as wireless, for our remarketed solutions. The last thing I'll mention here, too, which is the strength that we're seeing today from the solutions and product sales should help us fuel services sales in the next year to 2 years.

We delivered an outstanding third quarter with both revenue and earnings far exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, reve",1124,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding third quarter with both revenue and earnings far exceeding the high-end of our guidance. 
Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to reach a record $1 billion. We achieved this growth, while also delivering 45% year-over-year EPS growth, which is a new record for Keysight. Second, customers continue to make strong R&D investment in next-generation technology and we continue to achieve differentiation and momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. 
Keysight orders also grew to over $1 billion in both core revenue and orders grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. And third, we are raising our core outlook for the year. We now expect 2018 core revenue growth to be approximately 11%, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%. 
Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We have achieved earnings of $0.89 per share, which was $0.12 above the midpoint and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 45% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth for this quarter and reached a new Q3 record. Orders grew 15% in total to surpass $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 12%. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth and the second quarter out of the last 4 quarters with orders above $1 billion. 
Our continued strong order growth has translated into record revenue results. Q3 revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to also surpass $1 billion. Broad-based demand and investments in emerging technologies drove double-digit order growth for our solutions and commercial communications, aerospace, defense and government, automotive and energy, semiconductor and services. Our technology leadership solutions and industry focused approach continues to advance of a footprint in end markets undergoing technology transformations. 
We are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions within Marquis Keysight customers. Additionally, we are adding new customers at a rapid rate. In total, we have added close to 2,000 new direct customers So far this year. This quarter, we saw a very strong 23% revenue growth in our commercial communications end-market. Broad 5G-related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystem, which includes chipsets, devices, networks and infrastructure. Our early engagement with the market leaders and their advanced portfolio of 5G R&D solutions continue to strengthen Keysight's leadership position in 5G. 
In Q3, this translated to triple digit 5G order growth. We have the broadest array of 5G solutions on the market today and continue to see strength globally for our 5G program. We are engaged with lead operators around the world such as NTT DOCOMO in their 5G deployment process. This quarter, our Ixia Solutions Group, along with our Nemo solutions team from the Anite acquisition secured key design wins for our leading-edge and core network solutions for 5G, which is just another example of our differentiated portfolio of solutions. 
Speaking of Ixia, we were pleased with Ixia's improved revenue performance after our extensive integration activities last quarter. We are continuing to make good progress in optimizing the business and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Ixia was also seeing increased 400G activity. Our announced 1 high density 400 gig Ethernet test solutions won Best of Show at Tokyo and is gaining strong interest from customers. 
Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter, delivering our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in Q3. Demand was driven by broad strength across all regions, expansion within our top customers and wins with new accounts in the quarter. Major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers continue to aggressively invest across a broad set of automotive electronic applications. This is driving growth for both R&D applications and the associated solutions supporting high-value manufacturing tests. In the aerospace defense and government end-market, we delivered double-digit order growth for the fourth quarter second quarter and increased revenue by 22%. 
In the quarter, we saw strong worldwide demand across the aerospace and defense supply chain, including space, satellite, radar and electronic warfare applications. Looking forward, in this end market, we're seeing some headwinds in China from growing trade tensions, but expected them to be offset by growing demand in the rest of the world. In the U.S., the defense budget for 2019 was passed last week. We expect to benefit from the year-over-year budget stability as well as the significant increases in U.S. spending for research, development, test and evaluation. Across our end markets, software and services are key components of the value creation we delivered to customers. 
In the third quarter, revenue for our software solutions grew double digits. We continue to see increased demand in next-generation technology design as the complexity of that design increases and design cycles accelerate. Our long-term strategy to drive growth in services is also yielding results. Services orders grew double digits and revenue grew 9% year-over-year driven by calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. 
Customer success in providing leading-edge technology, solutions and insights is at the core of Keysight leadership model. The growth we have achieved over the past several quarters would not have been possible without our commitment to innovation and the continued targeted investments we have made over the past several years. We have significantly strengthened our technology leadership in key areas of the market undergoing multi-year transformations and growth trends. We will continue to focus our investments in these key growth areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market. 
Lastly, we have an amazing team at Keysight and I thank them for their commitment to both our company and our customers. Attracting and fostering and retaining top talent across the globe as well as creating a culture of diversity and inclusion will be contributing factors to our future success. Demonstrating KLM in action this quarter, I would highlight the career comeback program we have in Malaysia where our largest manufacturing facility is located along with a sizable R&D center. I am proud to say that through this program we have a growing number of mothers who have returned to the workforce bringing their expertise to the company in various areas, including electrical engineering, software development, human resources and supply chain. 
We look forward to sharing with you the success of the Keysight Leadership Model in the quarters and years to come. I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. 
As Ron mentioned, we delivered an exceptional quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business. Additionally, our continued focus execution and commitment to operational discipline is delivering record results for Keysight. 
For the third quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1 billion, which was well above our guidance of $942 million to $972 million. 
In Q3, we also delivered $1 billion in orders, which were up 15% with core orders growing 12%, enabling us to exit the quarter in a solid backlog position. 
Looking at our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 61.2% and operating expenses of $402 million, resulting in operating margin of 21.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history. We also achieved record net income of $170 million and delivered $0.89 in earnings per share, which was up 45%. 
Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group or CSG generated total revenue of $515 million, up 23%, while delivering gross margin of 61.7% and operating margin of 22.2%. 
In Q3, commercial communications delivered revenue of $314 million, up 23% driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data centers next-generation 400 gig and high-speed digital part. Aerospace, defense and government grew 22% and generated revenue of $201 million. 
As Ron mentioned, aerospace defense and government growth was robust with strong demand across the aerospace defense supply chain, including space, satellite, radar and electric -- electronic warfare applications. 
Our Electronic Industrial Group or EISG generated third quarter revenue of $258 million, up 19% driven by strength across all of its markets; automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 63.1% and operating market of 28.5%. Our Solutions Group or ISG reported Q3 revenue of $119 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 8.1%. We were pleased with improved revenue performance after extensive integration activities last quarter. We continue to focus on optimizing processes in several key areas and are confident in our ability to grow the business and increase profitability. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group or SSG revenue grew 9% in Q3 to reach $116 million, while delivering 40.1% gross margin and operating margin of 15.0%. Q3 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $742 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $38 million and free cash flow of negative $2 million. This includes accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan in the amount of $85 million and in order to secure tax deductibility and the current corporate rate prior to the new tax legislation taking effect. Excluding this accelerated payment, free cash flow was $83 million, which represents 8% of revenue. 
Under existing share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 668,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $59.81 for a total consideration of $40 million. 
Before moving to our guidance, I would like to make a few additional comments about the potential impact on our business from trade tensions between the U.S. and China. We currently estimate that the expense impact from the end our stories is still relatively immaterial. We're also closely monitoring the potential impact of these tensions on our aerospace and defense business in China, which we currently estimate at $10 million to $15 million per quarter. 
As Ron mentioned, we believe this will be offset by the strong demand trends we are seeing in the rest of the world aerospace defense market. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1billion to.$1,20,000,000 and Q4 earnings per share to be the range of $0.85 to $0.91 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares. 
At the midpoint, this brings our earnings growth for 2018 to 23% and total revenue growth to approximately 19% or 11% on a core basis, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%. 
Additionally for the year, we expect to deliver a year-over-year core operating margin incremental at our above our 40% target. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

Just to reiterate a couple of the points that were made in the prepared statements from Ron and Neil. So far, as we've looked at the planets that have been announced, the impacts are very small, immaterial. And separate from that, the trade tensions and the restrictions are principally affecting our aerospace defense business in China. And as Neil mentioned, based on the current situation, we estimated that impact to be $10 million to $15 million per quarter. Now if you take a step back, and I think Ron mentioned this as well, our strength of the aerospace defense business globally is very strong and we feel like the rest of the world will offset this impact to China. This is our fourth quarter in a row of double-digit order growth. And we continue to see increased investments around the world especially the U.S. As Ron mentioned, the U.S. DOD build, the Defense Appropriation Bill has been signed before the beginning of the new fiscal year. I think this is the first time that's happened in more than 20 years. And our overall business in aerospace defense remains a very broad from satellite to radio test to electronic warfare and radar test. So it's a very large market and its a growing market that we are playing a big role in. 
And then finally, back to China, just for a moment, we continue to actively monitor the situation and despite the pretensions, our business in China continues to be strong and broad. We delivered solid double-digit revenue and order growth in Q3 and we're continuing to win in China with our differentiated solutions for 5G, for automotive, for semiconductor, et cetera."

We go ahead and we acquired signals about then you have to analyze them and now, with our most recent solar scope that we have launched, we literally make a trillion measurements per second or we sample at a trillion measurements a second or $256 billion precision measurements a second time for channels. So as that data comes off, software is the only way to analyze that. We do some of that software within chips or in firmware or in pure software. But if I take a look at the overall business, in FY '17, it was over $500 million in software. Now as we look in this year, this quarter, we're running obviously significantly above that and that's even without Ixia. And when we add Ixia software in and we're going to be doing adding that to our total number, but we just want to make sure that we break out the products that are, let's say, half hardware and half software and do that correctly, you'll see that number go up and up. But there is no doubt 5G drives software as well as many of our other applications.

We delivered an outstanding third quarter with both revenue and earnings far exceeding the high end of our guidance.Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, reven",1128,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding third quarter with both revenue and earnings far exceeding the high end of our guidance.
Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to reach a record $1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 45% year-over-year EPS growth, which is a new record for Keysight. 
Second, customers continue to make strong R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we continue to achieve differentiation and momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. Keysight orders also grew to over $1 billion in both core revenue and orders, grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. 
And third, we are raising our core outlook for the year. We now expect 2018 core revenue growth to be approximately 11%, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%.
Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We have achieved earnings of $0.89 per share, which was $0.12 above the midpoint and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 45% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth for this quarter and reached a new Q3 record. Orders grew 15% in total to surpass $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 12%. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth and the second quarter out of the last 4 quarters with orders above $1 billion.
Our continued strong order growth has translated into record revenue results. Q3 revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to also surpass $1 billion. Broad-based demand and investments in emerging technologies drove double-digit order growth for our solutions in commercial communications, aerospace, defense and government, automotive and energy, semiconductor and services. 
Our technology leadership solutions and industry-focused approach continues to advance our footprint in key end markets undergoing technology transformations. We are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions within marquee Keysight customers. Additionally, we are adding new customers at a rapid rate. In total, we have added close to 2,000 new direct customers so far this year. 
This quarter, we saw a very strong 23% revenue growth in our commercial communications end market. Broad 5G-related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystem, which includes chipsets, devices, networks and infrastructure. Our early engagement with the market leaders and our advanced portfolio of 5G R&D solutions continue to strengthen Keysight's leadership position in 5G.
In Q3, this translated to triple-digit 5G order growth. We have the broadest array of 5G solutions on the market today and continue to see strength globally for our 5G program. We are engaged with lead operators around the world such as NTT DOCOMO in their 5G deployment process. This quarter, our Ixia Solutions Group, along with our Nemo Solutions team from the Anite acquisition secured key design wins for our leading-edge RAN and core network solutions for 5G, which is just another example of our differentiated portfolio of solutions.
Speaking of Ixia, we were pleased with Ixia's improved revenue performance after our extensive integration activities last quarter. We are continuing to make good progress in optimizing the business, and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Ixia was also seeing increased 400G activity. Our recent announced AresONE high-density 400 gig Ethernet test solution won Best of Show at Interop, Tokyo, and is gaining strong interest from customers. 
Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter, delivering our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in Q3. Demand was driven by broad strength across all regions, expansion within our top customers and wins with new accounts in the quarter. Major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers continue to aggressively invest across a broad set of automotive electronic applications. This is driving growth for both R&D applications and the associated solutions supporting high-value manufacturing test. 
In the aerospace, defense and government end market, we delivered double-digit order growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and increased revenue by 22%. In the quarter, we saw a strong worldwide demand across the aerospace and defense supply chain, including space, satellite, radar and electronic warfare applications. Looking forward, in this end market, we are seeing some headwinds in China from growing trade tensions, but expect them to be offset by growing demand in the rest of the world. In the U.S., the defense budget for 2019 was passed last week. We expect to benefit from the year-over-year budget stability as well as the significant increases in U.S. spending for research, development, test and evaluation. Across our end markets, software and services are key components of the value creation we delivered to customers.
In the third quarter, revenue for our software solutions grew double digits. We continue to see increased demand in next-generation technology design as the complexity of that design increases and design cycles accelerate. Our long-term strategy to drive growth in services is also yielding results. Services orders grew double digits, and revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by calibration, remarketed solutions and repair.
Customer success in providing leading-edge technology, solutions and insights is at the core of Keysight's leadership model. The growth we have achieved over the past several quarters would not have been possible without our commitment to innovation and the continued targeted investments we have made over the past several years. We have significantly strengthened our technology leadership in key areas of the market undergoing multiyear transformations and growth trends. We will continue to focus our investments in these key growth areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market.
Lastly, we have an amazing team at Keysight and I thank them for their commitment to both our company and our customers. Attracting and fostering and retaining top talent across the globe as well as creating a culture of diversity and inclusion will be contributing factors to our future success. 
Demonstrating KLM in action this quarter, I would highlight the career comeback program we have in Malaysia where our largest manufacturing facility is located along with a sizable R&D center. I am proud to say that through this program we have a growing number of mothers who have returned to the workforce bringing their expertise to the company in various areas, including electrical engineering, software development, human resources and supply chain.
We look forward to sharing with you the success of the Keysight Leadership Model in the quarters and years to come. 
I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.
As Ron mentioned, we delivered an exceptional quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business. Additionally, our continued focus, execution and commitment to operational discipline is delivering record results for Keysight.
For the third quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1 billion, which was well above our guidance of $942 million to $972 million.
In Q3, we also delivered $1 billion in orders, which were up 15% with core orders growing 12%, enabling us to exit the quarter in a solid backlog position.
Looking at our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 61.2% and operating expenses of $402 million, resulting in operating margin of 21.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history. We also achieved record net income of $170 million and delivered $0.89 in earnings per share, which was up 45%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, generated total revenue of $515 million, up 23%, while delivering gross margin of 61.7% and operating margin of 22.2%. 
In Q3, commercial communications delivered revenue of $314 million, up 23%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center next-generation 400 gig and high-speed digital test. 
Aerospace, defense and government grew 22% and generated revenue of $201 million.
As Ron mentioned, aerospace, defense and government growth was robust with strong demand across the aerospace defense supply chain, including space, satellite, radar and electric -- electronic warfare applications.
Our Electronic Industrial Group, or EISG, generated third quarter revenue of $258 million, up 19%, driven by strength across all of its markets, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 63.1% and operating margin of 28.5%. 
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q3 revenue of $119 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 8.1%. We were pleased with ISG's improved revenue performance after our extensive integration activities last quarter. We continue to focus on optimizing processes in several key areas and are confident in our ability to grow the business and increase profitability.
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 9% in Q3 to reach $116 million, while delivering 40.1% gross margin and operating margin of 15.0%. Q3 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $742 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $38 million and free cash flow of negative $2 million. This includes accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan in the amount of $85 million in order to secure tax deductibility at the current corporate rate prior to the new tax legislation taking effect. Excluding this accelerated payment, free cash flow was $83 million, which represents 8% of revenue.
Under our existing share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 668,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $59.81 for a total consideration of $40 million.
Before moving to our guidance, I would like to make a few additional comments about the potential impact on our business from trade tensions between the U.S. and China. We currently estimate that the expense impact from the announced tariffs is still relatively immaterial. We're also closely monitoring the potential impact of these tensions on our aerospace and defense business in China, which we currently estimate at $10 million to $15 million per quarter.
As Ron mentioned, we believe this will be offset by the strong demand trends we are seeing in the rest of the world aerospace defense market.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,000,000,000 to $10,20,000,000 and Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.91 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares.
At the midpoint, this brings our earnings growth for 2018 to 23% and total revenue growth to approximately 19% or 11% on a core basis, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%.
Additionally for the year, we expect to deliver a year-over-year core operating margin incremental at or above our 40% target.
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

So just to reiterate a couple of other points that were made at the -- in the prepared statements from Ron and Neil. So far, as we've looked at the tariffs that have been announced, the impacts are very small, immaterial. And separate from that, the trade tensions are -- and the restrictions are principally affecting our aerospace defense business in China. And as Neil mentioned, based on the current situation, we estimate that impact to be $10 million to $15 million per quarter. Now if you take a step back, and I think Ron mentioned this as well, the strength of our aerospace defense business globally is very strong, and we feel like the rest of the world will offset this impact to China. This is our fourth quarter in a row of double-digit order growth. And we continue to see increased investments around the world, especially the U.S. As Ron mentioned, the U.S. DOD build, the Defense Appropriation Bill, has been signed before the beginning of the new fiscal year. I think this is the first time that's happened in more than 20 years. And our overall business in aerospace defense remains very broad from satellite to MilCom radio test to electronic warfare and radar test. So it's a very large market, and it's a growing market that we're playing a big role in. And then finally, back to China, just for a moment, we continue to actively monitor the situation and despite the trade tensions, our business in China continues to be strong and broad. We delivered solid double-digit revenue and order growth in Q3, and we're continuing to win in China with our differentiated solutions for 5G, for automotive, for semiconductor, et cetera."

And when we add Ixia software in and we're going to be doing -- adding that to our total number, but we just want to make sure that we break out the products that are, let's say, half hardware and half software and do that correctly, you'll see that number go up and up. But there is no doubt, 5G drives software as well as many of our other applications. That business is growing, and we like that, not only for increased margins, but we also like that for potential recurring revenue in long term."

First, reven",1127,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding third quarter with both revenue and earnings far exceeding the high end of our guidance.
Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to reach a record $1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 45% year-over-year EPS growth, which is a new record for Keysight. 
Second, customers continue to make strong R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we continue to achieve differentiation and momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. Keysight orders also grew to over $1 billion, and both core revenue and orders grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. 
And third, we are raising our core outlook for the year. We now expect 2018 core revenue growth to be approximately 11%, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%.
Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We have achieved earnings of $0.89 per share, which was $0.12 above the midpoint and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 45% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth for this quarter and reached a new Q3 record. Orders grew 15% in total to surpass $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 12%. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth and the second quarter out of the last 4 quarters with orders above $1 billion.
Our continued strong order growth has translated into record revenue results. Q3 revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to also surpass $1 billion. Broad-based demand and investments in emerging technologies drove double-digit order growth for our solutions in commercial communications, aerospace, defense and government, automotive and energy, semiconductor and services. 
Our technology leadership solutions and industry-focused approach continues to advance our footprint in key end markets undergoing technology transformations. We are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions within marquee Keysight customers. Additionally, we are adding new customers at a rapid rate. In total, we have added close to 2,000 new direct customers so far this year. 
This quarter, we saw a very strong 23% revenue growth in our commercial communications end market. Broad 5G-related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystem, which includes chipsets, devices, networks and infrastructure. Our early engagement with the market leaders and our advanced portfolio of 5G R&D solutions continue to strengthen Keysight's leadership position in 5G.
In Q3, this translated to triple-digit 5G order growth. We have the broadest array of 5G solutions on the market today and continue to see strength globally for our 5G program. We are engaged with lead operators around the world such as NTT DOCOMO in their 5G deployment process. This quarter, our Ixia Solutions Group, along with our Nemo Solutions team from the Anite acquisition secured key design wins for our leading-edge RAN and core network solutions for 5G, which is just another example of our differentiated portfolio of solutions.
Speaking of Ixia, we were pleased with Ixia's improved revenue performance after our extensive integration activities last quarter. We are continuing to make good progress in optimizing the business, and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Ixia was also seeing increased 400G activity. Our recent announced AresONE high-density 400-gig Ethernet test solution won Best of Show at Interop, Tokyo, and is gaining strong interest from customers. 
Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter, delivering our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in Q3. Demand was driven by broad strength across all regions, expansion within our top customers and wins with new accounts in the quarter. Major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers continue to aggressively invest across a broad set of automotive electronic applications. This is driving growth for both R&D applications and the associated solutions supporting high-value manufacturing test. 
In the aerospace, defense and government end market, we delivered double-digit order growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and increased revenue by 22%. In the quarter, we saw a strong worldwide demand across the aerospace and defense supply chain, including space, satellite, radar and electronic warfare applications. Looking forward, in this end market, we are seeing some headwinds in China from growing trade tensions, but expect them to be offset by growing demand in the rest of the world. In the U.S., the defense budget for 2019 was passed last week. We expect to benefit from the year-over-year budget stability as well as the significant increases in U.S. spending for research, development, test and evaluation. Across our end markets, software and services are key components of the value creation we delivered to customers.
In the third quarter, revenue for our software solutions grew double digits. We continue to see increased demand in next-generation technology design as the complexity of that design increases and design cycles accelerate. Our long-term strategy to drive growth in services is also yielding results. Services orders grew double digits, and revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by calibration, remarketed solutions and repair.
Customer success in providing leading-edge technology, solutions and insights is at the core of Keysight's leadership model. The growth we have achieved over the past several quarters would not have been possible without our commitment to innovation and the continued targeted investments we have made over the past several years. We have significantly strengthened our technology leadership in key areas of the market undergoing multiyear transformations and growth trends. We will continue to focus our investments in these key growth areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market.
Lastly, we have an amazing team at Keysight and I thank them for their commitment to both our company and our customers. Attracting and fostering and retaining top talent across the globe as well as creating a culture of diversity and inclusion will be contributing factors to our future success. 
Demonstrating KLM in action this quarter, I would highlight the career comeback program we have in Malaysia where our largest manufacturing facility is located along with a sizable R&D center. I am proud to say that through this program we have a growing number of mothers who have returned to the workforce bringing their expertise to the company in various areas, including electrical engineering, software development, human resources and supply chain.
We look forward to sharing with you the success of the Keysight Leadership Model in the quarters and years to come. 
I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.
As Ron mentioned, we delivered an exceptional quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business. Additionally, our continued focus, execution and commitment to operational discipline is delivering record results for Keysight.
For the third quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1 billion, which was well above our guidance of $942 million to $972 million.
In Q3, we also delivered $1 billion in orders, which were up 15% with core orders growing 12%, enabling us to exit the quarter in a solid backlog position.
Looking at our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 61.2% and operating expenses of $402 million, resulting in operating margin of 21.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history. We also achieved record net income of $170 million and delivered $0.89 in earnings per share, which was up 45%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, generated total revenue of $515 million, up 23%, while delivering gross margin of 61.7% and operating margin of 22.2%. 
In Q3, commercial communications delivered revenue of $314 million, up 23%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center next-generation 400-gig and high-speed digital test. 
Aerospace, defense and government grew 22% and generated revenue of $201 million.
As Ron mentioned, aerospace, defense and government growth was robust with strong demand across the aerospace defense supply chain, including space, satellite, radar and electric -- electronic warfare applications.
Our Electronic Industrial Group, or EISG, generated third quarter revenue of $258 million, up 19%, driven by strength across all of its markets, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 63.1% and operating margin of 28.5%. 
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q3 revenue of $119 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 8.1%. We were pleased with ISG's improved revenue performance after our extensive integration activities last quarter. We continue to focus on optimizing processes in several key areas and are confident in our ability to grow the business and increase profitability.
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 9% in Q3 to reach $116 million, while delivering 40.1% gross margin and operating margin of 15.0%. Q3 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $742 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $38 million and free cash flow of negative $2 million. This includes accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan in the amount of $85 million in order to secure tax deductibility at the current corporate rate prior to the new tax legislation taking effect. Excluding this accelerated payment, free cash flow was $83 million, which represents 8% of revenue.
Under our existing share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 668,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $59.81 for a total consideration of $40 million.
Before moving to our guidance, I would like to make a few additional comments about the potential impact on our business from trade tensions between the U.S. and China. We currently estimate that the expense impact from the announced tariffs is still relatively immaterial. We're also closely monitoring the potential impact of these tensions on our aerospace and defense business in China, which we currently estimate at $10 million to $15 million per quarter.
As Ron mentioned, we believe this will be offset by the strong demand trends we are seeing in the rest of the world aerospace defense market.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,000,000,000 to $1,020,000,000 and Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.91 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares.
At the midpoint, this brings our earnings growth for 2018 to 23% and total revenue growth to approximately 19% or 11% on a core basis, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%.
Additionally, for the year, we expect to deliver a year-over-year core operating margin incremental at or above our 40% target.
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

So just to reiterate a couple of the points that were made at the -- in the prepared statements from Ron and Neil. So far, as we've looked at the tariffs that have been announced, the impacts are very small, immaterial. And separate from that, the trade tensions are -- and the restrictions are principally affecting our aerospace defense business in China. And as Neil mentioned, based on the current situation, we estimate that impact to be $10 million to $15 million per quarter. Now if you take a step back, and I think Ron mentioned this as well, the strength of our aerospace defense business globally is very strong, and we feel like the rest of the world will offset this impact to China. This is our fourth quarter in a row of double-digit order growth. And we continue to see increased investments around the world, especially the U.S. As Ron mentioned, the U.S. DoD bill, the Defense Appropriation Bill, has been signed before the beginning of the new fiscal year. I think this is the first time that's happened in more than 20 years. And our overall business in aerospace defense remains very broad from satellite to MilCom radio test to electronic warfare and radar test. So it's a very large market, and it's a growing market that we're playing a big role in. And then finally, back to China, just for a moment, we continue to actively monitor the situation and despite the trade tensions, our business in China continues to be strong and broad. We delivered solid double-digit revenue and order growth in Q3, and we're continuing to win in China with our differentiated solutions for 5G, for automotive, for semiconductor, et cetera."

First, reven",1127,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding third quarter with both revenue and earnings far exceeding the high end of our guidance.
Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to reach a record $1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 45% year-over-year EPS growth, which is a new record for Keysight. 
Second, customers continue to make strong R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we continue to achieve differentiation and momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. Keysight orders also grew to over $1 billion, and both core revenue and orders grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. 
And third, we are raising our core outlook for the year. We now expect 2018 core revenue growth to be approximately 11%, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%.
Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We have achieved earnings of $0.89 per share, which was $0.12 above the midpoint and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 45% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth for this quarter and reached a new Q3 record. Orders grew 15% in total to surpass $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 12%. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth and the second quarter out of the last 4 quarters with orders above $1 billion.
Our continued strong order growth has translated into record revenue results. Q3 revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to also surpass $1 billion. Broad-based demand and investments in emerging technologies drove double-digit order growth for our solutions in commercial communications, aerospace, defense and government, automotive and energy, semiconductor and services. 
Our technology leadership solutions and industry-focused approach continues to advance our footprint in key end markets undergoing technology transformations. We are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions within marquee Keysight customers. Additionally, we are adding new customers at a rapid rate. In total, we have added close to 2,000 new direct customers so far this year. 
This quarter, we saw a very strong 23% revenue growth in our commercial communications end market. Broad 5G-related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystem, which includes chipsets, devices, networks and infrastructure. Our early engagement with the market leaders and our advanced portfolio of 5G R&D solutions continue to strengthen Keysight's leadership position in 5G.
In Q3, this translated to triple-digit 5G order growth. We have the broadest array of 5G solutions on the market today and continue to see strength globally for our 5G program. We are engaged with lead operators around the world such as NTT DOCOMO in their 5G deployment process. This quarter, our Ixia Solutions Group, along with our Nemo Solutions team from the Anite acquisition secured key design wins for our leading-edge RAN and core network solutions for 5G, which is just another example of our differentiated portfolio of solutions.
Speaking of Ixia, we were pleased with Ixia's improved revenue performance after our extensive integration activities last quarter. We are continuing to make good progress in optimizing the business, and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Ixia was also seeing increased 400G activity. Our recent announced AresONE high-density 400-gig Ethernet test solution won Best of Show at Interop, Tokyo, and is gaining strong interest from customers. 
Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter, delivering our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in Q3. Demand was driven by broad strength across all regions, expansion within our top customers and wins with new accounts in the quarter. Major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers continue to aggressively invest across a broad set of automotive electronic applications. This is driving growth for both R&D applications and the associated solutions supporting high-value manufacturing test. 
In the aerospace, defense and government end market, we delivered double-digit order growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and increased revenue by 22%. In the quarter, we saw a strong worldwide demand across the aerospace and defense supply chain, including space, satellite, radar and electronic warfare applications. Looking forward, in this end market, we are seeing some headwinds in China from growing trade tensions, but expect them to be offset by growing demand in the rest of the world. In the U.S., the defense budget for 2019 was passed last week. We expect to benefit from the year-over-year budget stability as well as the significant increases in U.S. spending for research, development, test and evaluation. Across our end markets, software and services are key components of the value creation we delivered to customers.
In the third quarter, revenue for our software solutions grew double digits. We continue to see increased demand in next-generation technology design as the complexity of that design increases and design cycles accelerate. Our long-term strategy to drive growth in services is also yielding results. Services orders grew double digits, and revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by calibration, remarketed solutions and repair.
Customer success in providing leading-edge technology, solutions and insights is at the core of Keysight's leadership model. The growth we have achieved over the past several quarters would not have been possible without our commitment to innovation and the continued targeted investments we have made over the past several years. We have significantly strengthened our technology leadership in key areas of the market undergoing multiyear transformations and growth trends. We will continue to focus our investments in these key growth areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market.
Lastly, we have an amazing team at Keysight and I thank them for their commitment to both our company and our customers. Attracting and fostering and retaining top talent across the globe as well as creating a culture of diversity and inclusion will be contributing factors to our future success. 
Demonstrating KLM in action this quarter, I would highlight the career comeback program we have in Malaysia where our largest manufacturing facility is located along with a sizable R&D center. I am proud to say that through this program we have a growing number of mothers who have returned to the workforce bringing their expertise to the company in various areas, including electrical engineering, software development, human resources and supply chain.
We look forward to sharing with you the success of the Keysight Leadership Model in the quarters and years to come. 
I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.
As Ron mentioned, we delivered an exceptional quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business. Additionally, our continued focus, execution and commitment to operational discipline is delivering record results for Keysight.
For the third quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1 billion, which was well above our guidance of $942 million to $972 million.
In Q3, we also delivered $1 billion in orders, which were up 15% with core orders growing 12%, enabling us to exit the quarter in a solid backlog position.
Looking at our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 61.2% and operating expenses of $402 million, resulting in operating margin of 21.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history. We also achieved record net income of $170 million and delivered $0.89 in earnings per share, which was up 45%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, generated total revenue of $515 million, up 23%, while delivering gross margin of 61.7% and operating margin of 22.2%. 
In Q3, commercial communications delivered revenue of $314 million, up 23%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center next-generation 400-gig and high-speed digital test. 
Aerospace, defense and government grew 22% and generated revenue of $201 million.
As Ron mentioned, aerospace, defense and government growth was robust with strong demand across the aerospace defense supply chain, including space, satellite, radar and electric -- electronic warfare applications.
Our Electronic Industrial Group, or EISG, generated third quarter revenue of $258 million, up 19%, driven by strength across all of its markets, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 63.1% and operating margin of 28.5%. 
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q3 revenue of $119 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 8.1%. We were pleased with ISG's improved revenue performance after our extensive integration activities last quarter. We continue to focus on optimizing processes in several key areas and are confident in our ability to grow the business and increase profitability.
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 9% in Q3 to reach $116 million, while delivering 40.1% gross margin and operating margin of 15.0%. Q3 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $742 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $38 million and free cash flow of negative $2 million. This includes accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan in the amount of $85 million in order to secure tax deductibility at the current corporate rate prior to the new tax legislation taking effect. Excluding this accelerated payment, free cash flow was $83 million, which represents 8% of revenue.
Under our existing share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 668,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $59.81 for a total consideration of $40 million.
Before moving to our guidance, I would like to make a few additional comments about the potential impact on our business from trade tensions between the U.S. and China. We currently estimate that the expense impact from the announced tariffs is still relatively immaterial. We're also closely monitoring the potential impact of these tensions on our aerospace and defense business in China, which we currently estimate at $10 million to $15 million per quarter.
As Ron mentioned, we believe this will be offset by the strong demand trends we are seeing in the rest of the world aerospace defense market.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,000,000,000 to $1,020,000,000 and Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.91 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares.
At the midpoint, this brings our earnings growth for 2018 to 23% and total revenue growth to approximately 19% or 11% on a core basis, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%.
Additionally, for the year, we expect to deliver a year-over-year core operating margin incremental at or above our 40% target.
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

So just to reiterate a couple of the points that were made at the -- in the prepared statements from Ron and Neil. So far, as we've looked at the tariffs that have been announced, the impacts are very small, immaterial. And separate from that, the trade tensions are -- and the restrictions are principally affecting our aerospace defense business in China. And as Neil mentioned, based on the current situation, we estimate that impact to be $10 million to $15 million per quarter. Now if you take a step back, and I think Ron mentioned this as well, the strength of our aerospace defense business globally is very strong, and we feel like the rest of the world will offset this impact to China. This is our fourth quarter in a row of double-digit order growth. And we continue to see increased investments around the world, especially the U.S. As Ron mentioned, the U.S. DoD bill, the Defense Appropriation Bill, has been signed before the beginning of the new fiscal year. I think this is the first time that's happened in more than 20 years. And our overall business in aerospace defense remains very broad from satellite to MilCom radio test to electronic warfare and radar test. So it's a very large market, and it's a growing market that we're playing a big role in. And then finally, back to China, just for a moment, we continue to actively monitor the situation and despite the trade tensions, our business in China continues to be strong and broad. We delivered solid double-digit revenue and order growth in Q3, and we're continuing to win in China with our differentiated solutions for 5G, for automotive, for semiconductor, et cetera."

On top of that, from what we can see, we believe very strongly that we are gaining share with our 11% organic revenue growth this year and much, much higher when you look at our total revenue growth.

Keysight delivered a very strong finish to a breakout year with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter.",1210,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a very strong finish to a breakout year with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, fourth quarter revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis to reach a record $1.1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 42% year-over-year EPS growth.
Second, customers continue to make strong R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we continue to achieve broad-based momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. The investments we have made over the past several years in our technology, solutions, software and services are delivering results and have enabled Keysight to be at the forefront and capture the demand we see in the market.
And third, 2018 was an outstanding year for Keysight. Revenue grew 20% to reach a record $3.9 billion. We achieved 13% core revenue growth, which was above our expectation of 11%, and we delivered 28% year-over-year EPS growth for 2018. 
Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the fourth quarter. We achieved $1.01 per share in earnings, which was $0.13 above the midpoint and $0.10 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 42% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 9% in total to surpass $1 billion. This represents our second consecutive quarter of orders above $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 10%. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth and the third quarter out of the last 5 with orders above $1 billion.
Our continued strong order growth has translated into another quarter of record revenue, which was also above $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. Q4 revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis. We're delivering broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business and across our major geographies, including China. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing some expected headwinds in China as a result of global trade tensions, which we expect to continue in 2019. Despite this dynamic, the breadth of our product offering across the diverse set of end markets enabled strong revenue growth in China in Q4. In particular, we saw a good growth in commercial communications, where we had strong differentiation in 5G. 
2018 was a record year for Keysight with total order growth of 20% or 12% on core growth. This our total orders for the year to over $4 billion new milestone for the company. Total revenue grew 20% to a record $3.9 billion. On a core basis, revenue grew 13%, which was above our 11% expectation. We achieved this growth while also delivering our targeted core operating margin incremental, which resulted in $680 million in net income, up 34% over last year. 
Our results through this year were driven by good demands brands and strong execution on plan we implemented 4 years ago to innovate be a leader in our selected markets, create value for our customers and deliver growth profitability. At that time, we made a commitment to deliver annual EPS growth between 8% and 10% on a 4% core revenue growth CAGR, which we expected to achieve in 3 to 4 years. Earlier this year, we increased that target to 10% or greater EPS growth. I'm pleased to report to you today that within 3 years time we not only met that target, we exceeded it and delivered 28% EPS growth in 2018.
Creating value for our customers by providing leading-edge technology solutions and insights that help them be at the forefront of innovation is the cornerstone of our strategy and the Keysight leadership model. The targeted investments we have made over the past several years in software and services and key areas of the market undergoing multiyear transformations are delivering results. 
Let me share some data points with you that illustrate our growth in a few of our focus areas. Revenue for our Software Solutions grew strong double digits in 2018 and represents greater than 15% of our total revenue. This growth was driven by strong demand for our 5G solutions, high-frequency measurement application software and digital and photonic application software as well as the addition of ISG. 
In services, we achieved all-time high for both orders and revenue, as well as record double-digit order and revenue growth for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Services are increasingly important element of our solution-centric engagement model with customers. We are building momentum in services as we increase full solution sales in key end markets such as automotive and 5G. 
In automotive and energy, customer demand remains high, and we delivered eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth with strong growth across multiple applications. During the quarter, growth from our top accounts was enhanced by wins with many new customers. 
In 5G, we are leading and delivering very strong growth in Q4, resulting in record 5G orders. Our broad portfolio 5G solutions and engagement with leading market makers continues to strengthen Keysight's leading position in this fast-growing market. We continue to see major operator ecosystems embrace the Keysight platform. This quarter, we received endorsements from China telecom and SK telecom. The scalability of our platform combined with Keysight's team, ability to keep pace with the fast-evolving standard needs positions us for future success as 5G deployment scale. Additionally, our Ixia Solutions Group secured an important new 5G orders with leading mobile operators in Japan, Korea, China and the U.S. 
It is exciting to see ISG's recently launched 5G solutions gain momentum with the Tier 1 accounts. Our combined technologies enabled Keysight to deliver 4 end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technology continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. The contract manufacturing transition continues to take longer than we expected. 
That said, we have continued to make progress in optimizing the ISG business post-integration and order strengthen in the quarter for both disability and test.
We are confident in the plan we had to create long-term shareholder value. In summary, 2018 has been a year of great success and strong revenue and earnings growth. As we look ahead, we believe Keysight is well positioned to expand our leadership as our markets evolve. We have built a robust innovation engine and a broad portfolio of solutions that spans multiple segments. 
Our solution-centric approach to the market builds deep customer relationships that pure innovation and customer success. We will continue to focus our investments in these key areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market. 
Importantly, we have maintained our strong focus on financial discipline and operational excellence to drive earnings growth, while investing in key areas of the business. 
Before I turn the call over to Neil, I would like to thank every member of Keysight's team for their dedication and hard work that made our record 2018 results possible. I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute on the demand w",985,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.
As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute on the demand we see in core areas of our business. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1,051 million, which was above our guidance of $1 billion to $1,020,000,000. We also delivered $1.1 billion in orders in the quarter, which were up 9% in total and 10% on a core basis. 
Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 61% and operating expenses of $408 million, resulting in operating margin of 22.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history.
We also achieved record net income of $193 million and delivered $1.01 in earnings per share, which was up 42%. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $114 million. In conjunction with our annual financial planning cycle and asset impairment review, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $700 million net of tax, primarily due to weaker-than-expected market dynamics experienced in the Ixia Solutions Group. While this is disappointing, the Ixia Business is a valuable asset in the Keysight portfolio. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities created by combining Ixia's strength and networking and Keysight's strength in wireless and physical test. 
Our combined technologies enabled Keysight to deliver 4 end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technologies continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. 
Moving to performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, generated total revenue of $566 million, up 23%, while delivering record gross margin of 63.7% and record operating margin of 27%. In Q4, Commercial Communications delivered strong double-digit order growth and record revenue of $357 million, up 28%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center next-generation 400-gigabit and high-speed digital test.
Aerospace, defense and government grew 15% and generated revenue of $209 million. Aerospace, defense and government growth was driven by continued strong demand across the aerospace, defense supply chain, including space, satellite, cybersecurity, radar and electronic warfare applications. For the year, CSG revenue grew 17% to reach a record $2 billion. 
Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated fourth quarter revenue of $249 million, up a record 21%, driven by strength across all of its markets, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 60.6% and operating margin of 26%.
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q4 revenue of $115 million, gross margin of 70.5% and breakeven operating profit. ISG orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year and double-digit sequentially, driven by 5G wins as well as increased 400-gigabit and visibility sales. We were encouraged to see another quarter of improved sales execution, but as Ron mentioned, the contract manufacturing transaction is ongoing, which impacted ISG's Q4 revenue and operating results. 
We remain confident in our ability to work through these challenges, grow the business and increase profitability. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 10% in Q4 to reach a record $121 million, while delivering 40.9% gross margin and operating margin of 13%. Q4 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. This brings SSG revenue for the year to $461 million, up 10% over last year as our pivot to an organic growth strategy takes hold. 
As Ron highlighted, we are pleased with the performance and execution as a company for the 2018 fiscal year. Revenue for the year totaled $3.9 billion and gross margin improved 70 basis points to 60.7%. To fuel innovation and further strengthen our market position in strategic areas, we continue to invest, while at the same time, remain within our operating model. We achieved our core operating margin incremental target for the year and achieved 20% operating margin. This translated to strong 28% earnings growth and reported non-GAAP net income after taxes of $618 million or $3.24 per share for the full year. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $913 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $235 million and free cash flow of $201 million, which represents 19% of revenue. This brings our free cash flow for the year to $423 million or 11% of revenue, which includes the one-time $85 million accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan that we discussed last quarter. 
Under our existing share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 634,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $63.11 for a total consideration of $40 million. This brings our total repurchases for the year to approximately 2 million shares at an average price of $57.91 for total consideration of $120 million.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect first quarter 2019 revenue to be in the range of $965 million to $985 million and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76  to $0.82 based on weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. 
For 2019 modeling purposes, I would like to remind you that the quarterly revenue seasonality in the first half of 2018 was heavily skewed towards Q2 as a result of the closure of our facility due to last year's wildfires. Historically, sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 has averaged mid-single digits. With regard to our tax rate, based on our latest assessment of the benefits of tax reform, we are currently modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '19, reduction of 3 percentage points from our prior rate of 15%. 
With that, I will now turn lit back to Jason for the Q&A."

And that feeds into our Commercial Communications business, which is also very strong as we reported revenue for overall for China. And that was a bit of a surprise how strong that was, but our Services Business, for instance, has grown double digits throughout the year. On top of that, our automotive business have grown very strong. So when we look at, for instance, our revenue growth of CSG of 23%, we see also EISG at 21%, SSG at 10%. All of those are doing well, but EISG and SSG driven primarily from Commercial Communications and automotive seem to be strong.

And we've -- we've multifaceted plan to go after this. One, we put new leadership in place with Mark Pierpoint to lead that group, and that's working out very well. We've completed our transition and integration to a new sales platform that will help make sales much more integrated and also share on the information to really accelerate our revenue synergies, which are starting to pop up with Satish in our General Communications Solutions Group. We've seen improvements in our order flow, in our conversion throughout the quarter. And as we reported, the mid-single-digit growth for ISG in orders this past quarter and double-digit growth in orders sequentially. But we are consolidating CM supply chain, and we're transferring about 75 products and major products, I should say. And although they are not new products, it's a whole new process that we're putting into this CM. And what it will do, it will improve the quality and lower the cost to provide great performance in the long term. So that's what's going on. Still a lot of confidence in the business. We recently introduced new solution to solution for 400 gig, it is solution to grow it into our business need compared to the competition, it's a very, very strong. So we're excited about that.

Well, first of all, I just want to say as you said, people the company should be happy. We just set that a note that our employees have variable pay based on their a performance, and they are receiving a record of bonuses for this record performance during the last year and there is nothing that makes me feel happier than to be able to share the successes with all the employees that are working very hard. Second, with regard to the growth initiatives, one of the things that we looked at when we set this roughly 4 years ago was to look for a secular growth trend that last at least a decade and typically 2-plus. And that's what we're seeing in 5G as well as in commercial comps, and we're seeing in automotive with et cetera. And these trends are going to go on for a long period of time before you see automotive get to Level 5 and there is plenty, plenty of opportunity for us as this gets implemented and safety becomes extremely important and there are multiple technologies that are utilized. 5G, it's the same thing before that gets implemented around the world. A lot of times we forget and we think of how fast the U.S. is moving or how fast, for instance, China is moving right now and other countries. The world is much bigger and nobody -- many, many countries that will utilize this technology, that will not see it for many years, but we're starting to see some countries that will be seeing their first rollouts very soon. So we're really excited that you will see these growth initiatives and what we have going on for another decade, at least. And again, we will also look as we continue to build those out and more, but right now there is such a opportunity and a goldmine in these applications, we're focusing and it's providing us the growth that we have promised and then some as well as the earnings growth, which is our ultimate job."

The 2 other segments and there are obviously semiconductor and general electronics, the general electronics business is really extraordinarily diversed set of business. It's probably the most tightly linked to the overall macro environment. And so there is no one single driver in that business, but as long as the macroeconomy stay strong and electronics in general, are doing well, we'll continue to generate strong revenues in general electronics business. And lastly semiconductor, we've been cautious about semi for several quarters in a row. We did put up really strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, but orders in the fourth quarter, as we expected, were down in the fourth quarter.

We do a very valuable asset, asset within our portfolio. That said, in conjunction with our annual financial planning processes and our annual review of our asset base, we did take the goodwill impairment charge really driven by 2 primary factors. The first is that a test and visibility markets have really seen moderated growth rates since that time of the acquisition relative to our expectations. And at least as we look forward, we expect those moderated growth rates to continue forward at least a period of time. Second factor is one that we talked about in the past, obviously we did have a bit of a disruption to our revenues in the second quarter of this year as part of this contract manufacturer transition. And as we talked about that transition, it's still ongoing. To answer to the second part of your question, we don't believe that you're going to face any additional impairment, because we have again the multifaceted plan in place to improve this business. We're getting traction in the marketplace, Ron talked about the increasing sales velocity, we talked about the driving orders with the new 400 gig solution and the new 5G solution, we got a new Wi-Fi solution coming out in the spring. And so as we get these new technologies to market and we have the opportunity to combine, the capabilities of Keysight and Ixia together, we believe that we can generate value at this asset."

We see growth across the ecosystem, we've seen strong orders and adoption of our 5G platform from chipset providers, device makers, NEMs and operators back.

Keysight delivered a very strong finish to a breakout year with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter.",1219,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a very strong finish to a breakout year with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, fourth quarter revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis to reach a record $1.1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 42% year-over-year EPS growth.
Second, customers continue to make strong R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we continue to achieve broad-based momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. The investments we had made over the past several years in our technology, solutions, software and services are delivering results and have enabled Keysight to be at the forefront and capture the demand we see in the market.
And third, 2018 was an outstanding year for Keysight. Revenue grew 20% to reach a record $3.9 billion. We achieved 13% core revenue growth, which was above our expectation of 11%, and we delivered 28% year-over-year EPS growth for 2018. 
Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the fourth quarter. We achieved $1.01 per share in earnings, which was $0.13 above the midpoint and $0.10 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 42% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 9% in total to surpass $1 billion. This represents our second consecutive quarter of orders above $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 10%. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth and the third quarter out of the last 5 with orders above $1 billion.
Our continued strong order growth has translated into another quarter of record revenue, which was also above $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. Q4 revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis. We're delivering broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business and across our major geographies, including China. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing some expected headwinds in China as a result of global trade tensions, which we expect to continue in 2019. Despite this dynamic, the breadth of our product offering across the diverse set of end markets enabled strong revenue growth in China in Q4. In particular, we saw a good growth in commercial communications, where we had strong differentiation in 5G. 
2018 was a record year for Keysight with total order growth of 20% or 12% on core growth. This brought our total orders for the year to over $4 billion, a new milestone for the company. Total revenue grew 20% to a record $3.9 billion. On a core basis, revenue grew 13%, which was above our 11% expectation. We achieved this growth while also delivering our targeted core operating margin incremental, which resulted in $618 million in net income, up 34% over last year. 
Our results for this year were driven by good demands trends and strong execution on the plan we implemented 4 years ago to innovate and be a leader in our selected markets, create value for our customers and deliver growth profitably. At that time, we made the commitment to deliver annual EPS growth between 8% and 10% on a 4% core revenue growth CAGR, which we expected to achieve in 3 to 4 years. Earlier this year, we increased that target to 10% or greater EPS growth. I am pleased to report to you today that within 3 years time we not only met that target, we exceeded it and delivered 28% EPS growth in 2018.
Creating value for our customers by providing leading edge technology solutions and insights that help them be at the forefront of innovation is the cornerstone of our strategy and the Keysight leadership model. The targeted investments we have made over the past several years in software and services, and key areas of the market undergoing multiyear transformations are delivering results. 
Let me share some data points with you that illustrate our growth in a few of our focus areas. Revenue for our software solutions grew strong double digits in 2018 and represents greater than 15% of our total revenue. This growth was driven by strong demand for our 5G solutions, high-frequency measurement application software and digital and photonic application software as well as the addition of ISG. 
In services, we achieved all-time high for both orders and revenue, as well as record double-digit order and revenue growth for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Services are an increasingly important element of our solution-centric engagement model with customers. We are building momentum in services as we increase full solution sales in key end markets such as automotive and 5G. 
In automotive and energy, customer demand remains high, and we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth with strong growth across multiple applications. During the quarter, growth from our top accounts was enhanced by wins with many new customers. 
In 5G, we are leading and delivering very strong growth in Q4, resulting in record 5G orders. Our broad portfolio of 5G solutions and engagement with leading market makers continues to strengthen Keysight's leading position in this fast-growing market. We continue to see major operator ecosystems embrace the Keysight platform. This quarter, we received endorsements from China Telecom and SK telecom. The scalability of our platform combined with Keysight's team ability to keep pace with the fast-evolving standard needs positions us for future success as 5G deployment scale. Additionally, our Ixia Solutions Group secured important new 5G orders with leading mobile operators in Japan, Korea, China and The U.S. 
It is exciting to see ISG's recently launched 5G solutions gain momentum with these Tier 1 accounts. Our combined technologies enabled Keysight to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technologies continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. The contract manufacturing transition continues to take longer than we expected. 
That said, we have continue to make progress in optimizing the ISG business post-integration and order strengthen in the quarter for both visibility and test.
We are confident in the plan we have to create long-term shareholder value. In summary, 2018 has been a year of great success and strong revenue and earnings growth. As we look ahead, we believe Keysight is well positioned to expand our leadership as our markets evolve. We have built a robust innovation engine and a broad portfolio of solutions that spans multiple segments. 
Our solution-centric approach to the market builds deep customer relationships that fuel innovation and customer success. We will continue to focus our investments in these key areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market. 
Importantly, we have maintained our strong focus on financial discipline and operational excellence to drive earnings growth, while investing in key areas of the business. 
Before I turn the call over to Neil, I would like to thank every member of Keysight's team for their dedication and hard work that made our record 2018 results possible. I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute on the demand w",992,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.
As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute on the demand we see in core areas of our business. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1,051,000,000, which was above our guidance of $1 billion to $1,020,000,000. We also delivered $1.1 billion in orders in the quarter, which were up 9% in total and 10% on a core basis. 
Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 61% and operating expenses of $408 million, resulting in operating margin of 22.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history.
We also achieved record net income of $193 million and delivered $1.01 in earnings per share, which was up 42%. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $114 million. In conjunction with our annual financial planning cycle and asset impairment review, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $700 million net of tax, primarily due to weaker-than-expected market dynamics experienced in the Ixia Solutions Group. While this is disappointing, the Ixia Business is a valuable asset in the Keysight portfolio. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities created by combining Ixia's strength in networking and Keysight's strength in wireless and physical layer test. 
Our combined technologies enable Keysight to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technologies continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, generated total revenue of $566 million, up 23%, while delivering record gross margin of 63.7% and record operating margin of 27%. In Q4, Commercial Communications delivered strong double-digit order growth and record revenue of $357 million, up 28%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center next-generation 400-gigabit and high-speed digital test.
Aerospace defense and government grew 15% and generated revenue of $209 million. Aerospace defense and government growth was driven by continued strong demand across the aerospace, defense supply chain, including space, satellite, cybersecurity, radar and electronic warfare applications. For the year, CSG revenue grew 17% to reach a record $2 billion. 
Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated fourth quarter revenue of $249 million, up a record 21%, driven by strength across all of its markets, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 60.6% and operating margin of 26%.
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q4 revenue of $115 million, gross margin of 70.5% and breakeven operating profit. ISG orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year and double-digit sequentially, driven by 5G wins as well as increased 400-gigabit and visibility sales. We were encouraged to see another quarter of improved sales execution, but as Ron mentioned, the contract manufacturing transition is ongoing, which impacted ISG's Q4 revenue and operating results. 
We remain confident in our ability to work through these challenges, grow the business and increase profitability. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 10% in Q4 to reach a record $121 million, while delivering 40.9% gross margin and an operating margin of 13%. Q4 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. This brings SSG revenue for the year to $461 million, up 10% over last year as our pivot to an organic growth strategy takes hold. 
As Ron highlighted, we are pleased with our performance and execution as a company for the 2018 fiscal year. Revenue for the year totaled $3.9 billion and gross margin improved 70 basis points to 60.7%. To fuel innovation and further strengthen our market position in strategic areas, we continue to invest, while at the same time, remain within our operating model. We achieved our core operating margin incremental target for the year and achieved 20% operating margin. This translated to strong 28% earnings growth and reported non-GAAP net income after taxes of $618 million or $3.24 per share for the full year. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $913 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $235 million and free cash flow of $201 million, which represents 19% of revenue. This brings our free cash flow for the year to $423 million or 11% of revenue, which includes the onetime $85 million accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan that we discussed last quarter. 
Under existing share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 634,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $63.11 for a total consideration of $40 million. This brings our total repurchases for the year to approximately 2 million shares at an average price of $57.91 for a total consideration of $120 million.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect first quarter 2019 revenue to be in the range of $965 million to $985 million and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76  to $0.82 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. 
For 2019 modeling purposes, I would like to remind you that the quarterly revenue seasonality in the first half of 2018 was heavily skewed towards Q2 as a result of the closure of our Santa Rosa facility due to last year's wildfires. Historically, sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 has averaged mid-single digits. With regard to our tax rate, based on our latest assessment of the benefits of tax reform, we are currently modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '19, a or reduction of 3 percentage points from our prior rate of 15%. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

And that feeds into our commercial communications business, which is also very strong as we reported our revenue for overall for China. That was a bit of a surprise how strong that was, but our services business, for instance, has grown double digits throughout the year. On top of that, our automotive business has grown very strong. So when we look at, for instance, revenue growth of CSG of 23%, we see also EISG at 21%, SSG at 10%. All of those are doing well, but EISG and SSG driven primarily from commercial communications and automotive seem to be strong. There's is no doubt that we do have a tough compare compared to with this last year, which the performance was so much better than the year before, but we actually see upside to that 4% to 5%.

The Ixia integration has become a bigger job than we had thought it originally. We're making excellent progress, but it's taking longer than we originally thought. And we have a -- we've a multifaceted plan to go after this. One, we put new leadership in place with Mark Pierpoint to lead that group, and that's working out very well. We've completed our transition and integration to a new sales platform that will help make sales much more integrated and also share on the information to really accelerate our revenue synergies, which are starting to pop up with Satish in our general Communications Solutions Group. We've seen improvements in our order flow, in our funnel conversion throughout the quarter. And as we reported, we had mid-single-digit growth for ISG in orders this past quarter and double-digit growth in orders sequentially. But we are consolidating the CM supply chain, and we're transferring about 75 products and major products, I should say. And although they're not new products, it's a whole new process that we're putting into this CM. And what it will do, it will improve the quality and lower the cost to provide great performance in the long term. So that's what's going on. We still have a lot of confidence in the business. We recently introduced new solution, the AresONE solution for 400 gig, it is the denser solution to go ahead and to address this need. Compared to the competition, it's very, very strong. So we're excited about that. And now, I'll turn it over to Neil, who could talk a little bit about the guidance and the financials for Ixia."

Second, with regard to the growth initiatives, one of the things that we looked at when we set this up roughly 4 years ago was to look for a secular growth trend that last at least a decade and typically 2 plus. And that's what we're seeing in 5G as well as in commercial comps, and we're seeing it in automotive with ADAS, et cetera, and these trends are going to go on for a long period of time before you see automotive get to Level 5, and there is plenty, plenty of opportunity for us as this gets implemented and safety becomes extremely important and there are multiple technologies that are utilized. 5G, it's the same thing before that gets implemented around the world. A lot of times we forget and we think of how fast The U.S. is moving or how fast, for instance, China is moving right now and other countries. The world is much bigger and nobody -- there's many, many countries that will utilize this technology, that will not see it for many years, but we're starting to see some countries that will be seeing their first rollouts very soon. So we're really excited that you'll see these growth initiatives and what we have going on for another decade, at least. And again, we will also look as we continue to build those out to add more, but right now there is such a opportunity and a gold mine in these applications, we're focusing and it's providing us the growth that we had promised and then some as well as the earnings growth, which is our ultimate job."

The general electronics business is really extraordinarily diverse set of business. It's probably the most tightly linked to the overall macro environment. And so there is no one single driver in that business, but as long as the macro economy stay strong and electronics in general, are doing well, we'll continue to generate strong revenues in our general electronics business. And lastly, semiconductor, we've been cautious about semi for several quarters in a row.

And it -- yes, about 6 months to bring resources on board, but it's happening over multiple phases across multiple parts of our business. Last year, at the beginning of our fiscal year, we deployed the first global services sales organization within Keysight. So we've had our first year of having a focus sales organization. And as you heard from Ron's comments earlier, we delivered record high order growth during the year, 30% order growth in Q4, 22% growth for the entire year. So it is working. The other subtlety here is we're really putting a lot of focus across all of Keysight global sales on selling services, not just a dedicated sales team that sells value-added services. We put a lot of focus on upfront services sales. So that means when you sell a piece of equipment or a solution, we're selling more services upfront, and that's really helping us to drive growth now and over time, because a lot of this will be reoccurring. And then across the board, our services business for multivendor repair and cal is up, our remarketed equipment sales are up, and I think it's a direct result of us being successful with our organic services capability as well as deploying a sales organization that is capable of selling services."

Adam, we -- I think, we've been talking about new customer acquisition for several quarters now, and we have acquired several thousand new customers overall during the course of the last 12 months during our last fiscal year. That is an explicit focus across the board, including automotive. One of the vehicles, no pun intended, we're using to find and capture new customers is putting customers solution centers, where the customers are located. A year ago, we opened up our solution center right outside Detroit. It's been very successful. We have regular interaction with both new and existing customers there. And just last month or back in October, I should say, we opened up another new center in Shanghai, China, and that complements our capabilities that exist today in Bochum, Germany, in the Bay Area and other locations. So we're going to continue to deploy this strategy, it brings customers and innovators within Keysight together and it's really working very well. The other just comment I'lI make is that the additive function of Scienlab to our portfolio is making a big difference in terms of finding new customers, especially on the Tier 1 OEM side, where we have new solutions for that particular set of customers."

Well, I'd start by saying that obviously the noncash goodwill impairment charges, it does not change our confidence in ISG and the business and our strategy about bringing networking and wireless together within Keysight. We do -- we view ISG as a very valuable asset within our portfolio. That said, in conjunction with our annual financial planning processes and our annual review of our asset base, we did take the goodwill impairment charge really driven by 2 primary factors. The first is that the test and visibility markets have really seen moderated growth rates since the time of the acquisition relative to our expectations. And at least as we look forward, we expect those moderated growth rates to continue for at least a period of time. Second factor is one that we've talked about in the past. Obviously, we did have a bit of a disruption to our revenues in the second quarter of this year as part of this contract manufacturer transition. And as we talked about that, that transition is still ongoing. To answer the second part of your question, we don't believe that we're going to face any additional impairment, because we have, again, the multifaceted plan in place to improve this business. We are getting traction in the marketplace. Ron talked about the increasing sales velocity. We talked about the ability -- the driving orders with the new 400 gig ethernet solution, the new 5G solution, we got a new Wi-Fi solution coming out in the spring.

Keysight delivered a very strong finish to a breakout year with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter.",1220,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a very strong finish to a breakout year with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, fourth quarter revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis to reach a record $1.1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 42% year-over-year EPS growth.
Second, customers continued to make strong R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we continue to achieve broad-based momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. The investments we had made over the past several years in our technology, solutions, software and services are delivering results and have enabled Keysight to be at the forefront and capture the demand we see in the market.
And third, 2018 was an outstanding year for Keysight. Revenue grew 20% to reach a record $3.9 billion. We achieved 13% core revenue growth, which was above our expectation of 11%, and we delivered 28% year-over-year EPS growth for 2018. 
Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the fourth quarter. We achieved $1.01 per share in earnings, which was $0.13 above the midpoint and $0.10 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 42% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 9% in total to surpass $1 billion. This represents our second consecutive quarter of orders above $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 10%. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth and the third quarter out of the last 5 with orders above $1 billion.
Our continued strong order growth has translated into another quarter of record revenue, which was also above $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. Q4 revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis. We are delivering broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business and across our major geographies, including China. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing some expected headwinds in China as a result of global trade tensions, which we expect to continue in 2019. Despite this dynamic, the breadth of our product offering across the diverse set of end markets enabled strong revenue growth in China in Q4. In particular, we saw a good growth in commercial communications, where we had strong differentiation in 5G. 
2018 was a record year for Keysight with total order growth of 20% or 12% on core growth. This brought our total orders for the year to over $4 billion, a new milestone for the company. Total revenue grew 20% to a record $3.9 billion. On a core basis, revenue grew 13%, which was above our 11% expectation. We achieved this growth while also delivering our targeted core operating margin incremental, which resulted in $618 million in net income, up 34% over last year. 
Our results for this year were driven by good demands trends and strong execution on the plan we implemented 4 years ago to innovate and be a leader in our selected markets, create value for our customers and deliver growth profitably. At that time, we made the commitment to deliver annual EPS growth between 8% and 10% on a 4% core revenue growth CAGR, which we expected to achieve in 3 to 4 years. Earlier this year, we increased that target to 10% or greater EPS growth. I am pleased to report to you today that within 3 years' time we not only met that target, we exceeded it and delivered 28% EPS growth in 2018.
Creating value for our customers by providing leading edge technology solutions and insights that help them be at the forefront of innovation is the cornerstone of our strategy and the Keysight leadership model. The targeted investments we have made over the past several years in software and services, and key areas of the market undergoing multiyear transformations are delivering results. 
Let me share some data points with you that illustrate our growth in a few of our focus areas. Revenue for our software solutions grew strong double digits in 2018 and represents greater than 15% of our total revenue. This growth was driven by strong demand for our 5G solutions, high-frequency measurement application software and digital and photonic application software as well as the addition of ISG. 
In services, we achieved all-time high for both orders and revenue, as well as record double-digit order and revenue growth for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Services are an increasingly important element of our solution-centric engagement model with customers. We are building momentum in services as we increase full solution sales in key end markets such as automotive and 5G. 
In automotive and energy, customer demand remained high, and we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth with strong growth across multiple applications. During the quarter, growth from our top accounts was enhanced by wins with many new customers. 
In 5G, we are leading and delivering very strong growth in Q4, resulting in record 5G orders. Our broad portfolio of 5G solutions and engagement with leading market makers continues to strengthen Keysight's leading position in this fast-growing market. We continue to see major operator ecosystems embrace the Keysight platform. This quarter, we received endorsements from China Telecom and SK telecom. The scalability of our platform combined with Keysight's team's ability to keep pace with the fast-evolving standards needs positions us for future success as 5G deployments scale. Additionally, our Ixia Solutions Group secured important new 5G orders with leading mobile operators in Japan, Korea, China and the U.S. 
It is exciting to see ISG's recently launched 5G solutions gain momentum with these Tier 1 accounts. Our combined technologies enabled Keysight to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technologies continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. The contract manufacturing transition continues to take longer than we expected. 
That said, we have continued to make progress in optimizing the ISG business post-integration and orders strengthened in the quarter for both visibility and test.
We are confident in the plan we have to create long-term shareholder value. 
In summary, 2018 has been a year of great success and strong revenue and earnings growth. As we look ahead, we believe Keysight is well positioned to expand our leadership as our markets evolve. We have built a robust innovation engine and a broad portfolio of solutions that spans multiple segments. 
Our solution-centric approach to the market builds deep customer relationships that fuel innovation and customer success. We will continue to focus our investments in these key areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market. 
Importantly, we have maintained our strong focus on financial discipline and operational excellence to drive earnings growth, while investing in key areas of the business. 
Before I turn the call over to Neil, I would like to thank every member of Keysight's team for their dedication and hard work that made our record 2018 results possible. I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continued to execute on the demand",991,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.
As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continued to execute on the demand we see in core areas of our business. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1,051,000,000, which was above our guidance of $1 billion to $1,020,000,000. We also delivered $1.1 billion in orders in the quarter, which were up 9% in total and 10% on a core basis. 
Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 61% and operating expenses of $408 million, resulting in operating margin of 22.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history.
We also achieved record net income of $193 million and delivered $1.01 in earnings per share, which was up 42%. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $114 million. In conjunction with our annual financial planning cycle and asset impairment review, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $700 million net of tax, primarily due to weaker-than-expected market dynamics experienced in the Ixia Solutions Group. While this is disappointing, the Ixia Business is a valuable asset in the Keysight portfolio. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities created by combining Ixia's strength in networking and Keysight's strength in wireless and physical layer test. 
Our combined technologies enable Keysight to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technologies continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, generated total revenue of $566 million, up 23%, while delivering record gross margin of 63.7% and record operating margin of 27%. In Q4, Commercial Communications delivered strong double-digit order growth and record revenue of $357 million, up 28%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center next-generation 400-gigabit and high-speed digital test.
Aerospace defense and government grew 15% and generated revenue of $209 million. Aerospace defense and government growth was driven by continued strong demand across the aerospace, defense supply chain, including space, satellite, cybersecurity, radar and electronic warfare applications. For the year, CSG revenue grew 17% to reach a record $2 billion. 
Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated fourth quarter revenue of $249 million, up a record 21%, driven by strength across all of its markets, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 60.6% and operating margin of 26%.
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q4 revenue of $115 million, gross margin of 70.5% and breakeven operating profit. ISG orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year and double-digit sequentially, driven by 5G wins as well as increased 400-gigabit and visibility sales. We were encouraged to see another quarter of improved sales execution, but as Ron mentioned, the contract manufacturing transition is ongoing, which impacted ISG's Q4 revenue and operating results. 
We remain confident in our ability to work through these challenges, grow the business and increase profitability. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 10% in Q4 to reach a record $121 million, while delivering 40.9% gross margin and an operating margin of 13%. Q4 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. This brings SSG revenue for the year to $461 million, up 10% over last year as our pivot to an organic growth strategy takes hold. 
As Ron highlighted, we are pleased with our performance and execution as a company for the 2018 fiscal year. Revenue for the year totaled $3.9 billion and gross margin improved 70 basis points to 60.7%. To fuel innovation and further strengthen our market position in strategic areas, we continue to invest, while at the same time, remain within our operating model. We achieved our core operating margin incremental target for the year and achieved 20% operating margin. This translated to strong 28% earnings growth and reported non-GAAP net income after taxes of $618 million or $3.24 per share for the full year. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $913 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $235 million and free cash flow of $201 million, which represents 19% of revenue. This brings our free cash flow for the year to $423 million or 11% of revenue, which includes the onetime $85 million accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan that we discussed last quarter. 
Under existing share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 634,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $63.11 for a total consideration of $40 million. This brings our total repurchases for the year to approximately 2 million shares at an average price of $57.91 for a total consideration of $120 million.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect first quarter 2019 revenue to be in the range of $965 million to $985 million and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76  to $0.82 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. 
For 2019 modeling purposes, I would like to remind you that the quarterly revenue seasonality in the first half of 2018 was heavily skewed towards Q2 as a result of the closure of our Santa Rosa facility due to last year's wildfires. Historically, sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 has averaged mid-single digits. With regard to our tax rate, based on our latest assessment of the benefits of tax reform, we are currently modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '19, a reduction of 3 percentage points from our prior rate of 15%. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

And that feeds into our commercial communications business, which is also very strong as we reported our revenue for -- overall for China. That was a bit of a surprise how strong that was, but our services business, for instance, has grown double digits throughout the year. On top of that, our automotive business has grown very strong. So when we look at, for instance, revenue growth of CSG of 23%, we see also EISG at 21%, SSG at 10%. All of those are doing well, but EISG and SSG driven primarily from commercial communications and automotive seem to be strong. There's is no doubt that we do have a tough compare compared to with this last year, which the performance was so much better than the year before, but we actually see upside to that 4% to 5%.

The Ixia integration has become a bigger job than we had thought it originally. We're making excellent progress, but it's taking longer than we originally thought. And we have a -- we've a multifaceted plan to go after this. One, we put new leadership in place with Mark Pierpoint to lead that group, and that's working out very well. We've completed our transition and integration to a new sales platform that will help make sales much more integrated and also share on the information to really accelerate our revenue synergies, which are starting to pop up with Satish in our general Communications Solutions Group. We've seen improvements in our order flow, in our funnel conversion throughout the quarter. And as we reported, we had mid-single-digit growth for ISG in orders this past quarter and double-digit growth in orders sequentially. But we are consolidating the CM supply chain, and we're transferring about 75 products and major products, I should say. And although they're not new products, it's a whole new process that we're putting into this CM. And what it will do, it will improve the quality and lower the cost to provide great performance in the long term. So that's what's going on. We still have a lot of confidence in the business. We recently introduced new solution, the AresONE solution for 400-gig, it is the densest solution to go ahead and to address this need. Compared to the competition, it's very, very strong. So we're excited about that. And now, I'll turn it over to Neil, who could talk a little bit about the guidance and the financials for Ixia."

Our ability to sort of keep pace with the needs of the entire ecosystem is a big differentiator, and you can see that in our continued momentum of 5G orders in the company. We are into -- in conversations with lead customers today, because of the fact that we have the entire 5G stack end-to-end.

We just sent out a note that our employees have variable pay based on their performance, and they're receiving record bonuses for this record performance during the last year, and there is nothing that makes me feel happier than to be able to share this success with all the employees that are working very hard. Second, with regard to the growth initiatives, one of the things that we looked at when we set this up roughly 4 years ago was to look for a secular growth trend that last at least a decade and typically 2-plus. And that's what we're seeing in 5G as well as in commercial comms, and we're seeing it in automotive with ADAS, et cetera, and these trends are going to go on for a long period of time before you see automotive get to Level 5, and there is plenty, plenty of opportunity for us as this gets implemented and safety becomes extremely important and there are multiple technologies that are utilized. 5G, it's the same thing before that gets implemented around the world. A lot of times we forget and we think of how fast The U.S. is moving or how fast, for instance, China is moving right now, and other countries. The world is much bigger and nobody -- there's many, many countries that will utilize this technology, that will not see it for many years, but we're starting to see some countries that will be seeing their first rollouts very soon. So we're really excited that you'll see these growth initiatives and what we have going on for another decade, at least. And again, we will also look as we continue to build those out to add more, but right now there is such an opportunity and a gold mine in these applications, we're focusing and it's providing us the growth that we had promised and then some as well as the earnings growth, which is our ultimate job."

So just a couple of comments as it relates to subsegments within EISG. As Ron has already indicated with regard to automotive, we really believe that we're in the front end of a multiyear rollout of next-generation auto. And so we just don't see any reason to believe that the growth there is going to subside anytime soon. The 2 other segments in there are obviously semiconductor and general electronics. The general electronics business is a really extraordinarily diverse set of business. It's probably the most tightly linked to the overall macro environment. And so there is no one single driver in that business, but as long as the macro economy stay strong and electronics in general, are doing well, we'll continue to generate strong revenues in our general electronics business. And lastly, semiconductor, we've been cautious about semi for several quarters in a row. We did put up really strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, but orders in the fourth quarter, as we expected, were down in the fourth quarter. And so we are expecting some softness in the semi piece of our business going into next year, but I would remind everybody that semi as a part of Keysight is substantially less than 10% of our overall revenue."

And as you heard from Ron's comments earlier, we delivered record high order growth during the year, 30% order growth in Q4, 22% growth for the entire year. So it is working. The other subtlety here is we're really putting a lot of focus across all of Keysight global sales on selling services, not just a dedicated sales team that sells value-added services. We put a lot of focus on upfront services sales. So that means when you sell a piece of equipment or a solution, we're selling more services upfront, and that's really helping us to drive growth now and over time, because a lot of this will be reoccurring.

A year ago, we opened up our solution center right outside Detroit. It's been very successful. We have regular interaction with both new and existing customers there. And just last month, or back in October, I should say, we opened up another new center in Shanghai, China, and that complements our capabilities that exist today in Bochum, Germany, in the Bay Area and other locations. So we're going to continue to deploy this strategy, it brings customers and innovators within Keysight together and it's really working very well.

Well, I'd start by saying that obviously the noncash goodwill impairment charges, it does not change our confidence in ISG and the business and our strategy about bringing networking and wireless together within Keysight. We do -- we view ISG as a very valuable asset within our portfolio. That said, in conjunction with our annual financial planning processes and our annual review of our asset base, we did take the goodwill impairment charge really driven by 2 primary factors. The first is that the test and visibility markets have really seen moderated growth rates since the time of the acquisition relative to our expectations. And at least as we look forward, we expect those moderated growth rates to continue for at least a period of time. Second factor is one that we've talked about in the past. Obviously, we did have a bit of a disruption to our revenues in the second quarter of this year as part of this contract manufacturer transition. And as we talked about that, that transition is still ongoing. 
To answer the second part of your question, we don't believe that we're going to face any additional impairment, because we have, again, the multifaceted plan in place to improve this business. We are getting traction in the marketplace. Ron talked about the increasing sales velocity. We talked about the ability -- the driving orders with the new 400-gig Ethernet solution, the new 5G solution, we've got a new Wi-Fi solution coming out in the spring. And so as we get these new technologies to market and we have the opportunity to combine the capabilities of Keysight and Ixia together, we believe that we can generate value with this asset."

We've seen strong orders and adoption of our 5G platform from chipset providers, device makers, NEMs and operators. Especially when we work with operators, the challenges they face in deploying 5G go beyond just wireless and go into the aspects of the core network. It's all about the end-to-end equation.

Keysight delivered a very strong finish to a breakout year with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter.",1219,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a very strong finish to a breakout year with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on 3 key headlines for the quarter. First, fourth quarter revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis to reach a record $1.1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 42% year-over-year EPS growth.
Second, customers continued to make strong R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we continue to achieve broad-based momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. The investments we had made over the past several years in our technology, solutions, software and services are delivering results and have enabled Keysight to be at the forefront and capture the demand we see in the market.
And third, 2018 was an outstanding year for Keysight. Revenue grew 20% to reach a record $3.9 billion. We achieved 13% core revenue growth, which was above our expectation of 11%, and we delivered 28% year-over-year EPS growth for 2018. 
Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the fourth quarter. We achieved $1.01 per share in earnings, which was $0.13 above the midpoint and $0.10 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 42% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 9% in total to surpass $1 billion. This represents our second consecutive quarter of orders above $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 10%. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth and the third quarter out of the last 5 with orders above $1 billion.
Our continued strong order growth has translated into another quarter of record revenue, which was also above $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. Q4 revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis. We are delivering broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business and across our major geographies, including China. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing some expected headwinds in China as a result of global trade tensions, which we expect to continue in 2019. Despite this dynamic, the breadth of our product offering across the diverse set of end markets enabled strong revenue growth in China in Q4. In particular, we saw a good growth in commercial communications, where we had strong differentiation in 5G. 
2018 was a record year for Keysight with total order growth of 20% or 12% on core growth. This brought our total orders for the year to over $4 billion, a new milestone for the company. Total revenue grew 20% to a record $3.9 billion. On a core basis, revenue grew 13%, which was above our 11% expectation. We achieved this growth while also delivering our targeted core operating margin incremental, which resulted in $618 million in net income, up 34% over last year. 
Our results for this year were driven by good demands trends and strong execution on the plan we implemented 4 years ago to innovate and be a leader in our selected markets, create value for our customers and deliver growth profitably. At that time, we made the commitment to deliver annual EPS growth between 8% and 10% on a 4% core revenue growth CAGR, which we expected to achieve in 3 to 4 years. Earlier this year, we increased that target to 10% or greater EPS growth. I am pleased to report to you today that within 3 years' time we not only met that target, we exceeded it and delivered 28% EPS growth in 2018.
Creating value for our customers by providing leading-edge technology solutions and insights that help them be at the forefront of innovation is the cornerstone of our strategy and the Keysight leadership model. The targeted investments we have made over the past several years in software and services, and key areas of the market undergoing multiyear transformations are delivering results. 
Let me share some data points with you that illustrate our growth in a few of our focus areas. Revenue for our software solutions grew strong double digits in 2018 and represents greater than 15% of our total revenue. This growth was driven by strong demand for our 5G solutions, high-frequency measurement application software and digital and photonic application software as well as the addition of ISG. 
In services, we achieved all-time high for both orders and revenue, as well as record double-digit order and revenue growth for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Services are an increasingly important element of our solution-centric engagement model with customers. We are building momentum in services as we increase full solution sales in key end markets such as automotive and 5G. 
In automotive and energy, customer demand remained high, and we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth with strong growth across multiple applications. During the quarter, growth from our top accounts was enhanced by wins with many new customers. 
In 5G, we are leading and delivering very strong growth in Q4, resulting in record 5G orders. Our broad portfolio of 5G solutions and engagement with leading market makers continues to strengthen Keysight's leading position in this fast-growing market. We continue to see major operator ecosystems embrace the Keysight platform. This quarter, we received endorsements from China Telecom and SK Telecom. The scalability of our platform combined with Keysight's team's ability to keep pace with the fast-evolving standards needs positions us for future success as 5G deployments scale. Additionally, our Ixia Solutions Group secured important new 5G orders with leading mobile operators in Japan, Korea, China and the U.S. 
It is exciting to see ISG's recently launched 5G solutions gain momentum with these Tier 1 accounts. Our combined technologies enabled Keysight to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technologies continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. The contract manufacturing transition continues to take longer than we expected. 
That said, we have continued to make progress in optimizing the ISG business post-integration and orders strengthened in the quarter for both visibility and test.
We are confident in the plan we have to create long-term shareholder value. 
In summary, 2018 has been a year of great success and strong revenue and earnings growth. As we look ahead, we believe Keysight is well positioned to expand our leadership as our markets evolve. We have built a robust innovation engine and a broad portfolio of solutions that spans multiple segments. 
Our solution-centric approach to the market builds deep customer relationships that fuel innovation and customer success. We will continue to focus our investments in these key areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market. 
Importantly, we have maintained our strong focus on financial discipline and operational excellence to drive earnings growth, while investing in key areas of the business. 
Before I turn the call over to Neil, I would like to thank every member of Keysight's team for their dedication and hard work that made our record 2018 results possible. I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continued to execute on the demand",991,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise.
As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continued to execute on the demand we see in core areas of our business. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1,051,000,000, which was above our guidance of $1 billion to $1,020,000,000. We also delivered $1.1 billion in orders in the quarter, which were up 9% in total and 10% on a core basis. 
Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 61% and operating expenses of $408 million, resulting in operating margin of 22.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history.
We also achieved record net income of $193 million and delivered $1.01 in earnings per share, which was up 42%. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $114 million. In conjunction with our annual financial planning cycle and asset impairment review, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $700 million net of tax, primarily due to weaker-than-expected market dynamics experienced in the Ixia Solutions Group. While this is disappointing, the Ixia Business is a valuable asset in the Keysight portfolio. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities created by combining Ixia's strength in networking and Keysight's strength in wireless and physical layer test. 
Our combined technologies enable Keysight to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technologies continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, generated total revenue of $566 million, up 23%, while delivering record gross margin of 63.7% and record operating margin of 27%. In Q4, Commercial Communications delivered strong double-digit order growth and record revenue of $357 million, up 28%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center next-generation 400-gigabit and high-speed digital test.
Aerospace defense and government grew 15% and generated revenue of $209 million. Aerospace defense and government growth was driven by continued strong demand across the aerospace, defense supply chain, including space, satellite, cybersecurity, radar and electronic warfare applications. For the year, CSG revenue grew 17% to reach a record $2 billion. 
Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated fourth quarter revenue of $249 million, up a record 21%, driven by strength across all of its markets, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 60.6% and operating margin of 26%.
Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q4 revenue of $115 million, gross margin of 70.5% and breakeven operating profit. ISG orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year and double-digit sequentially, driven by 5G wins as well as increased 400-gigabit and visibility sales. We were encouraged to see another quarter of improved sales execution, but as Ron mentioned, the contract manufacturing transition is ongoing, which impacted ISG's Q4 revenue and operating results. 
We remain confident in our ability to work through these challenges, grow the business and increase profitability. 
Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 10% in Q4 to reach a record $121 million, while delivering 40.9% gross margin and an operating margin of 13%. Q4 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. This brings SSG revenue for the year to $461 million, up 10% over last year as our pivot to an organic growth strategy takes hold. 
As Ron highlighted, we are pleased with our performance and execution as a company for the 2018 fiscal year. Revenue for the year totaled $3.9 billion and gross margin improved 70 basis points to 60.7%. To fuel innovation and further strengthen our market position in strategic areas, we continue to invest, while at the same time, remain within our operating model. We achieved our core operating margin incremental target for the year and achieved 20% operating margin. This translated to strong 28% earnings growth and reported non-GAAP net income after taxes of $618 million or $3.24 per share for the full year. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $913 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $235 million and free cash flow of $201 million, which represents 19% of revenue. This brings our free cash flow for the year to $423 million or 11% of revenue, which includes the onetime $85 million accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan that we discussed last quarter. 
Under existing share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 634,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $63.11 for a total consideration of $40 million. This brings our total repurchases for the year to approximately 2 million shares at an average price of $57.91 for a total consideration of $120 million.
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect first quarter 2019 revenue to be in the range of $965 million to $985 million and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76  to $0.82 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. 
For 2019 modeling purposes, I would like to remind you that the quarterly revenue seasonality in the first half of 2018 was heavily skewed towards Q2 as a result of the closure of our Santa Rosa facility due to last year's wildfires. Historically, sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 has averaged mid-single digits. With regard to our tax rate, based on our latest assessment of the benefits of tax reform, we are currently modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '19, a reduction of 3 percentage points from our prior rate of 15%. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

And that feeds into our commercial communications business, which is also very strong as we reported our revenue for -- overall for China. That was a bit of a surprise how strong that was, but our services business, for instance, has grown double digits throughout the year. On top of that, our automotive business has grown very strong. So when we look at, for instance, revenue growth of CSG of 23%, we see also EISG at 21%, SSG at 10%. All of those are doing well, but EISG and SSG driven primarily from commercial communications and automotive seem to be strong. There's is no doubt that we do have a tough compare compared to with this last year, which the performance was so much better than the year before, but we actually see upside to that 4% to 5%.

The Ixia integration has become a bigger job than we had thought it originally. We're making excellent progress, but it's taking longer than we originally thought. And we have a -- we've a multifaceted plan to go after this. One, we put new leadership in place with Mark Pierpoint to lead that group, and that's working out very well. We've completed our transition and integration to a new sales platform that will help make sales much more integrated and also share on the information to really accelerate our revenue synergies, which are starting to pop up with Satish in our general Communications Solutions Group. We've seen improvements in our order flow, in our funnel conversion throughout the quarter. And as we reported, we had mid-single-digit growth for ISG in orders this past quarter and double-digit growth in orders sequentially. But we are consolidating the CM supply chain, and we're transferring about 75 products and major products, I should say. And although they're not new products, it's a whole new process that we're putting into this CM. And what it will do, it will improve the quality and lower the cost to provide great performance in the long term. So that's what's going on. We still have a lot of confidence in the business. We recently introduced new solution, the AresONE solution for 400-gig, it is the densest solution to go ahead and to address this need. Compared to the competition, it's very, very strong. So we're excited about that. And now, I'll turn it over to Neil, who could talk a little bit about the guidance and the financials for Ixia."

Second, with regard to the growth initiatives, one of the things that we looked at when we set this up roughly 4 years ago was to look for a secular growth trend that last at least a decade and typically 2-plus. And that's what we're seeing in 5G as well as in commercial comms, and we're seeing it in automotive with ADAS, et cetera, and these trends are going to go on for a long period of time before you see automotive get to Level 5, and there is plenty, plenty of opportunity for us as this gets implemented and safety becomes extremely important and there are multiple technologies that are utilized. 5G, it's the same thing before that gets implemented around the world. A lot of times we forget and we think of how fast The U.S. is moving or how fast, for instance, China is moving right now, and other countries. The world is much bigger and nobody -- there's many, many countries that will utilize this technology, that will not see it for many years, but we're starting to see some countries that will be seeing their first rollouts very soon. So we're really excited that you'll see these growth initiatives and what we have going on for another decade, at least. And again, we will also look as we continue to build those out to add more, but right now there is such an opportunity and a gold mine in these applications, we're focusing and it's providing us the growth that we had promised and then some as well as the earnings growth, which is our ultimate job."

The general electronics business is a really extraordinarily diverse set of business. It's probably the most tightly linked to the overall macro environment. And so there is no one single driver in that business, but as long as the macroeconomy stay strong and electronics in general, are doing well, we'll continue to generate strong revenues in our general electronics business. And lastly, semiconductor, we've been cautious about semi for several quarters in a row.

And it -- yes, about 6 months to bring resources on board, but it's happening over multiple phases across multiple parts of our business. Last year, at the beginning of our fiscal year, we deployed the first global services sales organization within Keysight. So we've had our first year of having a focused sales organization. And as you heard from Ron's comments earlier, we delivered record high order growth during the year, 30% order growth in Q4, 22% growth for the entire year. So it is working. The other subtlety here is we're really putting a lot of focus across all of Keysight global sales on selling services, not just a dedicated sales team that sells value-added services. We put a lot of focus on upfront services sales. So that means when you sell a piece of equipment or a solution, we're selling more services upfront, and that's really helping us to drive growth now and over time, because a lot of this will be reoccurring. And then across the board, our services business for multivendor repair and cal is up, our remarketed equipment sales are up, and I think it's a direct result of us being successful with our organic services capability as well as deploying a sales organization that is capable of selling services."

Adam, we -- I think, we've been talking about new customer acquisition for several quarters now, and we have acquired several thousand new customers overall during the course of the last 12 months during our last fiscal year. That is an explicit focus across the board, including automotive. One of the vehicles, no pun intended, we're using to find and capture new customers is putting customer solution centers, where the customers are located. A year ago, we opened up our solution center right outside Detroit. It's been very successful. We have regular interaction with both new and existing customers there. And just last month, or back in October, I should say, we opened up another new center in Shanghai, China, and that complements our capabilities that exist today in Bochum, Germany, in the Bay Area and other locations. So we're going to continue to deploy this strategy, it brings customers and innovators within Keysight together and it's really working very well. The other just comment I'll make is that the additive function of Scienlab to our portfolio is making a big difference in terms of finding new customers, especially on the Tier 1 OEM side, where we have new solutions for that particular set of customers."

Well, I'd start by saying that obviously the noncash goodwill impairment charges, it does not change our confidence in ISG and the business and our strategy about bringing networking and wireless together within Keysight. We do -- we view ISG as a very valuable asset within our portfolio. That said, in conjunction with our annual financial planning processes and our annual review of our asset base, we did take the goodwill impairment charge really driven by 2 primary factors. The first is that the test and visibility markets have really seen moderated growth rates since the time of the acquisition relative to our expectations. And at least as we look forward, we expect those moderated growth rates to continue for at least a period of time. Second factor is one that we've talked about in the past. Obviously, we did have a bit of a disruption to our revenues in the second quarter of this year as part of this contract manufacturer transition. And as we talked about that, that transition is still ongoing. 
To answer the second part of your question, we don't believe that we're going to face any additional impairment, because we have, again, the multifaceted plan in place to improve this business. We are getting traction in the marketplace. Ron talked about the increasing sales velocity. We talked about the ability -- the driving orders with the new 400-gig Ethernet solution, the new 5G solution, we've got a new Wi-Fi solution coming out in the spring.
