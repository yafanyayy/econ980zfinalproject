I'd first like to acknowledge the changes we made last week to further evolve our culture and restructure our leadership. We became aware of some behavioral issues that are inconsistent with NIKE's values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment. I'm committed to ensure that we have an environment where every NIKE employee can have a positive experience and reach their full potential. As you know, I've publicly committed to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of NIKE, Inc. beyond 2020. Trevor Edwards and I both agreed to a change in leadership structure in the NIKE Brand at this time. As we transition to our next phase of growth and continue to evolve our culture, Trevor will work with me as an adviser through this transition until he retires in August, and I'd like to thank him for his important and significant contributions in growing and strengthening the NIKE Brand around the world.
We have a deep leadership bench at NIKE, and I'm confident that our restructured leadership team will continue to strengthen our culture and drive the Consumer Direct Offense. So with that, this call will be led by our CFO, Andy Campion and me. So let's turn to the results we delivered in Q3 and the strong momentum we're building as we look forward.
Simply put, the Consumer Direct Offense is working. Through our 2X Innovation, we're creating and scaling new product platforms while also becoming sharper editors. Through 2x Direct, we're moving closer to the consumer through differentiated retail concepts, leading with our mobile apps, .com and digital partners. And through 2X Speed, we're serving consumers at their pace. 
During our Investor Day, we discussed the significant potential we see in our international markets. And this quarter, we delivered strong and sustainable growth across all of our international geographies. Take Greater China, for example, where positive macro trends are accelerating from consumer spending to sport participation. Looking ahead, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand our full digital portfolio, leading with key cities like Shanghai and Beijing. We saw this quarter with our Greater China business growing 24%. The end of Q3 also marks a significant turn in North America where we expect a reversal of trend in Q4. We've secured some great early wins here through new NIKE Consumer Experiences and differentiated retail across both our direct and partner channels. Overall, there's a strong global appetite for athletic footwear and apparel, and we're amplifying and capturing that demand through our Consumer Direct Offense and Triple Double strategy.
The momentum we're building in all 4 geographies is the result of getting the right product in front of the consumer in the right moment, and it's becoming increasingly clear that the closer we connect our strong brand to consumers in the marketplace, the greater the returns.
So I'm excited to share some of the highlights of how we're executing the Triple Double and fueling our growth in our key categories. At NIKE, growth always begins with innovation and great product. And this quarter, through 2X Innovation, we intensified the pace and scale at which we're bringing fresh and unexpected products to consumers. And we've done that by focusing our resources to create new platforms, not just new models, by diversifying those platforms across multiple styles and categories through our Complete Offense and by editing our assortments to offer more compelling choice of our Power Franchises. 
So let's start with the new platforms.  What's most exciting about our momentum is that it's being driven through a performance lens, delivering clear consumer benefits through platforms like the Air VaporMax and Nike React. The Air VaporMax, for example, is delivering lightweight comfort with a distinct style. And it quickly became the #1 performance shoe above the $100 price point, and we're now scaling that platform into millions of pairs. We're doing that with new designs like the VaporMax 2.0, the VaporMax 97 and the VaporMax Utility. 
Turning to Nike React, the consumer response has set new records for performance innovation launch. We initially offered the product to NikePlus members exclusively, selling out within hours. And when we broadened the launch, we sold through several weeks of supply in just 4 days. As we move into Q4, we'll leverage that demand by scaling the Epic React, launching the Odyssey React, a new running shoe at the $120 price point; and leveraging our portfolio to expand React cushioning into Sportswear, Basketball and Jordan icons. 
With the Air Max 270, we launched NIKE's Bold lifestyle-specific Air platform with consumers responding to its comfort and style. Both the Air VaporMax and the Air Max 270 are fueling energy across our Nike Air family of products. With more Air innovation in the pipeline, we now expect to grow the Nike Air business by several billion dollars over the next few years.  The greater scale of these platforms will create greater impact on our business into Q4 and beyond.
With other innovation platforms, we're just getting started. For example, we invented a new process for Flyknit, which we unveiled with our mercurial boots ahead of World Cup '18. Constructed in a 360-degree form that wraps the entire foot, it gives athletes better control over their movement. It's also incredibly efficient, creating 60% less waste than traditional cut-and-sew methods. The KOBE 360 will be the next shoe to adopt this new process of digital knitting, combined with the Nike React midsole to create an incredible cork feel. And in just a few weeks, we'll unveil a new platform that I'm extremely excited about. It takes digital product creation to an entirely new place. And as we did with the ZoomX, 4% for Breaking2, we're working closely with Elliot Khashoggi on this one. I can't say much more today but stay tuned in Q4.
We have some other truly disruptive platforms ahead, from HyperAdapt at new price points and new categories, to nonpowered adaptive footwear systems and improved fit, to other lifestyle cushioning systems. We're also innovating in apparel. We've begun to unveil our high-performance World Cup Vapor Knit Kits with engineered yarns and open testers for breathability. In addition to designing the National Team kits, we've created full lifestyle collections for fans. 
World Cup is such a powerful moment in sport, and we look forward to amplifying its energy [indiscernible] and sportswear businesses around the world. 
As we laid out in October, 2x Direct is delivering a vision for a more differentiated marketplace, connecting the NIKE Brand in deeper ways with consumers. And we're leading with our digital business which was up 18% on a currency-neutral basis in Q3, and we just launched the SNKRS app in China in December. And in the first month alone, we had 2 million downloads. And we're also scaling NikePlus membership with plans to launch in all 12 of our key cities within the next fiscal year.  We're still in the early stages of NikePlus membership, but we saw strong consumer response in Q3 with new members rising more than 50% versus the same period last year. 
While we lead with digital, we don't believe digital and physical retail operate in silos. In fact, more and more, they will intersect and amplify each other.  For example, in Q4, we're going to debut a new concept that we call NIKE app at Retail at both The Grove in Los Angeles and here in Portland. When you enter the doors, it recognizes you and opens up exclusive products in your app. You can scan for product availability in all nearby NIKE doors or check out and pay through the app with no waiting line. And if you're not in the store, you can reserve product through the app and we'll hold it in a personal locker so you can try it on before buying.  There are a number of other features that'll be phased in as we test, initiate before scaling to a wider fleet of stores.
What really powers all these immersive Consumer Experiences is great data and the ability to maximize it. And while we're constantly building these skills in house, we're also acquiring capabilities to accelerate our strategy. Today, we're announcing that we've acquired an exceptional consumer data and analytics firm named Zodiac. Based in New York, this team of world-class data scientists and their proprietary tools will help us deepen relationships with consumers all over the world, with the primary focus on our NikePlus members.
Better analytics are also a critical factor in our 2X Speed initiative. As we sharpen our consumer sensing, we can meet demand faster and deliver more relevant, personalized products. We've made good progress with our Express Lane teams, especially in EMEA where Express Lane product is accelerating growth in our Power Franchises. In North America, we're increasing our speed of delivery, particularly around key cities. Our focus for fiscal '19 is to apply those learnings further and on to our biggest volume drivers around the world.
The Triple Double comes to life through our categories. It's how we amplify sport's biggest moments, connect our brand emotionally with consumers and drive a complete offense to grow our business. So let's touch on of the few category highlights from the quarter.
The NIKE Basketball category had a very strong quarter, growing double digits, with growth across footwear and apparel in every geography and key city. We saw success with the launches of the KYRIE 4 and the PG 2, and through the LeBron watch, consumers could buy LEBRON 15 player edition shoes as soon as he debuted them on court. 
We've exceeded expectation in our first season as an official NBA partner, growing the NBA business significantly over the last year. A major bright spot has been the iconic Showtime Hoodie. It's been a huge hit at retail and has driven a whole new silhouette for NIKE apparel. 
Perhaps the greatest source of brand energy for both NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand was the NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles. Over the 3 days, we became the first brand to sell directly through Snapchat with the Tinker AJ 3 selling out in just 23 minutes. We launched SNKRS Past, our geolocated digital wristband that unlocks access to high heat product, as we did with our Cortez collaboration with Kendrick Lamar. And we hosted thousands of consumers in our makers' customization space.
In college Basketball, we're in the midst of one of the most unpredictable NCA tournaments in history, and NIKE and Jordan once again showed the strength of our partnerships sponsoring 85 teams across the men's and women's fields for March Madness.
With the Jordan Brand, we're making the right moves to keep this iconic brand special and create sustained growth. This quarter, we deliberately tightened distribution in the North America marketplace while also driving extraordinary heat with the consumer. We launched Russell Westbrook's first signature performance shoe with the Why Not 0.1. And we released limited-edition Jordan 3s on the SNKRS apps immediately after Justin Timberlake wore them at the Super Bowl Halftime Show. We've talked about adding new dimensions to Jordan, and this quarter, we accelerated that strategy. Going forward, we will carefully manage the distribution of iconic styles; we'll more completely leverage the company's innovation platforms to supercharge Jordan's performance products; we'll expand into new categories beyond Basketball and Sportswear; and drive our biggest growth opportunities in international, apparel and women's.
Moving on to our largest and most influential performance category, Running, where we're driving more innovation than any other time in our history. In addition to all the platforms we discussed, we're focused on growing our core footwear business using our Express Lane seized opportunities and we're adding new dimensions to our Power Franchises like the Zoom Pegasus. For example, this summer, the women's Zoom Pegasus 35 will have cushioning that's better tuned to her, and the new Peg Turbo will include ZoomX foam making our breakthrough platform accessible to more runners. 
We also had a very strong quarter in our Sportswear category, which continue to grow double digits with strong growth across both footwear and apparel. Tech Fleece led the way in apparel, while in footwear, we led with the Air Force 1, Cortez, Laser, Tangent and Air Max. 
Our women's business, overall, continues to accelerate. We created our first women's collection with both NIKE and the Jordan Brand. The 1 Reimagined featured 14 Nike Women's designers who reinterpreted 2 of our greatest icons in the Air Jordan 1 and the Air Force 1. One of the best examples of our Edit To Amplify approach came from the women's team this quarter with the new retail concept we call Unlaced. This new sneaker destination offers collections edited by leading stylists and will give access to a wider range of sizes for the first time with exclusive colors and elevated services. Unlaced will be both a physical and digital experience starting with NIKE.com in North America. It'll debut at NIKE SoHo this summer and then roll out to over 200 NIKE Direct and wholesale partners doors by the end of the calendar year. 
As you can tell, we were extremely productive this quarter. we're looking at every opportunity to improve, and we're investing in the opportunities with the greatest impact. We feel very good about the short-term momentum we're driving and the foundation we're setting for long-term accelerated growth.
With that, now here's Andy to provide more detail on the financial performance of our reported segments and our outlook."
291981,553754887,1423712,"NIKE, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2018",2018-03-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello to everyone on the call. Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting NIKE's next horizon of strong profitable growth, and there are several key themes within our performance that spea",2476,"Thanks, Mark, and hello to everyone on the call. Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting NIKE's next horizon of strong profitable growth, and there are several key themes within our performance that speak to the long-term sustainability of our momentum.
First, we exceeded the revenue and gross margin expectations that we set 90 days ago, fueled by an unprecedented flow of new products and innovation platforms that will scale over time. As Mark detailed, in the third quarter, we launched the Nike React and the Air Max 270 platforms to extraordinary consumer demand. We also began to scale and diversify the Air VaporMax platform, and the ZoomX platform and Running continues to sell out as we launch new colorways. 
While we're clearly doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, our product momentum is even broader based. Our Edit To Amplify approach is bringing focus and accelerating growth within our Power Franchises, like the Air Force 1 family of products and other key styles. We're running a much more complete offense, yet we still see tremendous opportunity to improve and edit how we serve our consumers.
Second, our results in Q3 confirm that where the NIKE Brand more directly connects with consumers, we see the greatest growth. Our NIKE digital ecosystem, in particular, is setting the pace for growth in all 4 of our geographies. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE.com grew 18% globally, driven by the expansion of our digital apps and international markets as well as the launch of NikePlus membership in North America. In each of our international geographies, NIKE.com's rate of growth outpaced the overall marketplace rate of growth by 2x or greater. And in North America, NIKE.com not only grew, but has been accelerating over the last 2 months. NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail are also resonating. That includes owned and partnered digital and physical experiences. In Q3, NIKE Consumer Experiences comprised more than 50% of our total revenue and drove over 100% of our revenue growth. In other words, we're both growing and reshaping the marketplace toward the vision that we shared with you at our Investor Day.
Third, as we exit Q3, we will put 2 significant headwinds largely behind us. At current rates, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on EBIT, net of hedging, to be roughly neutral in Q4 and begin shifting to a slight tailwind in fiscal year '19. At the same time, as Mark said, the close of Q3 marks the reversal of trend for North America. We have reset NIKE's supply; we're fueling demand through the launch of innovative products; we have reignited brand heat; we're connecting more directly with consumers through our digital ecosystem; and orders from our strategic partners are building. In short, NIKE has returned to a pull market in North America. NIKE North America revenue is now projected to be roughly flat to prior year in Q4 and return to growth in the first half of fiscal year '19. 
But before I share more on our outlook, let's first touch on our Q3 results.
Q3 reported revenue grew 7% as continued strong double-digit international growth and NIKE Direct growth in all geographies was partially offset by an expected contraction in North America wholesale revenue, driven by undifferentiated doors. Gross margin contracted 70 basis points in Q3, a stronger result than we expected 90 days ago, as our launches and stronger sellthrough fueled expanding full price gross margin. However, that expansion was more than offset by approximately 90 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds.
Total SG&A was up 11% in Q3. Operating overhead increased 9%, driven by investments in our NIKE Direct businesses, and demand creation increased 15%, primarily driven by sports marketing and activations related to the NBA All-Star Weekend as well as new product innovation launches. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was roughly 180%, including the one-time impacts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Income tax expense included provisional charges of $2 billion primarily related to the transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The one-time charges include some noncash impacts with the cash impacts to be paid over several years. The impact of U.S. tax reform is slightly favorable to NIKE in terms of both our normalized, steady-state effective tax rate and more efficient access to capital. When I speak to our outlook, I'll provide more dimension on the go-forward implications of tax reform.  As a result, Q3 diluted EPS was a loss of $0.57. That said, the one-time impact of U.S. tax reform had a $1.25 impact on EPS in the quarter. Excluding that impact, our profitability in Q3 exceeded our expectations. 
As of February 28, inventories were up 9%, leading into Q4 as we scale our new innovations globally and capitalize on strong consumer demand. Q3 inventory growth was primarily driven by aligning in-season product to our stronger forecast demand, while off-price inventory declined year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. This quarter, we saw a return to modest growth in North America inventory as we anniversary our efforts to tighten supply in the prior year and shift to a pull market. Internationally, our inventory levels are also healthy and generally aligned with the strong demand we continue to forecast in those markets.
Now let's turn to the financial performance through our operating segments. In North America, NIKE.com, differentiated NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, the impact of NIKE innovation and brand heat are driving increasingly stronger demand. While North America declined 6% for the quarter, we expect that the momentum will now reverse the trend. While undifferentiated wholesale dimensions in the marketplace declined, we are delivering and accelerating growth in NIKE Consumer Experiences in aggregate across owned and partnered, with NIKE.com, in particular, accelerating to strong double-digit growth as we progress through the quarter. Our partners are also increasingly bringing NIKE Consumer Experiences to life in the marketplace. As an example, Finish Line's Culver City store in LA was reset with NIKE Epic React as the only product available in the store across all brands for 3 days. The execution brought together new innovative NIKE product with great storytelling through our Shoes Go campaign and expert service. The results were amazing and served as a proof point for the potential of NIKE Consumer Experiences operated by a strategic partner in the U.S. marketplace.
As Mark noted, year-over-year comparisons in North America were also impacted by our quick and deliberate tightening of the distribution of select styles within the Jordan Brand. That said, as we enter Q4, we believe Jordan inventories are now clean, and we also began reigniting Jordan Brand heat in the marketplace through the launches and activations over the NBA All-Star Weekend. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue adding dimension to the Jordan Brand through both performance and lifestyle product.  For the quarter, EBIT in North America was down 14% versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expenses.
Moving on to EMEA, where we continue to see incredibly strong momentum in a region that is at the leading edge of consumer preferences. EMEA revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis in Q3. 2 of the hottest styles in the marketplace are the Air VaporMax and Air Max 97, and we're also seeing industry-leading growth in apparel, driven by our Tech Fleece business. Our growth in EMEA was also aided by our Express Lane, which is already quickly translating regional consumer preferences into color and material updates with respect to our Power Franchises. Overall, growth in EMEA was led by very strong NIKE.com results as well as strong results with key strategic partners. Key strategic partners who are also relentlessly consumer focused and digitally connected, such as JD and Zalando. Categorically, we saw double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training and NIKE Basketball. We expect continued strong growth in EMEA, and we're excited about the impact of the upcoming World Cup.
On a reported basis, EMEA revenue increased 19% and EBIT grew 16% as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin due to transactional FX headwinds. 
Next, let's turn to Greater China.  Having just been in China 2 weeks ago, I can tell you that Greater China not only continues to lead NIKE in terms of the pace of growth, but also in terms of executing the Consumer Direct Offense. In Q3, Greater China was up 19% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong double-digit growth across nearly all dimensions of the business, but notably led by digital. Digital momentum in the quarter was fueled by the launch of the SNKRS app in China and the continued success of our partnership with Tmall. And while our digital growth has been extraordinary, we have not even yet launched NikePlus membership in China. That is now slated for Q1 of fiscal year '19.  Also worth calling out, our women's business in Greater China has incredible momentum with double-digit growth driven by our innovation and Power Franchises, including styles designed specifically to connect with consumers around the Chinese New Year.  On a reported basis, Q3 revenue grew 24% and EBIT was up 30% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage. 
In APLA, revenue grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis, led by digital growth that significantly outpaced every other channel. To unlock digital growth even more broadly, we will be more aggressively rolling out our digital platforms into key markets across APLA. One real-time example is the SNKRS app which just launched in Japan yesterday. It immediately surged to become Japan's #1 free downloaded app in the iOS store.  APLA was also fueled by the brand energy surrounding the Winter Olympics in Korea, which helped drive strong and balanced double-digit growth across nearly every dimension: women's, men's, footwear, apparel and across many categories. Our on a reported basis, Q3 revenue in APLA was up 13% and EBIT grew 31%, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
And finally at Converse, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis as we rebalanced marketplace supply in North America. On a reported basis, revenue declined 3%, and EBIT was down 37%.  Looking forward, we will continue to invest in reigniting strong, sustainable, profitable growth at Converse. More specifically, we're dimensionalizing Converse's product portfolio through the One Star Chuck 70 and other sport and sport-inspired styles, investing in more Converse-specific digital platforms and creating heat and energy for the brand through new collaborations.
So with that, I'll now move to our outlook for the balance of the year.
We remain confident we will deliver on the growth and profitability expectations that we have previously communicated for fiscal year '18, excluding the one-time impact of U.S. tax reform. We will continue to invest in the key pillars of our strategy and drive accelerated growth in the dimensions of our portfolio that we highlighted at our Investor Day in October. We remain focused on what matters most to consumers and, in turn, what will fuel strong, sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. As for specific guidance, we expect Q4 reported revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. This growth reflects continued strength in our international geographies and the reversal of trend we're building in North America. We expect Q4 gross margin to be roughly flat to very slightly up versus the prior year, demonstrating progressively stronger currency-neutral gross margin expansion that will be almost fully offset by transactional FX headwinds, albeit lesser transactional FX headwinds than in prior quarters. For SG&A, we expect low teens growth in Q4. We will continue to invest in digital and membership, including completing the acquisitions of some key digital capabilities within the quarter as well as brand more marketing and supportive innovation and impactful consumer moments such as Air Max Day and the World Cup.
At current FX rates, we expect other income and expense, net of interest expense, to be approximately $30 million to $40 million of expense in Q4. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be in the 10% to 12% range. It's important to note that our tax rate may be volatile as we expect to continue receiving more specific legislative and regulatory guidance as to the application of the U.S. Tax Act.
Now looking ahead to fiscal year '19. While our planning is not yet finalized, we currently expect fiscal year '19 reported revenue growth in the mid to high single-digit range as international momentum continues and we return to growth in North America. We also expect strong gross margin expansion roughly in line with our long-term financial model. In fiscal year '19, we will also see the full impact of U.S. tax reform on our access to capital and investments as well as the tax rate. U.S. tax reform will certainly afford NIKE more efficient access to capital. So as we finalize our investment plans for the next fiscal year, we're prioritizing accelerated investment in the select dimensions of our business that will fuel NIKE's Consumer Direct Offense and drive long-term growth. At the top of our list is digital, ranging from new NikePlus membership experiences to new capabilities, including data and analytics, to our core enterprise resource planning platform. Our acquisition of Zodiac, a leading consumer and data analytics team, was a great example of us seizing an opportunity to accelerate NIKE's capability development. We'll also continue to prioritize investment in innovation, brand distinction, new NIKE Consumer Experiences in the marketplace and a faster, more responsive supply chain.
The incremental and more efficient access to capital will also enable us to amplify our returns to shareholders and complete our existing 4-year, $12 billion share repurchase program within fiscal year '19, roughly 1 year earlier than originally planned.
We currently expect U.S. tax reform to have a neutral to slightly favorable impact on our steady-state effective tax rate, which we would characterize as being in the teens on a normalized basis. That said, in any given fiscal year, geographical earnings mix, the impact of the new stock-based compensation accounting rules and other discrete items will create volatility on our rate. In fiscal year '19 specifically, our rate may also be impacted by adjustments to the provisional charges that we're accruing this quarter.
Taking all of these factors into consideration, we will provide our updated outlook for fiscal year '19 on our Q4 earnings call. 
As Mark said, our Consumer Direct Offense is working. NIKE Innovation is fueling strong consumer demand. NIKE Digital is accelerating. Our brands have great energy, and our organization is aligned and executing against what matters most to consumers. NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable profitable growth is underway.
With that, we'll now open the call up to questions."

Well, to go back to the investor meeting in October, we laid out how we want to shift the look of our overall marketplace to be 80% differentiated is our target, and that's over the next 5 years. And I'd say, as we commented, we're making some great progress on that front. You pointed out, and that's what we said is, NIKE Consumer Experiences drove 100% of the growth in the quarter. That's double-digit increases in new NikePlus members, which is a really key part of that strategy. We've had great feedback in terms of the NBA All-Star Weekend and some of the sellthrough in Basketball we're seeing, and that involves not only our direct doors, but some of our key partners. NBA All-Star Weekend, we had Kits and Revolve is 2 examples. Foot Locker was participating in that as well, and then we're bringing some of the new concepts to market here, starting very quickly with NIKE Unlaced for the digital launch and then physical coming up in summer. The NIKE app at Retail and Hyper Live are some of the examples that there. As far as our -- this is impacting our overall marketplace. We're working with our key partners to help differentiate them in their respective positions. Those conversations are ongoing with most strategic partners. We've aligned on the role that they play in serving our consumers from DICK'S to Foot Locker to Nordstrom, and this is not only physical retail, but it's how physical and digital interact. And then we have other digital partners which are obviously key to this transformation, Zalando and Tmall, ASOS and even Instagram, for example. So this is a multiyear journey for us, and I'd say we're making great progress in shaping that marketplace. And I think we'll continue to elevate our own Direct business, but we will also help to differentiate and elevate our key wholesale partners along the way."

We're on the front end of -- obviously, the very front end of launching React, and the response has been phenomenal. I think I said it's been a record-setting performance launch for NIKE. I think that's also a case of performance basis that is also translated well into a product that can be worn on the street. So there's performance actually driving Sportswear and Lifestyle in 1 product. Now the other aspect of that is, we are very committed to developing our platforms. So React, it starts with the Epic React running shoe, but you'll see that play out in other categories. And also, in more models at different price points within Running. So I think that leverage is only going to build over time, and that's something that isn't unique to React, it's also what we're seeing in VaporMax as well. And then NIKE.com, in the quarter, has been a case of month-to-month acceleration and that's driven also in part by these launches, so we think that, that is going to continue at a strong pace and accelerate really through Q4 and beyond.

The contraction was primarily the result of declines in undifferentiated wholesale and a deliberate tightening in the distribution of styles within the Jordan Brand. So that did have an impact on year-over-year comparisons. And as we said, we're really excited about the heat we've reignited with that brand and the clean inventory levels that we have there, too. And then to your point in innovation platforms, one of the metrics that we look very closely at is the rate of sellthrough as we launch products at the initial levels of supply. And the rate of sellthrough on the NIKE React, in particular, the Air Max 270 and those other styles far exceeded our expectations. We talked about supply selling out in hours with numbers and in days as compared to what we expected would be weeks with more broader distribution.

In fact, our 2X Innovation initiative commitment is equally being applied to apparel. And I think that will impact a product that you'll see at the World Cup, you'll see at the NBA Championships, you're seeing with our relationship with the NBA across all sport categories, training. And then it will wind up influencing more and more of the sportswear category as well where we are performing incredibly well. I'm really excited about what's coming in, in innovation and apparel and then our ability to kind of push on both sides of the performance and sportswear side. So there's a lot coming in at apparel, and frankly, there's a lot coming in footwear, a lot more coming in footwear than we've talked about. So I think our 2X Innovation investments which really kicked in the gear about 2 years ago are really starting to pay off. Anyway, back to your second question, Amazon. As you know, we have, I think you know, we have extended our pilot with Amazon, and to date, it's a smaller U.S.-based pilot. It's performed quite well. We've seen good sellthrough on a limited selection products. We're expanding that selection of products over this next phase. Our focus on this relationship really is how we can best work together to elevate the consumer experience, and that's really a key part of all of our digital partnerships. So we continue to engage with the U.S. digital marketplace to look at how we can serve digital demand from consumers, and Amazon is definitely a part of that. We get, just to back up for a second, get the most out of the partnerships that advance our brand through better presentation, through the sharing of data. Tmall in China, Zalando in Europe, these are great examples of those types of relationships. So we'll continue to work with Amazon to what we think will be a mutually beneficial partnership over the months ahead."

We've never operated as if we are and we aren't capital constrained. So our top priority, as we look ahead to any given fiscal year, is to ensure that we're prioritizing the investments that are going to fuel growth over the long term, as compared to adhering to rigidly to a specific metric in a short-term period. The Tax Act does also afford us even more efficient access to the cash flow and the capital that we generate around the world. So yes, our planning process are taking both of those into account in the context of us having a new very focused strategy. So we're prioritizing investments specifically in innovation. I told you in the past that we've doubled the investment in innovation. We continue to make incremental investments there, and I want to pause there for a moment. It's really a competitive advantage for NIKE. The -- we currently invest probably more than any other brand in the marketplace, but we're going to continue to make incremental meaningful investments. But those investments are still relatively insignificant compared to the kind of growth and returns that they generate, when you consider launches like React, VaporMax and the other platforms that Mark and I have shared. So innovation is certainly a priority. We're going to continue to drive brand distinction. You probably saw our Shoes Go campaign over the last several months and the energy that, that's creating as well as some of the energy we created against the All-Star weekend and other big moments in sports. And I would say, even though I'm a mentioning it third, at the top of our list is digital capabilities, both building them, and like we said, acquiring capabilities through teams, like the team we acquired in zodiac. And then there are really 2 final areas that are on our short list of priorities: NIKE Consumer Experiences owned and partner, that as Mark noted, integrate or leverage digital in the physical environment. We are clearly doing that ourselves, and we're increasingly doing that with our partners all at various stages of development, but we're going to continue to test and innovate there. And then finally, we are prioritizing investment in speed through 2 key initiatives: our Express Lane; and responsive manufacturing. So in short, we believe these are the investments that are going to drive brand distinction for NIKE and fuel our next horizon of long-term sustainable profitable growth and we're going to over index our investment in those dimensions."

We're seeing stronger full price sellthrough, and we're seeing better margin on the off-price dimension of that business. Now the off-price dimension of digital is bigger today than it might've been a couple of years ago.

I'd first like to acknowledge the changes we made last week to further evolve our culture and restructure our leadership. We became aware of some behavioral issues that are inconsistent with NIKE's values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment. I'm committed to ensure that we have an environment where every NIKE employee can have a positive experience and reach their full potential. As you know, I've publicly committed to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of NIKE, Inc. beyond 2020. Trevor Edwards and I both agreed to a change in leadership structure in the NIKE Brand at this time. As we transition to our next phase of growth and continue to evolve our culture, Trevor will work with me as an adviser through this transition until he retires in August, and I'd like to thank him for his important and significant contributions in growing and strengthening the NIKE Brand around the world.
We have a deep leadership bench at NIKE, and I'm confident that our restructured leadership team will continue to strengthen our culture and drive the Consumer Direct Offense. So with that, this call will be led by our CFO, Andy Campion and me. So let's turn to the results we delivered in Q3 and the strong momentum we're building as we look forward.
Simply put, the Consumer Direct Offense is working. Through 2X Innovation, we're creating and scaling new product platforms while also becoming sharper editors. Through 2X Direct, we're moving closer to the consumer through differentiated retail concepts, leading with our mobile apps, .com and digital partners. And through 2X Speed, we're serving consumers at their pace.
During our Investor Day, we discussed the significant potential we see in our international markets, and this quarter, we delivered strong and sustainable growth across all of our international geographies. Take Greater China for example, where positive macro trends are accelerating from consumer spending to sport participation. Looking ahead, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand our full digital portfolio, leading with key cities like Shanghai and Beijing. We saw this quarter with our Greater China business growing 24%.
The end of Q3 also marks a significant turn in North America, where we expect a reversal of trend in Q4. We've secured some great early wins here through new NIKE Consumer Experiences and differentiated retail across both our direct and partner channels. Overall, there's a strong global appetite for athletic footwear and apparel, and we're amplifying and capturing that demand through our Consumer Direct Offense and Triple Double strategy. The momentum we're building in all 4 geographies is the result of getting the right product in front of the consumer in the right moment, and it's becoming increasingly clear that the closer we connect our strong brand to consumers in the marketplace, the greater the returns.
So I'm excited to share some of the highlights of how we're executing the Triple Double and fueling our growth in our key categories. At NIKE, growth always begins with innovation and great product, and this quarter, through 2X Innovation, we intensified the pace and scale at which we're bringing fresh and unexpected products to consumers. And we've done that by focusing our resources to create new platforms, not just new models, by diversifying those platforms across multiple styles and categories through our complete offense and by editing our assortments to offer more compelling choice of our Power Franchises.
So let's start with the new platforms. What's most exciting about our momentum is that it's being driven through a performance lens, delivering clear consumer benefits through platforms like the Air VaporMax and Nike React. The Air VaporMax, for example, is delivering lightweight comfort with a distinct style. And it quickly became the #1 performance shoe above the $100 price point, and we're now scaling that platform into millions of pairs. We're doing that with new designs like the VaporMax 2.0, the VaporMax 97 and the VaporMax Utility.
Turning to Nike React, the consumer response has set new records for performance innovation launch. We initially offered the product to NikePlus members exclusively, selling out within hours. And when we broadened the launch, we sold through several weeks of supply in just 4 days. As we move into Q4, we'll leverage that demand by scaling the Epic React; launching the Odyssey React, a new running shoe at the $120 price point; and leveraging our portfolio to expand React cushioning into Sportswear, Basketball and Jordan icons.
With the Air Max 270, we launched NIKE's bold lifestyle-specific Air platform with consumers responding to its comfort and style. Both the Air VaporMax and the Air Max 270 are fueling energy across our Nike Air family of products. With more Air innovation in the pipeline, we now expect to grow the Nike Air business by several billion dollars over the next few years. The greater scale of these platforms will create greater impact on our business into Q4 and beyond.
With other innovation platforms, we're just getting started. For example, we invented a new process for Flyknit, which we unveiled with our Mercurial boots ahead of World Cup '18. Constructed in a 360-degree form that wraps the entire foot, it gives athletes better control over their movement. It's also incredibly efficient, creating 60% less waste than traditional cut-and-sew methods.
The KOBE 360 will be the next shoe to adopt this new process of digital knitting, combined with the Nike React midsole to create an incredible cork feel. And in just a few weeks, we'll unveil a new platform that I'm extremely excited about. It takes digital product creation to an entirely new place, and as we did with the ZoomX, 4% for Breaking2, we're working closely with Eliud Kipchoge on this one. I can't say much more today, but stay tuned in Q4.
We have some other truly disruptive platforms ahead, from HyperAdapt at new price points and new categories to non-powered adaptive footwear systems that improve fit, to other lifestyle cushioning systems. We're also innovating in apparel. We've begun to unveil our high-performance World Cup Vapor Knit kits with engineered yarns and open textures for breathability. In addition to designing the National Team kits, we've created full lifestyle collections for fans. World Cup is such a powerful moment in sport, and we look forward to amplifying its energy [indiscernible] and sportswear businesses around the world.
As we laid out in October, 2X Direct is delivering a vision for a more differentiated marketplace, connecting the NIKE Brand in deeper ways with consumers. And we're leading with our digital business, which was up 18% on a currency-neutral basis in Q3, and we just launched the SNKRS app in China in December, and in the first month alone, we had 2 million downloads. And we're also scaling NikePlus membership with plans to launch in all 12 of our key cities within the next fiscal year. We're still in the early stages of NikePlus membership, but we saw strong consumer response in Q3 with new members rising more than 50% versus the same period last year.
While we lead with digital, we don't believe digital and physical retail operate in silos. In fact, more and more, they will intersect and amplify each other. For example, in Q4, we're going to debut a new concept that we call NIKE App at Retail at both The Grove in Los Angeles and here in Portland. When you enter the doors, it recognizes you and opens up exclusive products in your app. You can scan for product availability in all nearby NIKE doors or check out and pay through the app with no waiting line. And if you're not in the store, you can reserve product through the app, and we'll hold it in a personal locker so you can try it on before buying. There are a number of other features that'll be phased in as we test, initiate before scaling to our wider fleet of stores.
What really powers all these immersive Consumer Experiences is great data and the ability to maximize it. And while we're constantly building these skills in-house, we're also acquiring capabilities to accelerate our strategy. Today, we're announcing that we've acquired an exceptional consumer data and analytics firm named Zodiac. Based in New York, this team of world-class data scientists and their proprietary tools will help us deepen relationships with consumers all over the world with a primary focus on our NikePlus members.
Better analytics are also a critical factor in our 2X Speed initiative. As we sharpen our consumer sensing, we can meet demand faster and deliver more relevant, personalized products. We've made good progress with our Express Lane teams, especially in EMEA where Express Lane product is accelerating growth in our Power Franchises. In North America, we're increasing our speed of delivery, particularly around key cities. Our focus for fiscal '19 is to apply those learnings further and on to our biggest volume drivers around the world.
The Triple Double comes to life through our categories. It's how we amplify sport's biggest moments, connect our brand emotionally with consumers and drive a complete offense to grow our business. So let's touch on a few of the category highlights from the quarter.
The NIKE Basketball category had a very strong quarter, growing double digits with growth across footwear and apparel in every geography and key city. We saw success with the launches of the KYRIE 4 and the PG 2, and through the LeBron Watch, consumers could buy LEBRON 15 player edition shoes as soon as he debuted them on court.
We've exceeded expectation in our first season as an official NBA partner, growing the NBA business significantly over the last year. A major bright spot has been the iconic Showtime Hoodie. It's been a huge hit at retail and has driven a whole new silhouette for NIKE apparel.
 
Perhaps the greatest source of brand energy for both NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand was the NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles. Over the 3 days, we became the first brand to sell directly through Snapchat with the Tinker AJ3 selling out in just 23 minutes. We launched SNKRS Pass, our geolocated digital wristband that unlocks access to high-heat product as we did with our Cortez collaboration with Kendrick Lamar. And we hosted thousands of consumers in our Makers' customization space.
In college basketball, we're in the midst of one of the most unpredictable NCA (sic) [ NCAA ] tournaments in history, and NIKE and Jordan once again showed the strength of our partnerships, sponsoring 85 teams across the men's and women's fields for March Madness.
With the Jordan Brand, we're making the right moves to keep this iconic brand special and create sustained growth. This quarter, we deliberately tightened distribution in the North America marketplace while also driving extraordinary heat with the consumer. We launched Russell Westbrook's first signature performance shoe with the Why Not Zer0.1. And we released limited-edition Jordan 3s on the SNKRS app immediately after Justin Timberlake wore them at the Super Bowl halftime show.
We've talked about adding new dimensions to Jordan, and this quarter, we accelerated that strategy. Going forward, we will carefully manage the distribution of iconic styles. We'll more completely leverage the company's innovation platforms to supercharge Jordan's performance products. We'll expand into new categories beyond Basketball and Sportswear and drive our biggest growth opportunities in international, apparel and women's.
Moving on to our largest and most influential performance category, Running, where we're driving more innovation than any other time in our history. In addition to all the platforms we discussed, we're focused on growing our core footwear business using our Express Lane seized opportunities, and we're adding new dimensions to our Power Franchises like the Zoom Pegasus. For example, this summer, the women's Zoom Pegasus 35 will have cushioning that's better tuned to her, and the new Peg Turbo will include ZoomX foam making our break-through platform accessible to more runners.
We also had a very strong quarter in our Sportswear category, which continued to grow double digits with strong growth across both footwear and apparel. Tech Fleece led the way in apparel, while in footwear, we led with the Air Force 1, Cortez, Laser, Tanjun and Air Max.
Our women's business overall continues to accelerate. We created our first women's collection with both NIKE and the Jordan Brand. The 1 Reimagined featured 14 Nike Women's designers who reinterpreted 2 of our greatest icons in the Air Jordan 1 and the Air Force 1.
One of the best examples of our Edit To Amplify approach came from the women's team this quarter with the new retail concept we call Unlaced. This new sneaker destination offers collections edited by leading stylists and will give access to a wider range of sizes for the first time with exclusive colors and elevated services. Unlaced will be both a physical and digital experience starting with NIKE.com in North America. It'll debut at NIKE Soho this summer and then roll out to over 200 NIKE Direct and Wholesale partner doors by the end of the calendar year.
As you can tell, we were extremely productive this quarter. We're looking at every opportunity to improve, and we're investing in the opportunities with the greatest impact. We feel very good about the short-term momentum we're driving and the foundation we're setting for long-term accelerated growth.
With that, now here's Andy to provide more detail on the financial performance of our reported segments and our outlook."
291981,553754887,1423765,"NIKE, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2018",2018-03-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone on the call. Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting NIKE's next horizon of strong profitable growth, and there are several key themes within our performance that speak",2474,"Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone on the call. Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting NIKE's next horizon of strong profitable growth, and there are several key themes within our performance that speak to the long-term sustainability of our momentum.
First, we exceeded the revenue and gross margin expectations that we set 90 days ago, fueled by an unprecedented flow of new products and innovation platforms that will scale over time. As Mark detailed, in the third quarter, we launched the Nike React and the Air Max 270 platforms to extraordinary consumer demand. We also began to scale and diversify the Air VaporMax platform, and the ZoomX platform in Running continues to sell out as we launch new colorways.
While we're clearly doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, our product momentum is even broader based. Our Edit To Amplify approach is bringing focus and accelerating growth within our Power Franchises like the Air Force 1 family of products and other key styles. We're running a much more complete offense, yet we still see tremendous opportunity to improve and edit how we serve our consumers.
Second, our results in Q3 confirm that where the NIKE Brand more directly connects with consumers, we see the greatest growth. Our NIKE Digital ecosystem, in particular, is setting the pace for growth in all 4 of our geographies. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE.com grew 18% globally, driven by the expansion of our digital apps in international markets as well as the launch of NikePlus membership in North America. In each of our international geographies, NIKE.com's rate of growth outpaced the overall marketplace rate of growth by 2x or greater. And in North America, NIKE.com not only grew but has been accelerating over the last 2 months. NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail are also resonating. That includes owned and partnered digital and physical experiences. In Q3, NIKE Consumer Experiences comprised more than 50% of our total revenue and drove over 100% of our revenue growth. In other words, we're both growing and reshaping the marketplace toward the vision that we shared with you at our Investor Day.
Third, as we exit Q3, we will put 2 significant headwinds largely behind us. At current rates, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on EBIT, net of hedging, to be roughly neutral in Q4 and begin shifting to a slight tailwind in fiscal year '19. At the same time, as Mark said, the close of Q3 marks a reversal of trend for North America. We have reset NIKE's supply. We're fueling demand through the launch of innovative products. We have reignited brand heat. We're connecting more directly with consumers through our digital ecosystem, and orders from our strategic partners are building. In short, NIKE has returned to a pull market in North America. NIKE North America revenue is now projected to be roughly flat to prior year in Q4 and return to growth in the first half of fiscal year '19.
But before I share more on our outlook, let's first touch on our Q3 results. Q3 reported revenue grew 7% as continued strong double-digit international growth and NIKE Direct growth in all geographies was partially offset by an expected contraction in North America wholesale revenue, driven by undifferentiated doors. Gross margin contracted 70 basis points in Q3, a stronger result than we expected 90 days ago, as our launches and stronger sell-through fueled expanding full-price gross margin. However, that expansion was more than offset by approximately 90 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds.
Total SG&A was up 11% in Q3. Operating overhead increased 9%, driven by investments in our NIKE Direct businesses, and demand creation increased 15%, primarily driven by sports marketing and activations related to the NBA All-Star Weekend as well as new product innovation launches.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was roughly 180%, including the onetime impacts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Income tax expense included provisional charges of $2 billion primarily related to the transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The onetime charges include some non-cash impacts with the cash impacts to be paid over several years.
The impact of U.S. tax reform is slightly favorable to NIKE in terms of both our normalized, steady-state effective tax rate and more efficient access to capital. When I speak to our outlook, I'll provide more dimension on the go-forward implications of tax reform.
As a result, Q3 diluted EPS was a loss of $0.57. That said, the onetime impact of U.S. tax reform had a $1.25 impact on EPS in the quarter. Excluding that impact, our profitability in Q3 exceeded our expectations.
As of February 28, inventories were up 9%, leading into Q4 as we scale our new innovations globally and capitalize on strong consumer demand. Q3 inventory growth was primarily driven by aligning in-season product to our stronger forecast demand, while off-price inventory declined year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. This quarter, we saw a return to modest growth in North America inventory as we anniversary our efforts to tighten supply in the prior year and shift to a pull market. Internationally, our inventory levels are also healthy and generally aligned with the strong demand we continue to forecast in those markets.
Now let's turn to the financial performance through our operating segments. In North America, NIKE.com, differentiated NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, the impact of NIKE innovation and brand heat are driving increasingly stronger demand. While North America declined 6% for the quarter, we expect that the momentum will now reverse the trend. While undifferentiated wholesale dimensions in the marketplace declined, we are delivering and accelerating growth in NIKE Consumer Experiences, in aggregate, across owned and partnered with NIKE.com, in particular, accelerating to strong double-digit growth as we progress through the quarter.
Our partners are also increasingly bringing NIKE Consumer Experiences to life in the marketplace. As an example, Finish Line's Culver City store in LA was reset with NIKE Epic React as the only product available in the store across all brands for 3 days. The execution brought together new innovative NIKE product with great storytelling through our Choose Go campaign and expert service. The results were amazing and served as a proof point for the potential of NIKE Consumer Experiences operated by a strategic partner in the U.S. marketplace.
As Mark noted, year-over-year comparisons in North America were also impacted by our quick and deliberate tightening of the distribution of select styles within the Jordan Brand. That said, as we enter Q4, we believe Jordan inventories are now clean, and we also began reigniting Jordan Brand heat in the marketplace through the launches and activations over the NBA All-Star Weekend. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue adding dimension to the Jordan Brand through both performance and lifestyle product. For the quarter, EBIT in North America was down 14% versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expenses.
Moving on to EMEA, where we continue to see incredibly strong momentum in a region that is at the leading edge of consumer preferences. EMEA revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis in Q3. Two of the hottest styles in the marketplace are the Air VaporMax and Air Max 97, and we're also seeing industry leading growth in apparel, driven by our Tech Fleece business. Our growth in EMEA was also aided by our Express Lane, which is already quickly translating regional consumer preferences into color and material updates with respect to our Power Franchises.
Overall, growth in EMEA was led by very strong NIKE.com results as well as strong results with key strategic partners, key strategic partners who are also relentlessly consumer focused and digitally connected such as JD and Zalando. Categorically, we saw double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training and NIKE Basketball. We expect continued strong growth in EMEA, and we're excited about the impact of the upcoming World Cup. On a reported basis, EMEA revenue increased 19% and EBIT grew 16% as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin due to transactional FX headwinds.
Next, let's turn to Greater China. Having just been in China 2 weeks ago, I can tell you that Greater China not only continues to lead NIKE in terms of the pace of growth but also in terms of executing the Consumer Direct Offense. In Q3, Greater China was up 19% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong double-digit growth across nearly all dimensions of the business but notably led by digital. Digital momentum in the quarter was fueled by the launch of the SNKRS app in China and the continued success of our partnership with Tmall.
And while our digital growth has been extraordinary, we have not even yet launched NikePlus membership in China. That is now slated for Q1 of fiscal year '19. Also worth calling out, our women's business in Greater China has incredible momentum with double-digit growth driven by our innovation and Power Franchises, including styles designed specifically to connect with consumers around the Chinese New Year. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue grew 24% and EBIT was up 30% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.
In APLA, revenue grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis led by digital growth that significantly outpaced every other channel. To unlock digital growth even more broadly, we will be more aggressively rolling out our digital platforms into key markets across APLA. One real-time example is the SNKRS app, which just launched in Japan yesterday. It immediately surged to become Japan's #1 free downloaded app in the iOS store. APLA was also fueled by the brand energy surrounding the Winter Olympics in Korea, which helped drive strong and balanced double-digit growth across nearly every dimension: women's, men's, footwear, apparel and across many categories. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue in APLA was up 13% and EBIT grew 31%, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
And finally at Converse, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis as we rebalanced marketplace supply in North America. On a reported basis, revenue declined 3% and EBIT was down 37%. Looking forward, we will continue to invest in reigniting strong, sustainable, profitable growth at Converse. More specifically, we're dimensionalizing Converse's product portfolio through the One Star, Chuck 70 and other sport and sport-inspired styles, investing in more Converse-specific digital platforms and creating heat and energy for the brand through new collaborations.
So with that, I'll now move to our outlook for the balance of the year. We remain confident we will deliver on the growth and profitability expectations that we have previously communicated for fiscal year '18, excluding the onetime impact of U.S. tax reform. We will continue to invest in the key pillars of our strategy and drive accelerated growth in the dimensions of our portfolio that we highlighted at our Investor Day in October. We remain focused on what matters most to consumers and in turn, what will fuel strong, sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.
As for specific guidance, we expect Q4 reported revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. This growth reflects continued strength in our international geographies and the reversal of trend we're building in North America. We expect Q4 gross margin to be roughly flat to very slightly up versus the prior year, demonstrating progressively stronger currency-neutral gross margin expansion that will be almost fully offset by transactional FX headwinds, albeit lesser transactional FX headwinds than in prior quarters. For SG&A, we expect low teens growth in Q4. We will continue to invest in digital and membership, including completing the acquisitions of some key digital capabilities within the quarter as well as brand more marketing and supportive innovation and impactful consumer moments such as Air Max Day and the World Cup.
At current FX rates, we expect other income and expense, net of interest expense, to be approximately $30 million to $40 million of expense in Q4. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be in the 10% to 12% range. It's important to note that our tax rate may be volatile as we expect to continue receiving more specific legislative and regulatory guidance as to the application of the U.S. Tax Act.
Now looking ahead to fiscal year '19. While our planning is not yet finalized, we currently expect fiscal year '19 reported revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digit range as international momentum continues and we return to growth in North America. We also expect strong gross margin expansion roughly in line with our long-term financial model.
In fiscal year '19, we will also see the full impact of U.S. tax reform on our access to capital and investments as well as the tax rate. U.S. tax reform will certainly afford NIKE more efficient access to capital. So as we finalize our investment plans for the next fiscal year, we're prioritizing accelerated investment in the select dimensions of our business that will fuel NIKE's Consumer Direct Offense and drive long-term growth. At the top of our list is digital, ranging from new NikePlus membership experiences to new capabilities, including data and analytics, to our core enterprise resource planning platform. Our acquisition of Zodiac, a leading consumer data and analytics team, was a great example of us seizing an opportunity to accelerate NIKE's capability development. We'll also continue to prioritize investment in innovation, brand distinction, new NIKE Consumer Experiences in the marketplace and a faster, more responsive supply chain.
The incremental and more efficient access to capital will also enable us to amplify our returns to shareholders and complete our existing 4-year $12 billion share repurchase program within fiscal year '19, roughly 1 year earlier than originally planned.
We currently expect U.S. tax reform to have a neutral to slightly favorable impact on our steady-state effective tax rate, which we would characterize as being in the teens on a normalized basis. That said, in any given fiscal year, geographical earnings mix, the impact of the new stock-based compensation accounting rules and other discrete items will create volatility on our rate. In fiscal year '19 specifically, our rate may also be impacted by adjustments to the provisional charges that we're accruing this quarter.  Taking all of these factors into consideration, we will provide our updated outlook for fiscal year '19 on our Q4 earnings call.
As Mark said, our Consumer Direct Offense is working. NIKE Innovation is fueling strong consumer demand. NIKE Digital is accelerating. Our brands have great energy, and our organization is aligned and executing against what matters most to consumers. NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth is underway.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

NBA All-Star Weekend, we had kits and Revolve as 2 examples. Foot Locker was participating in that as well, and then we're bringing some of the new concepts to market here, starting very quickly with NIKE Unlaced with the digital launch and then physical coming up in summer. The NIKE App at Retail and Hyper Live are some of the examples there. As far as our -- this is impacting our overall marketplace. We're working with our key partners to help differentiate them in their respective positions. Those conversations are ongoing with most strategic partners. We've aligned on the role that they play in serving our consumers from DICK'S to Foot Locker to Nordstrom, and this is not only physical retail, but it's how physical and digital interact. And then we have other digital partners, which are obviously key to this transformation, Zalando and Tmall, ASOS and even Instagram for example. So this is a multi-year journey for us, and I'd say we're making great progress in shaping that marketplace. And I think we'll continue to elevate our own Direct business, but we will also help to differentiate and elevate our key wholesale partners along the way."

We're on the front end of -- obviously, the very front end of launching React, and the response has been phenomenal. I think I said it's been a record-setting performance launch for NIKE. I think that's also a case of performance basis that has also translated well into a product that can be worn on the street. So there's performance actually driving Sportswear and Lifestyle in one product. The other aspect of that is we are very committed to developing our platforms. So React, it starts with the Epic React running shoe, but you'll see that play out in other categories and also, in more models at different price points within Running. So I think that leverage is only going to build over time, and that's something that isn't unique to React. It's also what we're seeing in VaporMax as well. And then NIKE.com, in the quarter, has been a case of month-to-month acceleration, and that's driven also in part by these launches.

And I'd just add, our results in the third quarter in North America were largely in line with what we expected in the quarter. The contraction was primarily result of declines in undifferentiated wholesale and a deliberate tightening in the distribution of styles within the Jordan Brand. So that did have an impact on year-over-year comparisons. But as we said, we're really excited about the heat we've reignited with that brand and the clean inventory levels that we have there, too. And then to your point on innovation platforms, one of the metrics that we look very closely at is the rate of sell-through as we launch products at the initial levels of supply, and the rate of sell-through on the NIKE React, in particular, the Air Max 270 and those other styles, far exceeded our expectations. We talked about supply selling out in hours with members and in days as compared to what we expected would be weeks with more broader distribution. So that's a leading indicator of the magnitude of demand for those new innovation platforms."

I think our strength comes from both our performance position and how we leverage that across sportswear. So actually, we're very excited about some of the performance innovation coming in apparel. In fact, our 2X Innovation initiative commitment is equally being applied to apparel, and I think that will impact a product that you'll see at the World Cup, you'll see at the NBA Championships, you're seeing with our relationship with the NBA across all sport categories, training. And then it will wind up influencing more and more the sportswear category as well where we are performing incredibly well. I'm really excited about what's coming in innovation in apparel and then our ability to kind of push on both sides of the performance and sportswear side. So there's a lot coming in apparel, and frankly, there's a lot coming in footwear, a lot more coming in footwear than we've talked about. So I think our 2X Innovation investments, which really kicked in the gear about 2 years ago, are really starting to pay off. Anyway, back to your second question, Amazon. As you know, we have, I think you know, we have extended our pilot with Amazon, and to date, it's a smaller U.S.-based pilot. It's performed quite well. We've seen good sell-through on a limited selection of products. We're expanding that selection of products over this next phase. Our focus on this relationship really is how we can best work together to elevate the consumer experience, and that's really a key part of all of our digital partnerships. So we continue to engage with the U.S. digital marketplace to look at how we can serve digital demand from consumers, and Amazon is definitely a part of that. We get, just to back up for a second, get the most out of the partnerships that advance our brand through better presentation, through the sharing of data. Tmall in China, Zalando in Europe, these are great examples of those types of relationships. So we'll continue to work with Amazon to what we think will be a mutually beneficial partnership over the months ahead."

Well, as you know, Michael, we didn't give specific SG&A guidance for fiscal year '19, and there are really 2 reasons for that. One, we've never operated because we're not. We've never operated as if we are, and we aren't capital constrained. So our top priority, as we look ahead to any given fiscal year, is to ensure that we're prioritizing the investments that are going to fuel growth over the long term as compared to adhering to -- rigidly to a specific metric in a short-term period. The Tax Act does also afford us even more efficient access to the cash flow and the capital that we generate around the world. So yes, our planning process is taking both of those into account in the context of us having a new very focused strategy. So we're prioritizing investments specifically in innovation. I've told you in the past that we doubled the investment in innovation. We continue to make incremental investments there, and I want to pause there for a moment. It's really a competitive advantage for NIKE. The -- we currently invest probably more than any other brand in the marketplace, but we're going to continue to make incremental meaningful investments. But those investments are still relatively insignificant compared to the kind of growth and returns that they generate when you consider launches like React, VaporMax and the other platforms that Mark and I have shared. So innovation is certainly a priority. We're going to continue to drive brand distinction. You probably saw our Choose Go campaign over the last several months and the energy that, that's creating as well as some of the energy we created against the All-Star weekend and other big moments in sport. And I would say, even though I'm mentioning it third, at the top of our list is digital capabilities, both building them and like we said, acquiring capabilities through teams like the team we acquired in Zodiac. And then there are really 2 final areas that are on our short list of priorities: NIKE Consumer Experiences owned and partner, that as Mark noted, integrate or leverage digital in the physical environment. We are clearly doing that ourselves, and we're increasingly doing that with our partners all at various stages of development. But we're going to continue to test and innovate there. And then finally, we are prioritizing investment in speed through 2 key initiatives: our Express Lane and responsive manufacturing. So in short, we believe these are the investments that are going to drive brand distinction for NIKE and fuel our next horizon of long-term sustainable profitable growth, and we're going to over index our investment in those dimensions."

Overall, ASPs for the entire enterprise were up, and ASPs in North America were slightly up all in.

We're seeing stronger full-price sell-through, and we're seeing better margin on the off-price dimension of that business. Now the off-price dimension of digital is bigger today than it might have been a couple of years ago. So on a relative basis, you've got more off price in digital in general in the marketplace both owned and partner. But I would say that is -- has been a source of margin expansion for us.

I'd first like to acknowledge the changes we made last week to further evolve our culture and restructure our leadership. We became aware of some behavioral issues that are inconsistent with NIKE's values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment. I'm committed to ensure that we have an environment where every NIKE employee can have a positive experience and reach their full potential. As you know, I've publicly committed to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of NIKE, Inc. beyond 2020. Trevor Edwards and I both agreed to a change in leadership structure in the NIKE Brand at this time. As we transition to our next phase of growth and continue to evolve our culture, Trevor will work with me as an adviser through this transition until he retires in August, and I'd like to thank him for his important and significant contributions in growing and strengthening the NIKE Brand around the world.
We have a deep leadership bench at NIKE, and I'm confident that our restructured leadership team will continue to strengthen our culture and drive the Consumer Direct Offense. So with that, this call will be led by our CFO, Andy Campion and me. So let's turn to the results we delivered in Q3 and the strong momentum we're building as we look forward.
Simply put, the Consumer Direct Offense is working. Through 2X Innovation, we're creating and scaling new product platforms while also becoming sharper editors. Through 2X Direct, we're moving closer to the consumer through differentiated retail concepts, leading with our mobile apps, .com and digital partners. And through 2X Speed, we're serving consumers at their pace.
During our Investor Day, we discussed the significant potential we see in our international markets, and this quarter, we delivered strong and sustainable growth across all of our international geographies. Take Greater China for example, where positive macro trends are accelerating from consumer spending to sport participation. Looking ahead, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand our full digital portfolio, leading with key cities like Shanghai and Beijing. We saw this quarter with our Greater China business growing 24%.
The end of Q3 also marks a significant turn in North America, where we expect a reversal of trend in Q4. We've secured some great early wins here through new NIKE Consumer Experiences and differentiated retail across both our direct and partner channels. Overall, there's a strong global appetite for athletic footwear and apparel, and we're amplifying and capturing that demand through our Consumer Direct Offense and Triple Double strategy. The momentum we're building in all 4 geographies is the result of getting the right product in front of the consumer in the right moment, and it's becoming increasingly clear that the closer we connect our strong brand to consumers in the marketplace, the greater the returns.
So I'm excited to share some of the highlights of how we're executing the Triple Double and fueling our growth in our key categories. At NIKE, growth always begins with innovation and great product, and this quarter, through 2X Innovation, we intensified the pace and scale at which we're bringing fresh and unexpected products to consumers. And we've done that by focusing our resources to create new platforms, not just new models, by diversifying those platforms across multiple styles and categories through our complete offense and by editing our assortments to offer more compelling choice of our Power Franchises.
So let's start with the new platforms. What's most exciting about our momentum is that it's being driven through a performance lens, delivering clear consumer benefits through platforms like the Air VaporMax and Nike React. The Air VaporMax, for example, is delivering lightweight comfort with a distinct style. And it quickly became the #1 performance shoe above the $100 price point, and we're now scaling that platform into millions of pairs. We're doing that with new designs like the VaporMax 2.0, the VaporMax 97 and the VaporMax Utility.
Turning to Nike React, the consumer response has set new records for performance innovation launch. We initially offered the product to NikePlus members exclusively, selling out within hours. And when we broadened the launch, we sold through several weeks of supply in just 4 days. As we move into Q4, we'll leverage that demand by scaling the Epic React; launching the Odyssey, a new running shoe at the $120 price point; and leveraging our portfolio to expand React cushioning into Sportswear, Basketball and Jordan icons.
With the Air Max 270, we launched NIKE's bold lifestyle-specific Air platform with consumers responding to its comfort and style. Both the Air VaporMax and the Air Max 270 are fueling energy across our Nike Air family of products. With more Air innovation in the pipeline, we now expect to grow the Nike Air business by several billion dollars over the next few years. The greater scale of these platforms will create greater impact on our business into Q4 and beyond.
With other innovation platforms, we're just getting started. For example, we invented a new process for Flyknit, which we unveiled with our Mercurial boots ahead of World Cup '18. Constructed in a 360-degree form that wraps the entire foot, it gives athletes better control over their movement. It's also incredibly efficient, creating 60% less waste than traditional cut-and-sew methods.
The KOBE 360 will be the next shoe to adopt this new process of digital knitting, combined with the Nike React midsole to create an incredible cork feel. And in just a few weeks, we'll unveil a new platform that I'm extremely excited about. It takes digital product creation to an entirely new place, and as we did with the ZoomX, 4% for Breaking2, we're working closely with Eliud Kipchoge on this one. I can't say much more today, but stay tuned in Q4.
We have some other truly disruptive platforms ahead, from HyperAdapt at new price points and new categories to non-powered adaptive footwear systems that improve fit, to other lifestyle cushioning systems. We're also innovating in apparel. We've begun to unveil our high-performance World Cup Vapor Knit kits with engineered yarns and open textures for breathability. In addition to designing the National Team kits, we've created full lifestyle collections for fans. World Cup is such a powerful moment in sport, and we look forward to amplifying its energy [indiscernible] and sportswear businesses around the world.
As we laid out in October, 2X Direct is delivering a vision for a more differentiated marketplace, connecting the NIKE Brand in deeper ways with consumers. And we're leading with our digital business, which was up 18% on a currency-neutral basis in Q3, and we just launched the SNKRS app in China in December, and in the first month alone, we had 2 million downloads. And we're also scaling NikePlus membership with plans to launch in all 12 of our key cities within the next fiscal year. We're still in the early stages of NikePlus membership, but we saw strong consumer response in Q3 with new members rising more than 50% versus the same period last year.
While we lead with digital, we don't believe digital and physical retail operate in silos. In fact, more and more, they will intersect and amplify each other. For example, in Q4, we're going to debut a new concept that we call Nike App at Retail at both The Grove in Los Angeles and here in Portland. When you enter the doors, it recognizes you and opens up exclusive products in your app. You can scan for product availability in all nearby NIKE doors or check out and pay through the app with no waiting line. And if you're not in the store, you can reserve product through the app, and we'll hold it in a personal locker so you can try it on before buying. There are a number of other features that'll be phased in as we test, initiate before scaling to our wider fleet of stores.
What really powers all these immersive Consumer Experiences is great data and the ability to maximize it. And while we're constantly building these skills in-house, we're also acquiring capabilities to accelerate our strategy. Today, we're announcing that we've acquired an exceptional consumer data and analytics firm named Zodiac. Based in New York, this team of world-class data scientists and their proprietary tools will help us deepen relationships with consumers all over the world with a primary focus on our NikePlus members.
Better analytics are also a critical factor in our 2X Speed initiative. As we sharpen our consumer sensing, we can meet demand faster and deliver more relevant, personalized products. We've made good progress with our Express Lane teams, especially in EMEA where Express Lane product is accelerating growth in our Power Franchises. In North America, we're increasing our speed of delivery, particularly around key cities. Our focus for fiscal '19 is to apply those learnings further and on to our biggest volume drivers around the world.
The Triple Double comes to life through our categories. It's how we amplify sport's biggest moments, connect our brand emotionally with consumers and drive a complete offense to grow our business. So let's touch on a few of the category highlights from the quarter.
The NIKE Basketball category had a very strong quarter, growing double digits with growth across footwear and apparel in every geography and key city. We saw success with the launches of the KYRIE 4 and the PG 2, and through the LeBron Watch, consumers could buy LEBRON 15 player edition shoes as soon as he debuted them on court.
We've exceeded expectation in our first season as an official NBA partner, growing the NBA business significantly over the last year. A major bright spot has been the iconic Showtime Hoodie. It's been a huge hit at retail and has driven a whole new silhouette for NIKE apparel.
 
Perhaps the greatest source of brand energy for both NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand was the NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles. Over the 3 days, we became the first brand to sell directly through Snapchat with the Tinker AJ3 selling out in just 23 minutes. We launched SNKRS Pass, our geolocated digital wristband that unlocks access to high-heat product as we did with our Cortez collaboration with Kendrick Lamar. And we hosted thousands of consumers in our Makers' customization space.
In college basketball, we're in the midst of one of the most unpredictable NCA (sic) [ NCAA ] tournaments in history, and NIKE and Jordan once again showed the strength of our partnerships, sponsoring 85 teams across the men's and women's fields for March Madness.
With the Jordan Brand, we're making the right moves to keep this iconic brand special and create sustained growth. This quarter, we deliberately tightened distribution in the North America marketplace while also driving extraordinary heat with the consumer. We launched Russell Westbrook's first signature performance shoe with the Why Not Zer0.1. And we released limited-edition Jordan 3s on the SNKRS app immediately after Justin Timberlake wore them at the Super Bowl halftime show.
We've talked about adding new dimensions to Jordan, and this quarter, we accelerated that strategy. Going forward, we will carefully manage the distribution of iconic styles. We'll more completely leverage the company's innovation platforms to supercharge Jordan's performance products. We'll expand into new categories beyond Basketball and Sportswear and drive our biggest growth opportunities in international, apparel and women's.
Moving on to our largest and most influential performance category, Running, where we're driving more innovation than any other time in our history. In addition to all the platforms we discussed, we're focused on growing our core footwear business using our Express Lane to seize opportunities, and we're adding new dimensions to our Power Franchises like the Zoom Pegasus. For example, this summer, the women's Zoom Pegasus 35 will have cushioning that's better tuned to her, and the new Peg Turbo will include ZoomX foam making our break-through platform accessible to more runners.
We also had a very strong quarter in our Sportswear category, which continued to grow double digits with strong growth across both footwear and apparel. Tech Fleece led the way in apparel, while in footwear, we led with the Air Force 1, Cortez, Laser, Tanjun and Air Max.
Our women's business overall continues to accelerate. We created our first women's collection with both NIKE and the Jordan Brand. The 1 Reimagined featured 14 Nike Women's designers who reinterpreted 2 of our greatest icons in the Air Jordan 1 and the Air Force 1.
One of the best examples of our Edit To Amplify approach came from the women's team this quarter with the new retail concept we call Unlaced. This new sneaker destination offers collections edited by leading stylists and will give access to a wider range of sizes for the first time with exclusive colors and elevated services. Unlaced will be both a physical and digital experience starting with NIKE.com in North America. It'll debut at NIKE Soho this summer and then roll out to over 200 NIKE Direct and Wholesale partner doors by the end of the calendar year.
As you can tell, we were extremely productive this quarter. We're looking at every opportunity to improve, and we're investing in the opportunities with the greatest impact. We feel very good about the short-term momentum we're driving and the foundation we're setting for long-term accelerated growth.
With that, now here's Andy to provide more detail on the financial performance of our reported segments and our outlook."
291981,553754887,1423798,"NIKE, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2018",2018-03-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone on the call. Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting NIKE's next horizon of strong profitable growth, and there are several key themes within our performance that speak",2474,"Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone on the call. Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting NIKE's next horizon of strong profitable growth, and there are several key themes within our performance that speak to the long-term sustainability of our momentum.
First, we exceeded the revenue and gross margin expectations that we set 90 days ago, fueled by an unprecedented flow of new products and innovation platforms that will scale over time. As Mark detailed, in the third quarter, we launched the Nike React and the Air Max 270 platforms to extraordinary consumer demand. We also began to scale and diversify the Air VaporMax platform, and the ZoomX platform in Running continues to sell out as we launch new colorways.
While we're clearly doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, our product momentum is even broader based. Our Edit To Amplify approach is bringing focus and accelerating growth within our Power Franchises like the Air Force 1 family of products and other key styles. We're running a much more complete offense, yet we still see tremendous opportunity to improve and edit how we serve our consumers.
Second, our results in Q3 confirm that where the NIKE Brand more directly connects with consumers, we see the greatest growth. Our NIKE Digital ecosystem, in particular, is setting the pace for growth in all 4 of our geographies. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE.com grew 18% globally, driven by the expansion of our digital apps in international markets as well as the launch of NikePlus membership in North America. In each of our international geographies, NIKE.com's rate of growth outpaced the overall marketplace rate of growth by 2x or greater. And in North America, NIKE.com not only grew but has been accelerating over the last 2 months. NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail are also resonating. That includes owned and partnered digital and physical experiences. In Q3, NIKE Consumer Experiences comprised more than 50% of our total revenue and drove over 100% of our revenue growth. In other words, we're both growing and reshaping the marketplace toward the vision that we shared with you at our Investor Day.
Third, as we exit Q3, we will put 2 significant headwinds largely behind us. At current rates, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on EBIT, net of hedging, to be roughly neutral in Q4 and begin shifting to a slight tailwind in fiscal year '19. At the same time, as Mark said, the close of Q3 marks a reversal of trend for North America. We have reset NIKE's supply. We're fueling demand through the launch of innovative products. We have reignited brand heat. We're connecting more directly with consumers through our digital ecosystem, and orders from our strategic partners are building. In short, NIKE has returned to a pull market in North America. NIKE North America revenue is now projected to be roughly flat to prior year in Q4 and return to growth in the first half of fiscal year '19.
But before I share more on our outlook, let's first touch on our Q3 results. Q3 reported revenue grew 7% as continued strong double-digit international growth and NIKE Direct growth in all geographies was partially offset by an expected contraction in North America wholesale revenue, driven by undifferentiated doors. Gross margin contracted 70 basis points in Q3, a stronger result than we expected 90 days ago, as our launches and stronger sell-through fueled expanding full-price gross margin. However, that expansion was more than offset by approximately 90 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds.
Total SG&A was up 11% in Q3. Operating overhead increased 9%, driven by investments in our NIKE Direct businesses, and demand creation increased 15%, primarily driven by sports marketing and activations related to the NBA All-Star Weekend as well as new product innovation launches.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was roughly 180%, including the onetime impacts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Income tax expense included provisional charges of $2 billion primarily related to the transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The onetime charges include some non-cash impacts with the cash impacts to be paid over several years.
The impact of U.S. tax reform is slightly favorable to NIKE in terms of both our normalized, steady-state effective tax rate and more efficient access to capital. When I speak to our outlook, I'll provide more dimension on the go-forward implications of tax reform.
As a result, Q3 diluted EPS was a loss of $0.57. That said, the onetime impact of U.S. tax reform had a $1.25 impact on EPS in the quarter. Excluding that impact, our profitability in Q3 exceeded our expectations.
As of February 28, inventories were up 9%, leading into Q4 as we scale our new innovations globally and capitalize on strong consumer demand. Q3 inventory growth was primarily driven by aligning in-season product to our stronger forecast demand, while off-price inventory declined year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. This quarter, we saw a return to modest growth in North America inventory as we anniversary our efforts to tighten supply in the prior year and shift to a pull market. Internationally, our inventory levels are also healthy and generally aligned with the strong demand we continue to forecast in those markets.
Now let's turn to the financial performance through our operating segments. In North America, NIKE.com, differentiated NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, the impact of NIKE innovation and brand heat are driving increasingly stronger demand. While North America declined 6% for the quarter, we expect that the momentum will now reverse the trend. While undifferentiated wholesale dimensions in the marketplace declined, we are delivering and accelerating growth in NIKE Consumer Experiences, in aggregate, across owned and partnered with NIKE.com, in particular, accelerating to strong double-digit growth as we progress through the quarter.
Our partners are also increasingly bringing NIKE Consumer Experiences to life in the marketplace. As an example, Finish Line's Culver City store in LA was reset with NIKE Epic React as the only product available in the store across all brands for 3 days. The execution brought together new innovative NIKE product with great storytelling through our Choose Go campaign and expert service. The results were amazing and served as a proof point for the potential of NIKE Consumer Experiences operated by a strategic partner in the U.S. marketplace.
As Mark noted, year-over-year comparisons in North America were also impacted by our quick and deliberate tightening of the distribution of select styles within the Jordan Brand. That said, as we enter Q4, we believe Jordan inventories are now clean, and we also began reigniting Jordan Brand heat in the marketplace through the launches and activations over the NBA All-Star Weekend. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue adding dimension to the Jordan Brand through both performance and lifestyle product. For the quarter, EBIT in North America was down 14% versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expenses.
Moving on to EMEA, where we continue to see incredibly strong momentum in a region that is at the leading edge of consumer preferences. EMEA revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis in Q3. Two of the hottest styles in the marketplace are the Air VaporMax and Air Max 97, and we're also seeing industry leading growth in apparel, driven by our Tech Fleece business. Our growth in EMEA was also aided by our Express Lane, which is already quickly translating regional consumer preferences into color and material updates with respect to our Power Franchises.
Overall, growth in EMEA was led by very strong NIKE.com results as well as strong results with key strategic partners, key strategic partners who are also relentlessly consumer focused and digitally connected such as JD and Zalando. Categorically, we saw double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training and NIKE Basketball. We expect continued strong growth in EMEA, and we're excited about the impact of the upcoming World Cup. On a reported basis, EMEA revenue increased 19% and EBIT grew 16% as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin due to transactional FX headwinds.
Next, let's turn to Greater China. Having just been in China 2 weeks ago, I can tell you that Greater China not only continues to lead NIKE in terms of the pace of growth but also in terms of executing the Consumer Direct Offense. In Q3, Greater China was up 19% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong double-digit growth across nearly all dimensions of the business but notably led by digital. Digital momentum in the quarter was fueled by the launch of the SNKRS app in China and the continued success of our partnership with Tmall.
And while our digital growth has been extraordinary, we have not even yet launched NikePlus membership in China. That is now slated for Q1 of fiscal year '19. Also worth calling out, our women's business in Greater China has incredible momentum with double-digit growth driven by our innovation and Power Franchises, including styles designed specifically to connect with consumers around the Chinese New Year. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue grew 24% and EBIT was up 30% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.
In APLA, revenue grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis led by digital growth that significantly outpaced every other channel. To unlock digital growth even more broadly, we will be more aggressively rolling out our digital platforms into key markets across APLA. One real-time example is the SNKRS app, which just launched in Japan yesterday. It immediately surged to become Japan's #1 free downloaded app in the iOS store. APLA was also fueled by the brand energy surrounding the Winter Olympics in Korea, which helped drive strong and balanced double-digit growth across nearly every dimension: women's, men's, footwear, apparel and across many categories. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue in APLA was up 13% and EBIT grew 31%, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
And finally at Converse, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis as we rebalanced marketplace supply in North America. On a reported basis, revenue declined 3% and EBIT was down 37%. Looking forward, we will continue to invest in reigniting strong, sustainable, profitable growth at Converse. More specifically, we're dimensionalizing Converse's product portfolio through the One Star, Chuck 70 and other sport and sport-inspired styles, investing in more Converse-specific digital platforms and creating heat and energy for the brand through new collaborations.
So with that, I'll now move to our outlook for the balance of the year. We remain confident we will deliver on the growth and profitability expectations that we have previously communicated for fiscal year '18, excluding the onetime impact of U.S. tax reform. We will continue to invest in the key pillars of our strategy and drive accelerated growth in the dimensions of our portfolio that we highlighted at our Investor Day in October. We remain focused on what matters most to consumers and in turn, what will fuel strong, sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.
As for specific guidance, we expect Q4 reported revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. This growth reflects continued strength in our international geographies and the reversal of trend we're building in North America. We expect Q4 gross margin to be roughly flat to very slightly up versus the prior year, demonstrating progressively stronger currency-neutral gross margin expansion that will be almost fully offset by transactional FX headwinds, albeit lesser transactional FX headwinds than in prior quarters. For SG&A, we expect low teens growth in Q4. We will continue to invest in digital and membership, including completing the acquisitions of some key digital capabilities within the quarter as well as brand more marketing and supportive innovation and impactful consumer moments such as Air Max Day and the World Cup.
At current FX rates, we expect other income and expense, net of interest expense, to be approximately $30 million to $40 million of expense in Q4. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be in the 10% to 12% range. It's important to note that our tax rate may be volatile as we expect to continue receiving more specific legislative and regulatory guidance as to the application of the U.S. Tax Act.
Now looking ahead to fiscal year '19. While our planning is not yet finalized, we currently expect fiscal year '19 reported revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digit range as international momentum continues and we return to growth in North America. We also expect strong gross margin expansion roughly in line with our long-term financial model.
In fiscal year '19, we will also see the full impact of U.S. tax reform on our access to capital and investments as well as the tax rate. U.S. tax reform will certainly afford NIKE more efficient access to capital. So as we finalize our investment plans for the next fiscal year, we're prioritizing accelerated investment in the select dimensions of our business that will fuel NIKE's Consumer Direct Offense and drive long-term growth. At the top of our list is digital, ranging from new NikePlus membership experiences to new capabilities, including data and analytics, to our core enterprise resource planning platform. Our acquisition of Zodiac, a leading consumer data and analytics team, was a great example of us seizing an opportunity to accelerate NIKE's capability development. We'll also continue to prioritize investment in innovation, brand distinction, new NIKE Consumer Experiences in the marketplace and a faster, more responsive supply chain.
The incremental and more efficient access to capital will also enable us to amplify our returns to shareholders and complete our existing 4-year $12 billion share repurchase program within fiscal year '19, roughly 1 year earlier than originally planned.
We currently expect U.S. tax reform to have a neutral to slightly favorable impact on our steady-state effective tax rate, which we would characterize as being in the teens on a normalized basis. That said, in any given fiscal year, geographical earnings mix, the impact of the new stock-based compensation accounting rules and other discrete items will create volatility in our rate. In fiscal year '19 specifically, our rate may also be impacted by adjustments to the provisional charges that we're accruing this quarter. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we will provide our updated outlook for fiscal year '19 on our Q4 earnings call.
As Mark said, our Consumer Direct Offense is working. NIKE Innovation is fueling strong consumer demand. NIKE Digital is accelerating. Our brands have great energy, and our organization is aligned and executing against what matters most to consumers. NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth is underway.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

NBA All-Star Weekend, we had kits and Revolve as 2 examples. Foot Locker was participating in that as well, and then we're bringing some of the new concepts to market here, starting very quickly with NIKE Unlaced with the digital launch and then physical coming up in summer. The NIKE App at Retail and Hyperlive are some of the examples there. As far as our -- this is impacting our overall marketplace. We're working with our key partners to help differentiate them in their respective positions. Those conversations are ongoing with most strategic partners. We've aligned on the role that they play in serving our consumers from DICK'S to Foot Locker to Nordstrom, and this is not only physical retail, but it's how physical and digital interact. And then we have other digital partners, which are obviously key to this transformation, Zalando and Tmall, ASOS and even Instagram for example. So this is a multi-year journey for us, and I'd say we're making great progress in shaping that marketplace. And I think we'll continue to elevate our own Direct business, but we will also help to differentiate and elevate our key wholesale partners along the way."

We're on the front end of -- obviously, the very front end of launching React, and the response has been phenomenal. I think I said it's been a record-setting performance launch for NIKE. I think that's also a case of performance basis that has also translated well into a product that can be worn on the street. So there's performance actually driving Sportswear and Lifestyle in one product. The other aspect of that is we are very committed to developing our platforms. So React, it starts with the Epic React running shoe, but you'll see that play out in other categories and also, in more models at different price points within Running. So I think that leverage is only going to build over time, and that's something that isn't unique to React. It's also what we're seeing in VaporMax as well. And then NIKE.com, in the quarter, has been a case of month-to-month acceleration, and that's driven also in part by these launches.

And I'd just add, our results in the third quarter in North America were largely in line with what we expected in the quarter. The contraction was primarily a result of declines in undifferentiated wholesale and a deliberate tightening in the distribution of styles within the Jordan Brand. So that did have an impact on year-over-year comparisons. But as we said, we're really excited about the heat we've reignited with that brand and the clean inventory levels that we have there, too. And then to your point on innovation platforms, one of the metrics that we look very closely at is the rate of sell-through as we launch products at the initial levels of supply, and the rate of sell-through on the NIKE React, in particular, the Air Max 270 and those other styles, far exceeded our expectations. We talked about supply selling out in hours with members and in days as compared to what we expected would be weeks with more broader distribution. So that's a leading indicator of the magnitude of demand for those new innovation platforms."

I think our strength comes from both our performance position and how we leverage that across sportswear. So actually, we're very excited about some of the performance innovation coming in apparel. In fact, our 2X Innovation initiative commitment is equally being applied to apparel, and I think that will impact a product that you'll see at the World Cup, you'll see at the NBA Championships, you're seeing with our relationship with the NBA across all sport categories, training. And then it will wind up influencing more and more the sportswear category as well where we are performing incredibly well. I'm really excited about what's coming in innovation in apparel and then our ability to kind of push on both sides of the performance and sportswear side. So there's a lot coming in apparel, and frankly, there's a lot coming in footwear -- a lot more coming in footwear than we've talked about. So I think our 2X Innovation investments, which really kicked in the gear about 2 years ago, are really starting to pay off. Anyway, back to your second question, Amazon. As you know, we have, I think you know, we have extended our pilot with Amazon, and to date, it's a smaller U.S.-based pilot. It's performed quite well. We've seen good sell-through on a limited selection of products. We're expanding that selection of products over this next phase. Our focus on this relationship really is how we can best work together to elevate the consumer experience, and that's really a key part of all of our digital partnerships. So we continue to engage with the U.S. digital marketplace to look at how we can serve digital demand from consumers, and Amazon is definitely a part of that. We get, just to back up for a second, get the most out of the partnerships that advance our brand through better presentation, through the sharing of data. Tmall in China, Zalando in Europe, these are great examples of those types of relationships. So we'll continue to work with Amazon to what we think will be a mutually beneficial partnership over the months ahead."

Well, as you know, Michael, we didn't give specific SG&A guidance for fiscal year '19, and there are really 2 reasons for that. One, we've never operated because we're not. We've never operated as if we are, and we aren't capital constrained. So our top priority, as we look ahead to any given fiscal year, is to ensure that we're prioritizing the investments that are going to fuel growth over the long term as compared to adhering to -- rigidly to a specific metric in a short-term period. The Tax Act does also afford us even more efficient access to the cash flow and the capital that we generate around the world. So yes, our planning process is taking both of those into account in the context of us having a new very focused strategy. So we're prioritizing investments specifically in innovation. I've told you in the past that we doubled the investment in innovation. We continue to make incremental investments there, and I want to pause there for a moment. It's really a competitive advantage for NIKE. The -- we currently invest probably more than any other brand in the marketplace, but we're going to continue to make incremental meaningful investments. But those investments are still relatively insignificant compared to the kind of growth and returns that they generate when you consider launches like React, VaporMax and the other platforms that Mark and I have shared. So innovation is certainly a priority. We're going to continue to drive brand distinction. You probably saw our Choose Go campaign over the last several months and the energy that, that's creating as well as some of the energy we created against the All-Star weekend and other big moments in sport. And I would say, even though I'm mentioning it third, at the top of our list is digital capabilities, both building them and like we said, acquiring capabilities through teams like the team we acquired in Zodiac. And then there are really 2 final areas that are on our short list of priorities: NIKE Consumer Experiences owned and partner, that as Mark noted, integrate or leverage digital in the physical environment. We are clearly doing that ourselves, and we're increasingly doing that with our partners all at various stages of development. But we're going to continue to test and innovate there. And then finally, we are prioritizing investment in speed through 2 key initiatives: our Express Lane and responsive manufacturing. So in short, we believe these are the investments that are going to drive brand distinction for NIKE and fuel our next horizon of long-term sustainable profitable growth, and we're going to over index our investment in those dimensions."

Overall, ASPs for the entire enterprise were up, and ASPs in North America were slightly up all in.

We're seeing stronger full-price sell-through, and we're seeing better margin on the off-price dimension of that business. Now the off-price dimension of digital is bigger today than it might have been a couple of years ago. So on a relative basis, you've got more off price in digital in general in the marketplace both owned and partner. But I would say that is -- has been a source of margin expansion for us.

So with that, this call will be led by our CFO, Andy Campion and me. So let's turn to the results we delivered in Q3 and the strong momentum we're building as we look forward.
Simply put, the Consumer Direct Offense is working. Through 2X Innovation, we're creating and scaling new product platforms while also becoming sharper editors. Through 2X Direct, we're moving closer to the consumer through differentiated retail concepts, leading with our mobile apps, .com and digital partners. And through 2X Speed, we're serving consumers at their pace.
During our Investor Day, we discussed the significant potential we see in our international markets, and this quarter, we delivered strong and sustainable growth across all of our international geographies. Take Greater China for example, where positive macro trends are accelerating from consumer spending to sport participation. Looking ahead, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand our full digital portfolio, leading with key cities like Shanghai and Beijing. We saw this quarter with our Greater China business growing 24%.
The end of Q3 also marks a significant turn in North America, where we expect a reversal of trend in Q4. We've secured some great early wins here through new NIKE Consumer Experiences and differentiated retail across both our direct and partner channels. Overall, there's a strong global appetite for athletic footwear and apparel, and we're amplifying and capturing that demand through our Consumer Direct Offense and Triple Double strategy. The momentum we're building in all 4 geographies is the result of getting the right product in front of the consumer in the right moment, and it's becoming increasingly clear that the closer we connect our strong brand to consumers in the marketplace, the greater the returns.
So I'm excited to share some of the highlights of how we're executing the Triple Double and fueling our growth in our key categories. At NIKE, growth always begins with innovation and great product, and this quarter, through 2X Innovation, we intensified the pace and scale at which we're bringing fresh and unexpected products to consumers. And we've done that by focusing our resources to create new platforms, not just new models, by diversifying those platforms across multiple styles and categories through our complete offense and by editing our assortments to offer more compelling choice of our Power Franchises.
So let's start with the new platforms. What's most exciting about our momentum is that it's being driven through a performance lens, delivering clear consumer benefits through platforms like the Air VaporMax and Nike React. The Air VaporMax, for example, is delivering lightweight comfort with a distinct style. And it quickly became the #1 performance shoe above the $100 price point, and we're now scaling that platform into millions of pairs. We're doing that with new designs like the VaporMax 2.0, the VaporMax 97 and the VaporMax Utility.
Turning to Nike React, the consumer response has set new records for performance innovation launch. We initially offered the product to NikePlus members exclusively, selling out within hours. And when we broadened the launch, we sold through several weeks of supply in just 4 days. As we move into Q4, we'll leverage that demand by scaling the Epic React; launching the Odyssey, a new running shoe at the $120 price point; and leveraging our portfolio to expand React cushioning into Sportswear, Basketball and Jordan icons.
With the Air Max 270, we launched NIKE's bold lifestyle-specific Air platform with consumers responding to its comfort and style. Both the Air VaporMax and the Air Max 270 are fueling energy across our Nike Air family of products. With more Air innovation in the pipeline, we now expect to grow the Nike Air business by several billion dollars over the next few years. The greater scale of these platforms will create greater impact on our business into Q4 and beyond.
With other innovation platforms, we're just getting started. For example, we invented a new process for Flyknit, which we unveiled with our Mercurial boots ahead of World Cup '18. Constructed in a 360-degree form that wraps the entire foot, it gives athletes better control over their movement. It's also incredibly efficient, creating 60% less waste than traditional cut-and-sew methods.
The KOBE 360 will be the next shoe to adopt this new process of digital knitting, combined with the Nike React midsole to create an incredible cork feel. And in just a few weeks, we'll unveil a new platform that I'm extremely excited about. It takes digital product creation to an entirely new place, and as we did with the ZoomX, 4% for Breaking2, we're working closely with Eliud Kipchoge on this one. I can't say much more today, but stay tuned in Q4.
We have some other truly disruptive platforms ahead, from HyperAdapt at new price points and new categories to non-powered adaptive footwear systems that improve fit, to other lifestyle cushioning systems. We're also innovating in apparel. We've begun to unveil our high-performance World Cup Vapor Knit kits with engineered yarns and open textures for breathability. In addition to designing the National Team kits, we've created full lifestyle collections for fans. World Cup is such a powerful moment in sport, and we look forward to amplifying its energy [indiscernible] and sportswear businesses around the world.
As we laid out in October, 2X Direct is delivering a vision for a more differentiated marketplace, connecting the NIKE Brand in deeper ways with consumers. And we're leading with our digital business, which was up 18% on a currency-neutral basis in Q3, and we just launched the SNKRS app in China in December, and in the first month alone, we had 2 million downloads. And we're also scaling NikePlus membership with plans to launch in all 12 of our key cities within the next fiscal year. We're still in the early stages of NikePlus membership, but we saw strong consumer response in Q3 with new members rising more than 50% versus the same period last year.
While we lead with digital, we don't believe digital and physical retail operate in silos. In fact, more and more, they will intersect and amplify each other. For example, in Q4, we're going to debut a new concept that we call Nike App at Retail at both The Grove in Los Angeles and here in Portland. When you enter the doors, it recognizes you and opens up exclusive products in your app. You can scan for product availability in all nearby NIKE doors or check out and pay through the app with no waiting line. And if you're not in the store, you can reserve product through the app, and we'll hold it in a personal locker so you can try it on before buying. There are a number of other features that'll be phased in as we test, initiate before scaling to our wider fleet of stores.
What really powers all these immersive Consumer Experiences is great data and the ability to maximize it. And while we're constantly building these skills in-house, we're also acquiring capabilities to accelerate our strategy. Today, we're announcing that we've acquired an exceptional consumer data and analytics firm named Zodiac. Based in New York, this team of world-class data scientists and their proprietary tools will help us deepen relationships with consumers all over the world with a primary focus on our NikePlus members.
Better analytics are also a critical factor in our 2X Speed initiative. As we sharpen our consumer sensing, we can meet demand faster and deliver more relevant, personalized products. We've made good progress with our Express Lane teams, especially in EMEA where Express Lane product is accelerating growth in our Power Franchises. In North America, we're increasing our speed of delivery, particularly around key cities. Our focus for fiscal '19 is to apply those learnings further and on to our biggest volume drivers around the world.
The Triple Double comes to life through our categories. It's how we amplify sport's biggest moments, connect our brand emotionally with consumers and drive a complete offense to grow our business. So let's touch on a few of the category highlights from the quarter.
The NIKE Basketball category had a very strong quarter, growing double digits with growth across footwear and apparel in every geography and key city. We saw success with the launches of the KYRIE 4 and the PG 2, and through the LeBron Watch, consumers could buy LEBRON 15 player edition shoes as soon as he debuted them on court.
We've exceeded expectation in our first season as an official NBA partner, growing the NBA business significantly over the last year. A major bright spot has been the iconic Showtime Hoodie. It's been a huge hit at retail and has driven a whole new silhouette for NIKE apparel.
 
Perhaps the greatest source of brand energy for both NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand was the NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles. Over the 3 days, we became the first brand to sell directly through Snapchat with the Tinker AJ3 selling out in just 23 minutes. We launched SNKRS Pass, our geolocated digital wristband that unlocks access to high-heat product as we did with our Cortez collaboration with Kendrick Lamar. And we hosted thousands of consumers in our Makers' customization space.
In college basketball, we're in the midst of one of the most unpredictable NCA (sic) [ NCAA ] tournaments in history, and NIKE and Jordan once again showed the strength of our partnerships, sponsoring 85 teams across the men's and women's fields for March Madness.
With the Jordan Brand, we're making the right moves to keep this iconic brand special and create sustained growth. This quarter, we deliberately tightened distribution in the North America marketplace while also driving extraordinary heat with the consumer. We launched Russell Westbrook's first signature performance shoe with the Why Not Zer0.1. And we released limited-edition Jordan 3s on the SNKRS app immediately after Justin Timberlake wore them at the Super Bowl halftime show.
We've talked about adding new dimensions to Jordan, and this quarter, we accelerated that strategy. Going forward, we will carefully manage the distribution of iconic styles. We'll more completely leverage the company's innovation platforms to supercharge Jordan's performance products. We'll expand into new categories beyond Basketball and Sportswear and drive our biggest growth opportunities in international, apparel and women's.
Moving on to our largest and most influential performance category, Running, where we're driving more innovation than any other time in our history. In addition to all the platforms we discussed, we're focused on growing our core footwear business using our Express Lane to seize opportunities, and we're adding new dimensions to our Power Franchises like the Zoom Pegasus. For example, this summer, the women's Zoom Pegasus 35 will have cushioning that's better tuned to her, and the new Peg Turbo will include ZoomX foam making our break-through platform accessible to more runners.
We also had a very strong quarter in our Sportswear category, which continued to grow double digits with strong growth across both footwear and apparel. Tech Fleece led the way in apparel, while in footwear, we led with the Air Force 1, Cortez, Laser, Tanjun and Air Max.
Our women's business overall continues to accelerate. We created our first women's collection with both NIKE and the Jordan Brand. The 1 Reimagined featured 14 Nike Women's designers who reinterpreted 2 of our greatest icons in the Air Jordan 1 and the Air Force 1.
One of the best examples of our Edit To Amplify approach came from the women's team this quarter with the new retail concept we call Unlaced. This new sneaker destination offers collections edited by leading stylists and will give access to a wider range of sizes for the first time with exclusive colors and elevated services. Unlaced will be both a physical and digital experience starting with NIKE.com in North America. It'll debut at NIKE Soho this summer and then roll out to over 200 NIKE Direct and Wholesale partner doors by the end of the calendar year.
As you can tell, we were extremely productive this quarter. We're looking at every opportunity to improve, and we're investing in the opportunities with the greatest impact. We feel very good about the short-term momentum we're driving and the foundation we're setting for long-term accelerated growth.
With that, now here's Andy to provide more detail on the financial performance of our reported segments and our outlook."
291981,553754887,1424082,"NIKE, Inc., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2018",2018-03-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone on the call. Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting NIKE's next horizon of strong profitable growth, and there are several key themes within our performance that speak",2474,"Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone on the call. Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting NIKE's next horizon of strong profitable growth, and there are several key themes within our performance that speak to the long-term sustainability of our momentum.
First, we exceeded the revenue and gross margin expectations that we set 90 days ago, fueled by an unprecedented flow of new products and innovation platforms that will scale over time. As Mark detailed, in the third quarter, we launched the Nike React and the Air Max 270 platforms to extraordinary consumer demand. We also began to scale and diversify the Air VaporMax platform, and the ZoomX platform in Running continues to sell out as we launch new colorways.
While we're clearly doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, our product momentum is even broader based. Our Edit To Amplify approach is bringing focus and accelerating growth within our Power Franchises like the Air Force 1 family of products and other key styles. We're running a much more complete offense, yet we still see tremendous opportunity to improve and edit how we serve our consumers.
Second, our results in Q3 confirm that where the NIKE Brand more directly connects with consumers, we see the greatest growth. Our NIKE Digital ecosystem, in particular, is setting the pace for growth in all 4 of our geographies. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE.com grew 18% globally, driven by the expansion of our digital apps in international markets as well as the launch of NikePlus membership in North America. In each of our international geographies, NIKE.com's rate of growth outpaced the overall marketplace rate of growth by 2x or greater. And in North America, NIKE.com not only grew but has been accelerating over the last 2 months. NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail are also resonating. That includes owned and partnered digital and physical experiences. In Q3, NIKE Consumer Experiences comprised more than 50% of our total revenue and drove over 100% of our revenue growth. In other words, we're both growing and reshaping the marketplace toward the vision that we shared with you at our Investor Day.
Third, as we exit Q3, we will put 2 significant headwinds largely behind us. At current rates, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on EBIT, net of hedging, to be roughly neutral in Q4 and begin shifting to a slight tailwind in fiscal year '19. At the same time, as Mark said, the close of Q3 marks a reversal of trend for North America. We have reset NIKE's supply. We're fueling demand through the launch of innovative products. We have reignited brand heat. We're connecting more directly with consumers through our digital ecosystem, and orders from our strategic partners are building. In short, NIKE has returned to a pull market in North America. NIKE North America revenue is now projected to be roughly flat to prior year in Q4 and return to growth in the first half of fiscal year '19.
But before I share more on our outlook, let's first touch on our Q3 results. Q3 reported revenue grew 7% as continued strong double-digit international growth and NIKE Direct growth in all geographies was partially offset by an expected contraction in North America wholesale revenue, driven by undifferentiated doors. Gross margin contracted 70 basis points in Q3, a stronger result than we expected 90 days ago, as our launches and stronger sell-through fueled expanding full-price gross margin. However, that expansion was more than offset by approximately 90 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds.
Total SG&A was up 11% in Q3. Operating overhead increased 9%, driven by investments in our NIKE Direct businesses, and demand creation increased 15%, primarily driven by sports marketing and activations related to the NBA All-Star Weekend as well as new product innovation launches.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was roughly 180%, including the onetime impacts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Income tax expense included provisional charges of $2 billion primarily related to the transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The onetime charges include some non-cash impacts with the cash impacts to be paid over several years.
The impact of U.S. tax reform is slightly favorable to NIKE in terms of both our normalized, steady-state effective tax rate and more efficient access to capital. When I speak to our outlook, I'll provide more dimension on the go-forward implications of tax reform.
As a result, Q3 diluted EPS was a loss of $0.57. That said, the onetime impact of U.S. tax reform had a $1.25 impact on EPS in the quarter. Excluding that impact, our profitability in Q3 exceeded our expectations.
As of February 28, inventories were up 9%, leading into Q4 as we scale our new innovations globally and capitalize on strong consumer demand. Q3 inventory growth was primarily driven by aligning in-season product to our stronger forecast demand, while off-price inventory declined year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. This quarter, we saw a return to modest growth in North America inventory as we anniversary our efforts to tighten supply in the prior year and shift to a pull market. Internationally, our inventory levels are also healthy and generally aligned with the strong demand we continue to forecast in those markets.
Now let's turn to the financial performance through our operating segments. In North America, NIKE.com, differentiated NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, the impact of NIKE innovation and brand heat are driving increasingly stronger demand. While North America declined 6% for the quarter, we expect that the momentum will now reverse the trend. While undifferentiated wholesale dimensions in the marketplace declined, we are delivering and accelerating growth in NIKE Consumer Experiences, in aggregate, across owned and partnered with NIKE.com, in particular, accelerating to strong double-digit growth as we progress through the quarter.
Our partners are also increasingly bringing NIKE Consumer Experiences to life in the marketplace. As an example, Finish Line's Culver City store in LA was reset with NIKE Epic React as the only product available in the store across all brands for 3 days. The execution brought together new innovative NIKE product with great storytelling through our Choose Go campaign and expert service. The results were amazing and served as a proof point for the potential of NIKE Consumer Experiences operated by a strategic partner in the U.S. marketplace.
As Mark noted, year-over-year comparisons in North America were also impacted by our quick and deliberate tightening of the distribution of select styles within the Jordan Brand. That said, as we enter Q4, we believe Jordan inventories are now clean, and we also began reigniting Jordan Brand heat in the marketplace through the launches and activations over the NBA All-Star Weekend. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue adding dimension to the Jordan Brand through both performance and lifestyle product. For the quarter, EBIT in North America was down 14% versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expenses.
Moving on to EMEA, where we continue to see incredibly strong momentum in a region that is at the leading edge of consumer preferences. EMEA revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis in Q3. Two of the hottest styles in the marketplace are the Air VaporMax and Air Max 97, and we're also seeing industry leading growth in apparel, driven by our Tech Fleece business. Our growth in EMEA was also aided by our Express Lane, which is already quickly translating regional consumer preferences into color and material updates with respect to our Power Franchises.
Overall, growth in EMEA was led by very strong NIKE.com results as well as strong results with key strategic partners, key strategic partners who are also relentlessly consumer focused and digitally connected such as JD and Zalando. Categorically, we saw double-digit growth in Sportswear, Men's Training and NIKE Basketball. We expect continued strong growth in EMEA, and we're excited about the impact of the upcoming World Cup. On a reported basis, EMEA revenue increased 19% and EBIT grew 16% as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin due to transactional FX headwinds.
Next, let's turn to Greater China. Having just been in China 2 weeks ago, I can tell you that Greater China not only continues to lead NIKE in terms of the pace of growth but also in terms of executing the Consumer Direct Offense. In Q3, Greater China was up 19% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong double-digit growth across nearly all dimensions of the business but notably led by digital. Digital momentum in the quarter was fueled by the launch of the SNKRS app in China and the continued success of our partnership with Tmall.
And while our digital growth has been extraordinary, we have not even yet launched NikePlus membership in China. That is now slated for Q1 of fiscal year '19. Also worth calling out, our women's business in Greater China has incredible momentum with double-digit growth driven by our innovation and Power Franchises, including styles designed specifically to connect with consumers around the Chinese New Year. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue grew 24% and EBIT was up 30% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.
In APLA, revenue grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis led by digital growth that significantly outpaced every other channel. To unlock digital growth even more broadly, we will be more aggressively rolling out our digital platforms into key markets across APLA. One real-time example is the SNKRS app, which just launched in Japan yesterday. It immediately surged to become Japan's #1 free downloaded app in the iOS store. APLA was also fueled by the brand energy surrounding the Winter Olympics in Korea, which helped drive strong and balanced double-digit growth across nearly every dimension: women's, men's, footwear, apparel and across many categories. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue in APLA was up 13% and EBIT grew 31%, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
And finally at Converse, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis as we rebalanced marketplace supply in North America. On a reported basis, revenue declined 3% and EBIT was down 37%. Looking forward, we will continue to invest in reigniting strong, sustainable, profitable growth at Converse. More specifically, we're dimensionalizing Converse's product portfolio through the One Star, Chuck 70 and other sport and sport-inspired styles, investing in more Converse-specific digital platforms and creating heat and energy for the brand through new collaborations.
So with that, I'll now move to our outlook for the balance of the year. We remain confident we will deliver on the growth and profitability expectations that we have previously communicated for fiscal year '18, excluding the onetime impact of U.S. tax reform. We will continue to invest in the key pillars of our strategy and drive accelerated growth in the dimensions of our portfolio that we highlighted at our Investor Day in October. We remain focused on what matters most to consumers and in turn, what will fuel strong, sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.
As for specific guidance, we expect Q4 reported revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. This growth reflects continued strength in our international geographies and the reversal of trend we're building in North America. We expect Q4 gross margin to be roughly flat to very slightly up versus the prior year, demonstrating progressively stronger currency-neutral gross margin expansion that will be almost fully offset by transactional FX headwinds, albeit lesser transactional FX headwinds than in prior quarters. For SG&A, we expect low teens growth in Q4. We will continue to invest in digital and membership, including completing the acquisitions of some key digital capabilities within the quarter as well as brand more marketing and supportive innovation and impactful consumer moments such as Air Max Day and the World Cup.
At current FX rates, we expect other income and expense, net of interest expense, to be approximately $30 million to $40 million of expense in Q4. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be in the 10% to 12% range. It's important to note that our tax rate may be volatile as we expect to continue receiving more specific legislative and regulatory guidance as to the application of the U.S. Tax Act.
Now looking ahead to fiscal year '19. While our planning is not yet finalized, we currently expect fiscal year '19 reported revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digit range as international momentum continues and we return to growth in North America. We also expect strong gross margin expansion roughly in line with our long-term financial model.
In fiscal year '19, we will also see the full impact of U.S. tax reform on our access to capital and investments as well as the tax rate. U.S. tax reform will certainly afford NIKE more efficient access to capital. So as we finalize our investment plans for the next fiscal year, we're prioritizing accelerated investment in the select dimensions of our business that will fuel NIKE's Consumer Direct Offense and drive long-term growth. At the top of our list is digital, ranging from new NikePlus membership experiences to new capabilities, including data and analytics, to our core enterprise resource planning platform. Our acquisition of Zodiac, a leading consumer data and analytics team, was a great example of us seizing an opportunity to accelerate NIKE's capability development. We'll also continue to prioritize investment in innovation, brand distinction, new NIKE Consumer Experiences in the marketplace and a faster, more responsive supply chain.
The incremental and more efficient access to capital will also enable us to amplify our returns to shareholders and complete our existing 4-year $12 billion share repurchase program within fiscal year '19, roughly 1 year earlier than originally planned.
We currently expect U.S. tax reform to have a neutral to slightly favorable impact on our steady-state effective tax rate, which we would characterize as being in the teens on a normalized basis. That said, in any given fiscal year, geographical earnings mix, the impact of the new stock-based compensation accounting rules and other discrete items will create volatility in our rate. In fiscal year '19 specifically, our rate may also be impacted by adjustments to the provisional charges that we're accruing this quarter. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we will provide our updated outlook for fiscal year '19 on our Q4 earnings call.
As Mark said, our Consumer Direct Offense is working. NIKE Innovation is fueling strong consumer demand. NIKE Digital is accelerating. Our brands have great energy, and our organization is aligned and executing against what matters most to consumers. NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth is underway.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

NBA All-Star Weekend, we had kits and Revolve as 2 examples. Foot Locker was participating in that as well, and then we're bringing some of the new concepts to market here, starting very quickly with NIKE Unlaced with the digital launch and then physical coming up in summer. The NIKE App at Retail and Hyperlive are some of the examples there. As far as our -- this is impacting our overall marketplace. We're working with our key partners to help differentiate them in their respective positions. Those conversations are ongoing with most strategic partners. We've aligned on the role that they play in serving our consumers from DICK'S to Foot Locker to Nordstrom, and this is not only physical retail, but it's how physical and digital interact. And then we have other digital partners, which are obviously key to this transformation, Zalando and Tmall, ASOS and even Instagram for example. So this is a multi-year journey for us, and I'd say we're making great progress in shaping that marketplace. And I think we'll continue to elevate our own Direct business, but we will also help to differentiate and elevate our key wholesale partners along the way."

We're on the front end of -- obviously, the very front end of launching React, and the response has been phenomenal. I think I said it's been a record-setting performance launch for NIKE. I think that's also a case of performance basis that has also translated well into a product that can be worn on the street. So there's performance actually driving Sportswear and Lifestyle in one product. The other aspect of that is we are very committed to developing our platforms. So React, it starts with the Epic React running shoe, but you'll see that play out in other categories and also, in more models at different price points within Running. So I think that leverage is only going to build over time, and that's something that isn't unique to React. It's also what we're seeing in VaporMax as well. And then NIKE.com, in the quarter, has been a case of month-to-month acceleration, and that's driven also in part by these launches. And we think that, that is going to continue at a strong pace and accelerate really through Q4 and beyond. So that's a big part of this as well."

And I'd just add, our results in the third quarter in North America were largely in line with what we expected in the quarter. The contraction was primarily a result of declines in undifferentiated wholesale and a deliberate tightening in the distribution of styles within the Jordan Brand. So that did have an impact on year-over-year comparisons. But as we said, we're really excited about the heat we've reignited with that brand and the clean inventory levels that we have there, too. And then to your point on innovation platforms, one of the metrics that we look very closely at is the rate of sell-through as we launch products at the initial levels of supply, and the rate of sell-through on the NIKE React, in particular, the Air Max 270 and those other styles, far exceeded our expectations. We talked about supply selling out in hours with members and in days as compared to what we expected would be weeks with more broader distribution.

I think our strength comes from both our performance position and how we leverage that across sportswear. So actually, we're very excited about some of the performance innovation coming in apparel. In fact, our 2X Innovation initiative commitment is equally being applied to apparel, and I think that will impact a product that you'll see at the World Cup, you'll see at the NBA Championships, you're seeing with our relationship with the NBA across all sport categories, training. And then it will wind up influencing more and more the sportswear category as well where we are performing incredibly well. I'm really excited about what's coming in innovation in apparel and then our ability to kind of push on both sides of the performance and sportswear side. So there's a lot coming in apparel, and frankly, there's a lot coming in footwear -- a lot more coming in footwear than we've talked about. So I think our 2X Innovation investments, which really kicked in the gear about 2 years ago, are really starting to pay off. Anyway, back to your second question, Amazon. As you know, we have, I think you know, we have extended our pilot with Amazon, and to date, it's a smaller U.S.-based pilot. It's performed quite well. We've seen good sell-through on a limited selection of products. We're expanding that selection of products over this next phase. Our focus on this relationship really is how we can best work together to elevate the consumer experience, and that's really a key part of all of our digital partnerships. So we continue to engage with the U.S. digital marketplace to look at how we can serve digital demand from consumers, and Amazon is definitely a part of that. We get, just to back up for a second, get the most out of the partnerships that advance our brand through better presentation, through the sharing of data. Tmall in China, Zalando in Europe, these are great examples of those types of relationships. So we'll continue to work with Amazon to what we think will be a mutually beneficial partnership over the months ahead."

Well, as you know, Michael, we didn't give specific SG&A guidance for fiscal year '19, and there are really 2 reasons for that. One, we've never operated because we're not. We've never operated as if we are, and we aren't capital constrained. So our top priority, as we look ahead to any given fiscal year, is to ensure that we're prioritizing the investments that are going to fuel growth over the long term as compared to adhering to -- rigidly to a specific metric in a short-term period. The Tax Act does also afford us even more efficient access to the cash flow and the capital that we generate around the world. So yes, our planning process is taking both of those into account in the context of us having a new very focused strategy. So we're prioritizing investments specifically in innovation. I've told you in the past that we doubled the investment in innovation. We continue to make incremental investments there, and I want to pause there for a moment. It's really a competitive advantage for NIKE. The -- we currently invest probably more than any other brand in the marketplace, but we're going to continue to make incremental meaningful investments. But those investments are still relatively insignificant compared to the kind of growth and returns that they generate when you consider launches like React, VaporMax and the other platforms that Mark and I have shared. So innovation is certainly a priority. We're going to continue to drive brand distinction. You probably saw our Choose Go campaign over the last several months and the energy that, that's creating as well as some of the energy we created against the All-Star weekend and other big moments in sport. And I would say, even though I'm mentioning it third, at the top of our list is digital capabilities, both building them and like we said, acquiring capabilities through teams like the team we acquired in Zodiac. And then there are really 2 final areas that are on our short list of priorities: NIKE Consumer Experiences owned and partner, that as Mark noted, integrate or leverage digital in the physical environment. We are clearly doing that ourselves, and we're increasingly doing that with our partners all at various stages of development. But we're going to continue to test and innovate there. And then finally, we are prioritizing investment in speed through 2 key initiatives: our Express Lane and responsive manufacturing. So in short, we believe these are the investments that are going to drive brand distinction for NIKE and fuel our next horizon of long-term sustainable profitable growth, and we're going to over index our investment in those dimensions."

We had a strong fourth quarter with results that confirm why we're so excited about the potential of the Consumer Direct Offense. The shifts we've made to our business and our deeper focus on the 3 c",517,"Thanks, Nitesh and hello, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter with results that confirm why we're so excited about the potential of the Consumer Direct Offense. The shifts we've made to our business and our deeper focus on the 3 core areas, Innovation, Direct and Speed, are igniting the next phase of growth and profitability for NIKE. Here are the key areas of where we're driving momentum in our business.
First, we're winning with new innovation. We're leading with platforms, not just products. For example, React and Air Max are scaling through multiple styles and across categories. We're driving extraordinary growth and brand heat with consumers. Second, our digital offense is transforming NIKE from how we connect with consumers, to how we deliver products. This is a major shift from operating models of the past to a new digitally powered model of the future. And third, with a more focused strategy, we're running a more complete portfolio with better balanced growth across geographies and categories. 
For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 13% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include our international business growing 23%, with Greater China up 35%. We returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. Sportswear, a $10 billion business for NIKE, had another quarter of double-digit growth. We saw solid momentum in key performance categories, and digital -- NIKE Digital was up 41% for the quarter. 
The key to accelerating our strength is to continue to sharpen the execution of our Triple Double, and looking at our progress this quarter, I'll start with 2X Innovation.
The lineup of fresh, unexpected products that we shared with you last fall at our Investor Day has entered the marketplace. And as I noted, the consumer has responded. NIKE React, for example, is living up to big expectations. We extended the launch momentum from last quarter and scaled significantly with excellent sellthrough globally. The Epic React is already the #2 performance running shoe in the marketplace, above $125, only trailing the Air VaporMax. And Zoom Air continues to be the training platform of choice for serious runners, led by our best-selling Pegasus line. Our latest, the Peg 35, has the highest bookings in the first season for any Pegasus in our history. Overall, Running grew 7% for fiscal year '18, and with a loaded pipeline in fiscal '19, led by the Peg Turbo with ZoomX cushioning, we see a great runaway ahead for our largest performance category.
In Sportswear, the consumer demand for all-day comfort is making Air Max one of the fastest-growing platforms in our industry. Our icons, the Air Max Plus, 95, 97 and 98, are all performing incredibly well.

So I said, you should look for more Air Max platforms in the season ahead, pushing the boundaries on lifestyle innovation. Air is one of NIKE's greatest competitive differentiators, and it continues to fuel extraordinary growth. Sportswear has begun to integrate NIKE React into new styles, with more to come throughout fiscal year '19, including new icons from Jordan.
The success of our new cushioning platforms is driving momentum in our women's business as well. In fact, following our launches the past 3 months, the 270, VaporMax and Epic React are already the top 3 selling women's athletic footwear models above $125. Overall, women's lifestyle product continues to set the pace for the category. For the quarter, women's saw the Air Force 1 continuing its strong momentum, the Blazer ramping up quickly in China and APLA and key Air Max icons growing triple digits. One of our biggest opportunities for fiscal '19 is to scale our women's sneaker business across both NIKE and Jordan. In women's apparel, lifestyles also leading the way, highlighted by strong growth in tops and fleece. And looking ahead, we're building on our leadership in bras and bringing more innovation through Flyknit apparel in the second half of the year. And as a part of our more holistic point of view on women's across Running, Training and Sportswear, we'll roll out a new approach, the seasonal head-to-toe capsules and collections, like we did with the mashed-up collection this quarter. There is great energy across our women's product and marketplace themes right now.
One of our most important performance categories, NIKE Basketball, has produced strong momentum this year off the back of the NBA partnership and high demand for key signature styles. We've had an amazing year 1 with the NBA. We had a lot of firsts this year, but I'd say our 3 biggest wins were our editions approach to jerseys, driving significantly higher NBA jersey sales that the league has ever had. The Showtime hoodie, which was a new premium apparel business for fiscal '18, with sellthrough approaching 100% across most teams and channels, and the steady flow of LeBron player edition footwear that we launched through LeBron Watch on the SNKRS app, which is a new feature that turns the on-court footwear to real-time buying opportunities.
Jordan Brand proved, too, that the NBA is the ultimate sneaker runway. In many ways, Jordan defines the spectrum of performance and style. As part of the pregame walk in, on the court with the game's best players and courtside with fans. But we know consumers are demanding more from Jordan, and we know that people want wider access and new dimensions, and we're delivering. This quarter, we nearly tripled the size of Jordan's women's sneaker business, Jordan apparel was up double digits in all geos, and the Jordan Brand in China was up nearly 50%.
These are the areas where we see exponential growth and we will continue to focus. We have a lot of opportunity to expand the Jordan portfolio of products to create a greater range of choice and to match the energy of the Jordan Brand. For both NIKE and Jordan, our partnerships with the world's best leagues, teams and athletes are what fuel our growth. Nobody is better positioned to harness the expanding power of sport. 
Let's look back at the moments and performances from our athletes over the last few weeks.
Kevin Durant won back-to-back NBA titles and finals MVP awards. Eliud Kipchoge won the London Marathon in our new 3D printed uppers with Flyprint and ZoomX. Brooks Koepka winning the U.S. Open for the second year in a row. And at the French Open, Simona Halep won her first title; and Rafa Nadal won his unrivaled 11th at Roland Garros.  And of course, we're 2 weeks into another world's greatest sports moments, the World Cup, where the energy for the NIKE Brand has been tremendous. With over 60% of the players in the opening around wearing NIKE boots, it's [indiscernible] worn by players and NIKE boots than all of the brands combined with [ Hurricane ] and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the way. We also debuted the latest generation of NIKE Flyknit, the material Super Fly 360 and the Vapor 360. 
In apparel, we've seen strong sellthrough of our performance kits and we've designed full collections across performance, training and sportswear for key national teams, including England, France, Portugal, Brazil and Nigeria. This quarter, we also made an important commitment to our future in Football. We entered into a 10-year partnership with the China Super League, one of the fastest growing football nations in the world. 
The stories of our athletes and the innovation they inspire have always been central to our brand. And today, those products and stories are being amplified even further by the power of digital. We've talked about how critical mobile and social experiences are to our consumer and how that's driving change, but really, the full digital transformation of NIKE that's taking place right now is even bigger than that. It's fundamentally shifting our entire company. Digital is allowing us to realize our vision for smart retail, to remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. It's sharpening our ability to sense the market for data and analytics. It's unlocking new manufacturing tools that are more precise and drive a new aesthetic. And it's opening up new opportunities for new partnerships and how we develop talent in the organization.
Let's start with our digital fueling 2X Direct and our mission to lead the industry to a more differentiated marketplace through NIKE Consumer Experiences.
In our own ecosystem, NikePlus membership is the key to an elevated consumer experience. Once someone becomes a member and customizes their profile, we know what sports they like, how active they are and the style of products they prefer, and that insight allows for unlocks for exclusive products, style advice from experts and rewards for their activity. It personalizes the entire experience and allows us to remove friction points for members as they move seamlessly from mobile to the in-store environment. We've relaunched NikePlus membership in November, and for the year, we've exceeded all of our membership targets with strong growth in new, active and buying members and improvement in engagement and in conversion. And we continue to explore the physical and digital intersection through our new NIKE app at retail, which is beginning to scale to multiple stores. Through smart retail, we can aggregate consumer buying patterns to better inform localized preferences and turn those into new growth opportunities. For example, next month, we're opening a new retail concept in L.A. called NIKE Live. It's a small format, data-driven store with an assortment influenced by what consumers are buying from surrounding zip codes. We see great potential in this approach, and you'll see a lot more of it across our key cities.
Digital innovation also allows us to push the edges on new immersive experiences, whether that's in our own channels or through partnered retail or our social media platforms. The SNKRS app has delivered some incredibly compelling experiences this quarter. For example, at venues during Kendrick Lamar's recent tour, we triggered SNKRS stashed drops to make his Cortez Kenny III shoe available exclusively to his fans who are at the show. The SNKRS app is creating credible demand, and capturing more value from that energy is one of NIKE's largest upside opportunities for fiscal '19 and beyond.
Our investments in the digital experience are also creating a platform for new brand-friendly e-commerce partnerships. Our work with Tmall continues to set the bar for how we cocreate shopping experiences through mobile and social. This quarter, we leveraged key shopping moments for Air Max on Tmall's Super Brand A and Young Athletes during its parents channel launch.
We continue to expand our presence in digital marketplaces through partnerships like Zalando in EMEA and ZOZOTOWN in Japan, which became a fully operational in March. And we see huge potential emerging storytelling and shopping through our social platforms. This quarter, NIKE became one of the first companies to drive new Consumer Experiences in Facebook Messenger app, leveraging the AR camera to reveal the KYRIE 4 red carpet. You should look for more exciting new shopping experiences with Facebook and other social media platforms in the coming months.
And as we noted at Investor Day, we're also piloting and scaling NIKE Consumer Experiences with key wholesale partners. For example, the NIKE certified athletes program turned selective Foot Locker associates into NIKE experts. And after showing strong early results, Foot Locker will scale the program across North America in Q1. And with JD group in EMEA, we launched both a physical and digital concept to celebrate Air Max storytelling called Undisputed Air, driving triple digit growth of NIKE Air products in JD versus last year.
Digital acceleration is also critical to creating an overall faster company, from consumer insight to responsive manufacturing to delivering products to the consumer when they want it. In other words, it's integral to our 2X Speed initiative.
In fiscal '18, we've invested significantly in the capabilities that heighten our ability to sense the market and drive efficiency through our supply chain. We scaled 7 key distribution centers around the world this year. One of the facilities in North America is our new rebound facility, the first to be focused solely on accepting return product and getting it back into the marketplace significantly faster to maximize full price indices and selling. We've also innovated the Zodiac team from our recent acquisition for giving us new predictive tools and advanced analytics to drive targeted growth. And we continue to develop our sensing capabilities within our key cities and sharpening the Express Lane, our fastest growing product engine that serves as a key focal point of our speed initiatives. This quarter, the Express Lane created a substantial impact by extending our in-line stories with new materials and colors as the teams did with the Air Max 270 this quarter. And amplifying the brand concepts we know are connecting desks with consumers, like the Tuned Air material to celebrate the World Cup and capturing emerging trends like we did in EMEA in the '90s apparel collection where we identified the trend and quickly delivered product to market. Express Lane, as a whole, is leading to significantly stronger, full price sellthrough rates.
But through digital, we're also inventing new manufacturing tools that allow us to push the boundaries of product creation like computational design with React or new Flyknit apparel, and automation throughout our supply chain continues to drive speed and efficiency. 2X Speed is a multiyear journey, and while we've made progress, we also know there's even greater opportunity ahead in this space. We've closed out the fiscal year with a strong performance across our business, being closer to the consumer and our new offense has its focus on the biggest growth opportunities making the right investments with the greatest returns. We fueled increased demand for NIKE in fiscal '18. In fiscal '19, we'll continue that acceleration with an even faster pace of innovation and by serving consumers more completely across our entire portfolio.
We have momentum, and we're continuing to transform across multiple dimensions and throughout our entire organization. And I'm confident we'll use this quarter as a catalyst for growth into fiscal '19 and beyond.
Thanks, and now here's Andy."

Fiscal year '18 was a strategically significant year for NIKE. As we began the fiscal year last June, we communicated our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense, which we believe would ignite NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable profitable growth and transform the company in the process. Then, at our Investor Day, this past October, we showcased how our new strategy was already beginning to come to life. We displayed the pipeline of innovative products that we plan to bring to market in the second half of fiscal year '18 on our path to 2X Innovation. We immersed our stakeholders in the relaunch of our NIKE and SNKRS app experiences and the new membership services that would ignite 2X Direct. And we shared several of the manufacturing and supply chain initiatives that will help 2X our speed and ultimately cut our time-to-market in half.
Of course, we also established a new long-term financial model. But perhaps even more notable than the financial goals we established were some of the key operational measures of success that we shared. Those measures of success better define how we will transform NIKE into a digitally led enterprise that connects more directly with our consumers globally through our key cities and countries.
And as we now close Q4, we are thrilled to see our strategic execution translating into strong financial performance as both revenue growth and profitability exceeded even our own expectations. At the same time, what's even more exciting is that we also delivered across all of our key operational measures and success. And it's worth highlighting a few examples as either proof points that NIKE's strategic transformation is underway at an accelerated pace.
So first, we said that new innovation platforms will drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fiscal year '18, revenue from new innovative platforms actually drove over 80% of our incremental growth, fueled by innovative new platforms such as the Air VaporMax, React, the Air Max 270 and ZoomX. We also said that we would 2X Direct with digital commerce growth, but owned and partnered comprising over 50% of NIKE's total company growth over the next 5 years. In fiscal year '18, NIKE Direct, in fact, drove over 90% of our growth, and 100% of our growth was driven by the combination of NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE Consumer Experiences. NIKE Digital, in particular, grew 34% in Q4 on a constant currency basis and was the single fastest growing channel globally. Yet, for many of the hottest styles launched on NIKE digital platforms within the quarter, our supply was only a fraction of the actual demand we experienced. This underscores a significant opportunity to better sense and serve digital demand in fiscal year '19. We also said in October that we expect our international geographies to drive over 75% of our growth, and that North America would return to mid-single digit growth over the next 5 years. For the full year, our international geographies accounted for over 100% of our growth, with Greater China growing nearly 2x the rate of any other geography on a currency-neutral basis. And in Q4, North America returned to growth, sharply reversing its prior trend. As Mark said, as we enter fiscal year '19, we are now running a more complete offense across our global portfolio. 
But before I go deeper into our outlook for fiscal year '19, let's first reflect on the drivers of our strong Q4 results.
NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 13%, up 8% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit international growth and a return to growth in North America. NIKE Direct led our growth globally, including 5% comp store growth and 34% digital growth. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $36.4 billion, up 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Gross margin expanded over 60 basis points in Q4, exceeding our own expectations due to accelerating full price sales and NIKE Digital growth. For the full year, gross margin contracted just under 80 basis points as strong underlying product profitability was more than offset by a 90 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25%, primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham and the NBA; brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup and global campaigns supporting the launch of new product innovations. For the full year, demand creation increased 7%.
Operating overhead increased 14% for the quarter and 10% for the full year as we're investing in capabilities that will fuel long-term growth, particularly with respect to digital and innovation.
Our effective tax rate was 6.4% for the quarter and 55.3% for the full year. The full year rate was significantly higher than the prior year, primarily due to the one-time transition tax associated with U.S. tax reform. Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 15% to $0.69. Full year diluted EPS declined 53% to $1.17, taking into account the significant one-time impacts of U.S. tax reform. As of May 31, inventories were up 4%, growing slower than the rate of revenue growth, which is an indication that our supply and demand management efforts over the course of fiscal year '18 have returned NIKE to a strong pull market globally.
Finally, today, we're announcing a new 4-year, $15 billion share repurchase program. We anticipate that our current $12 billion share repurchase program will be completed within fiscal year '19. This new expanded authorization, coupled with our dividend program, are evidence of NIKE's strong cash flow generation and steadily increasing cash returns to shareholders.
Now let's turn to the financial performance for a few of our reported operating segments.
In North America, Q4 revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and currency-neutral basis, led by new innovation platforms, very strong digital growth, continued momentum in Sportswear and broad growth across apparel. We've returned to North America to revenue growth and expanding margins, and this healthy momentum is carrying forward into this new fiscal year. As we expected, digital continues to reshape the consumer experience, and to some extent, disrupt the more undifferentiated multibrand wholesale dimensions of the marketplace. However, NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, both owned and partnered, and particularly those that leverage a digital connection to the consumer, drove over 2/3 of our growth in North America.
Digital connections have been critical to launching new and innovative products, creating brand heat and better serving consumer demand. For example, as part of the Epic React launch, through social media, we invited our consumers to Choose Go. The Choose Go campaign inspired more than 1 million NIKE Plus members to participate in a run on the NIKE Running Club app that day and generated over 500 million social media impressions. We also launched an exclusive colorway of the Epic React, with DICK'S Sporting Goods through a takeover of their digital commerce platform and social media channels. And as Mark detailed, we're in the process of launching the NIKE App at Retail in key markets, bringing NIKE Plus membership into the store and accelerating the convergence of digital and physical retail. 
As for the Jordan Brand, in North America, we are already back to a pull market and we expect a return to global growth in fiscal year '19. Consumers love the Jordan Brand, and their passion for the brand is unwavering. At the same time, we saw an opportunity to recalibrate the supply of select styles across distribution channels.
While that included tightening the supply in some cases, it also included expanding the supply of the hottest, most iconic Jordan styles on the Nike SNKRS app, which is fast becoming the leading destination for high heat footwear launches globally. We also leveraged both Jordan and NIKE launches on the SNKRS App to create compelling new consumer experiences that merged digital and physical with our strategic retail partners, for example, through initiatives such as Shock Drop, SNKRS Pass and SNKRS Stash. Looking forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue diversifying the Jordan Brand for women in performance and through apparel.
For the full year, North America's revenue declined 2%, and EBIT was 7% lower. However, our Q4 results in North America reflect a reversal of trend and sustainable momentum going into fiscal year '19.
Moving to EMEA, where revenues grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis in Q4, driven by strong global growth -- driven by strong growth in Global Football, Sportswear and Running, our apparel business is also particularly strong across Europe, with Global Football apparel approaching triple digit growth in Q4, fueled by high energy, national team collections associated with the World Cup. In footwear, Air Max continues to be the dominant platform in the region, with the Air Max 270 becoming the #1 style across key European markets and Air Max month in March propelling Sportswear to record full year revenues. The NIKE Brand is also #1 in all of our key cities across Europe, fueled by campaigns such as Nothing Beats a Londoner that amplified the authentic voice of over 200 London consumers, along with influencers such as [indiscernible] and several of the world's greatest athletes including Mo Farah, [ Hurricane ] and others. This is a great example of a hyper local city campaign that resonated with our consumers globally. 
While NIKE Direct continues to lead all dimensions of growth in EMEA, JD, for example, has also been a very strategic partner for NIKE. JD continues to leverage digital connections with consumers and differentiated store concepts, including size, to both create and serve demand, and we look forward to the best practices that they will bring to the North America marketplace. For the full year, currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%, fueled by double-digit growth in sportswear and across apparel. On a reported basis, fiscal year '18 revenues grew 16% and EBIT increased 5% as strong revenue growth was offset primarily by transactional FX headwinds on gross margin. 
So next, let's turn to Greater China. In Q4, Greater China's growth accelerated to 25% on a currency-neutral basis, including strong double-digit growth across all categories in the Jordan Brand and across our women's business. NIKE Digital growth continues to outpace all other marketplace dimensions, and we continue to partner with and learn from China's leading digital platforms. Through our partnership with Tmall, our first ever Air Max super brand day in March, became our largest day on the platform, second only to Singles' Day for the year. And with Tencent, we launched our Choose Go campaign through digital media, inspiring 2 million runners to participate in a 7-week running journey and creating strong demand for the Epic React.
For the full year, revenues in Greater China increased 18% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by Running, Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and NIKE Basketball. On a reported basis, fiscal year '18 revenues were up 21% and EBIT increased 20%. 
There are several drivers of the extraordinary long-term growth potential we see in Greater China, from favorable macroeconomics to the rise of sport and fitness, to the scale and impact of digital, to the strength of the NIKE Brand. Accordingly, we will continue to invest to extend our leadership in this strategically important and fast growing market.
In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across all key countries within this diverse geography and is being fueled by our focus on creating brand energy in key cities and through digital. In fact, while NIKE Digital growth was strong in every geography, APLA's digital growth led the pack. In addition to strong NIKE Direct digital growth, growth through the new entrepreneurial digital partners also accelerated.  Looking forward, we will continue to drive digital momentum by scaling the NIKE and SNKRS app across key countries within APLA while also continuing to explore and scale these digital partnerships.
For the full fiscal year, revenue increased 10% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced growth across all categories, including the Jordan Brand and our women's business. On a reported basis, full year revenues for the fiscal year increased 9%, while EBIT was up 21%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
And finally, at Converse, revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal year '18 and declined 14% in the fourth quarter. Contraction was primarily driven by the decision to rightsize wholesale distribution in North America and EMEA. At the same time, Converse Direct grew double digits in Q4, including strong double-digit growth in digital for the full year with acceleration in Q4. On a reported basis, full year revenues were down 8% and EBIT declined 35%. As we move into fiscal year '19, we are reigniting energy in the Converse brand and diversifying Converse's product portfolio both through Converse's authentic positioning in sport and through new sportswear styles and collaborations.  In fiscal year '19, Converse will also launch a more direct, branded and immersive digital experience to drive closer connections between the Converse brand and its passionate consumers.
Fiscal year '19 will be the first full year of execution against NIKE's Consumer Direct Offense and the long-term financial goals that we detailed in our Investor Day. As we are now deeper into the execution of our new offense, it is becoming increasingly clear that digital is transforming how we operate and will favorably reshape our economic model over the long term. Digital is inflecting our revenue growth and has a favorable mix impact on our gross margin as we capture more of the value that we are creating for consumers. And as for SG&A, we will continue to accelerate investment in scalable digital experiences and capabilities, building both organically and through acquisitions.
At the same time, we're already seeing how upfront investment in experiences, like the NIKE and SNKRS apps, and in capabilities, such as a data and analytics, can be efficiently leveraged globally to better serve our consumers across our key markets.
Finally, digital also creates the potential for win-win economic models with our wholesale partners over time as they transform their retail experiences to serve the next generation of digitally native consumers.
Taking all of these dynamics into account, we are updating our guidance for fiscal year '19. As of our last earnings call, we expected mid to high single digit revenue growth in fiscal year '19. As we now close Q4, our expectations for revenue growth in fiscal year '19 have moved up slightly, entering the high single-digit range. This improved outlook takes into account building consumer demand for NIKE. However, we are also mindful of renewed FX volatility and the strengthening dollar of late. As for gross margin, we now expect expansion of roughly 50 basis points or slightly greater, fueled by strong full price sales, expanding average selling prices and growth in our NIKE Direct business, partially offset by higher input cost.
As for SG&A, we will continue to prioritize investments in new digital consumer experiences and capabilities, in product innovation and in brand marketing. As such, in fiscal year '19, we expect SG&A to grow roughly in the same range as revenue growth. We're not targeting SG&A leverage in fiscal year '19. We are capturing productivity gains within SG&A, but we will use that incremental capacity to invest strategically for the long term.
As for other expense, net of interest expense, we expect roughly $125 million to $150 million of expense for the full year. We see our effective tax rate being in the midteens range are potentially slightly higher for the full year. It's important to note that our tax rate will continue to be volatile based upon the full implementation and further guidance with respect to U.S. tax reform. Variation in our mix of earnings geographically will also have an impact as will the impact of stock-based compensation and other discrete items.
Our focus will remain on driving strategic transformation and delivering strong growth over the long term, more so than on the results in any individual quarter. That said, for some additional context as we enter the fiscal year, we expect the same level of revenue growth in Q1 as we do for the full year. We also expect less gross margin expansion in the first half as compared to the second half of the year. And finally, as for SG&A, our investments will be more front loaded towards the first half of the fiscal year, driven by key consumer and sports moments such as the World Cup.
The Consumer Direct Offense is transforming how we operate at NIKE and how we will create value for shareholders going forward. More specifically, digital is proving to be as transformative as we expected and potentially even more so. We still have much work to do ahead of us to realize the full potential of our new office -- offense. That said, it is clear as we accelerate in fiscal year '19, that we have now ignited NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

As you know, our Investor Day guidance for North America was that we believed it was a mid-single-digit growth market over the next 5 years. And so we don't typically provide geographical specific guidance certainly by quarter or for the full year. But I would say that we have momentum going into the year, and that's really primarily fueled by new innovation platforms that we're scaling. NIKE Direct, certainly NIKE Digital, which accelerated to well over 30% growth, driven by strong results on SNKRS and through membership. And then I'd note that, importantly, we've returned North America to a healthy pull market. Inventory is clean, up only 2%; full price sales are accelerating; off price sales are declining; and gross margins are expanding.

In fact, it might be an understatement to say that our inventories are clean in North America, and that was not a result of adjusting prices. That was entirely about rightsizing supply and within distribution channels. And what we've seen is that certainly with respect to the hottest styles and the most iconic styles, we've had extraordinary demand. Again, demand that outpaced the supply that we had planned, particularly with respect to our digital experiences like this SNKRS app. So we continue to feel that there's great price value there and certainly as we ran innovation and storytelling to those icons and across the rest of the Jordan line."

I will -- I'll start with your question around the impact of digital. It's a great question and a timely question. As we -- as both Mark and I detailed, we saw acceleration in digital that, quite frankly, exceeded even our own expectations. It wasn't by accident. We've certainly been investing both organically in digital experiences, such as some of the experiences we've shared with respect to our membership initiatives, as well as in capabilities. You've heard us refer to our acquisitions of Virgin Mega and Vertex and Zodiac over time. And so that acceleration is definitely a result of the investment. In terms of our evolving view of the impact of digital on our economic model or how we create value for shareholders, we do see digital being a platform that helps us better optimize supply and demand. We obviously get a very direct read and signals from consumers in terms of which products they are most interested in, and that ultimately helps us amplify revenue growth through full priced sales. When we're leveraging digital in a more direct way, we obviously capture more of that revenue at the retail price. When we are leveraging digital with our partners, we do see a benefit from a full priced sales and a win-win relationship with our partners. Digital commerce also has margins that are favorable from a mix perspective relative to our traditional wholesale bricks-and-mortar business. From an SG&A perspective, I would suggest there are 2 ways to look at it. One is short, medium and long term, and then the other one is specifically more in the shorter term. I think short, medium and long term, what we're finding is that the capabilities or experiences we're building in digital are very scalable, and they're scalable in an efficient way. If you think about creating experiences around the SNKRS or NIKE apps, and to the extent we have success in the market where we launch that, we're then able to take that investment we've already made and leverage it in markets around the world. And we're certainly seeing that, for example, with the SNKRS app, which is #1 in Japan in terms of free applications, we've seen millions of downloads of that app since launch in China, leveraging a lot of that upfront initial investment. So we think it's a source of leverage, at the same time, because we're focused on long term and we do think digital has the ability to really inflect our value creation, we're accelerating the investments that we're making digital now to accelerate us down that path."

The shifts we've made to our business and our deeper focus on the 3 c",541,"Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter with results that confirm why we're so excited about the potential of the Consumer Direct Offense. The shifts we've made to our business and our deeper focus on the 3 core areas, Innovation, Direct and Speed, are igniting the next phase of growth and profitability for NIKE. Here are the key areas of where we're driving momentum in our business.
First, we're winning with new innovation. We're leading with platforms, not just products. For example, React and Air Max are scaling through multiple styles and across categories. They're driving extraordinary growth and brand heat with consumers. Second, our digital offense is transforming NIKE from how we connect with consumers to how we deliver products. This is a major shift from operating models of the past to a new digitally powered model of the future. And third, with a more focused strategy, we're running a more complete portfolio with better balanced growth across geographies and categories.
For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 13% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include our international business growing 23% with Greater China up 35%. We returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. Sportswear, a $10 billion business for NIKE, had another quarter of double-digit growth. We saw solid momentum in key performance categories, and Digital, NIKE Digital was up 41% for the quarter.
The key to accelerating our strength is to continue to sharpen the execution of our Triple Double, and looking at our progress this quarter, I'll start with 2X Innovation.
The lineup of fresh, unexpected products that we shared with you last fall at our Investor Day has entered the marketplace, and as I noted, the consumer has responded. NIKE React, for example, is living up to big expectations. We extended the launch momentum from last quarter and scaled significantly with excellent sell-through globally. The Epic React is already the #2 performance running shoe in the marketplace above $125, only trailing the Air VaporMax. And Zoom Air continues to be the training platform of choice for serious runners, led by our best-selling Pegasus line. Our latest, the Peg 35, has the highest bookings in the first season for any Pegasus in our history. Overall, Running grew 7% for fiscal year '18. With a loaded pipeline in fiscal '19 led by the Peg Turbo with ZoomX cushioning, we see a great runaway ahead for our largest performance category.
In Sportswear, the consumer demand for all-day comfort is making Air Max one of the fastest growing platforms in our industry. Our icons, the Air Max Plus, 95, 97 and 98, are all performing incredibly well. Air VaporMax built on that demand, and this quarter, we took it a step further with NIKE's first innovation to build specifically for lifestyle. The Air Max 270 is launching in March. 270 is the most successful Air Max launch in our history.

[ This is a ] driving force behind Sportswear, category that delivered more than [ $46 million ] in revenue in Q4, our best quarter ever. Look for more lifestyle Air Max platforms in the season ahead.

So I said, you should look for more Air Max platforms in the season ahead, pushing the boundaries on lifestyle innovation. Air is one of NIKE's greatest competitive differentiators, and it continues to fuel extraordinary growth. Sportswear has begun to integrate Nike React into new styles with more to come throughout fiscal year '19, including new icons from Jordan.
The success of our new cushioning platforms is driving momentum in our women's business as well. In fact, following our launches the past 3 months, the 270, VaporMax and Epic React are already the top 3 selling women's athletic footwear models above $125. Overall, women's lifestyle product continues to set the pace for the category. For the quarter, women's saw the Air Force 1 continuing its strong momentum, the Blazer ramping up quickly in China and APLA, and key Air Max icons growing triple digits. One of our biggest opportunities for fiscal '19 is to scale our women's sneaker business across both NIKE and Jordan.
In women's apparel, lifestyle's also leading the way, highlighted by strong growth in tops and fleece, and looking ahead, we're building on our leadership in bras and bringing more innovation through Flyknit apparel in the second half of the year. And as a part of our more holistic point of view on women's across Running, Training and Sportswear, we'll roll out a new approach with seasonal head-to-toe capsules and collections like we did with the Meshed Up Collection this quarter. There is great energy across our women's product and marketplace teams right now.
One of our most important performance categories, Nike Basketball, has produced strong momentum this year off the back of the NBA partnership and high demand for key signature styles. We've had an amazing year 1 with the NBA. We had a lot of firsts this year, but I'd say our 3 biggest wins were our editions approach to jerseys, driving significantly higher NBA jersey sales than the league has ever had, the Showtime Hoodie, which was a new premium apparel business for fiscal '18 with sell-through approaching 100% across most teams and channels and the steady flow of LeBron player edition footwear that we launched through LeBron Watch on the SNKRS App, which is a new feature that turns the on-court footwear into real-time buying opportunities.
Jordan Brand proved, too, that the NBA is the ultimate sneaker runway. In many ways, Jordan defines the spectrum of performance and style as part of the pregame walk-in, on the court with the game's best players and courtside with fans. But we know consumers are demanding more from Jordan, and we know that people want wider access and new dimensions. And we're delivering. This quarter, we nearly tripled the size of Jordan's women's sneaker business. Jordan apparel was up double digits in all geos, and the Jordan Brand in China was up nearly 50%.
These are the areas where we see exponential growth, and we will continue to focus. We have a lot of opportunity to expand the Jordan portfolio of products to create a greater range of choice and to match the energy of the Jordan Brand. For both NIKE and Jordan, our partnerships with the world's best leagues, teams and athletes are what fuel our growth. Nobody is better positioned to harness the expanding power of sport.
Let's look back at the moments and performances from our athletes over the last few weeks. Kevin Durant won back-to-back NBA titles and Finals MVP award. Eliud Kipchoge won the London Marathon in our new 3D printed uppers with FlyPrint and ZoomX, Brooks Koepka winning the U.S. Open for the second year in a row. And at the French Open, Simona Halep won her first title and Rafa Nadal won his unrivaled 11th at Roland Garros. And of course, we're 2 weeks into 1 of the world's greatest sports moments, the World Cup, where the energy for the NIKE Brand has been tremendous. With over 60% of the players in the opening round wearing NIKE boots, it's [indiscernible] by players in NIKE boots than all of the brands combined with Harry Kane and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the way. We also debuted the latest generation of NIKE Flyknit, the material Superfly 360 and the Vapor 360.
 
In apparel, we've seen strong sell-through of our performance kits, and we've designed full collections across performance, training and sportswear for key national teams, including England, France, Portugal, Brazil and Nigeria. This quarter, we also made an important commitment to our future in football. We entered into a 10-year partnership with the China Super League, 1 of the fastest growing football nations in the world.
The stories of our athletes and the innovation they inspire have always been central to our brand, and today, those products and stories are being amplified even further by the power of digital. We've talked about how critical mobile and social experiences are to our consumer and how that's driving change, but really, the full digital transformation of NIKE that's taking place right now is even bigger than that. It's fundamentally shifting our entire company.
Digital is allowing us to realize our vision for smart retail, to remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. It's sharpening our ability to sense the market through data and analytics. It's unlocking new manufacturing tools that are more precise and drive a new aesthetic. And it's opening up opportunities for new partnerships and how we develop talent in the organization.
Let's start with how digital is fueling 2X Direct and our mission to lead the industry to a more differentiated marketplace through NIKE Consumer Experiences. In our own ecosystem, NikePlus membership is the key to an elevated consumer experience. Once someone becomes a member and customizes their profile, we know what sports they like, how active they are and the style of products they prefer, and that insight allows for unlocks for exclusive product, style advice from experts and rewards for their activity. It personalizes the entire experience and allows us to remove friction points for members as they move seamlessly from mobile to the in-store environment.
We've relaunched NikePlus membership in November, and for the year, we've exceeded all of our membership targets with strong growth in new, active and buying members and improvement in engagements and in conversion. And we continue to explore the physical and digital intersection through our new NIKE App at Retail, which is beginning to scale to multiple stores.
Through smart retail, we can aggregate consumer buying patterns to better inform localized preferences and turn those into new growth opportunities. For example, next month, we're opening a new retail concept in L.A. called Nike Live. It's a small format, data-driven store with an assortment influenced by what consumers are buying from surrounding ZIP codes. We see great potential in this approach, and you'll see a lot more of it across our key cities.
Digital innovation also allows us to push the edges on new immersive experiences, whether that's in our own channels or through partnered retail or social media platforms. The SNKRS App has delivered some incredibly compelling experiences this quarter. For example, at venues during Kendrick Lamar's recent tour, we triggered SNKRS Stash drops to make his Cortez Kenny III shoe available exclusively to his fans who were at the show. The SNKRS App is creating incredible demand, and capturing more value from that energy is one of NIKE's largest upside opportunities for fiscal '19 and beyond.
Our investments in the digital experience are also creating a platform for new brand-friendly e-commerce partnerships. Our work with Tmall continues to set the bar for how we cocreate shopping experiences through mobile and social. This quarter, we leveraged key shopping moments for Air Max on Tmall's Super Brand Day and Young Athletes during its [ parent's ] channel launch.
We continue to expand our presence in digital marketplaces through partnerships like Zalando in EMEA and ZOZOTOWN in Japan, which became fully operational in March. And we see huge potential in merging storytelling and shopping through our social platforms. This quarter, NIKE became one of the first companies to drive new consumer experiences in Facebook Messenger app, leveraging the AR camera to reveal the KYRIE 4 Red Carpet. You should look for more exciting new shopping experiences with Facebook and other social media platforms in the coming months.
And as we noted at Investor Day, we're also piloting and scaling NIKE Consumer Experiences with key wholesale partners. For example, the NIKE-certified athletes program turned selected Foot Locker associates into NIKE experts. And after showing strong early results, Foot Locker will scale the program across North America in Q1. And with JD Group in EMEA, we launched both a physical and digital concept to celebrate Air Max storytelling called [ Undisputed Air ], driving triple-digit growth of NIKE Air products in JD versus last year.
Digital acceleration is also critical to creating an overall faster company from consumer insight to responsive manufacturing to delivering products to the consumer when they want it. In other words, it's integral to our 2X Speed initiative.
In fiscal '18, we've invested significantly in the capabilities that heighten our ability to sense the market and drive efficiency through our supply chain. We scaled 7 key distribution centers around the world this year. One of the facilities in North America is our new rebound facility, the first to be focused solely on accepting returned product and getting it back into the marketplace significantly faster to maximize full-price in-season selling.
We've also integrated the Zodiac team from our recent acquisition, who are giving us new predictive tools and advanced analytics to drive targeted growth. And we continue to develop our sensing capabilities within our key cities and sharpened the Express Lane, our fastest growing product engine that serves as a key focal point of our speed initiatives. This quarter, the Express Lane created a substantial impact by extending our in-line stories with new materials and colors as the teams did with the Air Max 270 this quarter, and amplifying the brand concepts we know are connecting best with consumers like the Tuned Air Mercurial to celebrate World Cup, and capturing emerging trends like we did in EMEA with the '90s apparel collection where we identified the trend and quickly delivered product to market. Express Lane, as a whole, is leading to significantly stronger full-price sell-through rates.
Through digital, we're also inventing new manufacturing tools that allow us to push the boundaries of product creation like computational design with React or new Flyknit apparel. And automation throughout our supply chain continues to drive speed and efficiency. 2X Speed is a multi-year journey, and while we've made progress, we also know there's even greater opportunity ahead in this space.
We've closed out the fiscal year with a strong performance across our business. Being closer to the consumer and our new offense has us focused on the biggest growth opportunities, making the right investments with the greatest returns. We fueled increased demand for NIKE in fiscal '18. In fiscal '19, we'll continue that acceleration with an even faster pace of innovation and by serving consumers more completely across our entire portfolio.
We have momentum, and we're continuing to transform across multiple dimensions and throughout our entire organization. And I'm confident we'll use this quarter as a catalyst for growth into fiscal '19 and beyond.
Thanks, and now here's Andy."

Fiscal year '18 was a strategically significant year for NIKE. As we began the fiscal year last June, we communicated our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense, which we believe would ignite NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable profitable growth and transform the company in the process. Then, at our Investor Day this past October, we showcased how our new strategy was already beginning to come to life. We displayed the pipeline of innovative products that we plan to bring to market in the second half of fiscal year '18 on our path to 2X Innovation. We immersed our stakeholders in the relaunch of our NIKE and SNKRS App experiences and the new membership services that would ignite 2X Direct. And we shared several of the manufacturing and supply chain initiatives that will help 2x our speed and ultimately cut our time to market in half.
Of course, we also established a new long-term financial model. But perhaps even more notable than the financial goals we established were some of the key operational measures of success that we shared. Those measures of success better define how we will transform NIKE into a digitally led enterprise that connects more directly with our consumers globally through our key cities and countries.
And as we now close Q4, we are thrilled to see our strategic execution translating into strong financial performance as both revenue growth and profitability exceeded even our own expectations. At the same time, what's even more exciting is that we also delivered across all of our key operational measures of success, and it's worth highlighting a few examples as these are proof points that NIKE's strategic transformation is underway at an accelerated pace.
So first, we said that new innovation platforms will drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fiscal year '18, revenue from new innovative platforms actually drove over 80% of our incremental growth, fueled by innovative new platforms such as the Air VaporMax, React, the Air Max 270 and ZoomX. We also said that we would 2X Direct with digital commerce growth but owned and partnered comprising over 50% of NIKE's total company growth over the next 5 years. In fiscal year '18, NIKE Direct, in fact, drove over 90% of our growth, and 100% of our growth was driven by the combination of NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE Consumer Experiences.
NIKE Digital, in particular, grew 34% in Q4 on a constant currency basis and was the single fastest growing channel globally. Yet, for many of the hottest styles launched on NIKE Digital platforms within the quarter, our supply was only a fraction of the actual demand we experienced. This underscores a significant opportunity to better sense and serve digital demand in fiscal year '19.
We also said in October that we expect our international geographies to drive over 75% of our growth and that North America would return to mid-single-digit growth over the next 5 years. For the full year, our international geographies accounted for over 100% of our growth with Greater China growing nearly 2x the rate of any other geography on a currency-neutral basis. And in Q4, North America returned to growth, sharply reversing its prior trend. As Mark said, as we enter fiscal year '19, we are now running a more complete offense across our global portfolio.
But before I go deeper into our outlook for fiscal year '19, let's first reflect on the drivers of our strong Q4 results.  NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 13%, up 8% on a currency-neutral basis driven by double-digit international growth and a return to growth in North America. NIKE Direct led our growth globally, including 5% comp store growth and 34% digital growth. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $36.4 billion, up 4% on a currency-neutral basis.
Gross margin expanded over 60 basis points in Q4, exceeding our own expectations due to accelerating full-price sales and NIKE Digital growth. For the full year, gross margin contracted just under 80 basis points as strong underlying product profitability was more than offset by a 90 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25%, primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham and the NBA; brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup; and global campaigns supporting the launch of new product innovations. For the full year, demand creation increased 7%. Operating overhead increased 14% for the quarter and 10% for the full year as we're investing in capabilities that will fuel long-term growth, particularly with respect to digital and innovation.
Our effective tax rate was 6.4% for the quarter and 55.3% for the full year. The full year rate was significantly higher than the prior year, primarily due to the onetime transition tax associated with U.S. tax reform. Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 15% to $0.69. Full year diluted EPS declined 53% to $1.17, taking into account the significant onetime impacts of U.S. tax reform. As of May 31, inventories were up 4%, growing slower than the rate of revenue growth, which is an indication that our supply and demand management efforts over the course of fiscal year '18 have returned NIKE to a strong pull market globally.
Finally, today, we're announcing a new 4-year $15 billion share repurchase program. We anticipate that our current $12 billion share repurchase program will be completed within fiscal year '19. This new expanded authorization, coupled with our dividend program, are evidence of NIKE's strong cash flow generation and steadily increasing cash returns to shareholders.
Now let's turn to the financial performance for a few of our reported operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and currency-neutral basis, led by new innovation platforms, very strong digital growth, continued momentum in Sportswear and broad growth across apparel. We've returned North America to revenue growth and expanding margins, and this healthy momentum is carrying forward into this new fiscal year.
As we expected, digital continues to reshape the consumer experience and to some extent, disrupt the more undifferentiated multi-brand wholesale dimensions of the marketplace. However, NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, both owned and partnered, and particularly those that leverage a digital connection to the consumer, drove over 2/3 of our growth in North America.
Digital connections have been critical to launching new and innovative products, creating brand heat and better serving consumer demand. For example, as part of the Epic React launch, through social media, we invited our consumers to Choose Go. The Choose Go campaign inspired more than 1 million NIKE+ members to participate in a run on the NIKE Running Club (sic) [ Run Club ] app that day and generated over 500 million social media impressions. We also launched an exclusive colorway of the Epic React with DICK'S Sporting Goods through a takeover of their digital commerce platform and social media channels. And as Mark detailed, we're in the process of launching the NIKE App at Retail in key markets, bringing NIKE+ membership into the store and accelerating the convergence of digital and physical retail.
As for the Jordan Brand in North America, we are already back to a pull market and we expect a return to global growth in fiscal year '19. Consumers love the Jordan Brand, and their passion for the brand is unwavering. At the same time, we saw an opportunity to recalibrate the supply of select styles across just distribution channels. While that included tightening the supply in some cases, it also included expanding the supply of the hottest, most iconic Jordan styles on the Nike SNKRS App, which has fast become the leading destination for high heat footwear launches globally.
We also leveraged both Jordan and NIKE launches on the SNKRS App to create compelling new consumer experiences that merged digital and physical with our strategic retail partners, for example, through initiatives such as Shock Drop, SNKRS Pass and SNKRS Stash. Looking forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue diversifying the Jordan Brand for women in performance and through apparel.
For the full year, North America's revenue declined 2% and EBIT was 7% lower. However, our Q4 results in North America reflect the reversal of trend and sustainable momentum going into fiscal year '19.
Moving to EMEA, where revenues grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis in Q4, driven by strong global growth -- driven by strong growth in Global Football, Sportswear and Running. Our apparel business is also particularly strong across Europe with Global Football apparel approaching triple-digit growth in Q4 fueled by high-energy national team collections associated with the World Cup. In footwear, Air Max continues to be the dominant platform in the region with the Air Max 270 becoming the #1 style across key European markets and Air Max Month in March propelling Sportswear to record full year revenues.
The NIKE Brand is also #1 in all of our key cities across Europe, fueled by campaigns such as Nothing Beats a Londoner that amplified the authentic voice of over 200 London consumers, along with influencers such as Skepta and several of the world's greatest athletes, including Mo Farah, Harry Kane and others. This is a great example of a hyper local city campaign that resonated with our consumers globally.
While NIKE Direct continues to lead all dimensions of growth in EMEA, JD, for example, has also been a very strategic partner for NIKE. JD continues to leverage digital connections with consumers and differentiated store concepts, including size, to both create and serve demand, and we look forward to the best practices that they will bring to the North American marketplace.
For the full year, currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%, fueled by double-digit growth in Sportswear and across apparel. On a reported basis, fiscal year '18 revenues grew 16% and EBIT increased 5% as strong revenue growth was offset primarily by transactional FX headwinds on gross margin.
So next, let's turn to Greater China. In Q4, Greater China's growth accelerated to 25% on a currency-neutral basis, including strong double-digit growth across all categories, the Jordan Brand and across our women's business. NIKE Digital growth continues to outpace all other marketplace dimensions, and we continue to partner with and learn from China's leading digital platforms. Through our partnership with Tmall, our first ever Air Max Super Brand Day in March, became our largest day on the platform, second only to Singles' Day for the year. And with Tencent, we launched our Choose Go campaign through digital media, inspiring 2 million runners to participate in a 7-week running journey and creating strong demand for the Epic React.
For the full year, revenues in Greater China increased 18% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by Running, Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Nike Basketball. On a reported basis, fiscal year '18 revenues were up 21% and EBIT increased 20%.
There are several drivers of the extraordinary long-term growth potential we see in Greater China from favorable macroeconomics to the rise of sport and fitness, to the scale and impact of digital, to the strength of the NIKE Brand. Accordingly, we will continue to invest to extend our leadership in this strategically important and fast growing market.
In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across all key countries within this diverse geography and is being fueled by our focus on creating brand energy in key cities and through digital. In fact, while NIKE Digital growth was strong in every geography, APLA's digital growth led the pack. In addition to strong NIKE Direct digital growth, growth through new entrepreneurial digital partners also accelerated. Looking forward, we will continue to drive digital momentum by scaling the NIKE and SNKRS Apps across key countries within APLA while also continuing to explore and scale these digital partnerships.
For the full fiscal year, revenue increased 10% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced growth across all categories, including the Jordan Brand and our women's business. On a reported basis, full year revenues for the fiscal year increased 9%, while EBIT was up 21%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
And finally, at Converse, revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal year '18 and declined 14% in the fourth quarter. Contraction was primarily driven by the decision to rightsize wholesale distribution in North America and EMEA. At the same time, Converse Direct grew double digits in Q4, including strong double-digit growth in digital for the full year with acceleration in Q4. On a reported basis, full year revenues were down 8% and EBIT declined 35%.
As we move into fiscal year '19, we are reigniting energy in the Converse brand and diversifying Converse's product portfolio both through Converse's authentic positioning in sport and through new sportswear styles and collaborations.  In fiscal year '19, Converse will also launch a more direct, branded and immersive digital experience to drive closer connections between the Converse brand and its passionate consumers.
Fiscal year '19 will be the first full year of execution against NIKE's Consumer Direct Offense and the long-term financial goals that we detailed at our Investor Day. As we are now deeper into the execution of our new offense, it is becoming increasingly clear that digital is transforming how we operate and will favorably reshape our economic model over the long term. Digital is inflecting our revenue growth and has a favorable mix impact on our gross margin as we capture more of the value that we are creating for consumers. And as for SG&A, we will continue to accelerate investments in scalable digital experiences and capabilities, building both organically and through acquisitions. At the same time, we're already seeing how upfront investment in experiences, like the NIKE and SNKRS Apps, and in capabilities, such as a data and analytics, can be efficiently leveraged globally to better serve our consumers across our key markets. Finally, digital also creates the potential for win-win economic models with our wholesale partners over time as they transform their retail experiences to serve the next generation of digitally native consumers.
Taking all of these dynamics into account, we are updating our guidance for fiscal year '19. As of our last earnings call, we expected mid- to high single-digit revenue growth in fiscal year '19. As we now close Q4, our expectations for revenue growth in fiscal year '19 have moved up slightly, entering the high single-digit range. This improved outlook takes into account building consumer demand for NIKE. However, we are also mindful of renewed FX volatility and the strengthening dollar of late. As for gross margin, we now expect expansion of roughly 50 basis points or slightly greater, fueled by strong full-price sales, expanding average selling prices and growth in our NIKE Direct businesses, partially offset by higher input costs.
As for SG&A, we will continue to prioritize investments in new digital consumer experiences and capabilities, in product innovation and in brand marketing. As such, in fiscal year '19, we expect SG&A to grow roughly in the same range as revenue growth. We're not targeting SG&A leverage in fiscal year '19. We are capturing productivity gains within SG&A, but we will use that incremental capacity to invest strategically for the long term.
As for other expense net of interest expense, we expect roughly $125 million to $150 million of expense for the full year. We see our effective tax rate being in the mid-teens range or potentially slightly higher for the full year. It's important to note that our tax rate will continue to be volatile based upon the full implementation and further guidance with respect to U.S. tax reform. Variation in our mix of earnings geographically will also have an impact as will the impact of stock-based compensation and other discrete items.
Our focus will remain on driving strategic transformation and delivering strong growth over the long term, more so than on the results in any individual quarter. That said, for some additional context as we enter the fiscal year, we expect the same level of revenue growth in Q1 as we do for the full year. We also expect less gross margin expansion in the first half as compared to the second half of the year. And finally, as for SG&A, our investments will be more front loaded towards the first half of the fiscal year, driven by key consumer and sports moments such as the World Cup.
The Consumer Direct Offense is transforming how we operate at NIKE and how we will create value for shareholders going forward. More specifically, digital is proving to be as transformative as we expected and potentially even more so. We still have much work to do ahead of us to realize the full potential of our new office -- offense. That said, it is clear, as we accelerate in fiscal year '19, that we have now ignited NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

As you know, our Investor Day guidance for North America was that we believed it was a mid-single-digit growth market over the next 5 years. And so we don't typically provide geographical specific guidance certainly by quarter or for the full year. But I would say that we have momentum going into the year, and that's really primarily fueled by new innovation platforms that we're scaling; NIKE Direct; certainly NIKE Digital, which accelerated to well over 30% growth driven by strong results on SNKRS and through membership. And then I'd note that, importantly, we've returned North America to a healthy pull market. Inventory is clean, up only 2%. Full-price sales are accelerating. Off-price sales are declining, and gross margins are expanding. So we do see a strong momentum, sustainable momentum going into fiscal year '19, but we aren't providing specific guidance by line item by geography."

As we -- as both Mark and I detailed, we saw acceleration in digital that, quite frankly, exceeded even our own expectations. It wasn'",430,"Sure. I will -- I'll start with your question around the impact of digital. It's a great question and a timely question. As we -- as both Mark and I detailed, we saw acceleration in digital that, quite frankly, exceeded even our own expectations. It wasn't by accident. We've certainly been investing both organically in digital experiences, such as some of the experiences we've shared with respect to our membership initiatives as well as in capabilities. You've heard us refer to our acquisitions of Virgin Mega, Invertex and Zodiac over time. And so that acceleration is definitely a result of the investment. In terms of our evolving view of the impact of digital on our economic model or how we create value for shareholders, we do see digital being a platform that helps us better optimize supply and demand. We obviously get a very direct read and signals from consumers in terms of which products they are most interested in, and that ultimately helps us amplify revenue growth through full-price sales. When we're leveraging digital in a more direct way, we obviously capture more of that revenue at the retail price. When we are leveraging digital with our partners, we do see a benefit from full-price sales and a win-win relationship with our partners. Digital commerce also has margins that are favorable from a mix perspective relative to our traditional wholesale bricks-and-mortar business. From an SG&A perspective, I would suggest there are 2 ways to look at it. One is short, medium and long term, and then the other one is specifically more in the shorter term. I think short, medium and long term, what we're finding is that the capabilities or experiences we're building in digital are very scalable, and they're scalable in an efficient way. You think about creating experiences around the SNKRS or NIKE Apps, and to the extent we have success in the market where we launch that, we're then able to take that investment we've already made and leverage it in markets around the world. And we're certainly seeing that, for example, with the SNKRS App, which is #1 in Japan in terms of free applications. We've seen millions of downloads of that app since launch in China, leveraging a lot of that upfront initial investment. So we think it's a source of leverage, at the same time, because we're focused on the long term and we do think digital has the ability to really inflect our value creation, we're accelerating the investments that we're making in digital now to accelerate us down that path."

We had a strong fourth quarter with results that confirm why we're so excited about the potential of the Consumer Direct Offense. The shifts we've made to our business and our deeper focus on the 3 c",543,"Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter with results that confirm why we're so excited about the potential of the Consumer Direct Offense. The shifts we've made to our business and our deeper focus on the 3 core areas, Innovation, Direct and Speed, are igniting the next phase of growth and profitability for NIKE. Here are the key areas of where we're driving momentum in our business.
First, we're winning with new innovation. We're leading with platforms, not just products. For example, React and Air Max are scaling through multiple styles and across categories. They're driving extraordinary growth and brand heat with consumers. Second, our digital offense is transforming NIKE from how we connect with consumers to how we deliver products. This is a major shift from operating models of the past to a new digitally powered model of the future. And third, with a more focused strategy, we're running a more complete portfolio with better balanced growth across geographies and categories.
For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 13% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include our international business growing 23% with Greater China up 35%. We returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. Sportswear, a $10 billion business for NIKE, had another quarter of double-digit growth. We saw solid momentum in key performance categories, and Digital, NIKE Digital was up 41% for the quarter.
The key to accelerating our strength is to continue to sharpen the execution of our Triple Double, and looking at our progress this quarter, I'll start with 2X Innovation.
The lineup of fresh, unexpected products that we shared with you last fall at our Investor Day has entered the marketplace, and as I noted, the consumer has responded. NIKE React, for example, is living up to big expectations. We extended the launch momentum from last quarter and scaled significantly with excellent sell-through globally. The Epic React is already the #2 performance running shoe in the marketplace above $125, only trailing the Air VaporMax. And Zoom Air continues to be the training platform of choice for serious runners, led by our best-selling Pegasus line. Our latest, the Peg 35, has the highest bookings in the first season for any Pegasus in our history. Overall, Running grew 7% for fiscal year '18. And with a loaded pipeline in fiscal '19 led by the Peg Turbo with ZoomX cushioning, we see a great runaway ahead for our largest performance category.
In Sportswear, the consumer demand for all-day comfort is making Air Max one of the fastest growing platforms in our industry. Our icons, the Air Max Plus, 95, 97 and 98, are all performing incredibly well. Air VaporMax built on that demand, and this quarter, we took it a step further with NIKE's first innovation to build specifically for lifestyle. The Air Max 270 is launching in March. 270 is the most successful Air Max launch in our history.
[Technical Difficulty]
[ This is a ] driving force behind Sportswear, a category that delivered more than [ $0.6 billion ] in revenue in Q4, our best quarter ever. Look for more lifestyle Air Max platforms in the season ahead.

So I said, you should look for more Air Max platforms in the season ahead, pushing the boundaries on lifestyle innovation. Air is one of NIKE's greatest competitive differentiators, and it continues to fuel extraordinary growth. Sportswear has begun to integrate Nike React into new styles with more to come throughout fiscal year '19, including new icons from Jordan.
The success of our new cushioning platforms is driving momentum in our women's business as well. In fact, following our launches the past 3 months, the 270, VaporMax and Epic React are already the top 3 selling women's athletic footwear models above $125. Overall, women's lifestyle product continues to set the pace for the category. For the quarter, women's saw the Air Force 1 continuing its strong momentum, the Blazer ramping up quickly in China and APLA, and key Air Max icons growing triple digits. One of our biggest opportunities for fiscal '19 is to scale our women's sneaker business across both NIKE and Jordan.
In women's apparel, lifestyle's also leading the way, highlighted by strong growth in tops and fleece. And looking ahead, we're building on our leadership in bras and bringing more innovation through Flyknit apparel in the second half of the year. And as a part of our more holistic point of view on women's across Running, Training and Sportswear, we'll roll out a new approach with seasonal head-to-toe capsules and collections like we did with the Meshed Up Collection this quarter. There is great energy across our women's product and marketplace teams right now.
One of our most important performance categories, Nike Basketball, has produced strong momentum this year off the back of the NBA partnership and high demand for key signature styles. We've had an amazing year 1 with the NBA. We had a lot of firsts this year, but I'd say our 3 biggest wins were our editions approach to jerseys, driving significantly higher NBA jersey sales than the league has ever had, the Showtime Hoodie, which was a new premium apparel business for fiscal '18 with sell-through approaching 100% across most teams and channels and the steady flow of LeBron player edition footwear that we launched through LeBron Watch on the SNKRS App, which is a new feature that turns the on-court footwear into real-time buying opportunities.
Jordan Brand proved, too, that the NBA is the ultimate sneaker runway. In many ways, Jordan defines the spectrum of performance and style as part of the pregame walk-in, on the court with the game's best players and courtside with fans. But we know consumers are demanding more from Jordan, and we know that people want wider access and new dimensions. And we're delivering. This quarter, we nearly tripled the size of Jordan's women's sneaker business. Jordan apparel was up double digits in all geos, and the Jordan Brand in China was up nearly 50%.
These are the areas where we see exponential growth, and we will continue to focus. We have a lot of opportunity to expand the Jordan portfolio of products to create a greater range of choice and to match the energy of the Jordan Brand. For both NIKE and Jordan, our partnerships with the world's best leagues, teams and athletes are what fuel our growth. Nobody is better positioned to harness the expanding power of sport.
Just look back at the moments and performances from our athletes over the last few weeks. Kevin Durant won back-to-back NBA titles and Finals MVP award. Eliud Kipchoge won the London Marathon in our new 3D printed uppers with FlyPrint and ZoomX, Brooks Koepka winning the U.S. Open for the second year in a row. And at the French Open, Simona Halep won her first title and Rafa Nadal won his unrivaled 11th at Roland Garros. And of course, we're 2 weeks into 1 of the world's greatest sports moments, the World Cup, where the energy for the NIKE Brand has been tremendous. With over 60% of the players in the opening round wearing NIKE boots, it's [indiscernible] by players in NIKE boots than all other brands combined with Harry Kane and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the way. We also debuted the latest generation of NIKE Flyknit, the material Superfly 360 and the Vapor 360.
 
In apparel, we've seen strong sell-through of our performance kits, and we've designed full collections across performance, training and sportswear for key national teams, including England, France, Portugal, Brazil and Nigeria. This quarter, we also made an important commitment to our future in football. We entered into a 10-year partnership with the China Super League, 1 of the fastest growing football nations in the world.
The stories of our athletes and the innovation they inspire have always been central to our brand, and today, those products and stories are being amplified even further by the power of digital. We've talked about how critical mobile and social experiences are to our consumer and how that's driving change, but really, the full digital transformation of NIKE that's taking place right now is even bigger than that. It's fundamentally shifting our entire company.
Digital is allowing us to realize our vision for smart retail, to remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. It's sharpening our ability to sense the market through data and analytics. It's unlocking new manufacturing tools that are more precise and drive a new aesthetic. And it's opening up opportunities for new partnerships and how we develop talent in the organization.
Let's start with how digital is fueling 2X Direct and our mission to lead the industry to a more differentiated marketplace through NIKE Consumer Experiences. In our own ecosystem, NikePlus membership is the key to an elevated consumer experience. Once someone becomes a member and customizes their profile, we know what sports they like, how active they are and the style of products they prefer, and that insight allows for unlocks for exclusive product, style advice from experts and rewards for their activity. It personalizes the entire experience and allows us to remove friction points for members as they move seamlessly from mobile to the in-store environment.
We've relaunched NikePlus membership in November, and for the year, we've exceeded all of our membership targets with strong growth in new, active and buying members and improvement in engagements and in conversion. And we continue to explore the physical and digital intersection through our new NIKE App at Retail, which is beginning to scale to multiple stores.
Through smart retail, we can aggregate consumer buying patterns to better inform localized preferences and turn those into new growth opportunities. For example, next month, we're opening a new retail concept in L.A. called Nike Live. It's a small format, data-driven store with its assortments influenced by what consumers are buying from surrounding ZIP codes. We see great potential in this approach, and you'll see a lot more of it across our key cities.
Digital innovation also allows us to push the edges on new immersive experiences, whether that's in our own channels or through partnered retail or social media platforms. The SNKRS App has delivered some incredibly compelling experiences this quarter. For example, at venues during Kendrick Lamar's recent tour, we triggered SNKRS Stash drops to make his Cortez Kenny III shoe available exclusively to his fans who were at the show. The SNKRS App is creating incredible demand, and capturing more value from that energy is one of NIKE's largest upside opportunities for fiscal '19 and beyond.
Our investments in the digital experience are also creating a platform for new brand-friendly e-commerce partnerships. Our work with Tmall continues to set the bar for how we cocreate shopping experiences through mobile and social. This quarter, we leveraged key shopping moments for Air Max on Tmall's Super Brand Day and Young Athletes during its [ parent's ] channel launch.
We continue to expand our presence in digital marketplaces through partnerships like Zalando in EMEA and ZOZOTOWN in Japan, which became fully operational in March. And we see huge potential in merging storytelling and shopping through our social platforms. This quarter, NIKE became one of the first companies to drive new consumer experiences in Facebook Messenger app, leveraging the AR camera to reveal the KYRIE 4 Red Carpet. You should look for more exciting new shopping experiences with Facebook and other social media platforms in the coming months.
And as we noted at Investor Day, we're also piloting and scaling NIKE Consumer Experiences with key wholesale partners. For example, the NIKE-certified athletes program turned selected Foot Locker associates into NIKE experts. And after showing strong early results, Foot Locker will scale the program across North America in Q1. And with JD Group in EMEA, we launched both a physical and digital concept to celebrate Air Max storytelling called [ Undisputed Air ], driving triple-digit growth of NIKE Air products in JD versus last year.
Digital acceleration is also critical to creating an overall faster company from consumer insight to responsive manufacturing to delivering products to the consumer when they want it. In other words, it's integral to our 2X Speed initiative.
In fiscal '18, we've invested significantly in the capabilities that heighten our ability to sense the market and drive efficiency through our supply chain. We scaled 7 key distribution centers around the world this year. One of the facilities in North America is our new rebound facility, the first to be focused solely on accepting returned product and getting it back into the marketplace significantly faster to maximize full-price in-season selling.
We've also integrated the Zodiac team from our recent acquisition, who are giving us new predictive tools and advanced analytics to drive targeted growth. And we continue to develop our sensing capabilities within our key cities and sharpened the Express Lane, our fastest growing product engine that serves as a key focal point of our speed initiatives. This quarter, the Express Lane created a substantial impact by extending our in-line stories with new materials and colors as the teams did with the Air Max 270 this quarter, and amplifying the brand concepts we know are connecting best with consumers like the Tuned Air Mercurial to celebrate World Cup, and capturing emerging trends like we did in EMEA with the '90s apparel collection where we identified the trend and quickly delivered product to market. Express Lane, as a whole, is leading to significantly stronger full-price sell-through rates.
Through digital, we're also inventing new manufacturing tools that allow us to push the boundaries of product creation like computational design with React or new Flyknit apparel. And automation throughout our supply chain continues to drive speed and efficiency. 2X Speed is a multi-year journey, and while we've made progress, we also know there's even greater opportunity ahead in this space.
We've closed out the fiscal year with a strong performance across our business. Being closer to the consumer and our new offense has us focused on the biggest growth opportunities, making the right investments with the greatest returns. We fueled increased demand for NIKE in fiscal '18. In fiscal '19, we'll continue that acceleration with an even faster pace of innovation and by serving consumers more completely across our entire portfolio.
We have momentum, and we're continuing to transform across multiple dimensions and throughout our entire organization. And I'm confident we'll use this quarter as a catalyst for growth into fiscal '19 and beyond.
Thanks, and now here's Andy."

Fiscal year '18 was a strategically significant year for NIKE. As we began the fiscal year last June, we communicated our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense, which we believe would ignite NIKE's n",2852,"Thank you, Mark, and hello to everyone on the call. Fiscal year '18 was a strategically significant year for NIKE. As we began the fiscal year last June, we communicated our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense, which we believe would ignite NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable profitable growth and transform the company in the process. Then, at our Investor Day this past October, we showcased how our new strategy was already beginning to come to life. We displayed the pipeline of innovative products that we plan to bring to market in the second half of fiscal year '18 on our path to 2X Innovation. We immersed our stakeholders in the relaunch of our NIKE and SNKRS App experiences and the new membership services that would ignite 2X Direct. And we shared several of the manufacturing and supply chain initiatives that will help 2x our speed and ultimately cut our time to market in half.
Of course, we also established a new long-term financial model. But perhaps even more notable than the financial goals we established were some of the key operational measures of success that we shared. Those measures of success better define how we will transform NIKE into a digitally led enterprise that connects more directly with our consumers globally through our key cities and countries.
And as we now close Q4, we are thrilled to see our strategic execution translating into strong financial performance as both revenue growth and profitability exceeded even our own expectations. At the same time, what's even more exciting is that we also delivered across all of our key operational measures of success, and it's worth highlighting a few examples as these are proof points that NIKE's strategic transformation is underway at an accelerated pace.
So first, we said that new innovation platforms will drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fiscal year '18, revenue from new innovative platforms actually drove over 80% of our incremental growth, fueled by innovative new platforms such as the Air VaporMax, React, the Air Max 270 and ZoomX. We also said that we would 2X Direct with digital commerce growth both owned and partnered comprising over 50% of NIKE's total company growth over the next 5 years. In fiscal year '18, NIKE Direct, in fact, drove over 90% of our growth, and 100% of our growth was driven by the combination of NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE Consumer Experiences.
NIKE Digital, in particular, grew 34% in Q4 on a constant currency basis and was the single fastest growing channel globally. Yet, for many of the hottest styles launched on NIKE Digital platforms within the quarter, our supply was only a fraction of the actual demand we experienced. This underscores a significant opportunity to better sense and serve digital demand in fiscal year '19.
We also said in October that we expect our international geographies to drive over 75% of our growth and that North America would return to mid-single-digit growth over the next 5 years. For the full year, our international geographies accounted for over 100% of our growth with Greater China growing nearly 2x the rate of any other geography on a currency-neutral basis. And in Q4, North America returned to growth, sharply reversing its prior trend. As Mark said, as we enter fiscal year '19, we are now running a more complete offense across our global portfolio.
But before I go deeper into our outlook for fiscal year '19, let's first reflect on the drivers of our strong Q4 results.  NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 13%, up 8% on a currency-neutral basis driven by double-digit international growth and a return to growth in North America. NIKE Direct led our growth globally, including 5% comp store growth and 34% digital growth. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $36.4 billion, up 4% on a currency-neutral basis.
Gross margin expanded over 60 basis points in Q4, exceeding our own expectations due to accelerating full-price sales and NIKE Digital growth. For the full year, gross margin contracted just under 80 basis points as strong underlying product profitability was more than offset by a 90 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25%, primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham and the NBA; brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup; and global campaigns supporting the launch of new product innovations. For the full year, demand creation increased 7%. Operating overhead increased 14% for the quarter and 10% for the full year as we're investing in capabilities that will fuel long-term growth, particularly with respect to digital and innovation.
Our effective tax rate was 6.4% for the quarter and 55.3% for the full year. The full year rate was significantly higher than the prior year, primarily due to the onetime transition tax associated with U.S. tax reform. Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 15% to $0.69. Full year diluted EPS declined 53% to $1.17, taking into account the significant onetime impacts of U.S. tax reform. As of May 31, inventories were up 4%, growing slower than the rate of revenue growth, which is an indication that our supply and demand management efforts over the course of fiscal year '18 have returned NIKE to a strong pull market globally.
Finally, today, we're announcing a new 4-year $15 billion share repurchase program. We anticipate that our current $12 billion share repurchase program will be completed within fiscal year '19. This new expanded authorization, coupled with our dividend program, are evidence of NIKE's strong cash flow generation and steadily increasing cash returns to shareholders.
Now let's turn to the financial performance for a few of our reported operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and currency-neutral basis, led by new innovation platforms, very strong digital growth, continued momentum in Sportswear and broad growth across apparel. We've returned North America to revenue growth and expanding margins, and this healthy momentum is carrying forward into this new fiscal year.
As we expected, digital continues to reshape the consumer experience and to some extent, disrupt the more undifferentiated multi-brand wholesale dimensions of the marketplace. However, NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, both owned and partnered, and particularly those that leverage a digital connection to the consumer, drove over 2/3 of our growth in North America.
Digital connections have been critical to launching new and innovative products, creating brand heat and better serving consumer demand. For example, as part of the Epic React launch, through social media, we invited our consumers to Choose Go. The Choose Go campaign inspired more than 1 million NIKE+ members to participate in a run on the NIKE Running Club (sic) [ Run Club ] app that day and generated over 500 million social media impressions. We also launched an exclusive colorway of the Epic React with DICK'S Sporting Goods through a takeover of their digital commerce platform and social media channels. And as Mark detailed, we're in the process of launching the NIKE App at Retail in key markets, bringing NIKE+ membership into the store and accelerating the convergence of digital and physical retail.
As for the Jordan Brand in North America, we are already back to a pull market and we expect a return to global growth in fiscal year '19. Consumers love the Jordan Brand, and their passion for the brand is unwavering. At the same time, we saw an opportunity to recalibrate the supply of select styles across just distribution channels. While that included tightening the supply in some cases, it also included expanding the supply of the hottest, most iconic Jordan styles on the Nike SNKRS App, which has fast become the leading destination for high heat footwear launches globally.
We also leveraged both Jordan and NIKE launches on the SNKRS App to create compelling new consumer experiences that merged digital and physical with our strategic retail partners, for example, through initiatives such as Shock Drop, SNKRS Pass and SNKRS Stash. Looking forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue diversifying the Jordan Brand for women in performance and through apparel.
For the full year, North America's revenue declined 2% and EBIT was 7% lower. However, our Q4 results in North America reflect a reversal of trend and sustainable momentum going into fiscal year '19.
Moving to EMEA, where revenues grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis in Q4, driven by strong global growth -- driven by strong growth in Global Football, Sportswear and Running. Our apparel business is also particularly strong across Europe with Global Football apparel approaching triple-digit growth in Q4 fueled by high-energy national team collections associated with the World Cup. In footwear, Air Max continues to be the dominant platform in the region with the Air Max 270 becoming the #1 style across key European markets and Air Max Month in March propelling Sportswear to record full year revenues.
The NIKE Brand is also #1 in all of our key cities across Europe, fueled by campaigns such as Nothing Beats a Londoner that amplified the authentic voice of over 200 London consumers, along with influencers such as Skepta and several of the world's greatest athletes, including Mo Farah, Harry Kane and others. This is a great example of a hyper local city campaign that resonated with our consumers globally.
While NIKE Direct continues to lead all dimensions of growth in EMEA, JD, for example, has also been a very strategic partner for NIKE. JD continues to leverage digital connections with consumers and differentiated store concepts, including size, to both create and serve demand, and we look forward to the best practices that they will bring to the North American marketplace.
For the full year, currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%, fueled by double-digit growth in Sportswear and across apparel. On a reported basis, fiscal year '18 revenues grew 16% and EBIT increased 5% as strong revenue growth was offset primarily by transactional FX headwinds on gross margin.
So next, let's turn to Greater China. In Q4, Greater China's growth accelerated to 25% on a currency-neutral basis, including strong double-digit growth across all categories, the Jordan Brand and across our women's business. NIKE Digital growth continues to outpace all other marketplace dimensions, and we continue to partner with and learn from China's leading digital platforms. Through our partnership with Tmall, our first ever Air Max Super Brand Day in March, became our largest day on the platform, second only to Singles' Day for the year. And with Tencent, we launched our Choose Go campaign through digital media, inspiring 2 million runners to participate in a 7-week running journey and creating strong demand for the Epic React.
For the full year, revenues in Greater China increased 18% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by Running, Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Nike Basketball. On a reported basis, fiscal year '18 revenues were up 21% and EBIT increased 20%.
There are several drivers of the extraordinary long-term growth potential we see in Greater China from favorable macroeconomics to the rise of sport and fitness, to the scale and impact of digital, to the strength of the NIKE Brand. Accordingly, we will continue to invest to extend our leadership in this strategically important and fast growing market.
In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across all key countries within this diverse geography and is being fueled by our focus on creating brand energy in key cities and through digital. In fact, while NIKE Digital growth was strong in every geography, APLA's digital growth led the pack. In addition to strong NIKE Direct digital growth, growth through new entrepreneurial digital partners also accelerated. Looking forward, we will continue to drive digital momentum by scaling the NIKE and SNKRS Apps across key countries within APLA while also continuing to explore and scale these digital partnerships.
For the full fiscal year, revenue increased 10% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced growth across all categories, including the Jordan Brand and our women's business. On a reported basis, full year revenues for the fiscal year increased 9%, while EBIT was up 21%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
And finally, at Converse, revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal year '18 and declined 14% in the fourth quarter. Contraction was primarily driven by the decision to rightsize wholesale distribution in North America and EMEA. At the same time, Converse Direct grew double digits in Q4, including strong double-digit growth in digital for the full year with acceleration in Q4. On a reported basis, full year revenues were down 8% and EBIT declined 35%.
As we move into fiscal year '19, we are reigniting energy in the Converse brand and diversifying Converse's product portfolio both through Converse's authentic positioning in sport and through new sportswear styles and collaborations.  In fiscal year '19, Converse will also launch a more direct, branded and immersive digital experience to drive closer connections between the Converse brand and its passionate consumers.
Fiscal year '19 will be the first full year of execution against NIKE's Consumer Direct Offense and the long-term financial goals that we detailed at our Investor Day. As we are now deeper into the execution of our new offense, it is becoming increasingly clear that digital is transforming how we operate and will favorably reshape our economic model over the long term. Digital is inflecting our revenue growth and has a favorable mix impact on our gross margin as we capture more of the value that we are creating for consumers. And as for SG&A, we will continue to accelerate investments in scalable digital experiences and capabilities, building both organically and through acquisitions. At the same time, we're already seeing how upfront investment in experiences, like the NIKE and SNKRS Apps; and in capabilities, such as a data and analytics, can be efficiently leveraged globally to better serve our consumers across our key markets. Finally, digital also creates the potential for win-win economic models with our wholesale partners over time as they transform their retail experiences to serve the next generation of digitally native consumers.
Taking all of these dynamics into account, we are updating our guidance for fiscal year '19. As of our last earnings call, we expected mid- to high single-digit revenue growth in fiscal year '19. As we now close Q4, our expectations for revenue growth in fiscal year '19 have moved up slightly, entering the high single-digit range. This improved outlook takes into account building consumer demand for NIKE. However, we are also mindful of renewed FX volatility and the strengthening dollar of late. As for gross margin, we now expect expansion of roughly 50 basis points or slightly greater, fueled by strong full-price sales, expanding average selling prices and growth in our NIKE Direct businesses, partially offset by higher input costs.
As for SG&A, we will continue to prioritize investments in new digital consumer experiences and capabilities, in product innovation and in brand marketing. As such, in fiscal year '19, we expect SG&A to grow roughly in the same range as revenue growth. We're not targeting SG&A leverage in fiscal year '19. We are capturing productivity gains within SG&A, but we will use that incremental capacity to invest strategically for the long term.
As for other expense net of interest expense, we expect roughly $125 million to $150 million of expense for the full year. We see our effective tax rate being in the mid-teens range or potentially slightly higher for the full year. It's important to note that our tax rate will continue to be volatile based upon the full implementation and further guidance with respect to U.S. tax reform. Variation in our mix of earnings geographically will also have an impact as will the impact of stock-based compensation and other discrete items.
Our focus will remain on driving strategic transformation and delivering strong growth over the long term, more so than on the results in any individual quarter. That said, for some additional context as we enter the fiscal year, we expect the same level of revenue growth in Q1 as we do for the full year. We also expect less gross margin expansion in the first half as compared to the second half of the year. And finally, as for SG&A, our investments will be more front loaded towards the first half of the fiscal year, driven by key consumer and sports moments such as the World Cup.
The Consumer Direct Offense is transforming how we operate at NIKE and how we will create value for shareholders going forward. More specifically, digital is proving to be as transformative as we expected and potentially even more so. We still have much work to do ahead of us to realize the full potential of our new office -- offense. That said, it is clear, as we accelerate in fiscal year '19, that we have now ignited NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

And so we don't typically provide geographical specific guidance certainly by quarter or for the full year. But I would say that we have momentum going into the year, and that's really primarily fueled by new innovation platforms that we're scaling; NIKE Direct; certainly NIKE Digital, which accelerated to well over 30% growth driven by strong results on SNKRS and through membership. And then I'd note that, importantly, we've returned North America to a healthy pull market. Inventory is clean, up only 2%. Full-price sales are accelerating. Off-price sales are declining, and gross margins are expanding. So we do see a strong momentum, sustainable momentum going into fiscal year '19, but we aren't providing specific guidance by line item by geography."

As we -- as both Mark and I detailed, we saw acceleration in digital that, quite frankly, exceeded even our own expectations. It wasn'",430,"Sure. I will -- I'll start with your question around the impact of digital. It's a great question and a timely question. As we -- as both Mark and I detailed, we saw acceleration in digital that, quite frankly, exceeded even our own expectations. It wasn't by accident. We've certainly been investing both organically in digital experiences, such as some of the experiences we've shared with respect to our membership initiatives as well as in capabilities. You've heard us refer to our acquisitions of Virgin Mega, Invertex and Zodiac over time. And so that acceleration is definitely a result of the investment. In terms of our evolving view of the impact of digital on our economic model or how we create value for shareholders, we do see digital being a platform that helps us better optimize supply and demand. We obviously get a very direct read and signals from consumers in terms of which products they are most interested in, and that ultimately helps us amplify revenue growth through full-price sales. When we're leveraging digital in a more direct way, we obviously capture more of that revenue at the retail price. When we are leveraging digital with our partners, we do see a benefit from full-price sales and a win-win relationship with our partners. Digital commerce also has margins that are favorable from a mix perspective relative to our traditional wholesale bricks-and-mortar business. From an SG&A perspective, I would suggest there are 2 ways to look at it. One is short, medium and long term, and then the other one is specifically more in the shorter term. I think short, medium and long term, what we're finding is that the capabilities or experiences we're building in digital are very scalable, and they're scalable in an efficient way. You think about creating experiences around the SNKRS or NIKE Apps, and to the extent we have success in the market where we launch that, we're then able to take that investment we've already made and leverage it in markets around the world. And we're certainly seeing that, for example, with the SNKRS App, which is #1 in Japan in terms of free applications. We've seen millions of downloads of that app since launch in China, leveraging a lot of that upfront initial investment. So we think it's a source of leverage, at the same time, because we're focused on the long term and we do think digital has the ability to really inflect our value creation, we're accelerating the investments that we're making in digital now to accelerate us down that path."

And so as we're investing to 2X Speed, we do have some investments in revolutionizing manufacturing and other initiatives that are in that line item of our P&L."

As you put it, I think you said it was a nice problem to have. We see it as a great opportunity to really serve the consumers who have extraordinary demand for that product better. So frankly, along the lines of the notion of 2X Speed, we're attacking that opportunity with a lot of urgency not just because it is a revenue upside potential driver, which it certainly is. As I said, the supply that we had against some of the demand we saw on some of the hottest styles was, as I said, but a fraction of that demand. We also see it as a great opportunity to both serve in terms of the product they want but also connect in a deeper way with those passionate consumers, many call them sneakerheads, who have chosen to connect with us as members on the NIKE App and SNKRS. In terms of 2X Speed, I think maybe even elevating, as Mark said, the digital transformation at NIKE is really an end-to-end notion. And when we think about demand sensing, the greatest opportunity we have is to sense the demand and even in a more nuanced way, the signals and the preferences from the consumers that we're connecting with directly on SNKRS. We use things like notify me initiatives, draws, preorders, and we're coming up increasingly with even more creative ways to get a sense for how robust the demand is, either for specific products or for types of products that we may be planning to bring to market."

We had a strong fourth quarter with results that confirm why we're so excited about the potential of the Consumer Direct Offense.

We had a strong fourth quarter with results that confirm why we're so excited about the potential of the Consumer Direct Offense. The shifts we've made to our business and our deeper focus on the 3 core areas, Innovation, Direct and Speed, are igniting the next phase of growth and profitability for NIKE. Here are the key areas of where we're driving momentum in our business.
First, we're winning with new innovation. We're leading with platforms, not just products. For example, React and Air Max are scaling through multiple styles and across categories. They're driving extraordinary growth and brand heat with consumers. Second, our digital offense is transforming NIKE from how we connect with consumers to how we deliver products. This is a major shift from operating models of the past to a new digitally powered model of the future. And third, with a more focused strategy, we're running a more complete portfolio with better balanced growth across geographies and categories.
For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 13% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include our international business growing 23% with Greater China up 35%. We returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. Sportswear, a $10 billion business for NIKE, had another quarter of double-digit growth. We saw solid momentum in key performance categories, and Digital, NIKE Digital was up 41% for the quarter.
The key to accelerating our strength is to continue to sharpen the execution of our Triple Double, and looking at our progress this quarter, I'll start with 2X Innovation.
The lineup of fresh, unexpected products that we shared with you last fall at our Investor Day has entered the marketplace, and as I noted, the consumer has responded. NIKE React, for example, is living up to big expectations. We extended the launch momentum from last quarter and scaled significantly with excellent sell-through globally. The Epic React is already the #2 performance running shoe in the marketplace above $125, only trailing the Air VaporMax. And Zoom Air continues to be the training platform of choice for serious runners, led by our best-selling Pegasus line. Our latest, the Peg 35, has the highest bookings in the first season for any Pegasus in our history. Overall, Running grew 7% for fiscal year '18. And with a loaded pipeline in fiscal '19 led by the Peg Turbo with ZoomX cushioning, we see a great runaway ahead for our largest performance category.
In Sportswear, the consumer demand for all-day comfort is making Air Max one of the fastest growing platforms in our industry. Our icons, the Air Max Plus, 95, 97 and 98, are all performing incredibly well. Air VaporMax built on that demand, and this quarter, we took it a step further with NIKE's first innovation to build specifically for lifestyle. The Air Max 270 is launching in March. 270 is the most successful Air Max launch in our history.
[Technical Difficulty]
[ This is a ] driving force behind Sportswear, a category that delivered more than [ $0.6 billion ] in revenue in Q4, our best quarter ever. Look for more lifestyle Air Max platforms in the season ahead.

So I said, you should look for more Air Max platforms in the season ahead, pushing the boundaries on lifestyle innovation. Air is one of NIKE's greatest competitive differentiators, and it continues to fuel extraordinary growth. Sportswear has begun to integrate Nike React into new styles with more to come throughout fiscal year '19, including new icons from Jordan.
The success of our new cushioning platforms is driving momentum in our women's business as well. In fact, following our launches the past 3 months, the 270, VaporMax and Epic React are already the top 3 selling women's athletic footwear models above $125. Overall, women's lifestyle product continues to set the pace for the category. For the quarter, women's saw the Air Force 1 continuing its strong momentum, the Blazer ramping up quickly in China and APLA, and key Air Max icons growing triple digits. One of our biggest opportunities for fiscal '19 is to scale our women's sneaker business across both NIKE and Jordan.
In women's apparel, lifestyle's also leading the way, highlighted by strong growth in tops and fleece. And looking ahead, we're building on our leadership in bras and bringing more innovation through Flyknit apparel in the second half of the year. And as a part of our more holistic point of view on women's across Running, Training and Sportswear, we'll roll out a new approach with seasonal head-to-toe capsules and collections like we did with the Meshed Up Collection this quarter. There is great energy across our women's product and marketplace teams right now.
One of our most important performance categories, Nike Basketball, has produced strong momentum this year off the back of the NBA partnership and high demand for key signature styles. We've had an amazing year 1 with the NBA. We had a lot of firsts this year, but I'd say our 3 biggest wins were our editions approach to jerseys, driving significantly higher NBA jersey sales than the league has ever had, the Showtime Hoodie, which was a new premium apparel business for fiscal '18 with sell-through approaching 100% across most teams and channels and the steady flow of LeBron player edition footwear that we launched through LeBron Watch on the SNKRS App, which is a new feature that turns the on-court footwear into real-time buying opportunities.
Jordan Brand proved, too, that the NBA is the ultimate sneaker runway. In many ways, Jordan defines the spectrum of performance and style as part of the pregame walk-in, on the court with the game's best players and courtside with fans. But we know consumers are demanding more from Jordan, and we know that people want wider access and new dimensions. And we're delivering. This quarter, we nearly tripled the size of Jordan's women's sneaker business. Jordan apparel was up double digits in all geos, and the Jordan Brand in China was up nearly 50%.
These are the areas where we see exponential growth, and we will continue to focus. We have a lot of opportunity to expand the Jordan portfolio of products to create a greater range of choice and to match the energy of the Jordan Brand. For both NIKE and Jordan, our partnerships with the world's best leagues, teams and athletes are what fuel our growth. Nobody is better positioned to harness the expanding power of sport.
Just look back at the moments and performances from our athletes over the last few weeks. Kevin Durant won back-to-back NBA titles and Finals MVP award. Eliud Kipchoge won the London Marathon in our new 3D printed uppers with FlyPrint and ZoomX, Brooks Koepka winning the U.S. Open for the second year in a row. And at the French Open, Simona Halep won her first title and Rafa Nadal won his unrivaled 11th at Roland Garros. And of course, we're 2 weeks into 1 of the world's greatest sports moments, the World Cup, where the energy for the NIKE Brand has been tremendous. With over 60% of the players in the opening round wearing NIKE boots, it's [indiscernible] by players in NIKE boots than all other brands combined with Harry Kane and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the way. We also debuted the latest generation of NIKE Flyknit, the material Superfly 360 and the Vapor 360.
 
In apparel, we've seen strong sell-through of our performance kits, and we've designed full collections across performance, training and sportswear for key national teams, including England, France, Portugal, Brazil and Nigeria. This quarter, we also made an important commitment to our future in football. We entered into a 10-year partnership with the China Super League, 1 of the fastest growing football nations in the world.
The stories of our athletes and the innovation they inspire have always been central to our brand, and today, those products and stories are being amplified even further by the power of digital. We've talked about how critical mobile and social experiences are to our consumer and how that's driving change, but really, the full digital transformation of NIKE that's taking place right now is even bigger than that. It's fundamentally shifting our entire company.
Digital is allowing us to realize our vision for smart retail, to remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. It's sharpening our ability to sense the market through data and analytics. It's unlocking new manufacturing tools that are more precise and drive a new aesthetic. And it's opening up opportunities for new partnerships and how we develop talent in the organization.
Let's start with how digital is fueling 2X Direct and our mission to lead the industry to a more differentiated marketplace through NIKE Consumer Experiences. In our own ecosystem, NikePlus membership is the key to an elevated consumer experience. Once someone becomes a member and customizes their profile, we know what sports they like, how active they are and the style of products they prefer, and that insight allows for unlocks for exclusive product, style advice from experts and rewards for their activity. It personalizes the entire experience and allows us to remove friction points for members as they move seamlessly from mobile to the in-store environment.
We've relaunched NikePlus membership in November, and for the year, we've exceeded all of our membership targets with strong growth in new, active and buying members and improvement in engagements and in conversion. And we continue to explore the physical and digital intersection through our new NIKE App at Retail, which is beginning to scale to multiple stores.
Through smart retail, we can aggregate consumer buying patterns to better inform localized preferences and turn those into new growth opportunities. For example, next month, we're opening a new retail concept in L.A. called Nike Live. It's a small format, data-driven store with its assortments influenced by what consumers are buying from surrounding ZIP codes. We see great potential in this approach, and you'll see a lot more of it across our key cities.
Digital innovation also allows us to push the edges on new immersive experiences, whether that's in our own channels or through partnered retail or social media platforms. The SNKRS App has delivered some incredibly compelling experiences this quarter. For example, at venues during Kendrick Lamar's recent tour, we triggered SNKRS Stash drops to make his Cortez Kenny III shoe available exclusively to his fans who were at the show. The SNKRS App is creating incredible demand, and capturing more value from that energy is one of NIKE's largest upside opportunities for fiscal '19 and beyond.
Our investments in the digital experience are also creating a platform for new brand-friendly e-commerce partnerships. Our work with Tmall continues to set the bar for how we cocreate shopping experiences through mobile and social. This quarter, we leveraged key shopping moments for Air Max on Tmall's Super Brand Day and Young Athletes during its [ parent's ] channel launch.
We continue to expand our presence in digital marketplaces through partnerships like Zalando in EMEA and ZOZOTOWN in Japan, which became fully operational in March. And we see huge potential in merging storytelling and shopping through our social platforms. This quarter, NIKE became one of the first companies to drive new consumer experiences in Facebook Messenger app, leveraging the AR camera to reveal the KYRIE 4 Red Carpet. You should look for more exciting new shopping experiences with Facebook and other social media platforms in the coming months.
And as we noted at Investor Day, we're also piloting and scaling NIKE Consumer Experiences with key wholesale partners. For example, the NIKE-certified athletes program turned selected Foot Locker associates into NIKE experts. And after showing strong early results, Foot Locker will scale the program across North America in Q1. And with JD Group in EMEA, we launched both a physical and digital concept to celebrate Air Max storytelling called [ Undisputed Air ], driving triple-digit growth of NIKE Air products in JD versus last year.
Digital acceleration is also critical to creating an overall faster company from consumer insight to responsive manufacturing to delivering products to the consumer when they want it. In other words, it's integral to our 2X Speed initiative.
In fiscal '18, we've invested significantly in the capabilities that heighten our ability to sense the market and drive efficiency through our supply chain. We scaled 7 key distribution centers around the world this year. One of the facilities in North America is our new rebound facility, the first to be focused solely on accepting returned product and getting it back into the marketplace significantly faster to maximize full-price in-season selling.
We've also integrated the Zodiac team from our recent acquisition, who are giving us new predictive tools and advanced analytics to drive targeted growth. And we continue to develop our sensing capabilities within our key cities and sharpened the Express Lane, our fastest growing product engine that serves as a key focal point of our speed initiatives. This quarter, the Express Lane created a substantial impact by extending our in-line stories with new materials and colors as the teams did with the Air Max 270 this quarter, and amplifying the brand concepts we know are connecting best with consumers like the Tuned Air Mercurial to celebrate World Cup, and capturing emerging trends like we did in EMEA with the '90s apparel collection where we identified the trend and quickly delivered product to market. Express Lane, as a whole, is leading to significantly stronger full-price sell-through rates.
Through digital, we're also inventing new manufacturing tools that allow us to push the boundaries of product creation like computational design with React or new Flyknit apparel. And automation throughout our supply chain continues to drive speed and efficiency. 2X Speed is a multi-year journey, and while we've made progress, we also know there's even greater opportunity ahead in this space.
We've closed out the fiscal year with a strong performance across our business. Being closer to the consumer and our new offense has us focused on the biggest growth opportunities, making the right investments with the greatest returns. We fueled increased demand for NIKE in fiscal '18. In fiscal '19, we'll continue that acceleration with an even faster pace of innovation and by serving consumers more completely across our entire portfolio.
We have momentum, and we're continuing to transform across multiple dimensions and throughout our entire organization. And I'm confident we'll use this quarter as a catalyst for growth into fiscal '19 and beyond.
Thanks, and now here's Andy."

Fiscal year '18 was a strategically significant year for NIKE. As we began the fiscal year last June, we communicated our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense, which we believe would ignite NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable profitable growth and transform the company in the process. Then, at our Investor Day this past October, we showcased how our new strategy was already beginning to come to life. We displayed the pipeline of innovative products that we plan to bring to market in the second half of fiscal year '18 on our path to 2X Innovation. We immersed our stakeholders in the relaunch of our NIKE and SNKRS App experiences and the new membership services that would ignite 2X Direct. And we shared several of the manufacturing and supply chain initiatives that will help 2x our speed and ultimately cut our time to market in half.
Of course, we also established a new long-term financial model. But perhaps even more notable than the financial goals we established were some of the key operational measures of success that we shared. Those measures of success better define how we will transform NIKE into a digitally led enterprise that connects more directly with our consumers globally through our key cities and countries.
And as we now close Q4, we are thrilled to see our strategic execution translating into strong financial performance as both revenue growth and profitability exceeded even our own expectations. At the same time, what's even more exciting is that we also delivered across all of our key operational measures of success, and it's worth highlighting a few examples as these are proof points that NIKE's strategic transformation is underway at an accelerated pace.
So first, we said that new innovation platforms will drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fiscal year '18, revenue from new innovative platforms actually drove over 80% of our incremental growth, fueled by innovative new platforms such as the Air VaporMax, React, the Air Max 270 and ZoomX. We also said that we would 2X Direct with digital commerce growth both owned and partnered comprising over 50% of NIKE's total company growth over the next 5 years. In fiscal year '18, NIKE Direct, in fact, drove over 90% of our growth, and 100% of our growth was driven by the combination of NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE Consumer Experiences.
NIKE Digital, in particular, grew 34% in Q4 on a constant currency basis and was the single fastest growing channel globally. Yet, for many of the hottest styles launched on NIKE Digital platforms within the quarter, our supply was only a fraction of the actual demand we experienced. This underscores a significant opportunity to better sense and serve digital demand in fiscal year '19.
We also said in October that we expect our international geographies to drive over 75% of our growth and that North America would return to mid-single-digit growth over the next 5 years. For the full year, our international geographies accounted for over 100% of our growth with Greater China growing nearly 2x the rate of any other geography on a currency-neutral basis. And in Q4, North America returned to growth, sharply reversing its prior trend. As Mark said, as we enter fiscal year '19, we are now running a more complete offense across our global portfolio.
But before I go deeper into our outlook for fiscal year '19, let's first reflect on the drivers of our strong Q4 results.  NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 13%, up 8% on a currency-neutral basis driven by double-digit international growth and a return to growth in North America. NIKE Direct led our growth globally, including 5% comp store growth and 34% digital growth. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $36.4 billion, up 4% on a currency-neutral basis.
Gross margin expanded over 60 basis points in Q4, exceeding our own expectations due to accelerating full-price sales and NIKE Digital growth. For the full year, gross margin contracted just under 80 basis points as strong underlying product profitability was more than offset by a 90 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25%, primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham and the NBA; brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup; and global campaigns supporting the launch of new product innovations. For the full year, demand creation increased 7%. Operating overhead increased 14% for the quarter and 10% for the full year as we're investing in capabilities that will fuel long-term growth, particularly with respect to digital and innovation.
Our effective tax rate was 6.4% for the quarter and 55.3% for the full year. The full year rate was significantly higher than the prior year, primarily due to the onetime transition tax associated with U.S. tax reform. Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 15% to $0.69. Full year diluted EPS declined 53% to $1.17, taking into account the significant onetime impacts of U.S. tax reform. As of May 31, inventories were up 4%, growing slower than the rate of revenue growth, which is an indication that our supply and demand management efforts over the course of fiscal year '18 have returned NIKE to a strong pull market globally.
Finally, today, we're announcing a new 4-year $15 billion share repurchase program. We anticipate that our current $12 billion share repurchase program will be completed within fiscal year '19. This new expanded authorization, coupled with our dividend program, are evidence of NIKE's strong cash flow generation and steadily increasing cash returns to shareholders.
Now let's turn to the financial performance for a few of our reported operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and currency-neutral basis, led by new innovation platforms, very strong digital growth, continued momentum in Sportswear and broad growth across apparel. We've returned North America to revenue growth and expanding margins, and this healthy momentum is carrying forward into this new fiscal year.
As we expected, digital continues to reshape the consumer experience and to some extent, disrupt the more undifferentiated multi-brand wholesale dimensions of the marketplace. However, NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, both owned and partnered, and particularly those that leverage a digital connection to the consumer, drove over 2/3 of our growth in North America.
Digital connections have been critical to launching new and innovative products, creating brand heat and better serving consumer demand. For example, as part of the Epic React launch, through social media, we invited our consumers to Choose Go. The Choose Go campaign inspired more than 1 million NIKE+ members to participate in a run on the NIKE Running Club (sic) [ Run Club ] app that day and generated over 500 million social media impressions. We also launched an exclusive colorway of the Epic React with DICK'S Sporting Goods through a takeover of their digital commerce platform and social media channels. And as Mark detailed, we're in the process of launching the NIKE App at Retail in key markets, bringing NIKE+ membership into the store and accelerating the convergence of digital and physical retail.
As for the Jordan Brand in North America, we are already back to a pull market and we expect a return to global growth in fiscal year '19. Consumers love the Jordan Brand, and their passion for the brand is unwavering. At the same time, we saw an opportunity to recalibrate the supply of select styles across just distribution channels. While that included tightening the supply in some cases, it also included expanding the supply of the hottest, most iconic Jordan styles on the Nike SNKRS App, which has fast become the leading destination for high heat footwear launches globally.
We also leveraged both Jordan and NIKE launches on the SNKRS App to create compelling new consumer experiences that merged digital and physical with our strategic retail partners, for example, through initiatives such as Shock Drop, SNKRS Pass and SNKRS Stash. Looking forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue diversifying the Jordan Brand for women in performance and through apparel.
For the full year, North America's revenue declined 2% and EBIT was 7% lower. However, our Q4 results in North America reflect a reversal of trend and sustainable momentum going into fiscal year '19.
Moving to EMEA, where revenues grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis in Q4, driven by strong global growth -- driven by strong growth in Global Football, Sportswear and Running. Our apparel business is also particularly strong across Europe with Global Football apparel approaching triple-digit growth in Q4 fueled by high-energy national team collections associated with the World Cup. In footwear, Air Max continues to be the dominant platform in the region with the Air Max 270 becoming the #1 style across key European markets and Air Max Month in March propelling Sportswear to record full year revenues.
The NIKE Brand is also #1 in all of our key cities across Europe, fueled by campaigns such as Nothing Beats a Londoner that amplified the authentic voice of over 200 London consumers, along with influencers such as Skepta and several of the world's greatest athletes, including Mo Farah, Harry Kane and others. This is a great example of a hyperlocal city campaign that resonated with our consumers globally.
While NIKE Direct continues to lead all dimensions of growth in EMEA, JD, for example, has also been a very strategic partner for NIKE. JD continues to leverage digital connections with consumers and differentiated store concepts, including size, to both create and serve demand, and we look forward to the best practices that they will bring to the North American marketplace.
For the full year, currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%, fueled by double-digit growth in Sportswear and across apparel. On a reported basis, fiscal year '18 revenues grew 16% and EBIT increased 5% as strong revenue growth was offset primarily by transactional FX headwinds on gross margin.
So next, let's turn to Greater China. In Q4, Greater China's growth accelerated to 25% on a currency-neutral basis, including strong double-digit growth across all categories, the Jordan Brand and across our women's business. NIKE Digital growth continues to outpace all other marketplace dimensions, and we continue to partner with and learn from China's leading digital platforms. Through our partnership with Tmall, our first ever Air Max Super Brand Day in March, became our largest day on the platform, second only to Singles' Day for the year. And with Tencent, we launched our Choose Go campaign through digital media, inspiring 2 million runners to participate in a 7-week running journey and creating strong demand for the Epic React.
For the full year, revenues in Greater China increased 18% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by Running, Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Nike Basketball. On a reported basis, fiscal year '18 revenues were up 21% and EBIT increased 20%.
There are several drivers of the extraordinary long-term growth potential we see in Greater China from favorable macroeconomics to the rise of sport and fitness, to the scale and impact of digital, to the strength of the NIKE Brand. Accordingly, we will continue to invest to extend our leadership in this strategically important and fast-growing market.
In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across all key countries within this diverse geography and is being fueled by our focus on creating brand energy in key cities and through digital. In fact, while NIKE Digital growth was strong in every geography, APLA's digital growth led the pack. In addition to strong NIKE Direct digital growth, growth through new entrepreneurial digital partners also accelerated. Looking forward, we will continue to drive digital momentum by scaling the NIKE and SNKRS Apps across key countries within APLA while also continuing to explore and scale these digital partnerships.
For the full fiscal year, revenue increased 10% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced growth across all categories, including the Jordan Brand and our women's business. On a reported basis, full year revenues for the fiscal year increased 9%, while EBIT was up 21%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
And finally, at Converse, revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal year '18 and declined 14% in the fourth quarter. Contraction was primarily driven by the decision to rightsize wholesale distribution in North America and EMEA. At the same time, Converse Direct grew double digits in Q4, including strong double-digit growth in digital for the full year with acceleration in Q4. On a reported basis, full year revenues were down 8% and EBIT declined 35%.
As we move into fiscal year '19, we are reigniting energy in the Converse brand and diversifying Converse's product portfolio both through Converse's authentic positioning in sport and through new sportswear styles and collaborations.  In fiscal year '19, Converse will also launch a more direct, branded and immersive digital experience to drive closer connections between the Converse brand and its passionate consumers.
Fiscal year '19 will be the first full year of execution against NIKE's Consumer Direct Offense and the long-term financial goals that we detailed at our Investor Day. As we are now deeper into the execution of our new offense, it is becoming increasingly clear that digital is transforming how we operate and will favorably reshape our economic model over the long term. Digital is inflecting our revenue growth and has a favorable mix impact on our gross margin as we capture more of the value that we are creating for consumers. And as for SG&A, we will continue to accelerate investments in scalable digital experiences and capabilities, building both organically and through acquisitions. At the same time, we're already seeing how upfront investment in experiences, like the NIKE and SNKRS Apps; and in capabilities, such as a data and analytics, can be efficiently leveraged globally to better serve our consumers across our key markets. Finally, digital also creates the potential for win-win economic models with our wholesale partners over time as they transform their retail experiences to serve the next generation of digitally native consumers.
Taking all of these dynamics into account, we are updating our guidance for fiscal year '19. As of our last earnings call, we expected mid- to high single-digit revenue growth in fiscal year '19. As we now close Q4, our expectations for revenue growth in fiscal year '19 have moved up slightly, entering the high single-digit range. This improved outlook takes into account building consumer demand for NIKE. However, we are also mindful of renewed FX volatility and the strengthening dollar of late. As for gross margin, we now expect expansion of roughly 50 basis points or slightly greater, fueled by strong full-price sales, expanding average selling prices and growth in our NIKE Direct businesses, partially offset by higher input costs.
As for SG&A, we will continue to prioritize investments in new digital consumer experiences and capabilities, in product innovation and in brand marketing. As such, in fiscal year '19, we expect SG&A to grow roughly in the same range as revenue growth. We're not targeting SG&A leverage in fiscal year '19. We are capturing productivity gains within SG&A, but we will use that incremental capacity to invest strategically for the long term.
As for other expense net of interest expense, we expect roughly $125 million to $150 million of expense for the full year. We see our effective tax rate being in the mid-teens range or potentially slightly higher for the full year. It's important to note that our tax rate will continue to be volatile based upon the full implementation and further guidance with respect to U.S. tax reform. Variation in our mix of earnings geographically will also have an impact as will the impact of stock-based compensation and other discrete items.
Our focus will remain on driving strategic transformation and delivering strong growth over the long term, more so than on the results in any individual quarter. That said, for some additional context as we enter the fiscal year, we expect the same level of revenue growth in Q1 as we do for the full year. We also expect less gross margin expansion in the first half as compared to the second half of the year. And finally, as for SG&A, our investments will be more front loaded towards the first half of the fiscal year, driven by key consumer and sports moments such as the World Cup.
The Consumer Direct Offense is transforming how we operate at NIKE and how we will create value for shareholders going forward. More specifically, digital is proving to be as transformative as we expected and potentially even more so. We still have much work to do ahead of us to realize the full potential of our new office -- offense. That said, it is clear, as we accelerate in fiscal year '19, that we have now ignited NIKE's next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

And so we don't typically provide geographical specific guidance certainly by quarter or for the full year. But I would say that we have momentum going into the year, and that's really primarily fueled by new innovation platforms that we're scaling; NIKE Direct; certainly NIKE Digital, which accelerated to well over 30% growth driven by strong results on SNKRS and through membership. And then I'd note that, importantly, we've returned North America to a healthy pull market. Inventory is clean, up only 2%. Full-price sales are accelerating. Off-price sales are declining, and gross margins are expanding. So we do see a strong momentum, sustainable momentum going into fiscal year '19, but we aren't providing specific guidance by line item by geography."

I will -- I'll start with your question around the impact of digital. It's a great question and a timely question. As we -- as both Mark and I detailed, we saw acceleration in digital that, quite frankly, exceeded even our own expectations. It wasn'",430,"Sure. I will -- I'll start with your question around the impact of digital. It's a great question and a timely question. As we -- as both Mark and I detailed, we saw acceleration in digital that, quite frankly, exceeded even our own expectations. It wasn't by accident. We've certainly been investing both organically in digital experiences, such as some of the experiences we've shared with respect to our membership initiatives as well as in capabilities. You've heard us refer to our acquisitions of Virgin Mega, Invertex and Zodiac over time. And so that acceleration is definitely a result of the investment. In terms of our evolving view of the impact of digital on our economic model or how we create value for shareholders, we do see digital being a platform that helps us better optimize supply and demand. We obviously get a very direct read and signals from consumers in terms of which products they are most interested in, and that ultimately helps us amplify revenue growth through full-price sales. When we're leveraging digital in a more direct way, we obviously capture more of that revenue at the retail price. When we are leveraging digital with our partners, we do see a benefit from full-price sales and a win-win relationship with our partners. Digital commerce also has margins that are favorable from a mix perspective relative to our traditional wholesale bricks-and-mortar business. From an SG&A perspective, I would suggest there are 2 ways to look at it. One is short, medium and long term, and then the other one is specifically more in the shorter term. I think short, medium and long term, what we're finding is that the capabilities or experiences we're building in digital are very scalable, and they're scalable in an efficient way. You think about creating experiences around the SNKRS or NIKE Apps, and to the extent we have success in the market where we launch that, we're then able to take that investment we've already made and leverage it in markets around the world. And we're certainly seeing that, for example, with the SNKRS App, which is #1 in Japan in terms of free applications. We've seen millions of downloads of that app since launch in China, leveraging a lot of that upfront initial investment. So we think it's a source of leverage, at the same time, because we're focused on the long term and we do think digital has the ability to really inflect our value creation, we're accelerating the investments that we're making in digital now to accelerate us down that path."

I think the underlying health of the business for NIKE in Europe is actually quite strong beyond what we're seeing in the World Cup, and again, I think that's both in footwear and apparel. Similarly, to the North America, we have a clean marketplace. We're seeing growing full-price sales. We're outpacing the marketplace overall. It's the same dynamics. New product innovation is resonating, especially in the -- some of the key styles we mentioned like the Air Max franchise, the Air Max 270, the VaporMax. We're editing our product mix. We're creating more choice but focusing on key products, and that's really helping to drive our strength in the marketplace. I think the focus, too, on the key cities with hyperlocal products, and a lot of it's fueled by our Express Lane, is really clicking into gear in Europe. So we are overindexing in Europe. And again, beyond the World Cup, we expect that to continue."

You know that our long-term financial model is to deliver as much as 50 basis points of expansion, and we have updated that outlook to be 50 basis points or slightly greater. That's led by stronger full-price selling as well as over indexing growth in our higher-margin NIKE Direct businesses. While FX headwinds are now behind us, we're not forecasting significant FX tailwinds based on current rates. And based on FX volatility being renewed of late, we're being measured in that regard even as we look out to the second half of the year. We are forecasting, as you noted, a bit of pressure on gross margin from select input cost headwinds within labor, oil, freight, materials. And then I should note that our margins -- within our margins, different than many of our peers, we capture a significant portion of our supply chain cost, where some of our peers capture those costs in SG&A.

As you put it, I think you said it was a nice problem to have. We see it as a great opportunity to really serve the consumers who have extraordinary demand for that product better. So frankly, along the lines of the notion of 2X Speed, we're attacking that opportunity with a lot of urgency not just because it is a revenue upside potential driver, which it certainly is. As I said, the supply that we had against some of the demand we saw on some of the hottest styles was, as I said, but a fraction of that demand. We also see it as a great opportunity to both serve in terms of the product they want but also connect in a deeper way with those passionate consumers, many call them sneakerheads, who have chosen to connect with us as members on the NIKE App and SNKRS. In terms of 2X Speed, I think maybe even elevating, as Mark said, the digital transformation at NIKE is really an end-to-end notion. And when we think about demand sensing, the greatest opportunity we have is to sense the demand and even in a more nuanced way, the signals and the preferences from the consumers that we're connecting with directly on SNKRS. We use things like notify me initiatives, draws, preorders, and we're coming up increasingly with even more creative ways to get a sense for how robust the demand is, either for specific products or for types of products that we may be planning to bring to market."

Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1, that momentum continued at the strong pace.

Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1, that momentum continued at the strong pace. We're capitalizing on the opportunities we see in the near term, and we're diving deeper into the areas that will widen NIKE's advantages over the long term.
Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we're taking a winning formula and executing it across our complete portfolio and is leading to the balanced growth that you see today. For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include double-digit growth in our international geographies and 6% growth in North America. NIKE Digital is leading the way for differentiated retail, up 36% for the quarter. And we saw acceleration in both our Sportswear and performance businesses. While this quarter's success was broad based and we're pleased with our momentum, we know we have even more opportunities ahead. As we've described before, a key focus that will create separation for NIKE over the long term is our digital transformation. Ultimately, it's about becoming more personal at scale. And put simply, it's how digital is accelerating each of our triple-double pillars, and that's how we create through 2X Innovation, how we connect through 2X Direct and how we serve through 2X Speed. So let's look at the quarter to each of these lenses.
The success we're seeing today starts with great products. It's ultimately where the consumer cast their vote. Our innovation platforms are building a foundation for growth over many years. As the pace of our consumers shift faster, strong platforms allow us to continually bring fresh products to market while extending our storytelling and investments. We're seeing it with Nike Air and React. Consumers are drawn to their comfort and performance, and they're asking for more style options. VaporMax and 270 are both proving there is still vast growth potential in Nike Air as we develop more comfort innovation in new forms.
This spring, we're taking the exaggerated air you see in the Air Max 270 and going a step further with the introduction of the Air Max 720. This new platform is engineered for maximum comfort cradling the entire foot. And the Air Max 27 -- or 720 is distinctly NIKE, and we'll deliver it to consumers in early 2019.
Nike React is a great example of how we've capitalized on the appeal of performance innovation and immediately scaled it into Sportswear. The React Element 87 is considered one of the industry's top new designs, and we've applied the comfort of React cushioning to more performance and Lifestyle shoes at several price points.
ZoomX continues to power the world's fastest runners, including Eliud Kipchoge during his epic world-record smashing run at the Berlin Marathon this month. This quarter, we took the magic of the Vaporfly 4% and merged it with an iconic running shoe creating Peg Turbo. The launch has created incredible energy for the whole Pegasus franchise and help -- our overall writing business to sell growth this quarter.
One of our most versatile endeavor advancing platforms is Flyknit. Through digital knitting, we can now place breathability, stretch and support exactly where we need it. In Basketball, for example, the KD 11 and the LeBron 16 each leverage specific yarns and different knit structures to match individual athlete needs. The LeBron 16 with its Battle Knit 2.0 has had a great early read with consumers both men and women.
As part of the broader commitment to scale sustainable platforms, we're expanding Nike Flyleather through iconic styles like the Air Force 1, the Cortez and the Air Max 95. Flyleather is a super material that looks and feels like premium leather but is lighter, more durable and more sustainable. It uses at least 50% reclaimed leather and helps eliminate waste.
And in the coming year, for the first time ever, NIKE will bring digitally powered adjustable footwear to professional sports. Building on the auto leasing platform from HyperAdapt, this breakthrough creates a custom fit. We have a group of elite athletes on campus this summer for an intense wear test. And their feedback was that they've never felt more secure or more in control of their movement. This next-generation, adaptable innovation will set the standard for optimal fit, and will offer it at more accessible price points and in greater quantities.
In addition to platforms, we're executing the fundamentals across our categories at a high level right now. We know that it's newness and freshness that wins with the consumer today. So with our Edit to Amplify approach, we're providing deeper assortment and greater options of our top sellers. Our footwear Power Franchises, for example, consistently outperform our overall footwear sell-through.
Apparel, too, continued its momentum with 11% growth driven by fleece, tops and bottoms, jackets and pants. We delivered a number of Sportswear apparel collections over the last 90 days, like the City Ready and the Metallic Sheen collections in women's and NIKE sport and tech packs and ACG. We'll continue on this path and extend into performance because selections give consumers more complete looks, and allow for better merchandising and storytelling. 
Overall with apparel, in our categories, we saw a consistent sell-through of our Football national teams collections drafting off the energy we created from the World Cup, where we had our first all NIKE men's final. The growth in our women's apparel business was led by Sportswear and sports bras, where our strategy to blend style and comfort is working. And in Nike Basketball apparel, we're capturing the excitement for LeBron's move to the Lakers. As you'll see in just a few weeks, we're bringing more creative designs with the NBA city jerseys this year.
When we look across our complete portfolio of products, we still see areas with significant upside. We've talked before about the opportunity in women's, in Young Athletes and Jordan, delivering innovation and fresh product in these areas brings balance to our portfolio. A strong roster of core footwear and entry price points is equally important to NIKE's overall growth potential. We're not yet where we want to be in sports footwear particularly in North America but 2 priorities for the business are: to develop innovation specifically for the core consumer, and to better leverage Pinnacle performance platforms like Nike Air in this zone.
Another product strategy that's driving incredible energy is our ability to create unique intersections between sport and style across our brands. A few examples over this past quarter include the on and off core collaboration between Serena and Virgil Abloh for the U.S. Open. Converse's limited edition Chuck Taylor's and One Star with creative partners in fashion and music; and our first Jordan Brand Football kit with PSG. 
As I've said before, it's not lifestyle versus performance or fashion versus sport, the consumer continues to be inspired by seeing those worlds come together. Overall, 2X Innovation is at the heart of our continued momentum right now. We have versatile platforms, we're mixing sport and style in unexpected ways and we have a deep lineup across our product portfolio that's creating value across all dimensions of our business. 
And while our product innovation is fueling demand, our 2X Direct strategy is driving new ways to connect with our consumers. It's building confidence in our vision for smart retail, where we remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. 2X Direct is in the early stages and it's already creating an impact, resulting in strong growth and margin expansion for our NIKE Direct channels.
We continue to see unprecedented demand for our highest -- product through our SNKRS App, which has become the world's #1 footwear shopping app. And we'll continue to expand the reach of SNKRS launching in Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia next quarter. 
The Nike Live retail concept we unveiled with our Melrose store in L.A. was incredibly successful this quarter. The premise behind the concept is to create a live and ever-changing experience. We're testing a number of new features, including product assortments that update frequently based on what's trending with the local consumer. A service that allows consumers to reserve an item on our apps and then pick it up curbside or in the store from a personal smart locker. And through Swish Techs, our store athletes, can now provide expert advice for consumers after they've left the store. 
And what we're learning in Melrose, we're bringing to 2 new flagship stores in our 2 most important key cities: New York and Shanghai, this next quarter. Both will be the culmination of all we've learned about personalized and experiential shopping over the last several years. There'll be incurred incredible showcases for the NIKE Brand.
Our obsession with the store experience is also paying off with top strategic partners. While retail consolidation has not finished its course in North America, our growing NIKE Consumer Experiences with Foot Locker, Nordstrom's and other key partners are already driving higher growth rates as compared to non-differentiated doors. We're equally energized by the momentum we are building new digital commerce partners. We just moved from a pilot stage to a fully operational program with Flipkart in India. And 2 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Jet.com to sell selected assortments of both NIKE and Converse in key cities in North America. With Jet, we're partnering to develop consumer insights and create a better branded experience on their platform. 
And we're doing the same with our key partners in China. This quarter, we made it possible to combine NikePlus member accounts to Tmall accounts. We're seeing impressive increase in new members in China as a result. And lastly, we launched a partnership with WeChat, making 1 billion monthly active users just 1 click away from becoming a not NikePlus member.
Ultimately, companies will be judged on their ability to be more personal with our consumers at scale. And NIKE's taking the lead on this promise leveraging more insights from all over the world and reshaping the shopping experience through smart retail.
To make that a reality, we're unlocking opportunities to quickly and seamlessly design, manufacture and deliver our products to consumers through 2X Speed. We're sharpening our sensing capabilities and developing fully responsive product manufacturing. We're actively building a portfolio of innovation and automation that impacts the entire spectrum of our process. Our goals are ambitious, and we have high standards. Our vision is to leverage automation to deliver amazing, innovative products faster and more responsibly while being more sustainable and cost-efficient. And we've had some great success. 
For example, we invented a plant assembly process for offers in our Advanced Product Creation Center at our world headquarters using 30% fewer steps and 50% less labor. We tested this process with our partners, including Flex, and in our Asia store space as well. Transforming traditional footwear manufacturing is a significant undertaking. We've learned a lot and are building you high-impact capabilities, yet we continue to face specific challenges together with our partners, including Flex, where the goal has been to deliver responsive, automated, close to market manufacturing of high-quality products at scale. This is a dynamic process and we're continually assessing and refining the best path forward. Leveraging our breakthroughs in areas like rapid prototyping, 3D and digital printing and new methods of make, all in service of cutting the overall product creation cycle in half.
Another key initiative accelerating on toward that goal is the Express Lane, which continues to be the engine that's creating the most agility in our supply chain right now. We're driving double-digit growth in many of our key cities and through the Express Lane as we capitalize on the local energy for key icons like the Cortez and sports moments like the World Cup. With this end-to-end view, our entire value chain we're delivering our right product to the right consumer in the right moment, and across product lines through our geos and with our partners around the world, we're relentlessly driving speed at a scale that is creating impact for our business.
We're off to a great start in Q1, managing the dynamic environment. More importantly, we're setting a new foundation for long-term, sustainable growth for years to come. Thanks, and now here is Andy."
291981,579140597,1561163,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 25, 2018",2018-09-25,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We're extremely pleased with the quality of the growth that we delivered in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we are delivering stronger, more broad-based momentum around the world",2648,"Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We're extremely pleased with the quality of the growth that we delivered in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we are delivering stronger, more broad-based momentum around the world than the expectations we set entering the fiscal year. We had continued strong growth in international markets, led by Greater China, growing at 20%; and our international growth is now being amplified by very strong, sustainable growth in North America.
As for the quality of our growth, our momentum continues to be directly tied to execution of the Consumer Direct Offense and more specifically, the Triple Double. First take, for example, our 2X Direct initiative. 2X Direct is about connecting the NIKE Brand more directly to our consumers. And today, the most direct connection to the consumer is through the mobile device in the palm of their hand. In Q1, we continued to enhance and expand our NIKE Digital ecosystem, leading with mobile, and the result was 36% NIKE Digital growth. NIKE Digital was once again our fastest-growing channel in each and every geography.
Now while NIKE Digital is leading the way, we believe physical retail will also play an important role in doubling our direct connection to consumers. We see growth in the physical environment being driven by smarter retail, experiences that leverage digital technologies to better serve consumers. In Q1, our vision for physical retail became more tangible. We continue to rollout what we're calling the Nike App at Retail, starting with our own in-line stores, and we also launched the new concept called Nike Live. The Nike Live concept came to life in Q1 through the opening of Nike by Melrose in Los Angeles. Nike Live leverages our NikePlus membership platform and other digitally enabled services to provide a truly differentiated consumer experience at retail. The results to date have been phenomenal. For example, at Nike by Melrose, the conversion of in-store shoppers into digital Nike+ members is 6x higher than in the rest of our fleet. As consumers seek to gain the full benefits associated with being more directly connected to NIKE.
Our approach has been to test, learn and then scale new concepts such as these. Accordingly, we're now in the process of scaling these new concepts across our fleet of owned stores and these tangible proof points are also accelerating new concept development with our strategic wholesale partners.
2X Innovation is another key pillar within the Consumer Direct Offense that is fueling our broad-based momentum. Suffice it to say that our recently launched innovation platforms, VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX, have already generated in aggregate over $2 billion in revenue at retail. Further, these platforms are driving brand distinction and catalyzing growth across our broader product portfolio in both performance and Sportswear. For example, as Mark noted, the new innovation we are bringing to the Nike Air franchise has ignited double-digit growth across our multibillion-dollar family of Nike Air products. 
Newness and innovation are also favorably impacting our gross margin as our full price sell-through is significantly outpacing off-price sales. Our current inventory levels are also tight in relation to this strong demand that we're creating.
Underlying our strategic momentum is the digital transformation of NIKE that Mark mentioned. A year ago, we aligned our teams around the world on our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. Over the past year, we've been ramping up investment in the new digital capabilities that will reshape how we operated NIKE for the long term. Our investments in new digital capabilities are coming in the form of both organic development and acquisition. As we closed fiscal year '18, we announced the acquisitions of Zodiac and Invertex, both of which are already having a profound impact on how we better serve consumers. Another acquisition that we made back in fiscal year '17 was Virgin Mega. That team has now become known as Studio 23, a digital hub in New York that's driving the explosive growth of the SNKRS App.
Within fiscal year '19, we're also investing significantly in the organic development of new capabilities, including: digital demand sensing; consumer data and analytics; connected inventory; digital product design and creation; a digital content engine; and a new enterprise resource platform that will help unlock speed and flexibility in our supply chain.
As our long-term financial model implies, we believe that NIKE's unrivaled scale and resources afford us the ability to over index on investment in these differentiating capabilities while still delivering expanding profitability over the 5-year horizon.
Execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is clearly beginning to transform NIKE's business model and how we will create value for shareholders over the long term. So let's recap our Q1 results in a bit more detail with a focus on how strategic execution is the driving force behind our current financial performance.
NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Our stronger-than-projected currency-neutral growth was driven by acceleration in North America and continued strong momentum in international markets, albeit slightly offset by FFX dynamics within the quarter. Our growth across geographies was led by NIKE Direct, with NIKE Direct growing 12% and NIKE Digital growing 34% on a currency-neutral basis.
The impact of innovation, NIKE Digital growth outpacing all other channels and our tighter supply and demand management also fueled roughly 50 basis points of NIKE, Inc. gross margin expansion in Q1. 
Demand creation grew 13% in the first quarter, primarily driven by sports marketing investments as well as brand campaigns that amplify key moments in sports such as the World Cup. Operating overhead increased 5%, driven by investments in digital capabilities as well as in our supply chain and enterprise technology platforms.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14%, which reflects the implementation of U.S. tax reform. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67. Finally, as of August 31, inventories were flat to prior year, primarily driven by a strong pull market across all geographies, coupled with the efforts we have taken over the past year to rightsize supply.
So now let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, we have returned to strong sustainable growth. Q1 revenue grew 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis led by accelerating growth across both footwear and apparel, driven by new innovation platforms as well as strong owned and partnered digital growth. Wholesale has also returned to growth, yet we see even greater opportunity to drive differentiation across the wholesale marketplace going forward, in part by leveraging our learnings from the Nike App at Retail and Nike by Melrose.
Another growth opportunity we see ahead of us in North America relates to the Jordan Brand. In the second half of fiscal year '18, we tightened supply. We also reset our approach to Jordan Retro, creating more current stories and collaborations with respect to Jordan's most iconic styles. We're now bringing those icons to life in more compelling ways for the new generation of Jordan consumers and as a result, the Jordan Brand is back to a pull market. We're also beginning to have greater momentum to the Jordan Brand. For example for women, we're extending sizes in the icons we know they already love and also created silhouettes and new collaborations made specifically for her. Apparel and performance basketball also represents significant growth opportunities going forward.
As the football and basketball seasons ramp-up, our brand momentum will continue to build in North America. At the same time, we're not taking that momentum for granted. We continue to identify and attack opportunities to elevate our game and drive strong, sustainable growth in this important geography.
So now let's turn to the EMEA. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in Sportswear and healthy growth in Running and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all the dimensions of the marketplace growing at a strong double-digit rate. One of the underlying drivers of our sustained growth in EMEA is the strength of our brand across this diverse geography. EMEA is home to 5 of our 12 key global cities, and in all 5 of those key cities in EMEA, NIKE is rated #1 by consumers and our growth is over indexing the broader market. 
By connecting more deeply with consumers in key influential cities, and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, NIKE is creating increasingly greater distinction as a brand in Europe. One of those sports moments was the incredibly exciting World Cup, in which both of the finalists were NIKE teams. And soon after the World Cup final, we launched our Awaken the Phantom campaign, generating over 50 million views in the first 2 weeks and driving strong sell-through on the launch of our newest Global Football franchise, the Phantom. And finally, after celebrating the French national team's World Cup victory, we continue to bring energy to Global Football with the launch of a Jordan-branded Paris Saint-Germain team kit and collection of apparel. That launch has been phenomenal, with the key styles selling out immediately.
While NIKE has become the leading brand in EMEA, we are far from having achieved our full potential. We see the opportunity to both grow the markets for athletic footwear and apparel across Europe and also create even greater separation from the competition as a brand. That is why we believe we can sustain this strong growth in EMEA over the long term.
Next, let's turn to Greater China, another geography in which the NIKE Brand continues to lead and sustain strong growth. We now delivered 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China's growth was 20% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by Sportswear, Jordan, Basketball and across women's and Young Athletes. Growth was also strong in balance across both footwear and apparel. We are winning with the Chinese consumer, first and foremost through the key cities of Shanghai and Beijing. We're also continually innovating in this large, digitally native marketplace. NIKE Digital growth remains strong and actually accelerated in Q1. We're also driving growth through our partnerships with China's leading digital platforms like Tmall and WeChat.
And finally, we're beginning to leverage digital in the largely NIKE-branded physical retail environment in China. Take, for example, our partner ByLee, which was acquired last year by Hillhouse, a leading firm in technology and consumer services. ByLee has already rolled out connected inventory that enables a more direct, NIKE Consumer Experiences with a faster and easier way to fulfill consumer demand, fully leveraging their roughly 2,500 touch points.
Now let's turn from China to another fast-growing and fast-developing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel and led by Japan, Mexico and Korea. Two areas of increasing focus for us in APLA had been our women's business and digital. Women's growth continues to accelerate, driven by distinctive brand marketing campaigns such as the Come Out Enforce and Rally Cry campaigns, focused on inspiring and empowering women through sport. 
NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA, with revenue growing over 70% in Q1, the highest rate of growth across all of our geographies as we continue expanding our digital ecosystem across this region. We will continue to sustain strong growth as we roll out the Nike SNKRS App in markets such as Mexico and Brazil, and bring the Nike Live retail concept to Tokyo later this fiscal year.
Beyond NIKE Direct, we're also expanding our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through entrepreneurial commerce partnerships such as those with Flipkart, ZOZOTOWN and several others. We see continued momentum in APLA over the course of fiscal year '19, and we will continue to invest in the fast-growing diverse geography as we move even those are to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. 
And finally, at Converse, revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth digitally. That said, Converse also experienced declines in undifferentiated wholesale primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. As we move through fiscal year '19, we will be expanding Converse's product portfolio while also elevating the Converse-branded digital ecosystem.
We are off to an even stronger start to the fiscal year than we initially expected. Our currency-neutral growth and profitability is exceeding our expectations. At the same time, global trade uncertainty and geopolitical dynamics have resulted in the dollar strengthening and foreign exchange shifting to a slight headwind over the past 90 days. Taking into account all of these dynamics, we are maintaining our full year guidance for fiscal year '19. Specifically, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, albeit at the lower end of that range as operational upside will likely be somewhat offset by FX headwinds. We expect gross margin to expand 50 basis points or slightly greater; SG&A to grow in the high single digits; and our effective tax rate to be in the midteens. Other expense, net of interest expense, is now projected to be in expense of $100 million to $125 million.
Based on the FX volatility of late, let me briefly explain more specifically how FX impact NIKE's financials in the short term. First, it is important to note that the revenue line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. Therefore, our reported real-dollar revenue growth reflects nearly all currency movements real-time. We do have a robust hedging program that delays the impact of FX on our profitability for 12 to as much as 24 months, most notably with respect to developed market currencies, for example, the euro. However, it is not economical to hedge FX risk in many emerging markets such as Turkey, Argentina and Brazil. And as for China, we're able to partially but not fully hedge our net exposure.
Our focus is on sustaining strong, currency-neutral operating momentum over the full year and even more importantly, over the longer term, so I'll provide a bit of context on Q2. For Q2, we expect strong currency-neutral revenue growth in line with the 9% currency-neutral revenue growth we delivered in Q1. That said, taking into account real-time FX dynamics, reported real-dollar revenue growth for Q2 is likely to be 2 to 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth. For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion approaching the same level of expansion that we delivered in Q1. As a reminder, we expect less gross margin expansion in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year. In Q2, we expect SG&A growth in the low teens driven by the timing of our investments in sports marketing, including the kickoff of the NBA and NFL seasons and the timing of strategic investment in new digital capabilities. For other expense net of interest expense, we expect expense in Q2 to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is creating brand distinction with consumers around the world and driving strong financial performance. At the same time, we see ourselves as being in the early stages of this transformation. There is no finish line for NIKE, particularly as it relates to digital. So we will continue to invest in the capabilities that will differentiate and create competitive advantage for NIKE long term. Those capabilities include product innovation, brand marketing, digital and speed within our supply chain.
We are thrilled with our momentum out of the gate in fiscal year '19. And nonetheless, we remain on the offense, identifying and attacking opportunities to elevate our game, building our momentum with consumers and ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

We're in the early stages of some of the more truly transformational change.

In our in-line stories, we're actually seeing strong comps as well. We've seen traffic up and even more notably, conversion. And conversion in the in-line stories we're seeing is a direct result of 2 things. One, the brand distinction that Mark mentioned in response to the last question as well as the product that we're bringing to market. We're seeing incredibly strong full price sell-through on our line right now. Our closed-out mix is down in inventory and our off-price sales are down as a percent of total. In our factory stores, our factory stores continue to be a very profitable dimension of the business. And frankly, the only challenge I'd really highlight in our factory stores is that its full price sell-through is so strong in in-line and digitally, it leaves some gaps in terms of the assortment that we bring to market in the short term and our factory stores. But we've identified opportunities in that regard and are looking at supply to fill those gaps. So again, it's a nice problem to have."

In the first half of the year, there's 1 element of material, so to speak, that is a bit of a headwind and that's in the chemical space, namely rubber. That will ease in the second half of the year. As we look at FX as well. FX is much more of a tailwind in the margin line item of our P&L in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year.

I mean, I mentioned Air, React, Zoom, there's ZoomX, there's still a tremendous amount of potential to leverage those both in performance across categories and then also across Sportswear.

We -- our goals for North America are long-term focus. It's a large, important geography. And as you may recall at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth over the next 5 years. As we innovate within the marketplace from a digital perspective and transform the broader retail landscape, on that note we said there might be some disruption in the short term as well. So to some extent, we hedged a little bit with respect to fiscal year '19. To be clear, we returned to strong growth in North America even faster than what we had expected. We have demand that is outstripping supply. You saw our inventory in North America was flat. And so what we're focused on, and we're always focused on you can rest assured, is capitalizing on every opportunity that we see to serve demand in the North America marketplace. We're not providing specific guidance from a geo perspective. But I will tell you that the brand is incredibly strong, our product's resonating, sell-through is strong. And even beyond what's working and what you can see in our numbers, we see opportunity to go beyond that and potentially, even more importantly, drive that sustainable growth over that 5-year horizon. And those opportunities fall under the overall umbrella of what Mark often refers to is our complete offense. At any given time, even when we have extraordinary momentum, there is underneath that umbrella where we see greater opportunity than we're capitalizing on. Specifically in North America, I touched on Jordan. We see acceleration in Jordan over the coming months and certainly out of this fiscal year and into next year. Women's is growing strong. Women's was a very strong dimension of growth for us as a company, but we see even more opportunity. It's not so much about the rate of growth, it's how much more opportunity is out there in the women's business, especially around athletic footwear and apparel. And then finally, another dimension of huge opportunity in North America is our Young Athletes business. It may surprise some people to know that it's one of our largest categories. At the same time, we see the opportunity to bring new materials, colors, prints and even designs directly targeted at Young Athletes. We have a silhouette called the Future series, which is actually and innovation that's made specifically for kids. So we do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in North America. Suffice it to say, we're really pleased with the momentum we have and we're bullish on being able to sustain growth in North America in fiscal year '19 and beyond. And then you also asked about global growth. You made a comment that said it's pretty consistent. I just want to be clear. On a currency-neutral basis, our momentum on the top line from a revenue perspective is stronger globally than we expected when we came into the year. While we maintained our high single-digit reported revenue growth guidance, that takes into account that over the last 90 days since we last spoke to you, FX has been pretty volatile. And as I touched on that line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. So while we protect the profitability through hedging, we see those impacts real time, and that's also why I gave you a little bit more color on Q2 guidance."

So taking that insight and designing and creating product leveraging digital technology that allows us to bring that insight to life in a product faster. And then absolutely we're using data in our supply chain to tighten our demand and supply management. And you see that already beginning to impact our full price versus off-price sell-through. On the very front end, of course, from a consumer perspective, data and analytics helps us personalize the consumer experience on the Nike app as well as the SNKRS App. And even in our physical retail environments as we use things like the things like the Nike App at Retail. And in that regard, one of the most notable successes or pilots early on has been connected inventory. So using RFID and using data and analytics in terms of where inventory is and where our consumers are looking to buy to get them the product they want more seamlessly. And then as for your second question, you asked about Jet.com and how that might compared to some of our other partnerships. And I'll say that Mark will probably want to add something here. We're excited about this partnership with Jet because it is a partnership that is really about creating a compelling consumer experience around the NIKE Brand, leveraging Nike membership to help better serve consumers in that channel, helping ensure that there's a clean assortment of product that's presented to that consumer across the marketplace. So there are several aspects of it that we view as distinctive in terms of the offering that will make to consumers. At the same time, it's one of several initiatives across a range of digital commerce platforms."

And I'll just add, on Jet, we're starting off with a more focused highlight as we look at offering a select amount of product in key cities across North America.

We're looking at our digital partners to help cocreate elevated consumer experiences and how they partner with NIKE. And so we can work together on advancing our connection to consumers through digital commerce. We are looking at how we partner with these digital platforms to advance the consumer connection in terms of product selection, in terms of personal service, in terms of the -- how the brand is presented online. And we're optimistic and feel very strong that the relationship with Jet.com is going to offer us of those opportunities, so we're excited about that. Amazon, our business with Amazon is performing well. Not a huge update here, other than we've seen really good sell-through on a limited selection of products that we've offered. We've said before that we want to work together to elevate the consumer experience, and that's important in any digital partnership that we enter into. We get the most out of our relationship when we work together to elevate that brand presentation. And one of the things we're going to continue to focus on is how we share data with our digital partners to advance that consumer experience. But we feel like the partnership with Amazon is working or moving towards a mutually beneficial space. So we're actually feeling good about where we are, and it's important that we stay focused and continue to look for those opportunities together."

Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1, that momentum continued at a strong pace. We're capitalizing on the opportunities we see in the near term, and we're divin",2056,"Thanks, Nitesh, and hello, and good afternoon, everyone. Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1, that momentum continued at a strong pace. We're capitalizing on the opportunities we see in the near term, and we're diving deeper into the areas that will widen NIKE's advantages over the long term.
Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we're taking a winning formula and executing it across our complete portfolio and is leading to the balanced growth that you see today. For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include double-digit growth in our international geographies and 6% growth in North America. NIKE Digital is leading the way for differentiated retail, up 36% for the quarter. And we saw acceleration in both our Sportswear and performance businesses. While this quarter's success was broad based and we're pleased with our momentum, we know we have even more opportunities ahead. As we've described before, a key focus that will create separation for NIKE over the long term is our digital transformation. Ultimately, it's about becoming more personal at scale. And put simply, it's how digital is accelerating each of our triple-double pillars, and that's how we create through 2X Innovation, how we connect through 2X Direct and how we serve through 2X Speed. So let's look at the quarter through each of these lenses.
The success we're seeing today starts with great products. It's ultimately where the consumer cast their vote. Our innovation platforms are building a foundation for growth over many years. As the pace of our consumers shift faster, strong platforms allow us to continually bring fresh products to market while extending our storytelling and investments. We're seeing it with Nike Air and React. Consumers are drawn to their comfort and performance, and they're asking for more style options. VaporMax and 270 are both proving there is still vast growth potential in Nike Air as we develop more comfort innovation in new forms.
This spring, we're taking the exaggerated air you see in the Air Max 270 and going a step further with the introduction of the Air Max 720. This new platform is engineered for maximum comfort, cradling the entire foot. And the Air Max 27 -- or 720 is distinctly NIKE, and we'll deliver it to consumers in early 2019.
Nike React is a great example of how we've capitalized on the appeal of performance innovation and immediately scaled it into Sportswear. The React Element 87 is considered one of the industry's top new designs, and we've applied the comfort of React cushioning to more performance and lifestyle shoes at several price points.
ZoomX continues to power the world's fastest runners, including Eliud Kipchoge during his epic world-record smashing run at the Berlin Marathon this month. This quarter, we took the magic of the Vaporfly 4% and merged it with an iconic running shoe, creating the Peg Turbo. The launch has created incredible energy for the whole Pegasus franchise and helped lead our overall running business to solid growth this quarter.
One of our most versatile and ever advancing platforms is Flyknit. Through digital knitting, we can now place breathability, stretch and support exactly where we need it. In Basketball, for example, the KD 11 and the LeBron 16 each leverage specific yarns and different knit structures to match individual athlete needs. The LeBron 16 with its Battle Knit 2.0 has had a great early read with consumers, both men and women.
As part of our broader commitment to scale sustainable platforms, we're expanding Nike Flyleather through iconic styles like the Air Force 1, Cortez and the Air Max 95. Flyleather is a super material that looks and feels like premium leather but is lighter, more durable and more sustainable. It uses at least 50% reclaimed leather and helps eliminate waste.
And in the coming year, for the first time ever, NIKE will bring digitally powered adjustable footwear to professional sports. Building on the auto leasing platform from HyperAdapt, this breakthrough creates a custom fit. We had a group of elite athletes on campus this summer for an intense wear test, and their feedback was that they'd never felt more secure or more in control of their movement. This next-generation, adaptable innovation will set the standard for optimal fit, and we'll offer it at more accessible price points and in greater quantities.
In addition to platforms, we're executing the fundamentals across our categories at a high level right now. We know that it's newness and freshness that wins with the consumer today. So with our Edit to Amplify approach, we're providing deeper assortments and greater options of our top sellers. Our footwear Power Franchises, for example, consistently outperform our overall footwear sell-through.
Apparel, too, continued its momentum with 11% growth driven by fleece, tops and bottoms, jackets and pants. We delivered a number of Sportswear apparel collections over the last 90 days, like the City Ready and the Metallic Sheen collections in women's and NIKE Sport and Tech Packs and ACG. We'll continue on this path and extend into performance because collections give consumers more complete looks and allow for better merchandising and storytelling. 
Overall with apparel, in our categories, we saw a consistent sell-through of our Football national teams collections drafting off the energy we created from the World Cup, where we had our first all NIKE men's final. The growth in our women's apparel business was led by Sportswear and sports bras, where our strategy to blend style and comfort is working. And in Nike Basketball apparel, we're capturing the excitement for LeBron's move to the Lakers. As you'll see in just a few weeks, we're bringing more creative designs with the NBA city jerseys this year.
When we look across our complete portfolio of products, we still see areas with significant upside. We've talked before about the opportunity in women's, in Young Athletes and Jordan. Delivering innovation and fresh product in these areas brings balance to our portfolio. A strong roster of core footwear at entry price points is equally important to NIKE's overall growth potential. We're not yet where we want to be in sports footwear particularly in North America but 2 priorities for the business are: to develop innovation specifically for the core consumer and to better leverage Pinnacle performance platforms like Nike Air in this zone.
Another product strategy that's driving incredible energy is our ability to create unique intersections between sport and style across our brands. A few examples over this past quarter include: the on and off court collaboration between Serena and Virgil Abloh for the U.S. Open; Converse's limited edition Chuck Taylor's and One Star with creative partners in fashion and music; and our first Jordan Brand Football kit with PSG. 
As I've said before, it's not lifestyle versus performance or fashion versus sport, the consumer continues to be inspired by seeing those worlds come together. Overall, 2X Innovation is at the heart of our continued momentum right now. We have versatile platforms. We're mixing sport and style in unexpected ways, and we have a deep lineup across our product portfolio that's creating value across all dimensions of our business. 
And while our product innovation is fueling demand, our 2X Direct strategy is driving new ways to connect with our consumers. It's building confidence in our vision for smart retail, where we remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. 2X Direct is in the early stages, and it's already creating an impact, resulting in strong growth and margin expansion for our NIKE Direct channels.
We continue to see unprecedented demand for our highest heat products through our SNKRS App, which has become the world's #1 footwear shopping app. And we'll continue to expand the reach of SNKRS, launching in Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia next quarter. 
The Nike Live retail concept we unveiled with our Melrose store in L.A. was incredibly successful this quarter. The premise behind the concept is to create a live and ever-changing experience. We're testing a number of new features, including: product assortments that update frequently based on what's trending with the local consumer; a service that allows consumers to reserve an item on our apps and then pick it up curbside or in the store from a personal smart locker; and through [ Swoosh text ], our store athletes can now provide expert advice for consumers after they've left the store. 
And what we're learning in Melrose, we're bringing to 2 new flagship stores in our 2 most important key cities, New York and Shanghai, this next quarter. Both will be the culmination of all we've learned about personalized and experiential shopping over the last several years. There'll be incredible showcases for the NIKE Brand.
Our obsession with the store experience is also paying off with top strategic partners. While retail consolidation has not finished its course in North America, our growing NIKE Consumer Experiences with Foot Locker, Nordstrom and other key partners are already driving higher growth rates as compared to nondifferentiated doors. We're equally energized by the momentum we're building with new digital commerce partners. We just moved from a pilot stage to a fully operational program with Flipkart in India. And 2 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Jet.com to sell selected assortments of both NIKE and Converse in key cities in North America. With Jet, we're partnering to develop consumer insights and create a better branded experience on their platform. 
And we're doing the same with our key partners in China. This quarter, we made it possible to combine NikePlus member accounts to Tmall accounts. We're seeing an impressive increase in new members in China as a result. And last week, we launched a partnership with WeChat, making 1 billion monthly active users just 1 click away from becoming a NikePlus member.
Ultimately, companies will be judged on their ability to be more personal with their consumers at scale. And NIKE's taking the lead on this promise, leveraging more insights from all over the world and reshaping the shopping experience through smart retail.
To make that a reality, we're unlocking opportunities to quickly and seamlessly design, manufacture and deliver our products to consumers through 2X Speed. We're sharpening our sensing capabilities and developing fully responsive product manufacturing. We're actively building a portfolio of innovation and automation that impacts the entire spectrum of our process. Our goals are ambitious, and we have high standards. Our vision is to leverage automation to deliver amazing, innovative products faster and more responsibly while being more sustainable and cost-efficient. And we've had some great success. 
For example, we invented a plant assembly process for offers in our Advanced Product Creation Center at our world headquarters using 30% fewer steps and 50% less labor. We tested this process with our partners, including Flex, and in our Asia store space as well. Transforming traditional footwear manufacturing is a significant undertaking. We've learned a lot and are building new high-impact capabilities, yet we continue to face specific challenges together with our partners, including Flex, where the goal has been to deliver responsive, automated, close-to-market manufacturing of high-quality products at scale. This is a dynamic process, and we're continually assessing and refining the best path forward, leveraging our breakthroughs in areas like rapid prototyping, 3D and digital printing and new methods of make, all in service of cutting the overall product creation cycle in half.
Another key initiative accelerating us towards that goal is the Express Lane, which continues to be the engine that's creating the most agility in our supply chain right now. We're driving double-digit growth in many of our key cities through the Express Lane as we capitalize on the local energy for key icons like the Cortez and sports moments like the World Cup. With this end-to-end view, our entire value chain, we're delivering the right product to the right consumer in the right moment. And across product lines, throughout geos and with our partners around the world, we're relentlessly driving speed at a scale that is creating impact for our business.
We're off to a great start in Q1, managing the dynamic environment. More importantly, we're setting a new foundation for long-term, sustainable growth for years to come. Thanks, and now here is Andy."

We are extremely pleased with the quality of the growth that we delivered in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we are delivering stronger, more broad-based momentum around the world than the expectations we set entering the fiscal year. We had continued strong growth in international markets, led by Greater China growing at 20%, and our international growth is now being amplified by very strong, sustainable growth in North America.
As for the quality of our growth, our momentum continues to be directly tied to execution of the Consumer Direct Offense and more specifically, the Triple Double. First, take for example our 2X Direct initiative. 2X Direct is about connecting the NIKE Brand more directly to our consumers. And today, the most direct connection to the consumer is through the mobile device in the palm of their hand. In Q1, we continued to enhance and expand our NIKE Digital ecosystem, leading with mobile, and the result was 36% NIKE Digital growth. NIKE Digital was once again our fastest-growing channel in each and every geography.
Now while NIKE Digital is leading the way, we believe physical retail will also play an important role in doubling our direct connection to consumers. We see growth in the physical environment being driven by smarter retail, experiences that leverage digital technology to better serve consumers. In Q1, our vision for physical retail became more tangible. We continued to roll out what we're calling the Nike App at Retail, starting with our own in-line stores, and we also launched the new concept called Nike Live. The Nike Live concept came to life in Q1 through the opening of Nike by Melrose in Los Angeles. Nike Live leverages our NikePlus membership platform and other digitally enabled services to provide a truly differentiated consumer experience at retail. The results to date have been phenomenal. For example, at Nike by Melrose, the conversion of in-store shoppers into digital NikePlus members is 6x higher than in the rest of our fleet as consumers seek to gain the full benefits associated with being more directly connected to NIKE.
Our approach has been to test, learn and then scale new concepts such as these. Accordingly, we're now in the process of scaling these new concepts across our fleet of owned stores, and these tangible proof points are also accelerating new concept development with our strategic wholesale partners.
2X Innovation is another key pillar within the Consumer Direct Offense that is fueling our broad-based momentum. Suffice it to say that our recently launched innovation platforms, VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX, have already generated in aggregate over $2 billion in revenue at retail. Further, these platforms are driving brand distinction and catalyzing growth across our broader product portfolio in both performance and Sportswear. For example, as Mark noted, the new innovation we are bringing to the Nike Air franchise has ignited double-digit growth across our multibillion-dollar family of Nike Air products. 
Newness and innovation are also favorably impacting our gross margin as our full price sell-through is significantly outpacing off-price sales. Our current inventory levels are also tight in relation to this strong demand that we're creating.
Underlying our strategic momentum is the digital transformation of NIKE that Mark mentioned. A year ago, we aligned our teams around the world on our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. Over the past year, we've been ramping up investment in the new digital capabilities that will reshape how we operated NIKE for the long term. Our investments in new digital capabilities are coming in the form of both organic development and acquisition. As we closed fiscal year '18, we announced the acquisitions of Zodiac and Invertex, both of which are already having a profound impact on how we better serve consumers. Another acquisition that we made back in fiscal year '17 was Virgin Mega. That team has now become known as Studio 23 (sic) [ s23NYC ], a digital hub in New York that's driving the explosive growth of the SNKRS App.
Within fiscal year '19, we're also investing significantly in the organic development of new capabilities including: digital demand sensing; consumer data and analytics; connected inventory; digital product design and creation; a digital content engine; and a new enterprise resource platform that will help unlock speed and flexibility in our supply chain.
As our long-term financial model implies, we believe that NIKE's unrivaled scale and resources afford us the ability to over index on investment in these differentiating capabilities while still delivering expanding profitability over the 5-year horizon.
Execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is clearly beginning to transform NIKE's business model and how we will create value for shareholders over the long term. So let's recap our Q1 results in a bit more detail with a focus on how strategic execution is the driving force behind our current financial performance.
NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Our stronger-than-projected currency-neutral growth was driven by acceleration in North America and continued strong momentum in international markets, albeit slightly offset by FX dynamics within the quarter. Our growth across geographies was led by NIKE Direct, with NIKE Direct growing 12% and NIKE Digital growing 34% on a currency-neutral basis.
The impact of innovation, NIKE Digital growth outpacing all other channels and our tighter supply and demand management also fueled roughly 50 basis points of NIKE, Inc. gross margin expansion in Q1. 
Demand creation grew 13% in the first quarter, primarily driven by sports marketing investments as well as brand campaigns that amplify key moments in sports such as the World Cup. Operating overhead increased 5%, driven by investments in digital capabilities as well as in our supply chain and enterprise technology platforms.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14%, which reflects the implementation of U.S. tax reform. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67. Finally, as of August 31, inventories were flat to prior year, primarily driven by a strong pull market across all geographies, coupled with the efforts we have taken over the past year to rightsize supply.
So now let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, we have returned to strong, sustainable growth. Q1 revenue grew 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by accelerating growth across both footwear and apparel, driven by new innovation platforms as well as strong owned and partnered digital growth. Wholesale has also returned to growth, yet we see even greater opportunity to drive differentiation across the wholesale marketplace going forward, in part by leveraging our learnings from the Nike App at Retail and Nike by Melrose.
Another growth opportunity we see ahead of us in North America relates to the Jordan Brand. In the second half of fiscal year '18, we tightened supply. We also reset our approach to Jordan Retro, creating more current stories and collaborations with respect to Jordan's most iconic styles. We're now bringing those icons to life in more compelling ways for the new generation of Jordan consumers, and as a result, the Jordan Brand is back to a pull market. We're also beginning to have greater dimension for the Jordan Brand. For example for women, we're extending sizes in the icons we know they already love and also creating silhouettes and new collaborations made specifically for her. Apparel and performance basketball also represents significant growth opportunities going forward.
As the football and basketball seasons ramp up, our brand momentum will continue to build in North America. At the same time, we're not taking that momentum for granted. We continue to identify and attack opportunities to elevate our game and drive strong, sustainable growth in this important geography.
So now let's turn to EMEA. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in Sportswear and healthy growth in Running and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all the dimensions of the marketplace, growing at a strong double-digit rate. One of the underlying drivers of our sustained growth in EMEA is the strength of our brand across this diverse geography. EMEA is home to 5 of our 12 key global cities, and in all 5 of those key cities in EMEA, NIKE is rated #1 by consumers, and our growth is over indexing the broader market. 
By connecting more deeply with consumers in key influential cities and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, NIKE is creating increasingly greater distinction as a brand in Europe. One of those sports moments was the incredibly exciting World Cup, in which both of the finalists were NIKE teams. And soon after the World Cup final, we launched our Awaken the Phantom campaign, generating over 50 million views in the first 2 weeks and driving strong sell-through on the launch of our newest Global Football franchise, the Phantom. And finally, after celebrating the French national team's World Cup victory, we continue to bring energy to Global Football with the launch of a Jordan-branded Paris Saint-Germain team kit and collection of apparel. That launch has been phenomenal, with the key styles selling out immediately.
While NIKE has become the leading brand in EMEA, we are far from having achieved our full potential. We see the opportunity to both grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel across Europe and also create even greater separation from the competition as a brand. That is why we believe we can sustain this strong growth in EMEA over the long term.
Next, let's turn to Greater China, another geography in which the NIKE Brand continues to lead and sustain strong growth. We've now delivered 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China's growth was 20% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by Sportswear, Jordan, Basketball and across women's and Young Athletes. Growth was also strong in balance across both footwear and apparel. We are winning with the Chinese consumer, first and foremost through the key cities of Shanghai and Beijing. We're also continually innovating in this large, digitally native marketplace. NIKE Digital growth remains strong and actually accelerated in Q1. We're also driving growth through our partnerships with China's leading digital platforms like Tmall and WeChat.
And finally, we're beginning to leverage digital in the largely NIKE-branded physical retail environment in China. Take for example our partner Belle, which was acquired last year by Hillhouse, a leading firm in technology and consumer services. Belle has already rolled out connected inventory that enables a more direct NIKE consumer experience with a faster and easier way to fulfill consumer demand, fully leveraging their roughly 2,500 touch points.
Now let's turn from China to another fast-growing and fast-developing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel and led by Japan, Mexico and Korea. Two areas of increasing focus for us in APLA had been our women's business and digital. Women's growth continues to accelerate, driven by distinctive brand marketing campaigns such as the Come Out in Force and Rally Cry campaigns, focused on inspiring and empowering women through sport. 
NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA, with revenue growing over 70% in Q1, the highest rate of growth across all of our geographies as we continue expanding our digital ecosystem across this region. We will continue to sustain strong growth as we roll out the Nike SNKRS App in markets such as Mexico and Brazil and bring the Nike Live retail concept to Tokyo later this fiscal year.
Beyond NIKE Direct, we're also expanding our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through entrepreneurial commerce partnerships such as those with Flipkart, ZOZOTOWN and several others. We see continued momentum in APLA over the course of fiscal year '19, and we will continue to invest in this fast-growing, diverse geography as we move even closer to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.
And finally, at Converse, revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth digitally. That said, Converse also experienced declines in undifferentiated wholesale, primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. As we move through fiscal year '19, we will be expanding Converse's product portfolio while also elevating the Converse-branded digital ecosystem.
We are off to an even stronger start to the fiscal year than we initially expected. Our currency-neutral growth and profitability is exceeding our expectations. At the same time, global trade uncertainty and geopolitical dynamics have resulted in the dollar strengthening and foreign exchange shifting to a slight headwind over the past 90 days.
Taking into account all of these dynamics, we are maintaining our full year guidance for fiscal year '19. Specifically, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, albeit at the lower end of that range as operational upside will likely be somewhat offset by FX headwinds. We expect gross margin to expand 50 basis points or slightly greater, SG&A to grow in the high single digits and our effective tax rate to be in the midteens. Other expense, net of interest expense, is now projected to be an expense of $100 million to $125 million.
Based on the FX volatility of late, let me briefly explain more specifically how FX impacts NIKE's financials in the short term. First, it is important to note that the revenue line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. Therefore, our reported real-dollar revenue growth reflects nearly all currency movements real time. We do have a robust hedging program that delays the impact of FX on our profitability for 12 to as much as 24 months, most notably with respect to developed market currencies, for example, the euro. However, it is not economical to hedge FX risks in many emerging markets such as Turkey, Argentina and Brazil. And as for China, we're able to partially but not fully hedge our net exposure.
Our focus is on sustaining strong, currency-neutral operating momentum over the full year and even more importantly, over the longer term. But I'll provide a bit of context on Q2. For Q2, we expect strong, currency-neutral revenue growth in line with the 9% currency-neutral revenue growth we delivered in Q1.
That said, taking into account real-time FX dynamics, reported real-dollar revenue growth for Q2 is likely to be 2 to 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth. For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion approaching the same level of expansion that we delivered in Q1. As a reminder, we expect less gross margin expansion in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year.
In Q2, we expect SG&A growth in the low teens driven by the timing of our investments in sports marketing, including the kickoff of the NBA and NFL seasons and the timing of strategic investment in new digital capabilities. For other expense net of interest expense, we expect expense in Q2 to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is creating brand distinction with consumers around the world and driving strong financial performance. At the same time, we see ourselves as being in the early stages of this transformation. There is no finish line for NIKE, particularly as it relates to digital. So we will continue to invest in the capabilities that will differentiate and create competitive advantage for NIKE long term. Those capabilities include product innovation, brand marketing, digital and speed within our supply chain.
We are thrilled with our momentum out of the gate in fiscal year '19. And nonetheless, we remain on the offense, identifying and attacking opportunities to elevate our game, build on our momentum with consumers and ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

And I'm sorry, Kate, as for undifferentiated retail, as I mentioned, we're seeing growth across all dimensions of the marketplace. We have had relatively strong growth with our strategic wholesale partners being Footlocker, Finish Line, DICK'S and others. That's being driven by the elevation of the consumer experience with those partners and also by the extraordinary impact of the new innovation and newness that we're bringing to our product portfolio. We're in the early stages of some of the more truly transformational change.

In our in-line stories, we're actually seeing strong comps as well. We've seen traffic up and even more notably, conversion. And conversion in the in-line stories we're seeing is a direct result of 2 things: one, the brand distinction that Mark mentioned in response to the last question as well as the product that we're bringing to market. We're seeing incredibly strong full price sell-through on our line right now. Our close-out mix is down in inventory and our off-price sales are down as a percent of total. In our factory stores, our factory stores continue to be a very profitable dimension of the business. And frankly, the only challenge I would really highlight in our factory stores is that its full price sell-through is so strong in in-line and digitally, it leaves some gaps in terms of the assortment that we bring to market in the short term in our factory stores. But we've identified opportunities in that regard and are looking at supply to fill those gaps. So again, it's a nice problem to have."

We're seeing strong structural improvement in our margins, and that's being driven by the innovation we're bringing to market and in turn, the strong full price versus off-price mix. Second, it's being driven by the over-indexing growth in our NIKE Digital business. And it's also being amplified by the initiatives that we have around product cost management. In the first half of the year, there's one element of material, so to speak, that is a bit of a headwind. And that's in the chemical space, namely rubber. That will ease in the second half of the year. As we look at FX as well, FX is much more of a tailwind in the margin line item of our P&L in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. So if I refer back to the guidance that we gave as we entered the year and we reiterated today, we have strong gross margin expansion forecast for the entire fiscal year. At the same time, we see slightly less margin expansion in the first half and more margin expansion in the second half."

We have an incredible lineup coming, I think, throughout the fiscal year of products. We're actually focusing on bringing innovation into the core price points as well. So we have a balanced portfolio of innovation across both footwear and apparel. And then we have opportunity to further dimensionalize the incredible platforms that we've got. I mean, I mentioned Air, React, Zoom. There's ZoomX. There's still a tremendous amount of potential to leverage those both in performance across categories and then also across Sportswear. And then I have to tell you, I can't really shed too much light on this at this stage but -- my excitement around what's coming as we, believe it or not, ramp up our portfolio around the Tokyo Olympics.

And as you may recall at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid-single-digit revenue",578,"Sure. Thanks for the compliment, Paul. I'll take that one. We -- our goals for North America are long term focused. It's a large, important geography. And as you may recall at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth over the next 5 years. As we innovate within the marketplace from a digital perspective and transform the broader retail landscape, on that note we said there might be some disruption in the short term as well. So to some extent, we hedged a little bit with respect to fiscal year '19. To be clear, we returned to strong growth in North America even faster than what we had expected. We have demand that is outstripping supply. You saw our inventory in North America was flat. And so what we're focused on, and we're always focused on you can rest assured, is capitalizing on every opportunity that we see to serve demand in the North America marketplace. We're not providing specific guidance from a geo perspective. But I will tell you that the brand is incredibly strong. Our product is resonating. Sell-through is strong. And even beyond what's working and what you can see in our numbers, we see opportunity to go beyond that and potentially, even more importantly, drive that sustainable growth over that 5-year horizon. And those opportunities fall under the overall umbrella of what Mark often refers to as our complete offense. At any given time, even when we have extraordinary momentum, that area is underneath that umbrella where we see greater opportunity than we're capitalizing on. Specifically in North America, I touched on Jordan. We see acceleration in Jordan over the coming months and certainly out of this fiscal year and into next year. Women's is growing strong. Women's was a very strong dimension of growth for us as a company, but we see even more opportunity. It's not so much about the rate of growth. It's how much more opportunity is out there in the women's business, especially around athletic footwear and apparel. And then finally, another dimension of huge opportunity in North America is our Young Athletes business. It may surprise some people to know that it's one of our largest categories. At the same time, we see the opportunity to bring new materials, colors, prints and even designs directly targeted at Young Athletes. We have a silhouette called the Future Series, which is actually an innovation that's made specifically for kids. So we do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in North America. Suffice it to say, we're really pleased with the momentum we have, and we're bullish on being able to sustain growth in North America in fiscal year '19 and beyond. And then you also asked about global growth. You made a comment that said it's pretty consistent. I just want to be clear. On a currency-neutral basis, our momentum on the top line from a revenue perspective is stronger globally than we expected when we came into the year. While we maintained our high single-digit reported revenue growth guidance, that takes into account that over the last 90 days since we last spoke to you, FX has been pretty volatile. And as I touched on, that line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. So while we protect the profitability through hedging, we see those impacts real time, and that's also why I gave you a little bit more color on Q2 guidance."

It starts with consumer data and analysis around consumer data. And I'd say that is manifesting itself right now, already, and most importantly, in terms of digital demand sensing, us continuing to leverage the intuition that we have but amplifying that intuition with real data as to what consumers' preferences are. And one of the best examples is Nike by Melrose. That store, that Nike Live store in Los Angeles, the entire assortment is based on data that we're analyzing around what consumers in those ZIP Codes have purchased and are interested in and some of the key themes. You move from digital demand sensing to digital product creation. So taking that insight and designing and creating product, leveraging digital technology that allows us to bring that insight to life in a product faster. And then absolutely, we're using data in our supply chain to tighten our demand and supply management. And you see that already beginning to impact our full price versus off-price sell-through. On the very front end, of course, from a consumer perspective, data and analytics helps us personalize the consumer experience on the Nike app as well as the SNKRS App and even in our physical retail environments as we use things like the things like the Nike App at Retail. And in that regard, one of the most notable successes or pilots early on has been connected inventory. So using RFID and using data and analytics in terms of where inventory is and where our consumers are looking to buy to get them the product they want more seamlessly. And then as for your second question, you asked about Jet.com and how that might compare to some of our other partnerships. And I'll say that Mark will probably want to add something here. We're excited about this partnership with Jet because it is a partnership that is really about creating a compelling consumer experience around the NIKE Brand, leveraging Nike membership to help better serve consumers in that channel, helping ensure that there's a clean assortment of product that's presented to that consumer across the marketplace.

Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1, that momentum continued at a strong pace.

Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1, that momentum continued at a strong pace. We're capitalizing on the opportunities we see in the near term, and we're diving deeper into the areas that will widen NIKE's advantages over the long term.
Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we're taking a winning formula and executing it across our complete portfolio and it's leading to the balanced growth that you see today. For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include double-digit growth in our international geographies and 6% growth in North America. NIKE Digital is leading the way for differentiated retail, up 36% for the quarter. And we saw acceleration in both our Sportswear and performance businesses. While this quarter's success was broad based and we're pleased with our momentum, we know we have even more opportunities ahead. As we've described before, a key focus that will create separation for NIKE over the long term is our digital transformation. Ultimately, it's about becoming more personal at scale. And put simply, it's how digital is accelerating each of our triple-double pillars, and that's how we create through 2X Innovation, how we connect through 2X Direct and how we serve through 2X Speed. So let's look at the quarter through each of these lenses.
The success we're seeing today starts with great products. It's ultimately where the consumer cast their vote. Our innovation platforms are building a foundation for growth over many years. As the taste of our consumers shift faster, strong platforms allow us to continually bring fresh products to market while extending our storytelling and investments. We're seeing it with Nike Air and React. Consumers are drawn to their comfort and performance, and they're asking for more style options. VaporMax and 270 are both proving there is still vast growth potential in Nike Air as we develop more comfort innovation in new forms.
This spring, we're taking the exaggerated air you see in the Air Max 270 and going a step further with the introduction of the Air Max 720. This new platform is engineered for maximum comfort, cradling the entire foot. And the Air Max 27 -- or 720 is distinctly NIKE, and we'll deliver it to consumers in early 2019.
Nike React is a great example of how we've capitalized on the appeal of performance innovation and immediately scaled it into Sportswear. The React Element 87 is considered one of the industry's top new designs, and we've applied the comfort of React cushioning to more performance and lifestyle shoes at several price points.
ZoomX continues to power the world's fastest runners, including Eliud Kipchoge during his epic world-record smashing run at the Berlin Marathon this month. This quarter, we took the magic of the Vaporfly 4% and merged it with an iconic running shoe, creating the Peg Turbo. The launch has created incredible energy for the whole Pegasus franchise and helped lead our overall running business to solid growth this quarter.
One of our most versatile and ever advancing platforms is Flyknit. Through digital knitting, we can now place breathability, stretch and support exactly where we need it. In Basketball, for example, the KD 11 and the LeBron 16 each leverage specific yarns and different knit structures to match individual athlete needs. The LeBron 16 with its Battle Knit 2.0 has had a great early read with consumers, both men and women.
As part of our broader commitment to scale sustainable platforms, we're expanding Nike Flyleather through iconic styles like the Air Force 1, the Cortez and the Air Max 95. Flyleather is a super material that looks and feels like premium leather but is lighter, more durable and more sustainable. It uses at least 50% reclaimed leather and helps eliminate waste.
And in the coming year, for the first time ever, NIKE will bring digitally powered adjustable footwear to professional sports. Building on the auto-lacing platform from HyperAdapt, this breakthrough creates a custom fit. We had a group of elite athletes on campus this summer for an intense wear test, and their feedback was that they'd never felt more secure or more in control of their movement. This next-generation, adaptable innovation will set the standard for optimal fit, and we'll offer it at more accessible price points and in greater quantities.
In addition to platforms, we're executing the fundamentals across our categories at a high level right now. We know that it's newness and freshness that wins with the consumer today. So with our Edit to Amplify approach, we're providing deeper assortments and greater options of our top sellers. Our footwear Power Franchises, for example, consistently outperform our overall footwear sell-through.
Apparel, too, continued its momentum with 11% growth driven by fleece, tops and bottoms, jackets and pants. We delivered a number of Sportswear apparel collections over the last 90 days, like the City Ready and the Metallic Sheen collections in women's and NIKE Sport and Tech Packs and ACG. We'll continue on this path and extend into performance because collections give consumers more complete looks and allow for better merchandising and storytelling. 
Overall with apparel, in our categories, we saw a consistent sell-through of our Football national teams collections drafting off the energy we created from the World Cup, where we had our first all NIKE men's final. The growth in our women's apparel business was led by Sportswear and sports bras, where our strategy to blend style and comfort is working. And in Nike Basketball apparel, we're capturing the excitement for LeBron's move to the Lakers. As you'll see in just a few weeks, we're bringing more creative designs with the NBA city jerseys this year.
When we look across our complete portfolio of products, we still see areas with significant upside. We've talked before about the opportunity in women's, in Young Athletes and Jordan. Delivering innovation and fresh product in these areas brings balance to our portfolio. A strong roster of core footwear at entry price points is equally important to NIKE's overall growth potential. We're not yet where we want to be in [ core ] footwear particularly in North America but 2 priorities for the business are: to develop innovation specifically for the core consumer and to better leverage Pinnacle performance platforms like Nike Air in this zone.
Another product strategy that's driving incredible energy is our ability to create unique intersections between sport and style across our brands. A few examples over this past quarter include: the on and off court collaboration between Serena and Virgil Abloh for the U.S. Open; Converse's limited edition Chuck Taylor's and One Star with creative partners in fashion and music; and our first Jordan Brand Football kit with PSG. 
As I've said before, it's not lifestyle versus performance or fashion versus sport, the consumer continues to be inspired by seeing those worlds come together. Overall, 2X Innovation is at the heart of our continued momentum right now. We have versatile platforms. We're mixing sport and style in unexpected ways, and we have a deep lineup across our product portfolio that's creating value across all dimensions of our business. 
And while our product innovation is fueling demand, our 2X Direct strategy is driving new ways to connect with our consumers. It's building confidence in our vision for smart retail, where we remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. 2X Direct is in the early stages, and it's already creating an impact, resulting in strong growth and margin expansion for our NIKE Direct channels.
We continue to see unprecedented demand for our highest heat products through our SNKRS App, which has become the world's #1 footwear shopping app. And we'll continue to expand the reach of SNKRS, launching in Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia next quarter. 
The Nike Live retail concept we unveiled with our Melrose store in L.A. was incredibly successful this quarter. The premise behind the concept is to create a live and ever-changing experience. We're testing a number of new features, including: product assortments that update frequently based on what's trending with the local consumer; a service that allows consumers to reserve an item on our apps and then pick it up curbside or in the store from a personal smart locker; and through [ Swoosh text ], our store athletes can now provide expert advice for consumers after they've left the store. 
And what we're learning in Melrose, we're bringing to 2 new flagship stores in our 2 most important key cities, New York and Shanghai, this next quarter. Both will be the culmination of all we've learned about personalized and experiential shopping over the last several years. There'll be incredible showcases for the NIKE Brand.
Our obsession with the store experience is also paying off with top strategic partners. While retail consolidation has not finished its course in North America, our growing NIKE Consumer Experiences with Foot Locker, Nordstrom and other key partners are already driving higher growth rates as compared to nondifferentiated doors. We're equally energized by the momentum we're building with new digital commerce partners. We just moved from a pilot stage to a fully operational program with Flipkart in India. And 2 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Jet.com to sell selected assortments of both NIKE and Converse in key cities in North America. With Jet, we're partnering to develop consumer insights and create a better branded experience on their platform. 
And we're doing the same with our key partners in China. This quarter, we made it possible to combine NikePlus member accounts to Tmall accounts. We're seeing an impressive increase in new members in China as a result. And last week, we launched a partnership with WeChat, making 1 billion monthly active users just one click away from becoming a NikePlus member.
Ultimately, companies will be judged on their ability to be more personal with their consumers at scale. And NIKE's taking the lead on this promise, leveraging more insights from all over the world and reshaping the shopping experience through smart retail.
To make that a reality, we're unlocking opportunities to quickly and seamlessly design, manufacture and deliver our products to consumers through 2X Speed. We're sharpening our sensing capabilities and developing fully responsive product manufacturing. We're actively building a portfolio of innovation and automation that impacts the entire spectrum of our process. Our goals are ambitious, and we have high standards. Our vision is to leverage automation to deliver amazing, innovative products faster and more responsibly while being more sustainable and cost-efficient. And we've had some great success. 
For example, we invented a flat assembly process for uppers in our Advanced Product Creation Center at our world headquarters using 30% fewer steps and 50% less labor. We tested this process with our partners, including Flex, and in our Asia store space as well. Transforming traditional footwear manufacturing is a significant undertaking. We've learned a lot and are building new high-impact capabilities, yet we continue to face specific challenges together with our partners, including Flex, where the goal has been to deliver responsive, automated, close-to-market manufacturing of high-quality products at scale. This is a dynamic process, and we're continually assessing and refining the best path forward, leveraging our breakthroughs in areas like rapid prototyping, 3D and digital printing and new methods of make, all in service of cutting the overall product creation cycle in half.
Another key initiative accelerating us towards that goal is the Express Lane, which continues to be the engine that's creating the most agility in our supply chain right now. We're driving double-digit growth in many of our key cities through the Express Lane as we capitalize on the local energy for key icons like the Cortez and sports moments like the World Cup. With this end-to-end view, our entire value chain, we're delivering the right product to the right consumer in the right moment. And across product lines, throughout geos and with our partners around the world, we're relentlessly driving speed at a scale that is creating impact for our business.
We're off to a great start in Q1, managing the dynamic environment. More importantly, we're setting a new foundation for long-term, sustainable growth for years to come. Thanks, and now here is Andy."

We are extremely pleased with the quality of the growth that we delivered in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we are delivering stronger, more broad-based momentum around the world than the expectations we set entering the fiscal year. We have continued strong growth in international markets, led by Greater China growing at 20%, and our international growth is now being amplified by very strong, sustainable growth in North America.
As for the quality of our growth, our momentum continues to be directly tied to execution of the Consumer Direct Offense and more specifically, the Triple Double. First, take for example our 2X Direct initiative. 2X Direct is about connecting the NIKE Brand more directly to our consumers. And today, the most direct connection to the consumer is through the mobile device in the palm of their hand. In Q1, we continued to enhance and expand our NIKE Digital ecosystem, leading with mobile, and the result was 36% NIKE Digital growth. NIKE Digital was once again our fastest-growing channel in each and every geography.
Now while NIKE Digital is leading the way, we believe physical retail will also play an important role in doubling our direct connection to consumers. We see growth in the physical environment being driven by smarter retail, experiences that leverage digital technology to better serve consumers. In Q1, our vision for physical retail became more tangible. We continued to roll out what we're calling the Nike App at Retail, starting with our own in-line stores, and we also launched the new concept called Nike Live. The Nike Live concept came to life in Q1 through the opening of Nike by Melrose in Los Angeles. Nike Live leverages our NikePlus membership platform and other digitally enabled services to provide a truly differentiated consumer experience at retail. The results to date have been phenomenal. For example, at Nike by Melrose, the conversion of in-store shoppers into digital NikePlus members is 6x higher than in the rest of our fleet as consumers seek to gain the full benefits associated with being more directly connected to NIKE.
Our approach has been to test, learn and then scale new concepts such as these. Accordingly, we're now in the process of scaling these new concepts across our fleet of owned stores, and these tangible proof points are also accelerating new concept development with our strategic wholesale partners.
2X Innovation is another key pillar within the Consumer Direct Offense that is fueling our broad-based momentum. Suffice it to say that our recently launched innovation platforms, VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX, have already generated in aggregate over $2 billion in revenue at retail. Further, these platforms are driving brand distinction and catalyzing growth across our broader product portfolio in both performance and Sportswear. For example, as Mark noted, the new innovation we are bringing to the Nike Air franchise has ignited double-digit growth across our multibillion-dollar family of Nike Air products. 
Newness and innovation are also favorably impacting our gross margin as our full price sell-through is significantly outpacing off-price sales. Our current inventory levels are also tight in relation to this strong demand that we're creating.
Underlying our strategic momentum is the digital transformation of NIKE that Mark mentioned. A year ago, we aligned our teams around the world on our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. Over the past year, we've been ramping up investment in the new digital capabilities that will reshape how we operate at NIKE for the long term. Our investments in new digital capabilities are coming in the form of both organic development and acquisition. As we closed fiscal year '18, we announced the acquisitions of Zodiac and Invertex, both of which are already having a profound impact on how we better serve consumers. Another acquisition that we made back in fiscal year '17 was Virgin Mega. That team has now become known as Studio 23 (sic) [ s23NYC ], a digital hub in New York that's driving the explosive growth of the SNKRS App.
Within fiscal year '19, we're also investing significantly in the organic development of new capabilities including: digital demand sensing; consumer data and analytics; connected inventory; digital product design and creation; a digital content engine; and a new enterprise resource platform that will help unlock speed and flexibility in our supply chain.
As our long-term financial model implies, we believe that NIKE's unrivaled scale and resources afford us the ability to over index on investment in these differentiating capabilities while still delivering expanding profitability over the 5-year horizon.
Execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is clearly beginning to transform NIKE's business model and how we will create value for shareholders over the long term. So let's recap our Q1 results in a bit more detail with a focus on how strategic execution is the driving force behind our current financial performance.
NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Our stronger-than-projected currency-neutral growth was driven by acceleration in North America and continued strong momentum in international markets, albeit slightly offset by FX dynamics within the quarter. Our growth across geographies was led by NIKE Direct, with NIKE Direct growing 12% and NIKE Digital growing 34% on a currency-neutral basis.
The impact of innovation, NIKE Digital growth outpacing all other channels and our tighter supply and demand management also fueled roughly 50 basis points of NIKE, Inc. gross margin expansion in Q1. 
Demand creation grew 13% in the first quarter, primarily driven by sports marketing investments as well as brand campaigns that amplify key moments in sport such as the World Cup. Operating overhead increased 5%, driven by investments in digital capabilities as well as in our supply chain and enterprise technology platforms.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14%, which reflects the implementation of U.S. tax reform. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67. Finally, as of August 31, inventories were flat to prior year, primarily driven by a strong pull market across all geographies, coupled with the efforts we have taken over the past year to rightsize supply.
So now let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, we have returned to strong, sustainable growth. Q1 revenue grew 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by accelerating growth across both footwear and apparel, driven by new innovation platforms as well as strong owned and partnered digital growth. Wholesale has also returned to growth, yet we see even greater opportunity to drive differentiation across the wholesale marketplace going forward, in part by leveraging our learnings from the Nike App at Retail and Nike by Melrose.
Another growth opportunity we see ahead of us in North America relates to the Jordan Brand. In the second half of fiscal year '18, we tightened supply. We also reset our approach to Jordan Retro, creating more current stories and collaborations with respect to Jordan's most iconic styles. We're now bringing those icons to life in more compelling ways for the new generation of Jordan consumers, and as a result, the Jordan Brand is back to a pull market. We're also beginning to add greater dimension to the Jordan Brand. For example for women, we're extending sizes in the icons we know they already love and also creating silhouettes and new collaborations made specifically for her. Apparel and performance basketball also represents significant growth opportunities going forward.
As the football and basketball seasons ramp up, our brand momentum will continue to build in North America. At the same time, we're not taking that momentum for granted. We continue to identify and attack opportunities to elevate our game and drive strong, sustainable growth in this important geography.
So now let's turn to EMEA. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in Sportswear and healthy growth in Running and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace, growing at a strong double-digit rate. One of the underlying drivers of our sustained growth in EMEA is the strength of our brand across this diverse geography. EMEA is home to 5 of our 12 key global cities, and in all 5 of those key cities in EMEA, NIKE is rated #1 by consumers, and our growth is over indexing the broader market. 
By connecting more deeply with consumers in key influential cities and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, NIKE is creating increasingly greater distinction as a brand in Europe. One of those sports moments was the incredibly exciting World Cup, in which both of the finalists were NIKE teams. And soon after the World Cup final, we launched our Awaken the Phantom campaign, generating over 50 million views in the first 2 weeks and driving strong sell-through on the launch of our newest Global Football franchise, the Phantom. And finally, after celebrating the French national team's World Cup victory, we continue to bring energy to Global Football with the launch of a Jordan-branded Paris Saint-Germain team kit and collection of apparel. That launch has been phenomenal, with the key styles selling out immediately.
While NIKE has become the leading brand in EMEA, we are far from having achieved our full potential. We see the opportunity to both grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel across Europe and also create even greater separation from the competition as a brand. That is why we believe we can sustain this strong growth in EMEA over the long term.
Next, let's turn to Greater China, another geography in which the NIKE Brand continues to lead and sustain strong growth. We've now delivered 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China's growth was 20% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by Sportswear, Jordan, Basketball and across women's and Young Athletes. Growth was also strong in balance across both footwear and apparel. We are winning with the Chinese consumer, first and foremost through the key cities of Shanghai and Beijing. We're also continually innovating in this large, digitally native marketplace. NIKE Digital growth remains strong and actually accelerated in Q1. We're also driving growth through our partnerships with China's leading digital platforms like Tmall and WeChat.
And finally, we're beginning to leverage digital in the largely NIKE-branded physical retail environment in China. Take for example our partner Belle, which was acquired last year by Hillhouse, a leading firm in technology and consumer services. Belle has already rolled out connected inventory that enables a more direct NIKE consumer experience with a faster and easier way to fulfill consumer demand, fully leveraging their roughly 2,500 touch points.
Now let's turn from China to another fast-growing and fast-developing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel and led by Japan, Mexico and Korea. Two areas of increasing focus for us in APLA have been our women's business and digital. Women's growth continues to accelerate, driven by distinctive brand marketing campaigns such as the Come Out in Force and Rally Cry campaigns, focused on inspiring and empowering women through sport. 
NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA, with revenue growing over 70% in Q1, the highest rate of growth across all of our geographies as we continue expanding our digital ecosystem across this region. We will continue to sustain strong growth as we roll out the Nike SNKRS App in markets such as Mexico and Brazil and bring the Nike Live retail concept to Tokyo later this fiscal year.
Beyond NIKE Direct, we're also expanding our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through entrepreneurial commerce partnerships such as those with Flipkart, ZOZOTOWN and several others. We see continued momentum in APLA over the course of fiscal year '19, and we will continue to invest in this fast-growing, diverse geography as we move even closer to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.
And finally, at Converse, revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth digitally. That said, Converse also experienced declines in undifferentiated wholesale, primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. As we move through fiscal year '19, we will be expanding Converse's product portfolio while also elevating the Converse-branded digital ecosystem.
We are off to an even stronger start to the fiscal year than we initially expected. Our currency-neutral growth and profitability is exceeding our expectations. At the same time, global trade uncertainty and geopolitical dynamics have resulted in the dollar strengthening and foreign exchange shifting to a slight headwind over the past 90 days.
Taking into account all of these dynamics, we are maintaining our full year guidance for fiscal year '19. Specifically, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, albeit at the lower end of that range as operational upside will likely be somewhat offset by FX headwinds. We expect gross margin to expand 50 basis points or slightly greater, SG&A to grow in the high single digits and our effective tax rate to be in the midteens. Other expense, net of interest expense, is now projected to be an expense of $100 million to $125 million.
Based on the FX volatility of late, let me briefly explain more specifically how FX impacts NIKE's financials in the short term. First, it is important to note that the revenue line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. Therefore, our reported real-dollar revenue growth reflects nearly all currency movements real time. We do have a robust hedging program that delays the impact of FX on our profitability for 12 to as much as 24 months, most notably with respect to developed market currencies, for example, the euro. However, it is not economical to hedge FX risks in many emerging markets such as Turkey, Argentina and Brazil. And as for China, we're able to partially but not fully hedge our net exposure.
Our focus is on sustaining strong, currency-neutral operating momentum over the full year and even more importantly, over the longer term. But I'll provide a bit of context on Q2. For Q2, we expect strong, currency-neutral revenue growth in line with the 9% currency-neutral revenue growth we delivered in Q1.
That said, taking into account real-time FX dynamics, reported real-dollar revenue growth for Q2 is likely to be 2 to 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth. For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion approaching the same level of expansion that we delivered in Q1. As a reminder, we expect less gross margin expansion in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year.
In Q2, we expect SG&A growth in the low teens driven by the timing of our investments in sports marketing, including the kickoff of the NBA and NFL seasons and the timing of strategic investment in new digital capabilities. For other expense net of interest expense, we expect expense in Q2 to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is creating brand distinction with consumers around the world and driving strong financial performance. At the same time, we see ourselves as being in the early stages of this transformation. There is no finish line for NIKE, particularly as it relates to digital. So we will continue to invest in the capabilities that will differentiate and create competitive advantage for NIKE long term. Those capabilities include product innovation, brand marketing, digital and speed within our supply chain.
We are thrilled with our momentum out of the gate in fiscal year '19. And nonetheless, we remain on the offense, identifying and attacking opportunities to elevate our game, build on our momentum with consumers and ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

We have had relatively strong growth with our strategic wholesale partners being Foot Locker, Finish Line, DICK'S and others. That's being driven by the elevation of the consumer experience with those partners and also by the extraordinary impact of the new innovation and newness that we're bringing to our product portfolio. We're in the early stages of some of the more truly transformational change. But what we're really encouraged by is that the learnings that we're having, particularly with the Nike App at Retail and Nike by Melrose, in other words the Nike Live concept, those conversations are really picking up steam in terms of new concept development that we see a great opportunity for across that bricks-and-mortar fleet in wholesale."

We feel actually very good and very proud of the work that we're doing with Just Do It, just the -- introducing Just Do It to the new generation of consumers on the 30th anniversary of the campaign when it first debuted. We know it's resonated actually quite strongly with consumers, obviously here in North America but also around the world. It's really transcended the North America market to touch, I think, people around the world. We have an incredible lineup of athletes in that spot. When you look at the Just Do It campaign and the list of athletes we have there, it's actually quite impressive, including Serena and Odell, Colin, Shaquem Griffin, Lacey Baker. These are actually very inspiring athletes. And again, we feel like that campaign has delivered on that message in a way that's really connected with people around the world. Like any campaign, it's -- not any campaign but many campaigns, it's driving a real uptake, I think, in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially. We've seen record engagement with the brand as part of the campaign. And our brand strength, as you well know, is a key dimension that contributes to the ongoing momentum that we're building across the Nike portfolio. So I mean that's really how we look at it. It's how do we connect and engage in a way that's relevant and inspiring to the consumers that we're here to serve."

We had extremely strong double-digit growth in digital and acceleration in that regard. We have taken a number of actions to remove friction, enhance the consumer experience, allocate product to that channel where we know consumers are -- demand is robust. And we're actually using data and demand sensing to better line up supply with demand digitally, so incredibly strong growth digitally. In our in-line stores, we're actually seeing strong comps as well. We've seen traffic up and even more notably, conversion. And conversion in the in-line stores we're seeing is a direct result of 2 things: one, the brand distinction that Mark mentioned in response to the last question as well as the product that we're bringing to market. We're seeing incredibly strong full price sell-through on our line right now. Our close-out mix is down in inventory and our off-price sales are down as a percent of total. In our factory stores, our factory stores continue to be a very profitable dimension of the business. And frankly, the only challenge I would really highlight in our factory stores is that its full price sell-through is so strong in in-line and digitally, it leaves some gaps in terms of the assortment that we bring to market in the short term in our factory stores. But we've identified opportunities in that regard and are looking at supply to fill those gaps. So again, it's a nice problem to have."

We've had great relationships with our digital partners there. I mentioned Tmall. WeChat is starting up with tremendous potential there. So there's great momentum in the marketplace and across multiple categories, Sportswear, Running, Basketball. The Jordan Brand is incredibly strong in China. So our fundamentals in China are actually quite sound and strong. We're not seeing any pushback from consumers. On the contrary, our relationship and connection to consumers is as strong as it can possibly be. We feel confident in our ability to continue to grow, and that's reflected in our outlook for China over this next year. We feel like there's great momentum and that we're in a good position for that to continue. Now that said, we're mindful of the dynamics, but we are focused on serving that Chinese consumer, strengthening our position there.

We're seeing strong structural improvement in our margins, and that's being driven by the innovation we're bringing to market and in turn, the strong full price versus off-price mix. Second, it's being driven by the over-indexing growth in our NIKE Digital business. And it's also being amplified by the initiatives that we have around product cost management. In the first half of the year, there's one element of material, so to speak, that is a bit of a headwind. And that's in the chemical space, namely rubber. That will ease in the second half of the year. As we look at FX as well, FX is much more of a tailwind in the margin line item of our P&L in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. So if I refer back to the guidance that we gave as we entered the year and we reiterated today, we have strong gross margin expansion forecast for the entire fiscal year. At the same time, we see slightly less margin expansion in the first half and more margin expansion in the second half."

We have an incredible lineup coming, I think, throughout the fiscal year of product. We're actually focusing on bringing innovation into the core price points as well. So we have a balanced portfolio of innovation across both footwear and apparel. And then we have opportunity to further dimensionalize the incredible platforms that we've got. I mean, I mentioned Air, React, Zoom. There's ZoomX. There's still a tremendous amount of potential to leverage those both in performance across categories and then also across Sportswear. And then I have to tell you, I can't really shed too much light on this at this stage but -- my excitement around what's coming as we, believe it or not, ramp up our portfolio around the Tokyo Olympics. NIKE is -- that's always a time where we showcase our innovation, and the buildup to the Olympics is an incredibly exciting time for NIKE and the innovation that we deliver.

We -- our goals for North America are long term focused. It's a large, important geography. And as you may recall at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid-single-digit revenu",577,"Sure. Thanks for the compliments, Paul. I'll take that one. We -- our goals for North America are long term focused. It's a large, important geography. And as you may recall at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth over the next 5 years. As we innovate within the marketplace from a digital perspective and transform the broader retail landscape, on that note we said there might be some disruption in the short term as well. So to some extent, we hedged a little bit with respect to fiscal year '19. To be clear, we've returned to strong growth in North America even faster than we had expected. We have demand that is outstripping supply. You saw our inventory in North America was flat. And so what we're focused on, and we're always focused on you can rest assured, is capitalizing on every opportunity that we see to serve demand in the North America marketplace. We're not providing specific guidance from a geo perspective. But I will tell you that the brand is incredibly strong. Our product is resonating. Sell-through is strong. And even beyond what's working and what you can see in our numbers, we see opportunity to go beyond that and potentially, even more importantly, drive that sustainable growth over that 5-year horizon. And those opportunities fall under the overall umbrella of what Mark often refers to as our complete offense. At any given time, even when we have extraordinary momentum, there are areas underneath that umbrella where we see greater opportunity than we're capitalizing on. Specifically in North America, I touched on Jordan. We see acceleration in Jordan over the coming months and certainly out of this fiscal year and into next year. Women's is growing strong. Women's was a very strong dimension of growth for us as a company, but we see even more opportunity. It's not so much about the rate of growth. It's how much more opportunity is out there in the women's business, especially around athletic footwear and apparel. And then finally, another dimension of huge opportunity in North America is our Young Athletes business. It may surprise some people to know that it's one of our largest categories. At the same time, we see the opportunity to bring new materials, colors, prints and even designs directly targeted at Young Athletes. We have a silhouette called the Future Series, which is actually an innovation that's made specifically for kids. So we do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in North America. Suffice it to say, we're really pleased with the momentum we have, and we're bullish on being able to sustain growth in North America in fiscal year '19 and beyond. And then you also asked about global growth. You made a comment that said it's pretty consistent. I just want to be clear. On a currency-neutral basis, our momentum on the top line from a revenue perspective is stronger globally than we expected when we came into the year. While we maintained our high single-digit reported revenue growth guidance, that takes into account that over the last 90 days since we last spoke to you, FX has been pretty volatile. And as I touched on, that line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. So while we protect the profitability through hedging, we see those impacts real time, and that's also why I gave you a little bit more color on Q2 guidance."

It starts with consumer data and analysis around consumer data. And I'd say that is manifesting itself right now, already, and most importantly, in terms of digital demand sensing, us continuing to leverage the intuition that we have but amplifying that intuition with real data as to what consumers' preferences are. And one of the best examples is Nike by Melrose. That store, that Nike Live store in Los Angeles, the entire assortment is based on data that we're analyzing around what consumers in those ZIP Codes have purchased and are interested in and some of the key themes. You move from digital demand sensing to digital product creation. So taking that insight and designing and creating product, leveraging digital technology that allows us to bring that insight to life in a product faster. And then absolutely, we're using data in our supply chain to tighten our demand and supply management. And you see that already beginning to impact our full price versus off-price sell-through. On the very front end, of course, from a consumer perspective, data and analytics helps us personalize the consumer experience on the Nike app as well as the SNKRS App and even in our physical retail environments as we use things like the things like the Nike App at Retail. And in that regard, one of the most notable successes or pilots early on has been connected inventory. So using RFID and using data and analytics in terms of where inventory is and where our consumers are looking to buy to get them the product they want more seamlessly. And then as for your second question, you asked about Jet.com and how that might compare to some of our other partnerships. And I'll say that Mark will probably want to add something here. We're excited about this partnership with Jet because it is a partnership that is really about creating a compelling consumer experience around the NIKE Brand, leveraging Nike membership to help better serve consumers in that channel, helping ensure that there's a clean assortment of product that's presented to that consumer across the marketplace. So there are several aspects of it that we view as distinctive in terms of the offering that we'll make to consumers. At the same time, it's one of several initiatives across a range of digital commerce platforms."

291981,579140597,1561276,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 25, 2018",2018-09-25,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nitesh, and hello, and good afternoon, everyone.

Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1, that momentum continued at a strong pace. We're capitalizing on the opportunities we see in the near term, and we're diving deeper into the areas that will widen NIKE's advantages over the long term.
Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we're taking a winning formula and executing it across our complete portfolio and it's leading to the balanced growth that you see today. For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include double-digit growth in our international geographies and 6% growth in North America. NIKE Digital is leading the way for differentiated retail, up 36% for the quarter. And we saw acceleration in both our Sportswear and performance businesses. While this quarter's success was broad based and we're pleased with our momentum, we know we have even more opportunities ahead. As we've described before, a key focus that will create separation for NIKE over the long term is our digital transformation. Ultimately, it's about becoming more personal at scale. And put simply, it's how digital is accelerating each of our triple-double pillars, and that's how we create through 2X Innovation, how we connect through 2X Direct and how we serve through 2X Speed. So let's look at the quarter through each of these lenses.
The success we're seeing today starts with great products. It's ultimately where the consumer cast their vote. Our innovation platforms are building a foundation for growth over many years. As the taste of our consumers shift faster, strong platforms allow us to continually bring fresh products to market while extending our storytelling and investments. We're seeing it with Nike Air and React. Consumers are drawn to their comfort and performance, and they're asking for more style options. VaporMax and 270 are both proving there is still vast growth potential in Nike Air as we develop more comfort innovation in new forms.
This spring, we're taking the exaggerated air you see in the Air Max 270 and going a step further with the introduction of the Air Max 720. This new platform is engineered for maximum comfort, cradling the entire foot. And the Air Max 27 -- or 720 is distinctly NIKE, and we'll deliver it to consumers in early 2019.
Nike React is a great example of how we've capitalized on the appeal of performance innovation and immediately scaled it into Sportswear. The React Element 87 is considered one of the industry's top new designs, and we've applied the comfort of React cushioning to more performance and lifestyle shoes at several price points.
ZoomX continues to power the world's fastest runners, including Eliud Kipchoge during his epic world-record smashing run at the Berlin Marathon this month. This quarter, we took the magic of the Vaporfly 4% and merged it with an iconic running shoe, creating the Peg Turbo. The launch has created incredible energy for the whole Pegasus franchise and helped lead our overall running business to solid growth this quarter.
One of our most versatile and ever advancing platforms is Flyknit. Through digital knitting, we can now place breathability, stretch and support exactly where we need it. In Basketball, for example, the KD 11 and the LeBron 16 each leverage specific yarns and different knit structures to match individual athlete needs. The LeBron 16 with its Battle Knit 2.0 has had a great early read with consumers, both men and women.
As part of our broader commitment to scale sustainable platforms, we're expanding Nike Flyleather through iconic styles like the Air Force 1, the Cortez and the Air Max 95. Flyleather is a super material that looks and feels like premium leather but is lighter, more durable and more sustainable. It uses at least 50% reclaimed leather and helps eliminate waste.
And in the coming year, for the first time ever, NIKE will bring digitally powered adjustable footwear to professional sports. Building on the auto-lacing platform from HyperAdapt, this breakthrough creates a custom fit. We had a group of elite athletes on campus this summer for an intense wear test, and their feedback was that they'd never felt more secure or more in control of their movement. This next-generation, adaptable innovation will set the standard for optimal fit, and we'll offer it at more accessible price points and in greater quantities.
In addition to platforms, we're executing the fundamentals across our categories at a high level right now. We know that it's newness and freshness that wins with the consumer today. So with our Edit to Amplify approach, we're providing deeper assortments and greater options of our top sellers. Our footwear Power Franchises, for example, consistently outperform our overall footwear sell-through.
Apparel, too, continued its momentum with 11% growth driven by fleece, tops and bottoms, jackets and pants. We delivered a number of Sportswear apparel collections over the last 90 days, like the City Ready and the Metallic Sheen collections in women's and NIKE Sport and Tech Packs and ACG. We'll continue on this path and extend into performance because collections give consumers more complete looks and allow for better merchandising and storytelling. 
Overall with apparel, in our categories, we saw a consistent sell-through of our Football national teams collections drafting off the energy we created from the World Cup, where we had our first all NIKE men's final. The growth in our women's apparel business was led by Sportswear and sports bras, where our strategy to blend style and comfort is working. And in Nike Basketball apparel, we're capturing the excitement for LeBron's move to the Lakers. As you'll see in just a few weeks, we're bringing more creative designs with the NBA city jerseys this year.
When we look across our complete portfolio of products, we still see areas with significant upside. We've talked before about the opportunity in women's, in Young Athletes and Jordan. Delivering innovation and fresh product in these areas brings balance to our portfolio. A strong roster of core footwear at entry price points is equally important to NIKE's overall growth potential. We're not yet where we want to be in [ core ] footwear particularly in North America but 2 priorities for the business are: to develop innovation specifically for the core consumer and to better leverage Pinnacle performance platforms like Nike Air in this zone.
Another product strategy that's driving incredible energy is our ability to create unique intersections between sport and style across our brands. A few examples over this past quarter include: the on and off court collaboration between Serena and Virgil Abloh for the U.S. Open; Converse's limited edition Chuck Taylor's and One Star with creative partners in fashion and music; and our first Jordan Brand Football kit with PSG. 
As I've said before, it's not lifestyle versus performance or fashion versus sport, the consumer continues to be inspired by seeing those worlds come together. Overall, 2X Innovation is at the heart of our continued momentum right now. We have versatile platforms. We're mixing sport and style in unexpected ways, and we have a deep lineup across our product portfolio that's creating value across all dimensions of our business. 
And while our product innovation is fueling demand, our 2X Direct strategy is driving new ways to connect with our consumers. It's building confidence in our vision for smart retail, where we remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. 2X Direct is in the early stages, and it's already creating an impact, resulting in strong growth and margin expansion for our NIKE Direct channels.
We continue to see unprecedented demand for our highest heat products through our SNKRS App, which has become the world's #1 footwear shopping app. And we'll continue to expand the reach of SNKRS, launching in Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia next quarter. 
The Nike Live retail concept we unveiled with our Melrose store in L.A. was incredibly successful this quarter. The premise behind the concept is to create a live and ever-changing experience. We're testing a number of new features, including: product assortments that update frequently based on what's trending with the local consumer; a service that allows consumers to reserve an item on our apps and then pick it up curbside or in the store from a personal smart locker; and through [ Swoosh text ], our store athletes can now provide expert advice for consumers after they've left the store. 
And what we're learning in Melrose, we're bringing to 2 new flagship stores in our 2 most important key cities, New York and Shanghai, this next quarter. Both will be the culmination of all we've learned about personalized and experiential shopping over the last several years. There'll be incredible showcases for the NIKE Brand.
Our obsession with the store experience is also paying off with top strategic partners. While retail consolidation has not finished its course in North America, our growing NIKE Consumer Experiences with Foot Locker, Nordstrom and other key partners are already driving higher growth rates as compared to nondifferentiated doors. We're equally energized by the momentum we're building with new digital commerce partners. We just moved from a pilot stage to a fully operational program with Flipkart in India. And 2 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Jet.com to sell selected assortments of both NIKE and Converse in key cities in North America. With Jet, we're partnering to develop consumer insights and create a better-branded experience on their platform. 
And we're doing the same with our key partners in China. This quarter, we made it possible to combine NikePlus member accounts to Tmall accounts. We're seeing an impressive increase in new members in China as a result. And last week, we launched a partnership with WeChat, making 1 billion monthly active users just one click away from becoming a NikePlus member.
Ultimately, companies will be judged on their ability to be more personal with their consumers at scale. And NIKE's taking the lead on this promise, leveraging more insights from all over the world and reshaping the shopping experience through smart retail.
To make that a reality, we're unlocking opportunities to quickly and seamlessly design, manufacture and deliver our products to consumers through 2X Speed. We're sharpening our sensing capabilities and developing fully responsive product manufacturing. We're actively building a portfolio of innovation and automation that impacts the entire spectrum of our process. Our goals are ambitious, and we have high standards. Our vision is to leverage automation to deliver amazing, innovative products faster and more responsibly while being more sustainable and cost-efficient. And we've had some great success. 
For example, we invented a flat assembly process for uppers in our Advanced Product Creation Center at our world headquarters using 30% fewer steps and 50% less labor. We tested this process with our partners, including Flex, and in our Asia store space as well. Transforming traditional footwear manufacturing is a significant undertaking. We've learned a lot and are building new high-impact capabilities, yet we continue to face specific challenges together with our partners, including Flex, where the goal has been to deliver responsive, automated, close-to-market manufacturing of high-quality products at scale. This is a dynamic process, and we're continually assessing and refining the best path forward, leveraging our breakthroughs in areas like rapid prototyping, 3D and digital printing and new methods of make, all in service of cutting the overall product creation cycle in half.
Another key initiative accelerating us towards that goal is the Express Lane, which continues to be the engine that's creating the most agility in our supply chain right now. We're driving double-digit growth in many of our key cities through the Express Lane as we capitalize on the local energy for key icons like the Cortez and sports moments like the World Cup. With this end-to-end view, our entire value chain, we're delivering the right product to the right consumer in the right moment. And across product lines, throughout geos and with our partners around the world, we're relentlessly driving speed at a scale that is creating impact for our business.
We're off to a great start in Q1, managing the dynamic environment. More importantly, we're setting a new foundation for long-term, sustainable growth for years to come. Thanks, and now here is Andy."
291981,579140597,1561276,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 25, 2018",2018-09-25,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We are extremely pleased with the quality of the growth that we delivered in the first quarter.

We are extremely pleased with the quality of the growth that we delivered in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we are delivering stronger, more broad-based momentum around the world than the expectations we set entering the fiscal year. We have continued strong growth in international markets, led by Greater China growing at 20%, and our international growth is now being amplified by very strong, sustainable growth in North America.
As for the quality of our growth, our momentum continues to be directly tied to execution of the Consumer Direct Offense and more specifically, the Triple Double. First, take for example our 2X Direct initiative. 2X Direct is about connecting the NIKE Brand more directly to our consumers. And today, the most direct connection to the consumer is through the mobile device in the palm of their hand. In Q1, we continued to enhance and expand our NIKE Digital ecosystem, leading with mobile, and the result was 36% NIKE Digital growth. NIKE Digital was once again our fastest-growing channel in each and every geography.
Now while NIKE Digital is leading the way, we believe physical retail will also play an important role in doubling our direct connection to consumers. We see growth in the physical environment being driven by smarter retail, experiences that leverage digital technology to better serve consumers. In Q1, our vision for physical retail became more tangible. We continued to roll out what we're calling the Nike App at Retail, starting with our own in-line stores, and we also launched the new concept called Nike Live. The Nike Live concept came to life in Q1 through the opening of Nike by Melrose in Los Angeles. Nike Live leverages our NikePlus membership platform and other digitally enabled services to provide a truly differentiated consumer experience at retail. The results to date have been phenomenal. For example, at Nike by Melrose, the conversion of in-store shoppers into digital NikePlus members is 6x higher than in the rest of our fleet as consumers seek to gain the full benefits associated with being more directly connected to NIKE.
Our approach has been to test, learn and then scale new concepts such as these. Accordingly, we're now in the process of scaling these new concepts across our fleet of owned stores, and these tangible proof points are also accelerating new concept development with our strategic wholesale partners.
2X Innovation is another key pillar within the Consumer Direct Offense that is fueling our broad-based momentum. Suffice it to say that our recently launched innovation platforms, VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX, have already generated in aggregate over $2 billion in revenue at retail. Further, these platforms are driving brand distinction and catalyzing growth across our broader product portfolio in both performance and Sportswear. For example, as Mark noted, the new innovation we are bringing to the Nike Air franchise has ignited double-digit growth across our multibillion-dollar family of Nike Air products. 
Newness and innovation are also favorably impacting our gross margin as our full price sell-through is significantly outpacing off-price sales. Our current inventory levels are also tight in relation to this strong demand that we're creating.
Underlying our strategic momentum is the digital transformation of NIKE that Mark mentioned. A year ago, we aligned our teams around the world on our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. Over the past year, we've been ramping up investment in the new digital capabilities that will reshape how we operate at NIKE for the long term. Our investments in new digital capabilities are coming in the form of both organic development and acquisition. As we closed fiscal year '18, we announced the acquisitions of Zodiac and Invertex, both of which are already having a profound impact on how we better serve consumers. Another acquisition that we made back in fiscal year '17 was Virgin Mega. That team has now become known as Studio 23 (sic) [ s23NYC ], a digital hub in New York that's driving the explosive growth of the SNKRS App.
Within fiscal year '19, we're also investing significantly in the organic development of new capabilities including: digital demand sensing; consumer data and analytics; connected inventory; digital product design and creation; a digital content engine; and a new enterprise resource platform that will help unlock speed and flexibility in our supply chain.
As our long-term financial model implies, we believe that NIKE's unrivaled scale and resources afford us the ability to over index on investment in these differentiating capabilities while still delivering expanding profitability over the 5-year horizon.
Execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is clearly beginning to transform NIKE's business model and how we will create value for shareholders over the long term. So let's recap our Q1 results in a bit more detail with a focus on how strategic execution is the driving force behind our current financial performance.
NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Our stronger-than-projected currency-neutral growth was driven by acceleration in North America and continued strong momentum in international markets, albeit slightly offset by FX dynamics within the quarter. Our growth across geographies was led by NIKE Direct, with NIKE Direct growing 12% and NIKE Digital growing 34% on a currency-neutral basis.
The impact of innovation, NIKE Digital growth outpacing all other channels and our tighter supply and demand management also fueled roughly 50 basis points of NIKE, Inc. gross margin expansion in Q1. 
Demand creation grew 13% in the first quarter, primarily driven by sports marketing investments as well as brand campaigns that amplify key moments in sport such as the World Cup. Operating overhead increased 5%, driven by investments in digital capabilities as well as in our supply chain and enterprise technology platforms.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14%, which reflects the implementation of U.S. tax reform. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67. Finally, as of August 31, inventories were flat to prior year, primarily driven by a strong pull market across all geographies, coupled with the efforts we have taken over the past year to rightsize supply.
So now let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, we have returned to strong, sustainable growth. Q1 revenue grew 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by accelerating growth across both footwear and apparel, driven by new innovation platforms as well as strong owned and partnered digital growth. Wholesale has also returned to growth, yet we see even greater opportunity to drive differentiation across the wholesale marketplace going forward, in part by leveraging our learnings from the Nike App at Retail and Nike by Melrose.
Another growth opportunity we see ahead of us in North America relates to the Jordan Brand. In the second half of fiscal year '18, we tightened supply. We also reset our approach to Jordan Retro, creating more current stories and collaborations with respect to Jordan's most iconic styles. We're now bringing those icons to life in more compelling ways for the new generation of Jordan consumers, and as a result, the Jordan Brand is back to a pull market. We're also beginning to add greater dimension to the Jordan Brand. For example for women, we're extending sizes in the icons we know they already love and also creating silhouettes and new collaborations made specifically for her. Apparel and performance basketball also represents significant growth opportunities going forward.
As the football and basketball seasons ramp up, our brand momentum will continue to build in North America. At the same time, we're not taking that momentum for granted. We continue to identify and attack opportunities to elevate our game and drive strong, sustainable growth in this important geography.
So now let's turn to EMEA. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in Sportswear and healthy growth in Running and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace, growing at a strong double-digit rate. One of the underlying drivers of our sustained growth in EMEA is the strength of our brand across this diverse geography. EMEA is home to 5 of our 12 key global cities, and in all 5 of those key cities in EMEA, NIKE is rated #1 by consumers, and our growth is over indexing the broader market. 
By connecting more deeply with consumers in key influential cities and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, NIKE is creating increasingly greater distinction as a brand in Europe. One of those sports moments was the incredibly exciting World Cup, in which both of the finalists were NIKE teams. And soon after the World Cup final, we launched our Awaken the Phantom campaign, generating over 50 million views in the first 2 weeks and driving strong sell-through on the launch of our newest Global Football franchise, the Phantom. And finally, after celebrating the French national team's World Cup victory, we continue to bring energy to Global Football with the launch of a Jordan-branded Paris Saint-Germain team kit and collection of apparel. That launch has been phenomenal, with the key styles selling out immediately.
While NIKE has become the leading brand in EMEA, we are far from having achieved our full potential. We see the opportunity to both grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel across Europe and also create even greater separation from the competition as a brand. That is why we believe we can sustain this strong growth in EMEA over the long term.
Next, let's turn to Greater China, another geography in which the NIKE Brand continues to lead and sustain strong growth. We've now delivered 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China's growth was 20% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by Sportswear, Jordan, Basketball and across women's and Young Athletes. Growth was also strong in balance across both footwear and apparel. We are winning with the Chinese consumer, first and foremost through the key cities of Shanghai and Beijing. We're also continually innovating in this large, digitally native marketplace. NIKE Digital growth remains strong and actually accelerated in Q1. We're also driving growth through our partnerships with China's leading digital platforms like Tmall and WeChat.
And finally, we're beginning to leverage digital in the largely NIKE-branded physical retail environment in China. Take for example our partner Belle, which was acquired last year by Hillhouse, a leading firm in technology and consumer services. Belle has already rolled out connected inventory that enables a more direct NIKE consumer experience with a faster and easier way to fulfill consumer demand, fully leveraging their roughly 2,500 touch points.
Now let's turn from China to another fast-growing and fast-developing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel and led by Japan, Mexico and Korea. Two areas of increasing focus for us in APLA have been our women's business and digital. Women's growth continues to accelerate, driven by distinctive brand marketing campaigns such as the Come Out in Force and Rally Cry campaigns, focused on inspiring and empowering women through sport. 
NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA, with revenue growing over 70% in Q1, the highest rate of growth across all of our geographies as we continue expanding our digital ecosystem across this region. We will continue to sustain strong growth as we roll out the Nike SNKRS App in markets such as Mexico and Brazil and bring the Nike Live retail concept to Tokyo later this fiscal year.
Beyond NIKE Direct, we're also expanding our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through entrepreneurial commerce partnerships such as those with Flipkart, ZOZOTOWN and several others. We see continued momentum in APLA over the course of fiscal year '19, and we will continue to invest in this fast-growing, diverse geography as we move even closer to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.
And finally, at Converse, revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth digitally. That said, Converse also experienced declines in undifferentiated wholesale, primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. As we move through fiscal year '19, we will be expanding Converse's product portfolio while also elevating the Converse-branded digital ecosystem.
We are off to an even stronger start to the fiscal year than we initially expected. Our currency-neutral growth and profitability is exceeding our expectations. At the same time, global trade uncertainty and geopolitical dynamics have resulted in the dollar strengthening and foreign exchange shifting to a slight headwind over the past 90 days.
Taking into account all of these dynamics, we are maintaining our full year guidance for fiscal year '19. Specifically, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, albeit at the lower end of that range as operational upside will likely be somewhat offset by FX headwinds. We expect gross margin to expand 50 basis points or slightly greater, SG&A to grow in the high single digits and our effective tax rate to be in the midteens. Other expense, net of interest expense, is now projected to be an expense of $100 million to $125 million.
Based on the FX volatility of late, let me briefly explain more specifically how FX impacts NIKE's financials in the short term. First, it is important to note that the revenue line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. Therefore, our reported real-dollar revenue growth reflects nearly all currency movements real time. We do have a robust hedging program that delays the impact of FX on our profitability for 12 to as much as 24 months, most notably with respect to developed market currencies, for example, the euro. However, it is not economical to hedge FX risks in many emerging markets such as Turkey, Argentina and Brazil. And as for China, we're able to partially but not fully hedge our net exposure.
Our focus is on sustaining strong, currency-neutral operating momentum over the full year and even more importantly, over the longer term. But I'll provide a bit of context on Q2. For Q2, we expect strong, currency-neutral revenue growth in line with the 9% currency-neutral revenue growth we delivered in Q1.
That said, taking into account real-time FX dynamics, reported real-dollar revenue growth for Q2 is likely to be 2 to 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth. For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion approaching the same level of expansion that we delivered in Q1. As a reminder, we expect less gross margin expansion in the first half of the year as compared to the second half of the year.
In Q2, we expect SG&A growth in the low teens driven by the timing of our investments in sports marketing, including the kickoff of the NBA and NFL seasons and the timing of strategic investment in new digital capabilities. For other expense net of interest expense, we expect expense in Q2 to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.
Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is creating brand distinction with consumers around the world and driving strong financial performance. At the same time, we see ourselves as being in the early stages of this transformation. There is no finish line for NIKE, particularly as it relates to digital. So we will continue to invest in the capabilities that will differentiate and create competitive advantage for NIKE long term. Those capabilities include product innovation, brand marketing, digital and speed within our supply chain.
We are thrilled with our momentum out of the gate in fiscal year '19. And nonetheless, we remain on the offense, identifying and attacking opportunities to elevate our game, build on our momentum with consumers and ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

When you look at the Just Do It campaign and the list of athletes we have there, it's actually quite impressive, including Serena and Odell, Colin, Shaquem Griffin, Lacey Baker. These are actually very inspiring athletes. And again, we feel like that campaign has delivered on that message in a way that's really connected with people around the world. Like any campaign, it's -- not any campaign but many campaigns, it's driving a real uptake, I think, in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially. We've seen record engagement with the brand as part of the campaign. And our brand strength, as you well know, is a key dimension that contributes to the ongoing momentum that we're building across the Nike portfolio. So I mean that's really how we look at it. It's how do we connect and engage in a way that's relevant and inspiring to the consumers that we're here to serve."

We had extremely strong double-digit growth in digital and acceleration in that regard. We have taken a number of actions to remove friction, enhance the consumer experience, allocate product to that channel where we know consumers are -- demand is robust. And we're actually using data and demand sensing to better line up supply with demand digitally, so incredibly strong growth digitally. In our in-line stores, we're actually seeing strong comps as well. We've seen traffic up and even more notably, conversion. And conversion in the in-line stores we're seeing is a direct result of 2 things: one, the brand distinction that Mark mentioned in response to the last question as well as the product that we're bringing to market. We're seeing incredibly strong full price sell-through on our line right now. Our close-out mix is down in inventory and our off-price sales are down as a percent of total. In our factory stores, our factory stores continue to be a very profitable dimension of the business. And frankly, the only challenge I would really highlight in our factory stores is that its full price sell-through is so strong in in-line and digitally, it leaves some gaps in terms of the assortment that we bring to market in the short term in our factory stores. But we've identified opportunities in that regard and are looking at supply to fill those gaps. So again, it's a nice problem to have."

We have a very strong connection with the Chinese consumer. We have -- for a long time, we're leading the market in digital, growing 40% in Q1. We've had great relationships with our digital partners there. I mentioned Tmall. WeChat is starting up with tremendous potential there. So there's great momentum in the marketplace and across multiple categories, Sportswear, Running, Basketball. The Jordan Brand is incredibly strong in China. So our fundamentals in China are actually quite sound and strong. We're not seeing any pushback from consumers. On the contrary, our relationship and connection to consumers is as strong as it can possibly be. We feel confident in our ability to continue to grow, and that's reflected in our outlook for China over this next year. We feel like there's great momentum and that we're in a good position for that to continue. Now that said, we're mindful of the dynamics, but we are focused on serving that Chinese consumer, strengthening our position there. And I'll just, I guess, close by saying we are amongst the most popular brands with the Chinese consumer. So."

We're seeing strong structural improvement in our margins, and that's being driven by the innovation we're bringing to market and in turn, the strong full price versus off-price mix. Second, it's being driven by the over-indexing growth in our NIKE Digital business. And it's also being amplified by the initiatives that we have around product cost management. In the first half of the year, there's one element of material, so to speak, that is a bit of a headwind. And that's in the chemical space, namely rubber. That will ease in the second half of the year. As we look at FX as well, FX is much more of a tailwind in the margin line item of our P&L in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. So if I refer back to the guidance that we gave as we entered the year and we reiterated today, we have strong gross margin expansion forecast for the entire fiscal year. At the same time, we see slightly less margin expansion in the first half and more margin expansion in the second half."

I also mentioned the adaptable -- adaptive footwear technology coming in to performance sport, and you'll see that on professional athletes very soon. We have an incredible lineup coming, I think, throughout the fiscal year of product. We're actually focusing on bringing innovation into the core price points as well. So we have a balanced portfolio of innovation across both footwear and apparel. And then we have opportunity to further dimensionalize the incredible platforms that we've got. I mean, I mentioned Air, React, Zoom. There's ZoomX. There's still a tremendous amount of potential to leverage those both in performance across categories and then also across Sportswear. And then I have to tell you, I can't really shed too much light on this at this stage but -- my excitement around what's coming as we, believe it or not, ramp up our portfolio around the Tokyo Olympics.

We -- our goals for North America are long-term focused. It's a large, important geography. And as you may recall at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid-single-digit revenu",576,"Sure. Thanks for the compliments, Paul. I'll take that one. We -- our goals for North America are long-term focused. It's a large, important geography. And as you may recall at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth over the next 5 years. As we innovate within the marketplace from a digital perspective and transform the broader retail landscape, on that note we said there might be some disruption in the short term as well. So to some extent, we hedged a little bit with respect to fiscal year '19. To be clear, we've returned to strong growth in North America even faster than we had expected. We have demand that is outstripping supply. You saw our inventory in North America was flat. And so what we're focused on, and we're always focused on you can rest assured, is capitalizing on every opportunity that we see to serve demand in the North America marketplace. We're not providing specific guidance from a geo perspective. But I will tell you that the brand is incredibly strong. Our product is resonating. Sell-through is strong. And even beyond what's working and what you can see in our numbers, we see opportunity to go beyond that and potentially, even more importantly, drive that sustainable growth over that 5-year horizon. And those opportunities fall under the overall umbrella of what Mark often refers to as our complete offense. At any given time, even when we have extraordinary momentum, there are areas underneath that umbrella where we see greater opportunity than we're capitalizing on. Specifically in North America, I touched on Jordan. We see acceleration in Jordan over the coming months and certainly out of this fiscal year and into next year. Women's is growing strong. Women's was a very strong dimension of growth for us as a company, but we see even more opportunity. It's not so much about the rate of growth. It's how much more opportunity is out there in the women's business, especially around athletic footwear and apparel. And then finally, another dimension of huge opportunity in North America is our Young Athletes business. It may surprise some people to know that it's one of our largest categories. At the same time, we see the opportunity to bring new materials, colors, prints and even designs directly targeted at Young Athletes. We have a silhouette called the Future Series, which is actually an innovation that's made specifically for kids. So we do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in North America. Suffice it to say, we're really pleased with the momentum we have, and we're bullish on being able to sustain growth in North America in fiscal year '19 and beyond. And then you also asked about global growth. You made a comment that said it's pretty consistent. I just want to be clear. On a currency-neutral basis, our momentum on the top line from a revenue perspective is stronger globally than we expected when we came into the year. While we maintained our high single-digit reported revenue growth guidance, that takes into account that over the last 90 days since we last spoke to you, FX has been pretty volatile. And as I touched on, that line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. So while we protect the profitability through hedging, we see those impacts real time, and that's also why I gave you a little bit more color on Q2 guidance."

It starts with consumer data and analysis around consumer data. And I'd say that is manifesting itself right now, already, and most importantly, in terms of digital demand sensing, us continuing to leverage the intuition that we have but amplifying that intuition with real data as to what consumers' preferences are. And one of the best examples is Nike by Melrose. That store, that Nike Live store in Los Angeles, the entire assortment is based on data that we're analyzing around what consumers in those ZIP Codes have purchased and are interested in and some of the key themes. You move from digital demand sensing to digital product creation. So taking that insight and designing and creating product, leveraging digital technology that allows us to bring that insight to life in a product faster. And then absolutely, we're using data in our supply chain to tighten our demand and supply management. And you see that already beginning to impact our full price versus off-price sell-through. On the very front end, of course, from a consumer perspective, data and analytics helps us personalize the consumer experience on the Nike app as well as the SNKRS App and even in our physical retail environments as we use things like the things like the Nike App at Retail. And in that regard, one of the most notable successes or pilots early on has been connected inventory. So using RFID and using data and analytics in terms of where inventory is and where our consumers are looking to buy to get them the product they want more seamlessly. And then as for your second question, you asked about Jet.com and how that might compare to some of our other partnerships. And I'll say that Mark will probably want to add something here. We're excited about this partnership with Jet because it is a partnership that is really about creating a compelling consumer experience around the NIKE Brand, leveraging Nike membership to help better serve consumers in that channel, helping ensure that there's a clean assortment of product that's presented to that consumer across the marketplace. So there are several aspects of it that we view as distinctive in terms of the offering that we'll make to consumers.

Hello and happy holidays, everyone. We've seen some amazing highlights since this past year. -- the marathon world-record. dominated the world championships. became a global star at the World Cup and Lebron James continue to inspire on and off the court. It was a year of incredible achievements for NIKE as well and Q2 was another strong proof point on our journey. We continue to show progress against our key long-term objectives of driving innovation, direct connections and speed and agility around the world. Our teams are doing a fantastic job of delivering sustainable, profitable growth through the Consumer Direct Offense, while aggressively pursuing our highest potential long-term opportunities. We set high goals and each success makes us hungry for more. The marketplace in which we compete is highly dynamic. Consumer expectations are accelerating and the macroeconomy is increasingly volatile. A key part of our strategy to win in this environment is to double down on digital. Our digital transformation is taking hold through a series of positive disruptions across the business. For example, we're leading the industry through a retail revolution. We're creating sports first, smart adaptive footwear. And we're investing in a global supply chain that delivers personal at scale. It's all incredibly energizing and we find that the more disruptive we are, the more we grow. 
Our digital disruption is fueled by breaking old models, building new commerce partnerships, emerging new talent with our years of industry experience. Our teams are driving change and it's yielding excellent results. For the quarter, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 10%. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 14%. Gross margin was up 80 basis points to prior year and earnings per share was up 13% to prior year. Specific highlights include 9% growth in North America and nearly 20% constant currency growth in our international geographies. Digital growth of 41% on a constant-currency basis and continued momentum in both sportswear and performance categories, including a return to growth in the Jordan business. The momentum we're driving is grounded in strong product innovation. We're increasing the pace of new concepts and bringing a new discipline to how we manage the life cycle of our innovation. We have a clear road map of how we stage our new platforms, giving each one the space to shine through high energy storytelling and then ramping up scale and choice to serve diverse consumer needs. Put simply, we're increasing the return on investment in innovation. One of our great differentiators is, of course, NIKE Air. It's being energized through platforms like VaporMax and Air Max 270, 2 of the world's top-selling athletic footwear models. New interpretations of our icons, led by the Air Max 95 and 97, and this spring, we're excited to add a new distinct Air platform to the mix with the Air Max 270. The consumer is already anticipating its arrival and will keep the interest high through multiple iterations early in its product life cycle. NIKE React 2 will enter a new phase as we expand the platform beyond running and basketball into lifestyle product, with the Element 55; and the shoe of the year, the Element 87. Both styles would scale significantly in 2019. Next year, we'll also add NIKE React hybrid to combine multiple cushioning platforms, along with a redesigned Epic React 2.0 coming in spring. As we broaden platforms across categories, we're also broadening them across price points to bring them to more people. As we mentioned on our call -- last call, we see greater opportunities for moderately priced footwear from NIKE right now. We were creating a more complete consumer offense for core footwear by creating performance and lifestyle icons and core only innovations. At NIKE, it's our mission to make athletes better. But perhaps no innovation delivers on that promise by ZoomX and the Vaporfly 4%, which has dominated the world's marathons since 2017. We've started something special with the 4%, enabling a dramatic improvement for the world's best runners, and you can expect more exciting breakthroughs to come here. That reputation has made its way to every day athletes, making 4%, the most sought after shoe on race day, and it's created a halo effect for many of our NIKE's footwear styles, especially the Peg 35, driving double-digit growth in the running category in Q2. I'm excited to announce that in the new year, we'll launch a new performance platform in Basketball at the $350 price point. We have a smart shoe designed for the perfect fit and it's a major step in advancing and connecting our digital transformation to product. This is just 1 better fit solution amongst many that we're working on. And we look forward to rolling them out throughout the year. We have a full innovation pipeline ahead, including new cushioning platforms, which will carry our strong product momentum into fiscal '20, all the way to Tokyo Olympics and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with the Olympics team and the Tokyo 2020 collection is the boldest we've ever assembled across performance and lifestyle in footwear and apparel. We're growing our competitive advantages in many ways. Sustainability is one example, where we're reducing waste at scale that creates change for our entire industry. NIKE Flyleather made a 50% reclaimed leather, will scale to over 1 million pairs starting this summer. NIKE Flyknit represents a multi-billion dollar business and uses 60% less waste than traditional manufacturing. And NIKE Air uses 50% recycled manufacturing waste in hundreds of millions of pairs. As a whole, we're making great progress to lower our environmental impact as a company, driving greater efficiencies and fueling growth in our business. Another area where our 2X Innovation agenda is making a dramatic impact is in apparel. As designers, there is no greater challenge than innovating for the body in motion. We think about many things, such as how to account for different environments through moisture management, creating breathability that adapts as needed or keeping the climate comfortable when it's Through new materials and methods of make, our apparel teams are continuing to push the limits in performance and in the process, creating new style. Our strategy starts with taking sports into new places. For example, in basketball, our partnership with the NBA is fueling strong growth. Our NBA apparel accelerated in year 2, especially with the jerseys, led by Miami, Minnesota and Brooklyn. And to no one 's surprise, LeBron has moved to also created opportunity. We already booked 3x more NIKE gear this year. And our work with NBA has also created a lift for NIKE in line basketball apparel. We built on the success of our showtime hoodie and added which has seen great sell-through. Overall, the traction we're gaining for basketball in NIKE Direct and internationally lead to strong global growth for Basketball category this quarter. In sportswear, our biggest category, apparel, grew over 20% this quarter. Sportswear and women's apparel were up double digits. In sportswear, we are anchoring our communications around head-to-toe collections, which makes it easier for consumers to shop complete look and strengthens our presentation in storytelling. Apparel continues to be one of NIKE's greater growth opportunities. And in the back half of the fiscal year, there's a lot to be excited about. We're launching new high-performance kits for the Woman's World Cup in France. collection that includes men's yoga apparel for the first time at NIKE. New innovation and expanded NIKE Tech Pack collection. 2 other areas of our business where we're accelerating, but we know we have much more opportunity ahead is Women's and Jordan. There's incredible momentum for Woman in sport right now as athletes, lead in every day with the moment of health and wellness, while driving a strong appetite for athletic footwear and apparel. This energy is manifesting in a number of ways. For example, footwear for women overall was up 20% for the quarter, and sneakers for her are really taking off with the Air Force 1 emerging as for favorite franchise, owning the #1 sport on nike.com for 5 weeks running. Our edit to amplify strategy to offer more color and material choices and fewer styles is also proving successful. NIKE has the top 3 selling women's athletic footwear models above $125 with the Air Max 270, VaporMax and Epic React. And in apparel, our broad business remains a strong growth opportunity, up over 20% in Q2. Looking ahead to this summer's World Cup, NIKE will dominate on the pitch. A total of 14 of the 24 national teams will compete in NIKE, including the favorite U.S. national team. And throughout the year, we'll continue to -- our Just Do It campaign that celebrates and everyday female athletes around the world. We think 2019 is going to be a true tipping point for woman in sport with more participation, more coverage and overall more energy. Meanwhile, with the Jordan Brand, we're seeing positive results from the strategic shifts that we are making. In Q2, Jordan grew double digits and we returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. At the same time, we continued our pace of double-digit growth internationally. We're making great progress in diversifying Jordan. Apparel had a very strong quarter, especially internationally. Sell-through of the Jordan and PSC collaboration exceeded expectations and we'll come back with a refreshed collection in January. Jordan's performance footwear is also contributing to solid growth, led by the new Air Jordan 33 game shoe and the Max that's doing well in China at $120 price point. And from a Sportswear perspective, we're elevating our storytelling with icons like the Air Jordan 1, which is more coveted than ever. At the start of Q3, our team executed an incredible effort with the most successful NIKE's sneaker ever launched, with the Air Jordan 11 It was a well-orchestrated plan, complete with targeting that offer free to our members, total integration across our business with partners like action and locally driven storytelling in our key cities. The Concorde shows that the Jordan Brand yet again has the power to drive launches with incredible volume and create energy for the brand. We're bringing much greater balance to Jordan with much more opportunity ahead. In 2X direct, we're beginning to realize a multiplying effect as the scale of our most innovative experiences. This quarter, momentum swing in the conversation around retail. We saw over the Thanksgiving shopping week, more than 30% increase in our digital business in North America for the quarter. In China, Singles Day once again broke records. NIKE earned a #1 sport brand on Tmall with our overall business for the day, up over 40% from last year Singles Day. It's clear that the consumers craving experiences and the fastest way to meet that demand is to test, learn and scale new features. We know that every one of our new experiences will be successful and not all will be scalable. But when we do find features that improve our services, NIKE's advantage is how quickly we deploy them across our global footprint. In November, we opened our Innovation concept in both Shanghai and New York. The energy and performance at both locations has exceeded expectations. Both stores create the most personal and responsive retail environment in the industry. It's a digital experience brought to life in a physical space, and uses of our most exciting features to date, such as the ability to scan barcodes to check availability and by the full look of manikins. Instant check out that requires no waiting at the register, expert studio that gives personal guidance, special unlocks and notifications when members enter the store. The gateway for consumers to get the most value out of these new experiences is membership. We want more doors to feel like the personal home for members, where we can elevate one-to-one service. We want to leverage mobile apps to make sure NIKE is serving our consumers wherever they are. One way we do that with members is to create ways to be in their path more organically. For example, the LeBron Watch, which will deliver 25% of Lebron 16's in the marketplace this year makes its shoes available in the moment through sneakers and our partner mobile apps. In China, this month, we gave early access to the through a QR code and live streamed NBA game on WeChat. And users can now buy directly on NIKE Run Club and NIKE training club apps, personalized to the way they train. Another key to making NIKE a part of people's lives more seamlessly again and again is to develop unique experiences with some of the world's most engaging and brand friendly platforms. And this quarter, we did that with a new feature on Instagram, that allows NIKE's products to be shopped directly from stores. On the Apple Watch, where we continue to serve our most active and highly valued NIKE Run Club members. And with Google, where consumers can now buy directly from NIKE through search and global assistant. And it further leverage partnership that amplify our brand, we're making great strides with strategic partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker, Nordstrom and Dick's Sporting Goods, where elevated experiences are driving outsized growth in the wholesale channel. We know that to fully leverage or fully offer consumers what they want in the moment requires a high level of agility in our business. And through 2X Speed, we're elevating the industry, creating an end-to-end value chain that's centered on the consumer. The are demand sensing and insights, so we know our consumer responsive product creation and manufacturing to provide the best product, delivery at speed for product to arrive when they wanted and connected inventory so there's never disappointed and start with better demand sensing and insights. In Q2 our Express Lane business grew double digits, supporting key cities with hyperlocal product and faster fulfillment to drive higher full price sell-through. Responsive product creation and manufacturing has many components. Digital product creation allows for greater precision and creativity and design, planning and staging materials drastically reduces lead times and automation increases speed and quality in manufacturing. Today, more than half of our total footwear production has been modernized through initiatives started in the modernization centers of our top 6 manufacturing partners and our Advanced Product Creation Center at world headquarters. We're also investing in delivery at speed. Take Singles Day as an example. To deliver against this massive opportunity, we had coordinated fulfillment strategy across our 12 Greater China distribution centers, and we shift direct from over 50 retail doors to consumers on the day. Overall, we fulfilled over 5 million units in 5 days. And finally our connected inventory strategy with partners like Zalando and JD will help us realize many of our Speed initiatives. In support of that initiative, we'll introduce RFID into footwear and all not licensed apparel in 2019. This will lead to vastly improve product visibility and accuracy across the supply chain from product creation to point-of-sale. And it further opens up the possibility to integrate more widely with our wholesale partners, contract factories and distribution centers. Each of these work streams is a building block for NIKE to become more personal at scale. And as a system, they demand enterprise-wide coordination and innovation. NIKE's ambitious digital transformation is driving the strong results you see today. We're staying competitive and opportunistic with every shift in the marketplace. As a leader, NIKE has high expectations. And as good as this quarter was, we know we have the ability to do much more. We're going to continue to use our scale, speed and agility to grow sport and our business around the world. Thanks. And now here's Andy"
291981,592025510,1629201,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Dec 20, 2018",2018-12-20,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. And happy holidays, everyone. Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency-neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year. Our strong",2922,"Thank you, Mark. And happy holidays, everyone. Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency-neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year. Our strong growth was also broad-based across all 4 of our geographies as well as across footwear, apparel, men's, women's and most categories. This broad-based momentum is not happening by accident, but rather is being fueled by our focus on what matters most to consumers globally. The common theme across our portfolio is the Consumer Direct Offense. More specifically, we are bringing the triple-double of 2X Innovation, 2X Direct and 2X Speed to life in our 12 key cities and 10 key countries around the world. Take innovation, for example. We've said we expect new innovation platforms to drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fact, year-to-date, new innovation platforms, including VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have driven over 80% of our incremental growth. Another significant contributor to our growth from a product perspective are our Power Franchises. By leveraging an approach that Mark calls editing to amplify, we're bringing new dimension and driving the growth of iconic franchises like the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. We do that, for example, through refresh new designs and collaborations for both men and women as well as color and material updates through to our Express Lane. Our broad-based growth is also being fueled by new experiences that more directly connects NIKE to our consumers globally. We expect NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE experiences physical and digital will contribute over 50% of our incremental growth and outpace undifferentiated retail over the next 5 years, leading the way once again in Q2 with NIKE Digital. Our NIKE Digital ecosystem continues to grow faster than all other channels, growing 41% on a currency-neutral basis. And as we drive deeper, more organic, one-to-one engagement with consumers, mobile now represents well over 50% of our digital commerce revenue. Our 2X Speed initiative is also driving our momentum. Cutting our time to market in half is not an all or nothing proposition. We're already infusing greater speed and agility into our product creation and supply chain processes, allowing us to amplify what's working with the consumer closer to realtime. For example, product updated and fulfilled through our Express Lane is growing double-digit and now represents a double-digit percentage of our total business. This is significant as Express Lane product also largely sales through at full price, favorably impacting margins. 2X Speed also includes initiatives ranging from leveraging automation to a more focused materials and material staging. these initiatives also reduce product cost and enhance inventory efficiency, the greater labor productivity and less waste. In short, we are very pleased with our strategic execution and the strong performance we have delivered to date. That said, more importantly, we are confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward. While FX headwinds have intensified, we now expect stronger currency-neutral revenue growth in fiscal year '19 than previously planned. And as we're beginning to gain greater insight into fiscal year '20, we're seeing continued strong demand. Our positive outlook is not nearly optimism, but rather is founded on fundamental changes and how we operate at NIKE. 1 fundamental change is how we bring innovation to market. In addition to driving faster innovation cycles, we're also focused on innovation platforms that have greater potential to scale across geographies. Accordingly, as Mark detailed, we've an extraordinary pipeline of innovation to come over the balance of fiscal year '19 and throughout fiscal year '20. That begins in spring with the launch of the Air Max 720 and HyperAdapt in Basketball, and extends the innovation platforms launching in earlier fiscal year '20 and through and beyond the Tokyo Olympics. We're also digitally transforming NIKE and driving positive disruption in our industry, unlocking new opportunities for growth long term. While we already have extraordinary digital momentum, we're still in the early stages of this transformation. We are executing against the 3-year road map of new digital capabilities that will enable us to continually serve consumers better. We're aggressively building those capabilities in-house and accelerating our development of those capabilities through acquisition. Our 3-year road map also includes the global expansion of our digital ecosystem in the key cities and countries where we see the greatest opportunity for growth. For example, just last month, we launched the NIKE App in Japan, where it immediately became the #1 rated shopping app. Over the next 5 years, we see the Consumer Direct Offense delivering on the financial model and measures of success we communicated on our Investor Day back in October 2017. But we are already setting our sights even higher longer term. We see the opportunity to expand the definition of sport, to be even more inclusive, including competition and training as well as movement and play. By using this broader lens to inspire and enable more active lifestyle, we will grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel. There are 4 areas where this purpose-driven approach to growth is creating outsized opportunities for us, international, digital, apparel and women's. The overall footwear and apparel industries in our international markets are already significantly larger in aggregate than in the U.S. That said, in international markets, the athletic segment of the overall footwear and apparel market has historically been less penetrated than in the U.S., but that is changing fast. Sport participation and culture continue to accelerate in international markets. And when sport grows, NIKE grows. China is perhaps the best current example of this phenomenon. And second, we said at our Investor Day, that digital owned and partnered, would comprised 30% of our business by 2023 as compared to roughly 15% of our business today. Frankly, we're already thinking bigger as we look longer term. Our industry has lagged many other industries in terms of digital penetration. Many consumer products industries are already at 50% digital penetration and projected to be well over 80% digital by 2030. We all know that disruptive new consumer-centric digital experiences have catalyzed this shift to digital in those industries. So as we increasingly innovate and lead with digital, we are intentionally disrupting our industry. We see this as positive disruption that widens the aperture for growth long term. We now see 30% digital penetration as just a milepost on our path to the majority of our business being digital. Third, apparel is another extraordinary opportunity for growth at NIKE. Apparel is a larger market in footwear globally. And at the same time, athletic apparel accounts for a smaller percentage of overall apparel than athletic accounts for within overall footwear. That dynamic is also changing fast. Consumers are increasingly choosing performance and sportswear apparel for more occasions as it better serves their more active and expressive lifestyle. And finally as we aim to redefine and expand the definition of sport, that is with a sharp focus on women. Similar to the strong returns we are seeing from having doubled our investment in innovation, we see the potential for asymmetrical returns by editing and more aggressively shifting resources towards of our women's business. The women's footwear and apparel markets are larger than men's. And today, women's represents less than a quarter of NIKE's total revenue. And we're already on this journey, as our women's business grew double digits in Q2, but we see step change growth opportunities ahead by serving women more deeply within classifications and across more occasions for her. In short, we have strong current momentum and we have extraordinary growth potential long term. But before I share more specifics regarding our outlook, let's reflect on the drivers of our current momentum. NIKE Inc. Q2 revenue increased 10%, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. This exceptional growth reflects double-digit currency-neutral momentum internationally and strong high single-digit growth in North America. NIKE Digital was the fastest-growing channel in each geography with 41% growth in aggregate on a currency-neutral basis, again led by mobile. That said, FX headwinds had a slightly larger impact on our reported revenue growth than the roughly 3 points we anticipated 90 days ago. We also delivered strong gross margin expansion of 80 basis points across NIKE Inc., fueled by NIKE Direct growth and higher mix of full price sales. Demand creation grew 4% in the quarter with our focus being on increasingly connecting with consumers through digital experiences and platforms. 
Operating overhead increased 18%, reflecting strategic investments that are accelerating NIKE's digital transformation and will fuel long-term growth. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. Second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.52, up 13% versus prior year. And as of November 30, inventories were up just 1%, reflecting a healthy pull market for NIKE and a lower mix of closeout across all geographies. Now let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 9% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew high single digits with NIKE Digital up well over 30% in North America. As Mark mentioned, we are now turning our vision for the next generation of retail into a reality. And our NIKE Live concept on we're aligning data-driven, bi-weekly flows of product to the store with digital storytelling and one-to-one connections between the store team and local consumers. As a result, the store is driving strong digital member acquisition, engagement and buying. And we're seeing even more impressive early results at our new house of innovation in New York. While the overall retail marketplace in North America is still going through consolidation, and we do expect that to continue. Our NIKE wholesale business in aggregate has returned to strong growth with improving profitability, led by our strategic retail partners, such as Foot Locker and increasingly JD. In Q2, we also reignited brand heat in North America through that Just Do It campaign that was launched in early September and by amplifying key moments in sport like the launch of the NBA season. We see of our brand across both NIKE and Jordan, our strong pipeline of innovative product and digitally like consumer experiences continuing to fuel strong growth in North America. In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth across sportswear, running, training and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace growing over 30% versus prior year. We have extraordinary momentum in this geography as we're taking significant share and we're growing the market. We are mindful of the geopolitical dynamics in Europe. That said, we have a long track record of delivering growth and profitability amidst of wide range of macroeconomic circumstances. As we look ahead, we expect our momentum to continue in Europe. In all 5 of our key cities in EMEA, consumers rate as the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand, and in fact those ratings strengthened even further in Q2. We're connecting more directly and deeply with consumers locally through our key city focus and we are seeing the impact globally. For example, through the PST partnership, we connected authentically with consumers in while the product sold out at launch around the world. We also recently introduced the NIKE App at Retail and NIKE Town London as well as the sneakers experience in allowing consumers to reserve shoes from launches and pick up in store. Those services are removing friction and personalizing the shopping experiences, driving significant new member acquisition in 2 of our key global cities. Next, let's turn to Greater China where yet again we delivered double-digit growth in Q2. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in China. In Q2, growth accelerated to 31% on a currency-neutral basis with digital going over 40%. As evidence of the scale and digital nature of this important market as well as the strength of the NIKE Brand, our sneakers app community in China, and recall that the sneakers app was launched just last year, it's already the same size as our sneakers community in North America. In Q2, with the opening of house of innovation in Shanghai, we also begin to more fully leverage digital in this largely NIKE branded physical retail environment. It's still early days, but the results have been extraordinary. While there has been uncertainty of labor regarding U.S., China relations, we have not seen any impact on our business. NIKE continues to win with the consumer in China. Through over 3 decades, NIKE has been a brand of China, for China. We've connected deeply with the consumer here through our key city focus on Shanghai and Beijing. Through partnerships with sports federations teams and athletes and by partnering with China's Ministry of Sport to fuel greater sport participation in schools across the country. In fact, just last month, leading up to the Shanghai marathon, we took Eliud Kipchoge on to Shanghai and other key cities. And then on Marathon Day, we launched a Shanghai focused Just Do It campaign. In just the first 24 hours, the campaign was watched more than 16 million times. We are bullish about our potential to continue delivering strong, sustainable and very profitable growth in this important geography. In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis with balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel as well as double-digit growth in sportswear Jordan and NIKE basketball. NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 75%. We also continue to expand our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through commerce partnerships, such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart and others. APLA is a market in which we are extremely entrepreneurial, testing new concepts that leverage digital to enhance the consumer experience at retail. As we mentioned on our last call, we'll be opening a NIKE Live experience in Tokyo in Q3. And in we are testing our connected inventory strategy. We have connected the inventory across 19 NIKE branded doors, including doors owned by 2 of our strategic partners. This connected inventory pilot has yielded very promising early results, serving thousands of consumers whose demand would otherwise have been unmet due to product being out of stock in a particular store. And finally at Converse, revenue increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2. Growth was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and a sharp acceleration in own digital growth globally, approaching triple digits. While Converse wholesale in the U.S. and U.K. remain challenged in Q2, Digital also accelerated in those markets. We see significant opportunity to grow Converse by expanding the product portfolio, including within Basketball as well as launching a new digital platform. And with that, let's turn to our outlook. There is increasing volatility and uncertainty on a macro level. That said, what is certain is that NIKE's execution of the consumer direct offense is driving consistently strong and sustainable broad-based growth across our diverse global portfolio, that is because we are focused on what matters most to consumers and they are responding globally with strong demand for NIKE. Accordingly, our full year guidance for fiscal year '19 reflects stronger currency-neutral revenue growth, stronger gross margin expansion and accelerated strategic investment. For the full year, we now expect currency-neutral revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range, potentially approaching low double digits. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported full year revenue growth to be over 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth. In other words, at the lower end of the high single-digit range. For gross margin, our outlook has also improved. We expect our full year gross margin expansion to be roughly in line with the gross margin expansion of 70 basis points that we delivered over the first half of fiscal year '19. We expect SG&A for the full year to grow in the high single digits as we continue to invest in new digital capabilities that will differentiate NIKE and fuel our long-term growth. We project other expense, net of interest expense, to be between $50 million and $75 million for the full year. And we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens for fiscal year '19. That said, the finalization of regulations related U.S. tax reform may result in discrete adjustments that impact our tax rate. While our focus is on sustaining profitable growth over the course of fiscal year '19 and for the long term, I will provide a bit of context on Q3 considering the current macro environment. In Q3, we expect strong currency-neutral revenue growth squarely within the high single-digit range. Based on FX dynamics, our reported real dollar revenue growth will likely be roughly 4 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth in Q3. For gross margin, we expect Q3 expansion to be roughly in line with our full year guidance. As for SG&A, we expect growth in the low-double digit range in Q3 as we continue to prioritize strategic investments. And finally we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be between 16% and 18%. Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is driving consistently strong performance, yet, we are still in the early stages. As we continue to execute, we're not only building current momentum, we're also gaining greater insight into NIKE's potential to transform the industry, drive sustainable growth and create extraordinary value for shareholders long term. With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

As for gross margin, I'll touch on that question first. We are expecting our gross margin to be better in the second half of the year. And as you note in our reported results, it was slightly better than we expe",334,"All right. Thanks for the question, Lauren. As for gross margin, I'll touch on that question first. We are expecting our gross margin to be better in the second half of the year. And as you note in our reported results, it was slightly better than we expected in Q2. We're seeing structural benefits to our margin from our over-indexing growth in Direct, which has had very strong momentum and momentum that's exceeded our expectations, specifically in digital as well as a greater mix of premium innovative product and stronger full price sell-through. We're also benefiting from a clean marketplace, particularly for NIKE. So as noted in my remarks, we do have an improved outlook for '19 with our expansion been roughly in line with the year-to-date margin expansion of 70 basis points. And as we noted when we entered the year, we expect that the second half margin to be stronger than the first half and in the first quarter our margin expansion was lesser than in the second quarter. I would note that in any given quarter, there can be anomalies that impact margin. And finally I'd note that Q2 is a quarter in which our margin is historically lower. Q3 and Q4, we have higher margin, and so the expansion we expect in the third and fourth quarters is actually strong expansion on an already relatively higher quarterly margin. And then you asked about ASP and units. What I would note is that ASPs were up across our portfolio in both footwear and apparel. Again, new innovation, strong full price sell-through, our shift to Direct, clean marketplace are impacting ASPs. We see continued ASP expansion in our order book going forward. So very balanced. Again, single-digit rates of increase in footwear and in apparel. The apparel ASP is even expanding a little bit stronger than footwear, but both strong. And then, like I said, balanced with strong unit expansion in both footwear and apparel. Operator, we'll take the next question, please."

So that's a good signal right there. I think that the great story in Jordan is that we're managing the business more holistically between performance, product and retro. It's a clean market, a healthy market, particularly in North America. So we're in a good pull market situation now. We got great brand heat, I think, and that's really driven by strong product and storytelling. I mentioned Concorde of late, the collaboration was the great source of energy that was kind of unexpected. But incredible sell-through in energy, not just in Europe, but around the world. So I think the potential in Jordan is the return of growth in North America and on the energy and enthusiasm for the brand and the product around the world, including and maybe especially call out China there. And then we have more potential as we diversify the portfolio product, particularly around the Woman's offense in both footwear and in apparel. So again we're actually quite bullish on the future opportunities and continued growth for Jordan in the second half and beyond as we move into fiscal '20."

And again even the government to some extent, the Ministry of Sports in terms of our joint venture to sport participation. We're seeing incredibly strong demand for our product, the innovation that we're launching, our Basketball product, or Jordan product. And then, as we noted our Digital business, both our NIKE Digital ecosystem and through our partnership with Tmall is fueling extremely strong growth. We have not seen any impact from our business from some of the U.S., China dynamics that we are all reading about. We're mindful of those. But in the context of being mindful of those, we continue to see very strong momentum in China. As per Europe, very similar. Europe, we have great momentum.

Frankly, we're not taking a year-over-year incremental rate of growth approach to Digital. Looking out longer-term, we do see the potential to have Digital be the majority of our business. And as I noted, when we look to other industries which your referenced, other industries, consumer products industries, not just Digital or content industries, but other industries ranging from toys, electronics, books, et cetera, we see that in each of those industries, there was positive disruption that catalyzed that shift. And as a leader in our industry, we're going to continue to invest in the digital transformation of NIKE, and even more importantly, consumer-centric digital transformation of the industry. Some examples of that are the services that we're providing within our NIKE App, the sneaker's app, which really has been a sorts of explicit growth. Our membership program, which, we believe, is a uniquely compelling proposition within this industry in terms of the friction that it removes for consumers and the personalization that it gives our consumers. And then as Mark touched upon on the call, we think, driving digital penetration in our industry has also as quite a bit to do with leveraging the power of digital in the physical retail environment. And again, as we always have NIKE, we tend to catalyze that change by putting innovative new experiences into the market, that then catalyze the change not only within our own store base because that's something within our control base, that's just an example for the strategic wholesale partners that we've referenced. In terms of the expense, we would like to see them continue to evolve. So we're very ambitious, but we see that goal is very achievable when you look at benchmarks and other industries. So again it's less about when we would get to the 30%. It's more about our extreme confidence that, that we're going to go well beyond that number over the long term."

Using the insights that we gain in that connection that we have with female consumer, we're creating better product and we're seeing that reflected in the demand. The capsule collections that we've introduced in apparel was one, Tara was another capsule collection. Great response to those. I think it's relevant product in the end. Compelling relevant product is the foundation of that demand. And then, I think, the brand is actually speaking to women more directly and personally. And as I said in my remarks, that's going to be amped up throughout this 2019 as we head toward World Cup. You're going to see Just Do It with the big emphasis on women's.

Now in terms of where opportunity is, as Mark touched on, we've got a tremendous momentum, and that momentum is opening the aperture in terms of our vision in terms of where incremental growth is longer-term. The women's footwear and apparel market is 1.5x the size of the men's footwear and apparel market globally; and as you noted, it's less than a quarter of our revenue. So we see extraordinary potential to drive continued strong growth and even step change growth as we really do 2 things. Open the aperture in terms of the definition of sport, again that's with the sharp focus on women and movement activity. And then second, editing and more aggressively shifting resources within NIKE towards the women's opportunity.

Eliud Kipchoge smashed the Marathon World Record. Simone Byles dominated the world championships. Kylian Mbappé became a global star at the World Cup and LeBron James continued to inspire on and off the court. It was a year of incredible achievements for NIKE as well and Q2 was another strong proof point on our journey. We continue to show progress against our key long-term objectives of driving innovation, direct connections and speed and agility around the world. Our teams are doing a fantastic job of delivering sustainable, profitable growth through the Consumer Direct Offense, while aggressively pursuing our highest potential long-term opportunities. We set high goals and each success makes us hungry for more. The marketplace in which we compete is highly dynamic. Consumer expectations are accelerating and the macroeconomy is increasingly volatile. A key part of our strategy to win in this environment is to double down on digital. Our digital transformation is taking hold through a series of positive disruptions across the business. For example, we're leading the industry through a retail revolution. We're creating sports first, smart adaptive footwear. And we're investing in a global supply chain that delivers personnel at scale. It's all incredibly energizing and we find that the more disruptive we are, the more we grow. 
Our digital disruption is fueled by breaking old models, building new commerce partnerships, emerging new talent with our years of industry experience. Our teams are driving change and it's yielding excellent results. For the quarter, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 10%. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 14%. Gross margin was up 80 basis points to prior year and earnings per share was up 13% to prior year. Specific highlights include 9% growth in North America and nearly 20% constant currency growth in our international geographies. Digital growth of 41% on a constant currency basis and continued momentum in both sportswear and performance categories, including a return to growth in the Jordan business. The momentum we're driving is grounded in strong product innovation. We're increasing the pace of new concepts and bringing a new discipline to how we manage the life cycle of our innovation. We have a clear road map of how we stage our new platforms, giving each one the space to shine through high-energy storytelling and then ramping up scale and choice to serve diverse consumer needs. Put simply, we're increasing the return on investment in innovation. One of our great differentiators is, of course, NIKE Air. It's being energized through platforms like VaporMax and Air Max 270, 2 of the world's top-selling athletic footwear models. New interpretations of our icons, led by the Air Max 95 and 97. And this spring, we're excited to add a new distinct Air platform to the mix with the Air Max 270. The consumer is already anticipating its arrival and will keep the interest high through multiple iterations early in its product life cycle. 
NIKE React too will enter a new phase as we expand the platform beyond running and basketball into lifestyle product, with the Element 55; and the shoe of the year, the Element 87. Both styles will scale significantly in 2019. Next year, we'll also add NIKE React hybrids to combine multiple cushioning platforms, along with a redesigned Epic React 2.0 coming in spring. As we broaden platforms across categories, we're also broadening them across price points to bring them to more people. As we mentioned on our call -- last call, we see greater opportunities for moderately priced footwear from NIKE right now. So we're creating a more complete consumer offense for core footwear by creating performance and lifestyle icons and core-only innovations. At NIKE, it's our mission to make athletes better. But perhaps no innovation delivers on that promise by ZoomX and the Vaporfly 4%, which has dominated the world's marathons since 2017. We've started something special with the 4%, enabling a dramatic improvement for the world's best runners, and you can expect more exciting breakthroughs to come here. That reputation has made its way to every day athletes, making 4%, the most sought after shoe on race day, and it's created a halo effect for many of our NIKE's fast footwear styles, especially the Peg 35, driving double-digit growth in the running category in Q2. I'm excited to announce that in the New Year, we'll launch a new adaptive performance platform in Basketball at the $350 price point. We have a smart shoe designed for the perfect fit and it's a major step in advancing and connecting our digital transformation to product. This is just 1 better fit solution amongst many that we're working on. And we look forward to rolling them out throughout the year. We have a full innovation pipeline ahead, including new cushioning platforms, which will carry our strong product momentum into fiscal '20, all the way to Tokyo Olympics and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with the Olympics team and the Tokyo 2020 collection is the boldest we've ever assembled across performance and lifestyle in footwear and apparel. We're growing our competitive advantages in many ways. Sustainability is one example, where we're reducing waste at a scale that creates change for our entire industry. NIKE Flyleather made a 50% reclaimed leather, will scale to over 1 million pairs starting this summer. NIKE Flyknit represents a multi-billion dollar business and uses 60% less waste than traditional manufacturing. And NIKE Air uses 50% recycled manufacturing waste in hundreds of millions of pairs. As a whole, we're making great progress to lower our environmental impact as a company, driving greater efficiencies and fueling growth in our business. Another area where our 2X Innovation agenda is making a dramatic impact is in apparel. As designers, there is no greater challenge than innovating for the body in motion. We think about many things, such as how to account for different environments through moisture management, creating breathability that adapts as needed or keeping our gourmet comfortable, the climate comfortable when it's Through new materials and methods of make, our apparel teams are continuing to push the limits in performance silhouettes, and in the process, creating new style. Our strategy starts with taking sports into new places. For example, in basketball, our partnership with the NBA is fueling strong growth. Our NBA apparel accelerated in year 2, especially with our city editions jerseys, led by Miami, Minnesota and Brooklyn. And to no one 's surprise, LeBron has moved to the Lake, who has also created opportunity. We already booked 3x more NIKE lakers gear this year. And our work with the NBA has also created a lift for NIKE in line basketball apparel. We built on the success of our showtime hoodie and added Therma Flex pants, which has seen great sell-through. Overall, the traction we've gained for basketball in NIKE Direct and internationally led to strong global growth for the Basketball category this quarter. In sportswear, our biggest category apparel grew over 20% this quarter. Sportswear fleece and women's apparel were up double digits. In sportswear, we are anchoring our communications around head-to-toe collections, which makes it easier for consumers to shop to complete look and strengthens our presentation and storytelling. Apparel continues to be one of NIKE's greatest growth opportunities. And in the back half of the fiscal year, there's a lot to be excited about. We're launching new high-performance kits for the Woman's World Cup in France. Yoga collection, that includes men's yoga apparel for the first time at NIKE. New types innovation and expanded NIKE Tech Pack collection. 2 other areas of our business where we're accelerating, but we know we have much more opportunity ahead is Women's and Jordan. There's incredible momentum for women in sport right now as athletes elite and every day lead a movement of health and wellness, while driving a strong appetite for athletic footwear and apparel. This energy is manifesting in a number of ways. For example, footwear for women overall was up 20% for the quarter, and sneakers for her are really taking off with the Sage Air Force 1 emerging as for favorite franchise, owning the #1 spot on nike.com for 5 weeks running. Our edit to amplify strategy to offer more color and material choices and fewer styles is also proving successful. NIKE has the top 3 selling women's athletic footwear models above $125 with the Air Max 270, VaporMax and Epic React. And in apparel, our broad business remains a strong growth opportunity, up over 20% in Q2. Looking ahead to this summer's World Cup, NIKE will dominate on the pitch. A total of 14 of the 24 national teams will compete in NIKE, including the favorite U.S. national team. And throughout the year, we'll continue to -- our Just Do It campaign that celebrates elite and everyday female athletes around the world. We think 2019 is going to be a true tipping point for woman in sport with more participation, more coverage and overall more energy. Meanwhile, with the Jordan Brand, we're seeing positive results from the strategic shifts that we are making. In Q2, Jordan grew double digits and we returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. At the same time, we continued our pace of double-digit growth internationally. We're making great progress in diversifying Jordan. Apparel had a very strong quarter, especially internationally. Sell-through of the Jordan and PSG collaboration exceeded expectations and we'll come back with a refreshed collection in January. Jordan's performance footwear is also contributing to solid growth, led by the new Air Jordan XXXIII game shoe and the Max Aura that's doing well in China at $120 price point. And from a Sportswear perspective, we're elevating our storytelling with icons like the Air Jordan 1, which is more coveted than ever. At the start of Q3, our team executed an incredible effort with the most successful NIKE sneaker ever launched, with the Air Jordan XI Concord. It was a well-orchestrated plan, complete with geo targeting that offered preheat paris to our members, total integration across our business with partners like House of Hoops and Footaction and locally driven storytelling in our key cities. The Concord shows that the Jordan Brand yet again has the power to drive launches with incredible volume and create energy for the brand. We're bringing much greater balance to Jordan with much more opportunity ahead. In 2X Direct, we're beginning to realize a multiplying effect as we scale our most innovative experiences. This quarter, you could feel the momentum swing in the conversation around retail. We saw at over the Thanksgiving shopping week, fueling more than 30% increase in our digital business in North America for the quarter. In China, Singles Day once again broke records. NIKE earned a #1 sport brand on Tmall with our overall business for the day, up over 40% from last year's Singles Day. It's clear that the consumers craving experiences and the fastest way to meet that demand is to test, learn and scale new features. We know not every one of our new experiences will be successful and not all will be scalable. But when we do find features that improve our services, NIKE's advantage is how quickly we deploy them across our global footprint. In November, we opened our House of Innovation concept in both Shanghai and New York. The energy and performance at both locations has exceeded expectations. Both stores create the most personal and responsive retail environment in the industry. It's a digital experience brought to life in a physical space. And uses our most exciting features to date, such as the ability to scan barcodes to check availability and by the full look of mannequins, instant check out that requires no waiting at the register, expert studio that gives personal guidance, and special unlocks and notifications when members enter the store. The gateway for consumers to get the most value out of these new experiences is membership. We want more doors to feel like a personal home for members, where we can elevate one-to-one service. And we want to leverage mobile apps to make sure NIKE is serving our consumers wherever they are. One way we do that with members is to create ways to be in their path more organically. For example, the LeBron Watch, which will deliver 25% of the LeBron 16s in the marketplace this year makes these on court shoes available in the moment through sneakers and our partner mobile apps. In China, this month, we gave early access to the Kyrie 5 through a QR code and a live streamed NBA game on WeChat. And users can now buy directly on our NIKE Run Club and NIKE Training Club apps, personalized to the way they train. Another key to making NIKE commerce a part of people's lives more seamlessly again and again is to develop unique experiences with some of the world's most engaging and brand-friendly platforms. And this quarter, we did that with a new feature in Instagram, that allows NIKE product to be shopped directly from stores. On the Apple Watch, where we continue to serve our most active and highly-valued NIKE Run Club members. And with Google, where consumers can now buy directly from NIKE through search and Google Assistant. And to further leverage partnerships that amplify our brand, we're making great strides with strategic partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker, Nordstrom and Dick's Sporting Goods, where elevated experiences are driving outsized growth in the wholesale channel. We know that to fully leverage or fully offer consumers what they want in the moment requires a high level of agility in our business. And through 2X Speed, we're elevating the industry, creating an end-to-end value chain that's centered on the consumer. The pillars are demand sensing and insights, so we know our consumer, responsive product creation and manufacturing to provide the best product, delivery at speed for product to arrive when they wanted and connected inventory so they're never disappointed and starts with better demand sensing and insights. In Q2, our Express Lane business grew double digits, supporting key cities with hyperlocal product and faster fulfillment to drive higher full price sell-through. Responsive product creation and manufacturing has many components. Digital product creation allows for greater precision and creativity and design, planning and staging materials drastically reduces lead times and automation increases speed and quality in manufacturing. Today, more than half of our total footwear production has been modernized through initiatives started in the modernization centers of our top 6 manufacturing partners and our Advanced Product Creation Center at our world headquarters. We're also investing in delivery at speed. Take Singles Day as an example. To deliver against this massive opportunity, we had coordinated fulfillment strategy across our 12 Greater China distribution centers, and we shipped direct from over 50 retail doors to consumers on the day. Overall, we fulfilled over 5 million units in 5 days. And finally, our connected inventory strategy with partners like Zalando and JD will help us realize many of our Speed initiatives. In support of that initiative, we'll introduce RFID into footwear and all not licensed apparel in 2019. This will lead to vastly improve product visibility and accuracy across the supply chain from product creation to point-of-sale. And it further opens up the possibility to integrate more widely with our wholesale partners, contract factories and distribution centers. Each of these work streams is a building block for NIKE to become more personal at scale. And as a system, they demand enterprise-wide coordination and innovation. NIKE's ambitious digital transformation is driving the strong results you see today. We're staying competitive and opportunistic with every shift in the marketplace. As a leader, NIKE has high expectations. And as good as this quarter was, we know we have the ability to do much more. We're going to continue to use our scale, speed and agility to grow sport and our business around the world. Thanks. And now here's Andy"

Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency-neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year. Our strong",2933,"Thank you, Mark, and happy holidays, everyone. Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency-neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year. Our strong growth was also broad-based across all 4 of our geographies as well as across footwear, apparel, men's, women's and most categories. This broad-based momentum is not happening by accident, but rather is being fueled by our focus on what matters most to consumers globally. The common theme across our portfolio is the Consumer Direct Offense. More specifically, we are bringing the triple-double of 2X Innovation, 2X Direct and 2X Speed to life in our 12 key cities and 10 key countries around the world. Take innovation, for example. We've said we expect new innovation platforms to drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fact, year-to-date, new innovation platforms, including VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have driven over 80% of our incremental growth. Another significant contributor to our growth from a product perspective are our Power Franchises. By leveraging an approach that Mark calls editing to amplify, we're bringing new dimension and driving the growth of iconic franchises like the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. We do that, for example, through fresh new designs and collaborations for both men and women as well as color and material updates through our Express Lane. Our broad-based growth is also being fueled by new experiences that more directly connect NIKE to our consumers globally. We expect NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE experiences physical and digital will contribute over 50% of our incremental growth and outpace undifferentiated retail over the next 5 years, leading the way once again in Q2 with NIKE Digital. Our NIKE Digital ecosystem continues to grow faster than all other channels, growing 41% on a currency-neutral basis. And as we drive deeper, more organic, one-to-one engagement with consumers, mobile now represents well over 50% of our digital commerce revenue. Our 2X Speed initiative is also driving our momentum. Cutting our time to market in half is not an all or nothing proposition, we're already infusing greater speed and agility into our product creation and supply chain processes, allowing us to amplify what's working with the consumer closer to real time. For example, product updated and fulfilled through our Express Lane is growing double digits and now represents a double-digit percentage of our total business. This is significant as Express Lane product also largely sells through at full price, favorably impacting margins. 2X Speed also includes initiatives ranging from leveraging automation to a more focused materials power and material staging. These initiatives also reduce product cost and enhance inventory efficiency, the greater labor productivity and less waste. In short, we are very pleased with our strategic execution and the strong performance we have delivered to date. That said, more importantly, we are confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward. While FX headwinds have intensified, we now expect stronger currency-neutral revenue growth in fiscal year '19 than previously planned. And as we're beginning to gain greater insight into fiscal year '20, we're seeing continued strong demand. Our positive outlook is not merely optimism, but rather is founded on fundamental changes in how we operate at NIKE. 1 fundamental change is how we bring innovation to market. In addition to driving faster innovation cycles, we're also focused on innovation platforms that have greater potential to scale across geographies. Accordingly, as Mark detailed, we've an extraordinary pipeline of innovation to come over the balance of fiscal year '19 and throughout fiscal year '20. That begins in spring with the launch of the Air Max 720 and HyperAdapt in Basketball, and extends the innovation platforms launching in early fiscal year '20 and through and beyond the Tokyo Olympics. We're also digitally transforming NIKE and driving positive disruption in our industry, unlocking new opportunities for growth long term. While we already have extraordinary digital momentum, we're still in the early stages of this transformation. We are executing against a 3-year road map of new digital capabilities that will enable us to continually serve consumers better. We're aggressively building those capabilities in-house and accelerating our development of those capabilities through acquisition. Our 3-year road map also includes the global expansion of our digital ecosystem in the key cities and countries, where we see the greatest opportunity for growth. For example, just last month, we launched the NIKE App in Japan, where it immediately became the #1 rated shopping app. Over the next 5 years, we see the Consumer Direct Offense delivering on the financial model and measures of success we communicated at our Investor Day back in October 2017. But we are already setting our sights even higher longer term. We see the opportunity to expand the definition of sport, to be even more inclusive, including competition and training as well as movement and play. By using this broader lens to inspire and enable more active lifestyle, we will grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel. There are 4 areas where this purpose-driven approach to growth is creating outsized opportunities for us, international, digital, apparel and women's. The overall footwear and apparel industries in our international markets are already significantly larger in aggregate than in the U.S. That said, in international markets, the athletic segment of the overall footwear and apparel market has historically been less penetrated than in the U.S., but that is changing fast. Sport participation and culture continue to accelerate in international markets. And when sport grows, NIKE grows. China is perhaps the best current example of this phenomenon. And second, we said at our Investor Day, that digital owned and partnered, would comprise 30% of our business by 2023 as compared to roughly 15% of our business today. Frankly, we're already thinking bigger as we look longer term. Our industry has lagged many other industries in terms of digital penetration. Many consumer products industries are already at 50% digital penetration and projected to be well over 80% digital by 2030. We all know that disruptive new consumer-centric digital experiences have catalyzed the shift to digital in those industries. So as we increasingly innovate and lead with digital, we are intentionally disrupting our industry. We see this as positive disruption that widens the aperture for growth long term. We now see 30% digital penetration as just a milepost on our path to the majority of our business being digital. Third, apparel is another extraordinary opportunity for growth at NIKE. Apparel is a larger market in footwear globally. And at the same time, athletic apparel accounts for a smaller percentage of overall apparel than athletic accounts for within overall footwear. That dynamic is also changing fast. Consumers are increasingly choosing performance and sportswear apparel for more occasions as it better serves their more active and expressive lifestyle. And finally, as we aim to redefine and expand the definition of sport, that is with a sharp focus on women. Similar to the strong returns we are seeing from having doubled our investment in innovation, we see the potential for asymmetrical returns by editing and more aggressively shifting resources towards our women's business. The women's footwear and apparel markets are larger than men's. Yet today, women's represents less than 1/4 of NIKE's total revenue. And we're already on this journey, as our women's business grew double digits in Q2, but we see step change growth opportunities ahead by serving women more deeply within classifications and across more occasions for her. In short, we have strong current momentum and we have extraordinary growth potential long term. But before I share more specifics regarding our outlook, let's reflect on the drivers of our current momentum. NIKE Inc. Q2 revenue increased 10%, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. This exceptional growth reflects double-digit currency-neutral momentum internationally and strong high single-digit growth in North America. NIKE Digital was the fastest-growing channel in each geography with 41% growth in aggregate on a currency-neutral basis, again, led by mobile. That said, FX headwinds had a slightly larger impact on our reported revenue growth than the roughly 3 points we anticipated 90 days ago. We also delivered strong gross margin expansion of 80 basis points across NIKE Inc., fueled by NIKE Direct's growth and a higher mix of full price sales. Demand creation grew 4% in the quarter with our focus being on increasingly connecting with consumers through digital experiences and platforms. 
Operating overhead increased 18%, reflecting strategic investments that are accelerating NIKE's digital transformation and will fuel long-term growth. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. Second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.52, up 13% versus prior year. And as of November 30, inventories were up just 1%, reflecting a healthy pull market for NIKE and a lower mix of closeout across all geographies. Now let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 9% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew high single digits with NIKE Digital up well over 30% in North America. As Mark mentioned, we are now turning our vision for the next generation of retail into a reality. In our NIKE Live concept on Melrose, we're aligning data-driven, bi-weekly flow of the product to the store with digital storytelling and one-to-one connections between the store team and local consumers. As a result, the store is driving strong digital member acquisition, engagement and buying. And we're seeing even more impressive early results at our new House of Innovation in New York. While the overall retail marketplace in North America is still going through consolidation, and we do expect that to continue, our NIKE wholesale business in aggregate has returned to strong growth with improving profitability, led by our strategic retail partners, such as Foot Locker and increasingly JD. In Q2, we also reignited brand heat in North America through the Just Do It campaign that was launched in early September and by amplifying key moments in sport like the launch of the NBA season. We see our brand tee across both NIKE and Jordan, our strong pipeline of innovative product and digitally like consumer experiences continuing to fuel strong growth in North America. In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth across sportswear, running, training and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace growing over 30% versus prior year. We have extraordinary momentum in this geography as we're taking significant share and we're growing the market. We are mindful of the geopolitical dynamics in Europe. That said, we have a long track record of delivering growth and profitability amidst a wide range of macroeconomic circumstances. As we look ahead, we expect our momentum to continue in Europe. In all 5 of our key cities in EMEA, consumers rate us as the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand, and in fact, those ratings strengthened even further in Q2. We're connecting more directly and deeply with consumers locally through our key city focus and we're seeing the impact globally. For example, through the PSG-Jordan partnership, we connected authentically with consumers in Paris, while the product sold out at launch around the world. We also recently introduced the NIKE App at Retail and NIKE Town London as well as the sneaker's past experience in Paris, allowing consumers to reserve shoes from high heat launches and pick up in store. Those services are removing friction and personalizing the shopping experience, driving significant new member acquisition in 2 of our key global cities. Next, let's turn to Greater China, where yet, again, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in Q2. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in China. In Q2, growth accelerated to 31% on a currency-neutral basis with digital growing over 40%. As evidence of the scale and digital nature of this important market as well as the strength of the NIKE Brand, our sneakers app community in China, and recall that the sneakers app was launched just last year, it's already the same size as our sneakers community in North America. In Q2, with the opening of House of Innovation in Shanghai, we also began to more fully leverage digital in this largely NIKE-branded physical retail environment. It's still early days, but the results have been extraordinary. While there has been uncertainty of late regarding U.S., China relations, we have not seen any impact on our business. NIKE continues to win with the consumer in China. For over 3 decades, NIKE has been a brand of China, for China. We've connected deeply with the consumer here through our key city focus on Shanghai and Beijing. Through partnerships with sports federations, teams and athletes and by partnering with China's Ministry of Sport to fuel greater sport participation in schools across the country. In fact, just last month, leading up to the Shanghai Marathon, we took Eliud Kipchoge on a tour of Shanghai and other key cities. And then on Marathon Day, we launched a Shanghai-focused Just Do It campaign. In just the first 24 hours, the campaign was watched more than 16 million times. We are bullish about our potential to continue delivering strong, sustainable and very profitable growth in this important geography. In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis with balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel as well as double-digit growth in sportswear Jordan and NIKE basketball. NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 75%. We also continue to expand our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through commerce partnerships, such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart and others. APLA is a market in which we are extremely entrepreneurial, testing new concepts that leverage digital to enhance the consumer experience at retail. As we mentioned on our last call, we'll be opening a NIKE Live experience in Tokyo in Q3. And in Seoul, we are testing our connected inventory strategy. We have connected the inventory across 19 NIKE branded doors, including doors owned by 2 of our strategic partners. This connected inventory pilot has yielded very promising early results, serving thousands of consumers whose demand would otherwise have been unmet due to product being out of stock in a particular store. And finally at Converse, revenue increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2. Growth was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and a sharp acceleration in own digital growth globally, approaching triple digits. While Converse wholesale in the U.S. and U.K. remain challenged in Q2, Digital also accelerated in those markets. We see significant opportunity to grow Converse by expanding the product portfolio, including within Basketball as well as launching a new digital platform. And with that, let's turn to our outlook. There is increasing volatility and uncertainty of late on a macro level. That said, what is certain is that NIKE's execution of the consumer direct offense is driving consistently strong and sustainable broad-based growth across our diverse global portfolio. That is because we are focused on what matters most to consumers and they are responding globally with strong demand for NIKE. Accordingly, our full year guidance for fiscal year '19 reflects stronger currency-neutral revenue growth, stronger gross margin expansion and accelerated strategic investment. For the full year, we now expect currency-neutral revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range, potentially approaching low double digits. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported full year revenue growth to be over 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth. In other words, at the low end of the high single-digit range. For gross margin, our outlook has also improved. We expect our full year gross margin expansion to be roughly in line with the gross margin expansion of 70 basis points that we delivered over the first half of fiscal year '19. We expect SG&A for the full year to grow in the high single digits as we continue to invest in new digital capabilities that will differentiate NIKE and fuel our long-term growth. We project other expense, net of interest expense, to be between $50 million and $75 million for the full year. And we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens for fiscal year '19. That said, the finalization of regulations-related U.S. tax reform may result in discrete adjustments that impact our tax rate. While our focus is on sustaining profitable growth over the course of fiscal year '19 and for the long term, I will provide a bit of context on Q3 considering the current macro environment. In Q3, we expect strong currency-neutral revenue growth squarely within the high single-digit range. Based on FX dynamics, our reported real dollar revenue growth will likely be roughly 4 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth in Q3. For gross margin, we expect Q3 expansion to be roughly in line with our full year guidance. As for SG&A, we expect growth in the low-double digit range in Q3 as we continue to prioritize strategic investment. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be between 16% and 18%. Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is driving consistently strong performance. Yet, we are still in the early stages. As we continue to execute, we're not only building current momentum, we're also gaining greater insight into NIKE's potential to transform the industry, drive sustainable growth and create extraordinary value for shareholders long term. With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

We are expecting our gross margin to be better in the second half of the year. And as you note in our reported results, it was slightly better than we expected in Q2. We're seeing structural benefits to our margin from our over-indexing growth in Direct, which has had very strong momentum and momentum that's exceeded our expectations, specifically in digital as well as a greater mix of premium innovative product and stronger full price sell-through. We're also benefiting from a clean marketplace, particularly for NIKE. So as noted in my remarks, we do have an improved outlook for '19 with our expansion been roughly in line with the year-to-date margin expansion of 70 basis points. And as we noted when we entered the year, we expect that the second half margin to be stronger than the first half. And in the first quarter, our margin expansion was lesser than in the second quarter. I would note that in any given quarter, there can be anomalies that impact margin. And finally, I'd note that, Q2 is a quarter in which our margin is historically lower. Q3 and Q4, we have higher margin. And so the expansion we expect in the third and fourth quarters is actually strong expansion on an already relatively higher quarterly margin. And then you asked about ASP and units. What I would note is that ASPs were up across our portfolio in both footwear and apparel. Again, new innovation, strong full price sell-through, our shift to Direct, clean marketplace are impacting ASPs. We see continued ASP expansion in our order book going forward. And so very balanced. Again, single-digit rates of increase in footwear and in apparel, with apparel ASP is even expanding a little bit stronger than footwear, but both strong. And then, like I said, balanced with strong unit expansion in both footwear and apparel. Operator, we'll take the next question, please."

So I think the potential in Jordan is the return to growth in North America and on the energy and the enthusiasm for the brand and the product around the world, and including and maybe I'll especially call out China there. And then, we have more potential as we diversify the portfolio of product, particularly around the Woman's offense in both footwear and in apparel. So again we're actually quite bullish on the future opportunities and continued growth for Jordan in the second half and beyond as we move into fiscal '20."

We're seeing incredibly strong demand for our product, the innovation that we're launching, our Basketball product, our Jordan product. And then, as we've noted, our Digital business, both our NIKE Digital ecosystem and through our partnership with Tmall is fueling extremely strong growth. We have not seen any impact from our business from some of the U.S., China dynamics that we're all reading about. We're mindful of those. But in the context of being mindful of those, we continue to see very strong signs of momentum in China. As per Europe, very similar. Europe, we have great momentum.

Frankly, we're not taking a year-over-year incremental rate of growth approach to Digital. Looking out longer-term, we do see the potential to have Digital be the majority of our business. And as I noted, when we look to other industries, which you referenced, other industries, consumer products industries, not just Digital or content industries, but other industries ranging from toys to electronics, books, et cetera, we see that in each of those industries, there was positive disruption that catalyzed that shift. And as the leader in our industry, we're going to continue to invest in this digital transformation of NIKE, and even more importantly, a consumer-centric digital transformation of the industry. Some examples of that are the services that we're providing within our NIKE App, the sneaker's app, which really has been a source of explosive growth. Our membership program, which, we believe, is a uniquely compelling proposition within this industry in terms of the friction that it removes for consumers and the personalization that it gives our consumers. And then as Mark touched upon on the call, we think, driving digital penetration in our industry also has quite a bit to do with leveraging the power of digital in the physical retail environment. And again, as we always have as NIKE, we tend to catalyze that change by putting innovative new experiences into the market, that then catalyze the change not only within our owned store base because that's something within our control but that's an example for the strategic wholesale partners that we've referenced. In terms of the experience, we would like to see them continue to evolve. So we're very ambitious, but we see the goals is very achievable when you look at benchmarks in other industries. So again it's less about when we would get to the 30%. And it's more about our extreme confidence that, that we're going to go well beyond that number over the long term."

Using the insights that we gain in that connection that we have with the female consumer, we're creating better product and we're seeing that reflected in the demand. The capsule collections that we've introduced in apparel Nike Metallic Sheen was one, Terra Perma was another capsule collection. Great response to those. I think it's relevant product in the end. Compelling relevant product is the foundation of that demand. And then, I think, the brand is actually speaking to women more directly and personally. And as I said in my remarks, that's going to be amped up throughout this 2019 as we head towards World Cup. You're going to see Just Do It with a big emphasis on women's. And then sports is affecting lifestyle and fashion in a way that we're seeing dramatic impacts around the world.

Now in terms of where opportunity is, as Mark touched on, we've got tremendous momentum, and that momentum is opening the aperture in terms of our vision in terms of where incremental growth is longer-term. The women's footwear and apparel market is 1.5x the size of the men's footwear and apparel market globally; and as you noted, it's less than 1/4 of our revenue. So we see extraordinary potential to drive continued strong growth and even step change growth as we really do 2 things, open the aperture in terms of the definition of sport, again, that's with a sharp focus on women and movement and activity. And then second, editing and more aggressively shifting resources within NIKE towards the women's opportunity. So in short, we've got great momentum in the women's business, but we're chasing something much bigger.

We've seen some amazing highlights in sports this past year. Eliud Kipchoge smashed the Marathon World Record. Simone Biles dominated the world championships.

Eliud Kipchoge smashed the Marathon World Record. Simone Biles dominated the world championships. Kylian Mbappé became a global star at the World Cup and LeBron James continued to inspire on and off the court. 
It was a year of incredible achievements for NIKE as well and Q2 was another strong proof point on our journey. We continue to show progress against our key long-term objectives of driving innovation, direct connections and speed and agility around the world. 
Our teams are doing a fantastic job of delivering sustainable, profitable growth through the Consumer Direct Offense, while aggressively pursuing our highest potential long-term opportunities. We set high goals and each success makes us hungry for more. 
The marketplace in which we compete is highly dynamic. Consumer expectations are accelerating and the macro-economy is increasingly volatile. A key part of our strategy to win in this environment is to double down on digital. Our digital transformation is taking hold through a series of positive disruptions across the business. For example, we're leading the industry through a retail revolution. We're creating sports first smart adaptive footwear. And we're investing in a global supply chain that delivers personal at scale. It's all incredibly energizing and we find that the more disruptive we are, the more we grow. 
Our digital disruption is fueled by breaking old models, building new commerce partnerships, emerging new talent with our years of industry experience. Our teams are driving change and it's yielding excellent results. 
For the quarter, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 10%. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 14%. Gross margin was up 80 basis points to prior year and earnings per share was up 13% to prior year. 
Specific highlights include 9% growth in North America and nearly 20% constant currency growth in our international geographies. Digital growth of 41% on a constant currency basis and continued momentum in both sportswear and performance categories, including a return to growth in the Jordan business. 
The momentum we're driving is grounded in strong product innovation. We're increasing the pace of new concepts and bringing a new discipline to how we manage the life cycle of our innovation. We have a clear road map of how we stage our new platforms, giving each one the space to shine through high-energy storytelling and then ramping up scale and choice to serve diverse consumer needs. Put simply, we're increasing the return on investment in innovation. 
One of our great differentiators is, of course, NIKE Air. It's being energized through platforms like VaporMax and Air Max [ 270 ], 2 of the world's top-selling athletic footwear models. New interpretations of our icons, led by the Air Max 95 and 97. And this spring, we're excited to add a new distinct Air platform to the mix with the Air Max 270. The consumer is already anticipating its arrival and will keep the interest high through multiple iterations early in its product life cycle. 
NIKE React too will enter a new phase as we expand the platform beyond running and basketball into lifestyle product, with the Element 55; and the shoe of the year, the Element 87. Both styles will scale significantly in 2019. Next year, we'll also add NIKE React hybrids that combine multiple cushioning platforms, along with a redesigned Epic React 2.0 coming in spring. 
As we broaden platforms across categories, we're also broadening them across price points to bring them to more people. As we mentioned on our call -- last call, we see greater opportunities for moderately priced footwear from NIKE right now. So we're creating a more complete consumer offense for core footwear by creating performance and lifestyle icons and core-only innovations. 
At NIKE, it's our mission to make athletes better. But perhaps no innovation delivers on that promise like ZoomX and the VaporFly 4%, which has dominated the world's marathons since 2017. We've started something special with the 4%, enabling a dramatic improvement for the world's best runners, and you can expect more exciting breakthroughs to come here. 
That reputation has made its way to everyday athletes, making 4%, the most sought after shoe on race day, and it's created a halo effect for many of our NIKE's fast footwear styles, especially the Peg 35, driving double-digit growth in the running category in Q2. 
I'm excited to announce that in the New Year, we'll launch a new adaptive performance platform in Basketball at the $350 price point. We have a smart shoe designed for the perfect fit and it's a major step in advancing and connecting our digital transformation to product. This is just one better fit solution amongst many that we're working on. And we look forward to rolling them out throughout the year. 
We have a full innovation pipeline ahead including new cushioning platforms which will carry our strong product momentum into fiscal '20, all the way to Tokyo Olympics and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with the Olympics team and the Tokyo 2020 collection is the boldest we've ever assembled across performance and lifestyle in footwear and apparel. We're growing our competitive advantages in many ways. Sustainability is one example, where we're reducing waste at a scale that creates change for our entire industry. NIKE Flyleather made a 50% reclaimed leather, will scale to over 1 million pairs starting this summer. NIKE Flyknit represents a multibillion dollar business and uses 60% less waste than traditional manufacturing. And NIKE Air uses 50% recycled manufacturing waste in hundreds of millions of pairs. As a whole, we're making great progress to lower our environmental impact as a company, driving greater efficiencies and fueling growth in our business. 
Another area where our 2X Innovation agenda is making a dramatic impact is in apparel. As designers, there is no greater challenge than innovating for the body in motion. We think about many things, such as how to account for different environments through moisture management, creating breathability that adapts as needed or keeping a garment comfortable when it's twisting and turning. Through new materials and methods of make, our apparel teams are continuing to push the limits in performance silhouettes, and in the process, creating new style. 
Our strategy starts with taking sports into new places. For example, in basketball, our partnership with the NBA is fueling strong growth. Our NBA apparel accelerated in year 2, especially with our city editions jerseys, led by Miami, Minnesota and Brooklyn. And to no one's surprise, LeBron's moved to the Lakers has also created opportunity. We already booked 3x more NIKE Lakers gear this year. And our work with the NBA has also created a lift for NIKE inline basketball apparel. We built on the success of our Showtime hoodie and added Therma Flex pants, which have seen great sell-through. 
Overall, the traction we've gained for basketball in NIKE Direct and internationally led to strong global growth for the Basketball category this quarter. 
In Sportswear, our biggest category apparel grew over 20% this quarter. Sportswear fleece and women's apparel were up double digits. In Sportswear, we're anchoring our communications around head-to-toe collections, which makes it easier for consumers to shop the complete look and strengthens our presentation and storytelling. 
Apparel continues to be one of NIKE's greatest growth opportunities. And in the back half of the fiscal year, there's a lot to be excited about. We're launching new high-performance kits for the Woman's World Cup in France. A yoga collection, that includes men's yoga apparel for the first time at NIKE. New tights innovation, and expanded NIKE Tech Pack collection. 
2 other areas of our business where we're accelerating, but we know we have much more opportunity ahead, is Women's and Jordan. There's incredible momentum for women in sport right now as athletes, elite and everyday, lead a movement of health and wellness, while driving a strong appetite for athletic footwear and apparel. 
This energy is manifesting in a number of ways. For example, footwear for women overall was up 20% for the quarter, and Sneakers For Her are really taking off with the Sage Air Force 1 emerging as her favorite franchise, owning the #1 spot on nike.com for 5 weeks running. 
Our Edit to Amplify strategy to offer more color and material choices and fewer styles is also proving successful. NIKE has the top 3 selling women's athletic footwear models above $125 with the Air Max 270, VaporMax and Epic React. And in apparel, our broad business remains a strong growth opportunity, up over 20% in Q2. 
Looking ahead to this summer's World Cup, NIKE will dominate on the pitch. A total of 14 of the 24 national teams will compete in NIKE, including the favorite U.S. national team. And throughout the year, we'll continue to -- our Just Do It campaign that celebrates elite and everyday female athletes around the world. 
We think 2019 is going to be a true tipping point for woman in sport with more participation, more coverage and overall more energy. 
Meanwhile, with the Jordan Brand, we're seeing positive results from the strategic shifts that we're making. In Q2, Jordan grew double digit and we returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. At the same time, we've continued our pace of double-digit growth internationally. We're making great progress in diversifying Jordan. Apparel had a very strong quarter, especially internationally. Sell-through of the Jordan and PSG collaboration exceeded expectations and we'll come back with a refreshed collection in January. 
Jordan's performance footwear is also contributing to solid growth, led by the new Air Jordan XXXIII game shoe and the Max Aura that's doing well in China at $120 price point. And from a Sportswear perspective, we're elevating our storytelling with icons like the Air Jordan 1, which is more coveted than ever. 
At the start of Q3, our team executed an incredible effort with the most successful NIKE sneaker ever launched, with the Air Jordan XI Concord. It was a well-orchestrated plan, complete with geo targeting that offered preheat Paris to our members, total integration across our business with partners like House of Hoops and Footaction and locally driven storytelling in our key cities. 
The Concord shows that the Jordan Brand yet again has the power to drive launches with incredible volume and create energy for the brand. We're bringing much greater balance to Jordan with much more opportunity ahead. 
In 2X Direct, we're beginning to realize a multiplying effect as we scale our most innovative experiences. This quarter, you could feel the momentum swing in the conversation around retail. We saw it over the Thanksgiving shopping week, fueling more than 30% increase in our digital business in North America for the quarter. 
In China, Singles Day once again broke records. NIKE earned the #1 sport brand on Tmall with our overall business for the day, up over 40% from last year's Singles Day. It's clear that the consumers' craving experiences and the fastest way to meet that demand is to test, learn and scale new features. We know not every one of our new experiences will be successful and not all will be scalable but when we do find features that improve our services, NIKE's advantage is how quickly we deploy them across our global footprint. 
In November, we opened our House of Innovation concept in both Shanghai and New York. The energy and performance at both locations has exceeded expectations. Both stores create the most personal and responsive retail environment in the industry. It's a digital experience brought to life in a physical space and uses our most exciting features to date, such as the ability to scan barcodes to check availability and by the full look of mannequins, instant check out that requires no waiting at a register, expert studio that gives personal guidance, and special unlocks and notifications when members enter the store. 
The gateway for consumers to get the most value out of these new experiences is membership. We want more doors to feel like a personal home for members, where we can elevate one-to-one service. And we want to leverage mobile apps to make sure NIKE is serving our consumers wherever they are. One way we do that with members is to create ways to be in their path more organically. For example, the LeBron Watch, which will deliver 25% of the LeBron 16s in the marketplace this year, makes his on-court shoes available in the moment through sneakers and our partner mobile apps. 
In China, this month, we gave early access to the Kyrie 5 through a QR code and a live streamed NBA game on WeChat. And users can now buy directly on our NIKE Run Club and NIKE Training Club apps, personalized to the way they train. 
Another key to making NIKE commerce a part of people's lives more seamlessly again and again is to develop unique experiences with some of the world's most engaging and brand-friendly platforms. And this quarter, we did that with a new feature in Instagram, that allows NIKE product to be shopped directly from stores, on the Apple Watch, where we continue to serve our most active and highly-valued NIKE Run Club members. And with Google, where consumers can now buy directly from NIKE through search and Google Assistant.
 And to further leverage partnerships that amplify our brand, we're making great strides with strategic partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker, Nordstrom and DICK'S Sporting Goods, where elevated experiences are driving outsized growth in the wholesale channel. We know that to fully leverage or fully offer consumers what they want in the moment requires a high level of agility in our business. And through 2X Speed, we're elevating the industry, creating an end-to-end value chain that's centered on the consumer. The pillars are demand-sensing and insights, so we know our consumer, responsive product creation and manufacturing to provide the best product, delivery at speed for product to arrive when they want it and connected inventory so they're never disappointed. And it starts with better demand sensing and insights. 
In Q2, our Express Lane business grew double digits, supporting key cities with hyperlocal product and faster fulfillment to drive higher full price sell-through. Responsive product creation and manufacturing has many components. Digital product creation allows for greater precision and creativity and design, planning and staging materials drastically reduces lead times and automation increases speed and quality in manufacturing. 
To date, more than half of our total footwear production has been modernized through initiatives started in the modernization centers of our top 6 manufacturing partners and our Advanced Product Creation Center at our world headquarters. 
We're also investing in delivery at speed. Take Singles Day as an example. To deliver against this massive opportunity, we had coordinated fulfillment strategy across our 12 Greater China distribution centers, and we shipped direct from over 50 retail doors to consumers on the day. Overall, we fulfilled over 5 million units in 5 days. 
And finally, our connected inventory strategy with partners like Zalando and JD will help us realize many of our speed initiatives. In support of that initiative, we'll introduce RFID into footwear and all nonlicensed apparel in 2019. This will lead to vastly improved product visibility and accuracy across the supply chain from product creation to point-of-sale. And it further opens up the possibility to integrate more widely with our wholesale partners, contract factories and distribution centers. 
Each of these work streams is a building block for NIKE to become more personal at scale. And as a system, they demand enterprise-wide coordination and innovation. NIKE's ambitious digital transformation is driving the strong results you see today. We're staying competitive and opportunistic with every shift in the marketplace. As a leader, NIKE has high expectations. And as good as this quarter was, we know we have the ability to do much more. We're going to continue to use our scale, speed and agility to grow sport and our business around the world. 
Thanks. And now here's Andy"

Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency-neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year. Our strong",2938,"Thank you, Mark, and happy holidays, everyone. Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency-neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year. Our strong growth was also broad-based across all 4 of our geographies as well as across footwear, apparel, men's, women's and most categories. This broad-based momentum is not happening by accident, but rather is being fueled by our focus on what matters most to consumers globally. 
The common theme across our portfolio is the Consumer Direct Offense. More specifically, we are bringing the triple-double of 2X Innovation, 2X Direct and 2X Speed to life in our 12 key cities and 10 key countries around the world. Take innovation, for example. We've said we expect new innovation platforms to drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fact, year-to-date, new innovation platforms, including VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have driven over 80% of our incremental growth. 
Another significant contributor to our growth from a product perspective are our Power Franchises. By leveraging an approach that Mark calls, editing to amplify, we're bringing new dimension and driving the growth of iconic franchises like the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. We do that, for example, through fresh new designs and collaborations for both men and women as well as color and material updates through our Express Lane. 
Our broad-based growth is also being fueled by new experiences that more directly connect NIKE to our consumers globally. We expect NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE experiences, physical and digital, will contribute over 50% of our incremental growth and outpace undifferentiated retail over the next 5 years, leading the way once again in Q2 with NIKE Digital. Our NIKE Digital ecosystem continues to grow faster than all other channels, growing 41% on a currency-neutral basis. And as we drive deeper, more organic, one-to-one engagement with consumers, mobile now represents well over 50% of our digital commerce revenue. 
Our 2X Speed initiative is also driving our momentum. Cutting our time to market in half is not an all or nothing proposition, we're already infusing greater speed and agility into our product creation and supply chain processes, allowing us to amplify what's working with the consumer closer to real time. For example, product updated and fulfilled through our Express Lane is growing double digits and now represents a double-digit percentage of our total business. This is significant as Express Lane product also largely sells through at full price, favorably impacting margins. 
2X Speed also includes initiatives ranging from leveraging automation to a more focused materials pallette and materials staging. These initiatives also reduce product cost and enhance inventory efficiency, a greater labor productivity and less waste. In short, we are very pleased with our strategic execution and the strong performance we have delivered to date. That said, more importantly, we are confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward. 
While FX headwinds have intensified, we now expect stronger currency-neutral revenue growth in fiscal year '19 than previously planned. And as we're beginning to gain greater insight into fiscal year '20, we're seeing continued strong demand. Our positive outlook is not merely optimism, but rather is founded on fundamental changes in how we operate at NIKE. One fundamental change is in how we bring innovation to market. In addition to driving faster innovation cycles, we're also focused on innovation platforms that have greater potential to scale across geographies. Accordingly, as Mark detailed, we've an extraordinary pipeline of innovation to come, over the balance of fiscal year '19 and throughout fiscal year '20. That begins in spring with the launch of the Air Max 720 and HyperAdapt in Basketball, and extends to innovation platforms launching in early fiscal year '20 and through and beyond the Tokyo Olympics. 
We're also digitally transforming NIKE and driving positive disruption in our industry, unlocking new opportunities for growth long term. While we already have extraordinary digital momentum, we're still in the early stages of this transformation. We are executing against a 3-year road map of new digital capabilities that will enable us to continually serve consumers better. We're aggressively building those capabilities in-house and accelerating our development of those capabilities through acquisition. 
Our 3-year road map also includes the global expansion of our digital ecosystem in the key cities and countries where we see the greatest opportunity for growth. For example, just last month, we launched the NIKE App in Japan, where it immediately became the #1 rated shopping app. 
Over the next 5 years, we see the Consumer Direct Offense delivering on the financial model and measures of success we communicated at our Investor Day back in October 2017. But we are already setting our sights even higher longer term. We see the opportunity to expand the definition of sport, to be even more inclusive, including competition and training as well as movement and play. By using this broader lens to inspire and enable a more active lifestyle, we will grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel. 
There are 4 areas where this purpose-driven approach to growth is creating outsized opportunities for us: international, digital, apparel and women's. The overall footwear and apparel industries in our international markets are already significantly larger in aggregate than in the U.S. That said, in international markets, the athletic segment of the overall footwear and apparel market has historically been less penetrated than in the U.S., but that is changing fast. Sport participation and culture continue to accelerate in international markets. And when sport grows, NIKE grows. China is perhaps the best current example of this phenomenon. 
And second, we said at our Investor Day, that digital, owned and partnered, would comprise 30% of our business by 2023 as compared to roughly 15% of our business today. Frankly, we're already thinking bigger as we look longer term. Our industry has lagged many other industries in terms of digital penetration. Many consumer products industries are already at 50% digital penetration and projected to be well over 80% digital by 2030. We all know that disruptive new consumer-centric digital experiences have catalyzed the shift to digital in those industries. So as we increasingly innovate and lead with digital, we are intentionally disrupting our industry. We see this as positive disruption that widens the aperture for growth long term. We now see 30% digital penetration as just a milepost on our path to the majority of our business being digital. 
Third, apparel is another extraordinary opportunity for growth at NIKE. Apparel is a larger market in footwear globally. And at the same time, athletic apparel accounts for a smaller percentage of overall apparel than athletic accounts for within overall footwear. That dynamic is also changing fast. Consumers are increasingly choosing performance and sportswear apparel for more occasions as it better serves their more active and expressive lifestyle. 
And finally, as we aim to redefine and expand the definition of sport, that is with a sharp focus on women. Similar to the strong returns we are seeing from having doubled our investment in innovation, we see the potential for asymmetrical returns by editing and more aggressively shifting resources towards our women's business. The women's footwear and apparel markets are larger than men's. Yet today, women's represents less than 1/4 of NIKE's total revenue. And we're already on this journey, as our women's business grew double digits in Q2, but we see step-change growth opportunities ahead by serving women more deeply within classifications and across more occasions for her. In short, we have strong current momentum and we have extraordinary growth potential long term. 
But before I share more specifics regarding our outlook, let's reflect on the drivers of our current momentum. NIKE Inc. Q2 revenue increased 10%, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. This exceptional growth reflects double-digit currency-neutral momentum internationally and strong high single-digit growth in North America. 
NIKE Digital was the fastest-growing channel in each geography with 41% growth in aggregate on a currency-neutral basis, again, led by mobile. That said, FX headwinds had a slightly larger impact on our reported revenue growth than the roughly 3 points we anticipated 90 days ago. 
We also delivered strong gross margin expansion of 80 basis points across NIKE Inc., fueled by NIKE Direct's growth and a higher mix of full price sales. Demand creation grew 4% in the quarter with our focus being on increasingly connecting with consumers through digital experiences and platforms. 
Operating overhead increased 18%, reflecting strategic investments that are accelerating NIKE's digital transformation and will fuel long-term growth. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. 
Second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.52, up 13% versus prior year. And as of November 30, inventories were up just 1%, reflecting a healthy pull market for NIKE and a lower mix of closeout across all geographies. N
ow let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 9% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew high single digits with NIKE Digital up well over 30% in North America. As Mark mentioned, we are now turning our vision for the next generation of retail into a reality. In our NIKE Live concept on Melrose, we're aligning data-driven, bi-weekly flows of the product to the store with digital storytelling and one-to-one connections between the store team and local consumers. As a result, the store is driving strong digital member acquisition, engagement and buying. And we're seeing even more impressive early results at our new House of Innovation in New York. 
While the overall retail marketplace in North America is still going through consolidation, and we do expect that to continue, our NIKE wholesale business in aggregate has returned to strong growth with improving profitability, led by our strategic retail partners, such as Foot Locker and increasingly JD. In Q2, we also reignited brand heat in North America through the Just Do It campaign that was launched in early September and by amplifying key moments in sport like the launch of the NBA season. 
We see our brand tee across both NIKE and Jordan, our strong pipeline of innovative product and digitally [ like ] consumer experiences continuing to fuel strong growth in North America. 
In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth across sportswear, running, training and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace growing over 30% versus prior year. We have extraordinary momentum in this geography as we're taking significant share and we're growing the market. We are mindful of the geopolitical dynamics in Europe, that said, we have a long track record of delivering growth and profitability amidst a wide range of macroeconomic circumstances. As we look ahead, we expect our momentum to continue in Europe. 
In all 5 of our key cities in EMEA, consumers rate us as the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand, and in fact, those ratings strengthened even further in Q2. We're connecting more directly and deeply with consumers locally through our key city focus and we're seeing the impact globally. For example, through the PSG-Jordan partnership, we connected authentically with consumers in Paris, while the product sold out at launch around the world. 
We also recently introduced the NIKE App at Retail and NIKE Town London as well as the sneaker's past experience in Paris, allowing consumers to reserve shoes from high heat launches and pick up in store. Those services are removing friction and personalizing the shopping experience, driving significant new member acquisition in 2 of our key global cities. 
Next, let's turn to Greater China, where yet again, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in Q2. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in China. In Q2, growth accelerated to 31% on a currency-neutral basis with digital growing over 40%. As evidence of the scale and digital nature of this important market as well as the strength of the NIKE Brand, our sneakers app community in China -- and recall that the sneakers app was launched just last year, is already the same size as our sneakers' community in North America. 
In Q2, with the opening of House of Innovation in Shanghai, we also began to more fully leverage digital in this largely NIKE-branded physical retail environment. It's still early days, but the results have been extraordinary. 
While there has been uncertainty of late regarding U.S., China relations, we have not seen any impact on our business. NIKE continues to win with the consumer in China. For over 3 decades, NIKE has been a brand of China, for China. We've connected deeply with the consumer here through our key city focus on Shanghai and Beijing. Through partnerships with sports federations, teams and athletes and by partnering with China's Ministry of Sport to fuel greater sport participation in schools across the country. In fact, just last month, leading up to the Shanghai Marathon, we took Eliud Kipchoge on a tour of Shanghai and other key cities. And then on Marathon Day, we launched a Shanghai-focused Just Do It campaign. In just the first 24 hours, the campaign was watched more than 16 million times. We are bullish about our potential to continue delivering strong, sustainable and very profitable growth in this important geography. 
In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis with balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel as well as double-digit growth in sportswear Jordan and NIKE basketball. NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 75%. We also continue to expand our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through commerce partnerships, such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart and others. APLA is a market in which we are extremely entrepreneurial, testing new concepts that leverage digital to enhance the consumer experience at retail. As we mentioned on our last call, we'll be opening a NIKE Live experience in Tokyo in Q3. And in Seoul, we are testing our connected inventory strategy. We have connected the inventory across 19 NIKE branded doors, including doors owned by 2 of our strategic partners. This connected inventory pilot has yielded very promising early results, serving thousands of consumers whose demand would otherwise have been unmet due to product being out of stock in a particular store. 
And finally at Converse, revenue increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2. Growth was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and a sharp acceleration in own digital growth globally, approaching triple digits. While Converse wholesale in the U.S. and U.K. remain challenged in Q2, Digital also accelerated in those markets. We see significant opportunity to grow Converse by expanding the product portfolio, including within Basketball, as well as launching a new digital platform.
And with that, let's turn to our outlook. There is increasing volatility and uncertainty of late on a macro level. That said, what is certain is that NIKE's execution of the consumer direct offense is driving consistently strong and sustainable broad-based growth across our diverse global portfolio. That is because we are focused on what matters most to consumers and they are responding globally with strong demand for NIKE. Accordingly, our full year guidance for fiscal year '19 reflects stronger currency-neutral revenue growth, stronger gross margin expansion and accelerated strategic investment. 
For the full year, we now expect currency-neutral revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range, potentially approaching low double digits. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported full year revenue growth to be over 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth. In other words, at the low end of the high single-digit range. 
For gross margin, our outlook has also improved. We expect our full year gross margin expansion to be roughly in line with the gross margin expansion of 70 basis points that we delivered over the first half of fiscal year '19. We expect SG&A for the full year to grow in the high single digits as we continue to invest in new digital capabilities that will differentiate NIKE and fuel our long-term growth. 
We project other expense, net of interest expense, to be between $50 million and $75 million for the full year. And we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens for fiscal year '19. That said, the finalization of regulations-related U.S. tax reform may result in discrete adjustments that impact our tax rate. 
While our focus is on sustaining profitable growth over the course of fiscal year '19 and for the long term, I will provide a bit of context on Q3 considering the current macro environment. In Q3, we expect strong currency-neutral revenue growth squarely within the high single-digit range. Based on FX dynamics, our reported real dollar revenue growth will likely be roughly 4 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth in Q3. For gross margin, we expect Q3 expansion to be roughly in line with our full year guidance. As for SG&A, we expect growth in the low-double digit range in Q3 as we continue to prioritize strategic investment. 
And finally, we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be between 16% and 18%. Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is driving consistently strong performance. Yet, we are still in the early stages. As we continue to execute, we're not only building current momentum, we're also gaining greater insight into NIKE's potential to transform the industry, drive sustainable growth and create extraordinary value for shareholders long term. 
With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

And then, maybe just talk to us a little bit about how much of the 9% growth in North America has been driven by ASP versus units?

We are expecting our gross margin to be better in the second half of the year. And as you note in our reported results, it was slightly better than we expected in Q2. We're seeing structural benefits to our margin from our over-indexing growth in Direct, which has had very strong momentum and momentum that's exceeded our expectations, specifically in digital as well as a greater mix of premium innovative product and stronger full price sell-through. We're also benefiting from a clean marketplace, particularly for NIKE. So as noted in my remarks, we do have an improved outlook for '19 with our expansion being roughly in line with the year-to-date margin expansion of 70 basis points. And as we noted when we entered the year, we expect that the second half margin to be stronger than the first half. And in the first quarter, our margin expansion was lesser than in the second quarter. I would note that in any given quarter, there can be anomalies that impact margin. And finally, I'd note that, Q2 is a quarter in which our margin is historically lower. Q3 and Q4, we have higher margin. And so the expansion we expect in the third and fourth quarters is actually strong expansion on an already relatively higher quarterly margin. And then you asked about ASP and units. What I would note is that ASPs were up across our portfolio in both footwear and apparel. Again, new innovation, strong full price sell-through, our shift to Direct, clean marketplace, are impacting ASPs. We see continued ASP expansion in our order book going forward. So very balanced. Again, single-digit rates of increase in footwear and in apparel, apparel ASP is even expanding a little bit stronger than footwear, but both strong. And then, like I said, balanced with strong unit expansion in both footwear and apparel. Operator, we'll take the next question, please."

The PSG collaboration was a great source of energy that was kind of unexpected. But incredible sell-through in energy, not just in Europe, but around the world. So I think the potential in Jordan is the return to growth in North America and on the energy and the enthusiasm for the brand and the product around the world, including and maybe I'll especially call out China there. And then we have more potential as we diversify the portfolio of product, particularly around the Woman's offense in both footwear and in apparel.

We're seeing incredibly strong demand for our product, the innovation that we're launching, our Basketball product, our Jordan product. And then, as we've noted, our Digital business, both our NIKE Digital ecosystem and through our partnership with Tmall is fueling extremely strong growth. We have not seen any impact from our business from some of the U.S., China dynamics that we're all reading about. We're mindful of those. But in the context of being mindful of those, we continue to see very strong signs of momentum in China. As per Europe, very similar. Europe, we have great momentum. In both geographies, ASPs are strong, comp store sales are strong, closeout mix is low, inventory is healthy. In EMEA, in particular, we're taking significant share.

Frankly, we're not taking a year-over-year incremental rate of growth approach to Digital. Looking out longer-term, we do see the potential to have Digital be the majority of our business. And as I noted, when we look to other industries, which you referenced, other industries, consumer products industries, not just Digital or content industries, but other industries ranging from toys to electronics, books, et cetera, we see that in each of those industries, there was positive disruption that catalyzed that shift. And as the leader in our industry, we're going to continue to invest in this digital transformation of NIKE, and even more importantly, a consumer-centric digital transformation of the industry. Some examples of that are the services that we're providing within our NIKE App, the sneaker's app, which really has been a source of explosive growth. Our membership program, which we believe is a uniquely compelling proposition within this industry in terms of the friction that it removes for consumers and the personalization that it gives our consumers. And then as Mark touched upon on the call, we think driving digital penetration in our industry also has quite a bit to do with leveraging the power of digital in the physical retail environment. And again, as we always have as NIKE, we tend to catalyze that change by putting innovative new experiences into the market, that then catalyze the change, not only within our owned store base because that's something within our control, but it sets an example for the strategic wholesale partners that we've referenced. In terms of the experience, we would like to see them continue to evolve. So we're very ambitious, but we see the goals as very achievable when you look at benchmarks in other industries. So again it's less about when we would get to the 30%. It's more about our extreme confidence that, that we're going to go well beyond that number over the long term."

And that's one example, but that's true across the product offering. Using the insights that we gain in that connection that we have with the female consumer, we're creating better product and we're seeing that reflected in the demand. The capsule collections that we've introduced in apparel, Metallic Sheen was one, Terra Perma was another capsule collection. Great response to those. I think it's relevant product in the end. Compelling relevant product is the foundation of that demand. And then, I think, the brand is actually speaking to women more directly and personally. And as I said in my remarks, that's going to be amped up throughout this 2019 as we head towards World Cup. You're going to see Just Do It with a big emphasis on women's. And then sports is affecting lifestyle and fashion in a way that we're seeing dramatic impacts around the world.

Now in terms of where opportunity is, as Mark touched on, we've got tremendous momentum, and that momentum is opening the aperture in terms of our vision in terms of where incremental growth is longer-term. The women's footwear and apparel market is 1.5x the size of the men's footwear and apparel market globally; and as you noted, it's less than 1/4 of our revenue. So we see extraordinary potential to drive continued strong growth and even step-change growth as we really do 2 things, open the aperture in terms of the definition of sport, again that's with a sharp focus on women and movement and activity.

We've seen some amazing highlights in sports this past year. Eliud Kipchoge smashed the Marathon World Record. Simone Biles dominated the world championships.

Eliud Kipchoge smashed the Marathon World Record. Simone Biles dominated the world championships. Kylian Mbappé became a global star at the World Cup and LeBron James continued to inspire on and off the court. 
It was a year of incredible achievements for NIKE as well and Q2 was another strong proof point on our journey. We continue to show progress against our key long-term objectives of driving innovation, direct connections and speed and agility around the world. 
Our teams are doing a fantastic job of delivering sustainable, profitable growth through the Consumer Direct Offense, while aggressively pursuing our highest potential long-term opportunities. We set high goals and each success makes us hungry for more. 
The marketplace in which we compete is highly dynamic. Consumer expectations are accelerating and the macro-economy is increasingly volatile. A key part of our strategy to win in this environment is to double down on digital. Our digital transformation is taking hold through a series of positive disruptions across the business. For example, we're leading the industry through a retail revolution. We're creating sports first smart adaptive footwear. And we're investing in a global supply chain that delivers personal at scale. It's all incredibly energizing and we find that the more disruptive we are, the more we grow. 
Our digital disruption is fueled by breaking old models, building new commerce partnerships, emerging new talent with our years of industry experience. Our teams are driving change and it's yielding excellent results. 
For the quarter, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 10%. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 14%. Gross margin was up 80 basis points to prior year and earnings per share was up 13% to prior year. 
Specific highlights include 9% growth in North America and nearly 20% constant currency growth in our international geographies. Digital growth of 41% on a constant currency basis and continued momentum in both sportswear and performance categories, including a return to growth in the Jordan business. 
The momentum we're driving is grounded in strong product innovation. We're increasing the pace of new concepts and bringing a new discipline to how we manage the life cycle of our innovation. We have a clear road map of how we stage our new platforms, giving each one the space to shine through high-energy storytelling and then ramping up scale and choice to serve diverse consumer needs. Put simply, we're increasing the return on investment in innovation. 
One of our great differentiators is, of course, NIKE Air. It's being energized through platforms like VaporMax and Air Max [ 270 ], 2 of the world's top-selling athletic footwear models. New interpretations of our icons, led by the Air Max 95 and 97. And this spring, we're excited to add a new distinct Air platform to the mix with the Air Max 270. The consumer is already anticipating its arrival and will keep the interest high through multiple iterations early in its product life cycle. 
NIKE React too will enter a new phase as we expand the platform beyond running and basketball into lifestyle product, with the Element 55; and the shoe of the year, the Element 87. Both styles will scale significantly in 2019. Next year, we'll also add NIKE React hybrids that combine multiple cushioning platforms, along with a redesigned Epic React 2.0 coming in spring. 
As we broaden platforms across categories, we're also broadening them across price points to bring them to more people. As we mentioned on our call -- last call, we see greater opportunities for moderately priced footwear from NIKE right now. So we're creating a more complete consumer offense for core footwear by creating performance and lifestyle icons and core-only innovations. 
At NIKE, it's our mission to make athletes better. But perhaps no innovation delivers on that promise like ZoomX and the VaporFly 4%, which has dominated the world's marathons since 2017. We've started something special with the 4%, enabling a dramatic improvement for the world's best runners, and you can expect more exciting breakthroughs to come here. 
That reputation has made its way to everyday athletes, making 4%, the most sought after shoe on race day, and it's created a halo effect for many of our NIKE's fast footwear styles, especially the Peg 35, driving double-digit growth in the running category in Q2. 
I'm excited to announce that in the New Year, we'll launch a new adaptive performance platform in Basketball at the $350 price point. We have a smart shoe designed for the perfect fit and it's a major step in advancing and connecting our digital transformation to product. This is just one better fit solution amongst many that we're working on. And we look forward to rolling them out throughout the year. 
We have a full innovation pipeline ahead including new cushioning platforms which will carry our strong product momentum into fiscal '20, all the way to Tokyo Olympics and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with the Olympics team and the Tokyo 2020 collection is the boldest we've ever assembled across performance and lifestyle in footwear and apparel. We're growing our competitive advantages in many ways. Sustainability is one example, where we're reducing waste at a scale that creates change for our entire industry. NIKE Flyleather made a 50% reclaimed leather, will scale to over 1 million pairs starting this summer. NIKE Flyknit represents a multibillion dollar business and uses 60% less waste than traditional manufacturing. And NIKE Air uses 50% recycled manufacturing waste in hundreds of millions of pairs. As a whole, we're making great progress to lower our environmental impact as a company, driving greater efficiencies and fueling growth in our business. 
Another area where our 2X Innovation agenda is making a dramatic impact is in apparel. As designers, there is no greater challenge than innovating for the body in motion. We think about many things, such as how to account for different environments through moisture management, creating breathability that adapts as needed or keeping a garment comfortable when it's twisting and turning. Through new materials and methods of make, our apparel teams are continuing to push the limits in performance silhouettes, and in the process, creating new style. 
Our strategy starts with taking sports into new places. For example, in basketball, our partnership with the NBA is fueling strong growth. Our NBA apparel accelerated in year 2, especially with our city editions jerseys, led by Miami, Minnesota and Brooklyn. And to no one's surprise, LeBron's moved to the Lakers has also created opportunity. We already booked 3x more NIKE Lakers gear this year. And our work with the NBA has also created a lift for NIKE inline basketball apparel. We built on the success of our Showtime hoodie and added Therma Flex pants, which have seen great sell-through. 
Overall, the traction we've gained for basketball in NIKE Direct and internationally led to strong global growth for the Basketball category this quarter. 
In Sportswear, our biggest category apparel grew over 20% this quarter. Sportswear fleece and women's apparel were up double digits. In Sportswear, we're anchoring our communications around head-to-toe collections, which makes it easier for consumers to shop the complete look and strengthens our presentation and storytelling. 
Apparel continues to be one of NIKE's greatest growth opportunities. And in the back half of the fiscal year, there's a lot to be excited about. We're launching new high-performance kits for the Woman's World Cup in France. A yoga collection, that includes men's yoga apparel for the first time at NIKE. New tights innovation, and expanded NIKE Tech Pack collection. 
2 other areas of our business where we're accelerating, but we know we have much more opportunity ahead, is Women's and Jordan. There's incredible momentum for women in sport right now as athletes, elite and everyday, lead a movement of health and wellness, while driving a strong appetite for athletic footwear and apparel. 
This energy is manifesting in a number of ways. For example, footwear for women overall was up 20% for the quarter, and Sneakers For Her are really taking off with the Sage Air Force 1 emerging as her favorite franchise, owning the #1 spot on nike.com for 5 weeks running. 
Our Edit to Amplify strategy to offer more color and material choices and fewer styles is also proving successful. NIKE has the top 3 selling women's athletic footwear models above $125 with the Air Max 270, VaporMax and Epic React. And in apparel, our broad business remains a strong growth opportunity, up over 20% in Q2. 
Looking ahead to this summer's World Cup, NIKE will dominate on the pitch. A total of 14 of the 24 national teams will compete in NIKE, including the favorite U.S. national team. And throughout the year, we'll continue to -- our Just Do It campaign that celebrates elite and everyday female athletes around the world. 
We think 2019 is going to be a true tipping point for woman in sport with more participation, more coverage and overall more energy. 
Meanwhile, with the Jordan Brand, we're seeing positive results from the strategic shifts that we're making. In Q2, Jordan grew double digit and we returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. At the same time, we've continued our pace of double-digit growth internationally. We're making great progress in diversifying Jordan. Apparel had a very strong quarter, especially internationally. Sell-through of the Jordan and PSG collaboration exceeded expectations and we'll come back with a refreshed collection in January. 
Jordan's performance footwear is also contributing to solid growth, led by the new Air Jordan XXXIII game shoe and the Max Aura that's doing well in China at $120 price point. And from a Sportswear perspective, we're elevating our storytelling with icons like the Air Jordan 1, which is more coveted than ever. 
At the start of Q3, our team executed an incredible effort with the most successful NIKE sneaker ever launched, with the Air Jordan XI Concord. It was a well-orchestrated plan, complete with geo targeting that offered preheat Paris to our members, total integration across our business with partners like House of Hoops and Footaction and locally driven storytelling in our key cities. 
The Concord shows that the Jordan Brand yet again has the power to drive launches with incredible volume and create energy for the brand. We're bringing much greater balance to Jordan with much more opportunity ahead. 
In 2X Direct, we're beginning to realize a multiplying effect as we scale our most innovative experiences. This quarter, you could feel the momentum swing in the conversation around retail. We saw it over the Thanksgiving shopping week, fueling more than 30% increase in our digital business in North America for the quarter. 
In China, Singles Day once again broke records. NIKE earned the #1 sport brand on Tmall with our overall business for the day, up over 40% from last year's Singles Day. It's clear that the consumers' craving experiences and the fastest way to meet that demand is to test, learn and scale new features. We know not every one of our new experiences will be successful and not all will be scalable but when we do find features that improve our services, NIKE's advantage is how quickly we deploy them across our global footprint. 
In November, we opened our House of Innovation concept in both Shanghai and New York. The energy and performance at both locations has exceeded expectations. Both stores create the most personal and responsive retail environment in the industry. It's a digital experience brought to life in a physical space and uses our most exciting features to date, such as the ability to scan barcodes to check availability and by the full look of mannequins, instant check out that requires no waiting at a register, expert studio that gives personal guidance, and special unlocks and notifications when members enter the store. 
The gateway for consumers to get the most value out of these new experiences is membership. We want more doors to feel like a personal home for members, where we can elevate one-to-one service. And we want to leverage mobile apps to make sure NIKE is serving our consumers wherever they are. One way we do that with members is to create ways to be in their path more organically. For example, the LeBron Watch, which will deliver 25% of the LeBron 16s in the marketplace this year, makes his on-court shoes available in the moment through sneakers and our partner mobile apps. 
In China, this month, we gave early access to the Kyrie 5 through a QR code and a live streamed NBA game on WeChat. And users can now buy directly on our NIKE Run Club and NIKE Training Club apps, personalized to the way they train. 
Another key to making NIKE commerce a part of people's lives more seamlessly again and again is to develop unique experiences with some of the world's most engaging and brand-friendly platforms. And this quarter, we did that with a new feature in Instagram, that allows NIKE product to be shopped directly from stores, on the Apple Watch, where we continue to serve our most active and highly-valued NIKE Run Club members. And with Google, where consumers can now buy directly from NIKE through search and Google Assistant.
 And to further leverage partnerships that amplify our brand, we're making great strides with strategic partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker, Nordstrom and DICK'S Sporting Goods, where elevated experiences are driving outsized growth in the wholesale channel. We know that to fully leverage or fully offer consumers what they want in the moment requires a high level of agility in our business. And through 2X Speed, we're elevating the industry, creating an end-to-end value chain that's centered on the consumer. The pillars are demand-sensing and insights, so we know our consumer, responsive product creation and manufacturing to provide the best product, delivery at speed for product to arrive when they want it and connected inventory so they're never disappointed. And it starts with better demand sensing and insights. 
In Q2, our Express Lane business grew double digits, supporting key cities with hyperlocal product and faster fulfillment to drive higher full price sell-through. Responsive product creation and manufacturing has many components. Digital product creation allows for greater precision and creativity and design, planning and staging materials drastically reduces lead times and automation increases speed and quality in manufacturing. 
To date, more than half of our total footwear production has been modernized through initiatives started in the modernization centers of our top 6 manufacturing partners and our Advanced Product Creation Center at our world headquarters. 
We're also investing in delivery at speed. Take Singles Day as an example. To deliver against this massive opportunity, we had coordinated fulfillment strategy across our 12 Greater China distribution centers, and we shipped direct from over 50 retail doors to consumers on the day. Overall, we fulfilled over 5 million units in 5 days. 
And finally, our connected inventory strategy with partners like Zalando and JD will help us realize many of our speed initiatives. In support of that initiative, we'll introduce RFID into footwear and all nonlicensed apparel in 2019. This will lead to vastly improved product visibility and accuracy across the supply chain from product creation to point-of-sale. And it further opens up the possibility to integrate more widely with our wholesale partners, contract factories and distribution centers. 
Each of these work streams is a building block for NIKE to become more personal at scale. And as a system, they demand enterprise-wide coordination and innovation. NIKE's ambitious digital transformation is driving the strong results you see today. We're staying competitive and opportunistic with every shift in the marketplace. As a leader, NIKE has high expectations. And as good as this quarter was, we know we have the ability to do much more. We're going to continue to use our scale, speed and agility to grow sport and our business around the world. 
Thanks. And now here's Andy"

Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency-neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year. Our strong",2938,"Thank you, Mark, and happy holidays, everyone. Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency-neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year. Our strong growth was also broad-based across all 4 of our geographies as well as across footwear, apparel, men's, women's and most categories. This broad-based momentum is not happening by accident, but rather is being fueled by our focus on what matters most to consumers globally. 
The common theme across our portfolio is the Consumer Direct Offense. More specifically, we are bringing the triple-double of 2X Innovation, 2X Direct and 2X Speed to life in our 12 key cities and 10 key countries around the world. Take innovation, for example. We've said we expect new innovation platforms to drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fact, year-to-date, new innovation platforms, including VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have driven over 80% of our incremental growth. 
Another significant contributor to our growth from a product perspective are our Power Franchises. By leveraging an approach that Mark calls, editing to amplify, we're bringing new dimension and driving the growth of iconic franchises like the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. We do that, for example, through fresh new designs and collaborations for both men and women as well as color and material updates through our Express Lane. 
Our broad-based growth is also being fueled by new experiences that more directly connect NIKE to our consumers globally. We expect NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE experiences, physical and digital, will contribute over 50% of our incremental growth and outpace undifferentiated retail over the next 5 years, leading the way once again in Q2 with NIKE Digital. Our NIKE Digital ecosystem continues to grow faster than all other channels, growing 41% on a currency-neutral basis. And as we drive deeper, more organic, one-to-one engagement with consumers, mobile now represents well over 50% of our digital commerce revenue. 
Our 2X Speed initiative is also driving our momentum. Cutting our time to market in half is not an all or nothing proposition, we're already infusing greater speed and agility into our product creation and supply chain processes, allowing us to amplify what's working with the consumer closer to real time. For example, product updated and fulfilled through our Express Lane is growing double digits and now represents a double-digit percentage of our total business. This is significant as Express Lane product also largely sells through at full price, favorably impacting margins. 
2X Speed also includes initiatives ranging from leveraging automation to a more focused materials pallette and materials staging. These initiatives also reduce product cost and enhance inventory efficiency, a greater labor productivity and less waste. In short, we are very pleased with our strategic execution and the strong performance we have delivered to date. That said, more importantly, we are confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward. 
While FX headwinds have intensified, we now expect stronger currency-neutral revenue growth in fiscal year '19 than previously planned. And as we're beginning to gain greater insight into fiscal year '20, we're seeing continued strong demand. Our positive outlook is not merely optimism, but rather is founded on fundamental changes in how we operate at NIKE. One fundamental change is in how we bring innovation to market. In addition to driving faster innovation cycles, we're also focused on innovation platforms that have greater potential to scale across geographies. Accordingly, as Mark detailed, we've an extraordinary pipeline of innovation to come, over the balance of fiscal year '19 and throughout fiscal year '20. That begins in spring with the launch of the Air Max 720 and HyperAdapt in Basketball, and extends to innovation platforms launching in early fiscal year '20 and through and beyond the Tokyo Olympics. 
We're also digitally transforming NIKE and driving positive disruption in our industry, unlocking new opportunities for growth long term. While we already have extraordinary digital momentum, we're still in the early stages of this transformation. We are executing against a 3-year road map of new digital capabilities that will enable us to continually serve consumers better. We're aggressively building those capabilities in-house and accelerating our development of those capabilities through acquisition. 
Our 3-year road map also includes the global expansion of our digital ecosystem in the key cities and countries where we see the greatest opportunity for growth. For example, just last month, we launched the NIKE App in Japan, where it immediately became the #1 rated shopping app. 
Over the next 5 years, we see the Consumer Direct Offense delivering on the financial model and measures of success we communicated at our Investor Day back in October 2017. But we are already setting our sights even higher longer term. We see the opportunity to expand the definition of sport, to be even more inclusive, including competition and training as well as movement and play. By using this broader lens to inspire and enable a more active lifestyle, we will grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel. 
There are 4 areas where this purpose-driven approach to growth is creating outsized opportunities for us: international, digital, apparel and women's. The overall footwear and apparel industries in our international markets are already significantly larger in aggregate than in the U.S. That said, in international markets, the athletic segment of the overall footwear and apparel market has historically been less penetrated than in the U.S., but that is changing fast. Sport participation and culture continue to accelerate in international markets. And when sport grows, NIKE grows. China is perhaps the best current example of this phenomenon. 
And second, we said at our Investor Day, that digital, owned and partnered, would comprise 30% of our business by 2023 as compared to roughly 15% of our business today. Frankly, we're already thinking bigger as we look longer term. Our industry has lagged many other industries in terms of digital penetration. Many consumer products industries are already at 50% digital penetration and projected to be well over 80% digital by 2030. We all know that disruptive new consumer-centric digital experiences have catalyzed the shift to digital in those industries. So as we increasingly innovate and lead with digital, we are intentionally disrupting our industry. We see this as positive disruption that widens the aperture for growth long term. We now see 30% digital penetration as just a milepost on our path to the majority of our business being digital. 
Third, apparel is another extraordinary opportunity for growth at NIKE. Apparel is a larger market in footwear globally. And at the same time, athletic apparel accounts for a smaller percentage of overall apparel than athletic accounts for within overall footwear. That dynamic is also changing fast. Consumers are increasingly choosing performance and sportswear apparel for more occasions as it better serves their more active and expressive lifestyle. 
And finally, as we aim to redefine and expand the definition of sport, that is with a sharp focus on women. Similar to the strong returns we are seeing from having doubled our investment in innovation, we see the potential for asymmetrical returns by editing and more aggressively shifting resources towards our women's business. The women's footwear and apparel markets are larger than men's. Yet today, women's represents less than 1/4 of NIKE's total revenue. And we're already on this journey, as our women's business grew double digits in Q2, but we see step-change growth opportunities ahead by serving women more deeply within classifications and across more occasions for her. In short, we have strong current momentum and we have extraordinary growth potential long term. 
But before I share more specifics regarding our outlook, let's reflect on the drivers of our current momentum. NIKE Inc. Q2 revenue increased 10%, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. This exceptional growth reflects double-digit currency-neutral momentum internationally and strong high single-digit growth in North America. 
NIKE Digital was the fastest-growing channel in each geography with 41% growth in aggregate on a currency-neutral basis, again, led by mobile. That said, FX headwinds had a slightly larger impact on our reported revenue growth than the roughly 3 points we anticipated 90 days ago. 
We also delivered strong gross margin expansion of 80 basis points across NIKE Inc., fueled by NIKE Direct's growth and a higher mix of full price sales. Demand creation grew 4% in the quarter with our focus being on increasingly connecting with consumers through digital experiences and platforms. 
Operating overhead increased 18%, reflecting strategic investments that are accelerating NIKE's digital transformation and will fuel long-term growth. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. 
Second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.52, up 13% versus prior year. And as of November 30, inventories were up just 1%, reflecting a healthy pull market for NIKE and a lower mix of closeout across all geographies. N
ow let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 9% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew high single digits with NIKE Digital up well over 30% in North America. As Mark mentioned, we are now turning our vision for the next generation of retail into a reality. In our NIKE Live concept on Melrose, we're aligning data-driven, bi-weekly flows of the product to the store with digital storytelling and one-to-one connections between the store team and local consumers. As a result, the store is driving strong digital member acquisition, engagement and buying. And we're seeing even more impressive early results at our new House of Innovation in New York. 
While the overall retail marketplace in North America is still going through consolidation, and we do expect that to continue, our NIKE wholesale business in aggregate has returned to strong growth with improving profitability, led by our strategic retail partners, such as Foot Locker and increasingly JD. In Q2, we also reignited brand heat in North America through the Just Do It campaign that was launched in early September and by amplifying key moments in sport like the launch of the NBA season. 
We see our brand tee across both NIKE and Jordan, our strong pipeline of innovative product and digitally [ like ] consumer experiences continuing to fuel strong growth in North America. 
In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth across sportswear, running, training and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace growing over 30% versus prior year. We have extraordinary momentum in this geography as we're taking significant share and we're growing the market. We are mindful of the geopolitical dynamics in Europe, that said, we have a long track record of delivering growth and profitability amidst a wide range of macroeconomic circumstances. As we look ahead, we expect our momentum to continue in Europe. 
In all 5 of our key cities in EMEA, consumers rate us as the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand, and in fact, those ratings strengthened even further in Q2. We're connecting more directly and deeply with consumers locally through our key city focus and we're seeing the impact globally. For example, through the PSG-Jordan partnership, we connected authentically with consumers in Paris, while the product sold out at launch around the world. 
We also recently introduced the NIKE App at Retail and NIKE Town London as well as the sneaker's past experience in Paris, allowing consumers to reserve shoes from high heat launches and pick up in store. Those services are removing friction and personalizing the shopping experience, driving significant new member acquisition in 2 of our key global cities. 
Next, let's turn to Greater China, where yet again, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in Q2. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in China. In Q2, growth accelerated to 31% on a currency-neutral basis with digital growing over 40%. As evidence of the scale and digital nature of this important market as well as the strength of the NIKE Brand, our sneakers app community in China -- and recall that the sneakers app was launched just last year, is already the same size as our sneakers' community in North America. 
In Q2, with the opening of House of Innovation in Shanghai, we also began to more fully leverage digital in this largely NIKE-branded physical retail environment. It's still early days, but the results have been extraordinary. 
While there has been uncertainty of late regarding U.S., China relations, we have not seen any impact on our business. NIKE continues to win with the consumer in China. For over 3 decades, NIKE has been a brand of China, for China. We've connected deeply with the consumer here through our key city focus on Shanghai and Beijing. Through partnerships with sports federations, teams and athletes and by partnering with China's Ministry of Sport to fuel greater sport participation in schools across the country. In fact, just last month, leading up to the Shanghai Marathon, we took Eliud Kipchoge on a tour of Shanghai and other key cities. And then on Marathon Day, we launched a Shanghai-focused Just Do It campaign. In just the first 24 hours, the campaign was watched more than 16 million times. We are bullish about our potential to continue delivering strong, sustainable and very profitable growth in this important geography. 
In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis with balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel as well as double-digit growth in sportswear Jordan and NIKE basketball. NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 75%. We also continue to expand our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through commerce partnerships, such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart and others. APLA is a market in which we are extremely entrepreneurial, testing new concepts that leverage digital to enhance the consumer experience at retail. As we mentioned on our last call, we'll be opening a NIKE Live experience in Tokyo in Q3. And in Seoul, we are testing our connected inventory strategy. We have connected the inventory across 19 NIKE branded doors, including doors owned by 2 of our strategic partners. This connected inventory pilot has yielded very promising early results, serving thousands of consumers whose demand would otherwise have been unmet due to product being out of stock in a particular store. 
And finally at Converse, revenue increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2. Growth was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and a sharp acceleration in own digital growth globally, approaching triple digits. While Converse wholesale in the U.S. and U.K. remain challenged in Q2, Digital also accelerated in those markets. We see significant opportunity to grow Converse by expanding the product portfolio, including within Basketball, as well as launching a new digital platform.
And with that, let's turn to our outlook. There is increasing volatility and uncertainty of late on a macro level. That said, what is certain is that NIKE's execution of the consumer direct offense is driving consistently strong and sustainable broad-based growth across our diverse global portfolio. That is because we are focused on what matters most to consumers and they are responding globally with strong demand for NIKE. Accordingly, our full year guidance for fiscal year '19 reflects stronger currency-neutral revenue growth, stronger gross margin expansion and accelerated strategic investment. 
For the full year, we now expect currency-neutral revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range, potentially approaching low double digits. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported full year revenue growth to be over 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth. In other words, at the low end of the high single-digit range. 
For gross margin, our outlook has also improved. We expect our full year gross margin expansion to be roughly in line with the gross margin expansion of 70 basis points that we delivered over the first half of fiscal year '19. We expect SG&A for the full year to grow in the high single digits as we continue to invest in new digital capabilities that will differentiate NIKE and fuel our long-term growth. 
We project other expense, net of interest expense, to be between $50 million and $75 million for the full year. And we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens for fiscal year '19. That said, the finalization of regulations-related U.S. tax reform may result in discrete adjustments that impact our tax rate. 
While our focus is on sustaining profitable growth over the course of fiscal year '19 and for the long term, I will provide a bit of context on Q3 considering the current macro environment. In Q3, we expect strong currency-neutral revenue growth squarely within the high single-digit range. Based on FX dynamics, our reported real dollar revenue growth will likely be roughly 4 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth in Q3. For gross margin, we expect Q3 expansion to be roughly in line with our full year guidance. As for SG&A, we expect growth in the low-double digit range in Q3 as we continue to prioritize strategic investment. 
And finally, we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be between 16% and 18%. Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is driving consistently strong performance. Yet, we are still in the early stages. As we continue to execute, we're not only building current momentum, we're also gaining greater insight into NIKE's potential to transform the industry, drive sustainable growth and create extraordinary value for shareholders long term. 
With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions."

We are expecting our gross margin to be better in the second half of the year. And as you note in our reported results, it was slightly better than we expected in Q2. We're seeing structural benefits to our margin from our over-indexing growth in Direct, which has had very strong momentum and momentum that's exceeded our expectations, specifically in digital as well as a greater mix of premium innovative product and stronger full price sell-through. We're also benefiting from a clean marketplace, particularly for NIKE. So as noted in my remarks, we do have an improved outlook for '19 with our expansion being roughly in line with the year-to-date margin expansion of 70 basis points. And as we noted when we entered the year, we expect that the second half margin to be stronger than the first half. And in the first quarter, our margin expansion was lesser than in the second quarter. I would note that in any given quarter, there can be anomalies that impact margin. And finally, I'd note that, Q2 is a quarter in which our margin is historically lower. Q3 and Q4, we have higher margin. And so the expansion we expect in the third and fourth quarters is actually strong expansion on an already relatively higher quarterly margin. And then you asked about ASP and units. What I would note is that ASPs were up across our portfolio in both footwear and apparel. Again, new innovation, strong full price sell-through, our shift to Direct, clean marketplace, are impacting ASPs. We see continued ASP expansion in our order book going forward. So very balanced. Again, single-digit rates of increase in footwear and in apparel, apparel ASP is even expanding a little bit stronger than footwear, but both strong. And then, like I said, balanced with strong unit expansion in both footwear and apparel. Operator, we'll take the next question, please."

The PSG collaboration was a great source of energy that was kind of unexpected. But incredible sell-through in energy, not just in Europe, but around the world. So I think the potential in Jordan is the return to growth in North America and on the energy and the enthusiasm for the brand and the product around the world, including and maybe I'll especially call out China there. And then we have more potential as we diversify the portfolio of product, particularly around the Woman's offense in both footwear and in apparel.

Obviously, the backbone of that demand and that response is great product. So we feel really good about that in terms of where we've been this first half and then obviously with what's coming. But our -- the strategic relationships with our bigger partners, who are really investing in the consumer experience, is what we're seeing paying off. And we're bullish on that as we move forward.

I'll touch on the first part of your question related to the momentum in China and Europe in contrast of what you referred to as what some others maybe saying in those markets. We're seeing extraordinary momentum in both markets. I'd say the headline in China is our growth continues to accelerate. We are the #1 brand with consumers in China. We are a brand of China, deeply connected with teams, federations, athletes. And, again, even with the government to some extent and the Ministry of Sports in terms of our joint venture to fuel sport participation. We're seeing incredibly strong demand for our product, the innovation that we're launching, our Basketball product, our Jordan product. And then, as we've noted, our Digital business, both our NIKE Digital ecosystem and through our partnership with Tmall is fueling extremely strong growth. We have not seen any impact from our business from some of the U.S., China dynamics that we're all reading about. We're mindful of those. But in the context of being mindful of those, we continue to see very strong signs of momentum in China. As per Europe, very similar. Europe, we have great momentum. In both geographies, ASPs are strong, comp store sales are strong, closeout mix is low, inventory is healthy. In EMEA, in particular, we're taking significant share. That's also amplifying our growth."

Frankly, we're not taking a year-over-year incremental rate of growth approach to Digital. Looking out longer-term, we do see the potential to have Digital be the majority of our business. And as I noted, when we look to other industries, which you referenced, other industries, consumer products industries, not just Digital or content industries, but other industries ranging from toys to electronics, books, et cetera, we see that in each of those industries, there was positive disruption that catalyzed that shift. And as the leader in our industry, we're going to continue to invest in this digital transformation of NIKE, and even more importantly, a consumer-centric digital transformation of the industry. Some examples of that are the services that we're providing within our NIKE App, the sneaker's app, which really has been a source of explosive growth. Our membership program, which we believe is a uniquely compelling proposition within this industry in terms of the friction that it removes for consumers and the personalization that it gives our consumers. And then as Mark touched upon on the call, we think driving digital penetration in our industry also has quite a bit to do with leveraging the power of digital in the physical retail environment. And again, as we always have as NIKE, we tend to catalyze that change by putting innovative new experiences into the market, that then catalyze the change, not only within our owned store base because that's something within our control, but it sets an example for the strategic wholesale partners that we've referenced. In terms of the experience, we would like to see them continue to evolve. So we're very ambitious, but we see the goals as very achievable when you look at benchmarks in other industries. So again it's less about when we would get to the 30%. It's more about our extreme confidence that, that we're going to go well beyond that number over the long term."

I think there's a number of factors. I think women are embracing sneaker culture. We're seeing that with some of the iconic franchises that we've had like the Air Force 1 that are actually designed specifically for women with deeper insights that, I think, resonate. And that's one example, but that's true across the product offering. Using the insights that we gain in that connection that we have with the female consumer, we're creating better product and we're seeing that reflected in the demand. The capsule collections that we've introduced in apparel, Metallic Sheen was one, Terra Perma was another capsule collection. Great response to those. I think it's relevant product in the end. Compelling relevant product is the foundation of that demand. And then, I think, the brand is actually speaking to women more directly and personally. And as I said in my remarks, that's going to be amped up throughout this 2019 as we head towards World Cup. You're going to see Just Do It with a big emphasis on women's. And then sports is affecting lifestyle and fashion in a way that we're seeing dramatic impacts around the world.

And from a categorical perspective, it's largely comprised sportswear, running and training, which is in part why it's relatively well distributed across the regions. In terms of the rate of growth, it's outpacing in all geos, outpacing the men's business. Now in terms of where opportunity is, as Mark touched on, we've got tremendous momentum, and that momentum is opening the aperture in terms of our vision in terms of where incremental growth is longer-term. The women's footwear and apparel market is 1.5x the size of the men's footwear and apparel market globally; and as you noted, it's less than 1/4 of our revenue. So we see extraordinary potential to drive continued strong growth and even step-change growth as we really do 2 things, open the aperture in terms of the definition of sport, again that's with a sharp focus on women and movement and activity. And then second, editing and more aggressively shifting resources within NIKE towards the women's opportunity. So in short, we've got great momentum in the women's business, but we're chasing something much bigger. Thank you, Jim. Okay, that's all the time we have for today. Thank you all for joining us.
