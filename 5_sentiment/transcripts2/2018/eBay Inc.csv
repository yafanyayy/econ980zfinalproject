Quarter 4 was a record quarter for us, highlighted by the fifth straight quarter of volume acceleration in our U.S. Marketplace, flow strong growth had stepped up.

Quarter 4 was a record quarter for us, highlighted by the fifth straight quarter of volume acceleration in our U.S. Marketplace, flow strong growth had stepped up. Overall total GMV grew 10% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. Total revenue was up 7% and active buyers grew 5%, ending the year at $170 million. GMV in revenue in our Marketplace platform grew at 6%. Our StubHub platform grew volume at 15%, and our Classified platform grew revenue at 13%. Finally, we repurchased $922 million of our own shares, taking advantage of a share price that we do not believe reflects the long-term value of our company. In our Marketplace platform, volume growth accelerated by 1 point in the U.S, while international growth decelerated 3 points, driven in part by the timing and impact of Korean Thanksgiving and slower export trade due to the stronger British pound in Europe. eBay was again one of the top holiday shopping destinations for consumers around the world, and performance this quarter was driven by strong U.S. consumer spending and good execution on our key initiatives. Our new product rollouts which leverage our structured data foundation, got good initial traction in Q4. Over 150,000 customers a day used guaranteed delivery while searching on eBay in U.S. during the holiday season. Group listings, which is the first time buyers are seeing a product-based commerce experience on eBay, performed well and set the foundation for the next set of changes we'll make this year. And finally, we began to ramp eBay Authenticate where we're already seeing inventory scaling nicely and much higher conversion on like-for-like items. 
We continue to invest in brand advertising with a coordinated holiday activation across all of our key markets. Significantly changing consumer consideration is a long-term effort, and we plan to invest more heavily in our brand in 2018.
Lastly, our first-party advertising revenue continues to pick up momentum. Nearly 160,000 sellers use promoted listings to advertise over 100 million items in the quarter, driving over 50% sequential revenue growth in Q4. The rapid growth of promoted listings is enabling us to shift away from nonstrategic third-party advertising. 
Our StubHub platform had a good Q4 with a 13 point GMV growth acceleration, driven by a strong concert environment and good MLB playoff and college football performances. While we don't expect growth in 2018 to be at the same level as Q4 due to the ongoing ticketing landscape challenges we discussed last quarter, StubHub continues to be the world's favorite destination for fans looking to buy event tickets.
And Classifieds continues to enjoy robust vibrancy and double-digit growth with mobile and eBay Kleinanzeigen continuing to be stand out performers. 
Now taking a step back and putting Q4 in the context of the past 2.5 years, we've made great progress against our key strategic priorities to drive the best choice, the most relevance in a powerful selling platform while sharpening the eBay brand. This strategy is enabling us to transform the eBay experience and accelerate the growth of our business. We significantly simplified and improved our customer experience and built equity in our brand. We've built a strong foundation of structured data with the majority of our listings now tied to our product catalog and 14% of all traffic landing on catalog-enabled experiences. And we've done this while accelerating growth in our core eBay platform by nearly 3 points.
Looking to 2018, our strategy remains unchanged. We intend to raise the bar on our customer experience and again accelerate growth despite tougher comps. We'll focus on key areas of our user experience, including search, delivery and returns, customer service and payments, while continually planting the seeds of technology innovation. Let me share a few examples of our plans.
We will take the next step in transforming our user experience, including on eBay search, by launching a full product based commerce experience for relevant inventory. This experience will leverage our structured data catalog in a more holistic way than we previously done. We'll do this while also focusing on our overall search experience using data and AI to improve our recall and relevance. We'll continue to shrink delivery times by expanding Guaranteed Delivery and work with our sellers to provide retail standard experiences for consumers. This will include enabling our vastly simplified returns process for buyers and sellers. Our technology innovation continues to focus on emerging platforms such as artificial intelligence, voice and image technology, virtual and augmented reality and distributed commerce. I've often said that eBay runs on AI, powering many aspects of our buying and selling experience. In 2018, we'll focus our AI capabilities on computer vision, personalization, search and dynamic pricing capabilities for our sellers. AR, VR and mixed reality are becoming viable platforms for development. As this tech becomes more consumer-friendly and accessible, eBay will take advantage of their unique capabilities, delivering immersive and engaging buying and selling experiences.
And there is a step-change opportunity to remove friction from the user experience by allowing users to interact with eBay by simply typing a message or using their voice to engage a digital assistant. In 2018, we plan on taking the first step towards unifying conversational commerce with the core eBay shopping experience, providing seamless voice or text assistance when needed within our desktop and app platforms. 
2018 will be a year of significant focus on customer service. In 2017, we onshored a significant number of support roles, and that trend will continue this year, enabling us to provide top-tier life-support to a broader set of our customer base. And for customers looking for a fast self-service, we're rolling out brand-new AI-enabled mobile and desktop pages to address their service requests. And finally, we anticipate that our digital assistant will have the capability of directly handling certain service requests instantly and without human intervention.
Finally, let me touch on our strategy and approach for payments on eBay. We've been looking closely at the customer payments experience and the economics under our existing PayPal relationship. After careful consideration, we believe that we can offer a more seamless experience while giving buyers and sellers more choice for payment and payout options. At the same time, we believe we can capture significantly better economics while reducing overall selling costs. Therefore, we have made the decision to intermediate payments on eBay. We have already begun building this capability and we'll move as quickly as we can under the terms of our operating agreement with PayPal. I'm excited to announce a deal with [ Audien ], a leading global payment processor to be our primary partner in this effort. We are looking forward to working with [ Audien ], who we believe are uniquely qualified to support us in this transition. They power payment processing for a number of the world's leading global marketplaces and bring to our partnership a broad global footprint with a flexible and scalable technology platform. 
We've also aligned on terms for a new commercial agreement with PayPal to include them as a way to pay at checkout under our intermediated payment model. PayPal has been a great partner for eBay and we look forward to a continued strong partnership with them going forward. 
We've built a world-class team to execute on this payment opportunity, including senior executives from companies such as PayPal, Alipay and Amazon Payments. In 2021, we expect to have transitioned a majority of our market Marketplace customers to our new payment experience.
In summary, we've made good progress in 2017, delivering fundamental customer improvements while accelerating growth and improving the operating performance of the business. We enter 2018 with a healthier ecosystem and on a path for further acceleration this year. Looking forward to a year of significant progress to the benefit of our global community, of buyers and sellers, shareholders and employees.
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financials and our 2018 guidance."
27862,549105091,1377588,"eBay Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-01-31,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q4 financials, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Please note that my commentary on our 2017 financial performance is based on revenue accounting standards in place as of 2017 year-end.In Q4, we delivered G",2744,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q4 financials, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Please note that my commentary on our 2017 financial performance is based on revenue accounting standards in place as of 2017 year-end.
In Q4, we delivered GMV of $24.4 billion, increasing 10% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. We generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.59 of non-GAAP EPS, $796 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $920 million -- $922 million of our stock. 
Let's start with Q4 active buyers on Slide 5.  In the quarter, trailing 12-month growth was 5% year-over-year, resulting in 170 million active buyers. Active buyer growth in our Marketplace platform decelerated slightly, offset by strength at StubHub. The extended Thanksgiving holiday in Korea was the primary driver of the Marketplace growth deceleration. 
On Slide 6, in Q4, we enabled $24.4 billion of GMV, up 7%. By geography, the U.S. generated $9.9 billion of GMV, up 8%, accelerating 3 points versus the prior quarter. International delivered $14.6 billion of GMV, up 6%, down 3 points versus the prior quarter. 
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 7% organically, consistent with the prior quarter. We delivered $2 billion of transaction revenue, up 7%, and $578 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 6%. 
Transitioning to our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. Q4 GMV grew 6%, with U.S. GMV accelerating by 1 point to 7%, and international GMV growing 6%, a 3-point deceleration. International growth was impacted by the extended Korean Thanksgiving holiday, slowing U.K. export growth due to a stronger pound and softer consumer spending in Germany. Underlying these trends, we saw our B2C segment grow 6%, relatively constant with prior quarters. C2C grew 7% year-over-year, another quarter of good growth, aided by our ongoing efforts to simplify consumer selling and drive engagement. Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Transaction revenue grew 7%, driven by volume growth and the impact of our Q2 pricing changes, partially offset by heavier promotional spend in the holiday season. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 3%, decelerating 3 points versus Q3, as we continued to shift our advertising efforts away from nonstrategic third-party ad placements and towards our first-party promoted listings product. This will favor transaction revenue putting ongoing pressure on MS&O revenue growth. For the full year, the Marketplace platform generated $84 billion of GMV, growing 6%, a 1.5 points faster than 2016 and $7.6 billion in revenue, also up 6%, 2 points faster than the prior year.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 15%, accelerating 13 points from Q3 due to a stronger-than-expected event landscape, led by concerts, a great World Series and strong college football matchups. StubHub revenue grew 10%, up 5 points versus Q3, driven by volume, offset by a lower take rate and seasonal incentives to take advantage of a strong market opportunity. In 2017, StubHub grew GMV 5% to $4.5 billion and delivered $1 billion in revenue, growing 9% year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 10, our Classifieds platform continues to innovate and serve more than 250 million monthly unique visitors. In Q4, Classified had another strong quarter, up 13% revenue growth. We continue to see good vertical performance and strength in advertising revenue. For the full year, Classifieds generated $897 million of revenue, up 12%.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q4, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 31%, which is down 100 basis points versus last year, 40 basis points of which was due to the impact of foreign exchange. Cost of revenue increased slightly year-over-year as a percentage of revenue, driven primarily by our first-party inventory program in Korea. Q4 sales and marketing expense was up 100 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by the increased investment in our ongoing brand campaign. Product development was down slightly year-over-year due to leverage, partially offset by increased investment in product. G&A expense was down 50 basis points as we delivered further operating leverage. For the year, operating margin was 29.5%, down 160 basis points. Foreign exchange impacted full year margin by 70 basis points, and the remaining impact was driven by our investments in Marketplace product and marketing initiatives and growth of our first-party inventory program in Korea.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q4, we delivered $0.59 in non-GAAP EPS, up 9%, driven by revenue growth, the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by the impact of foreign exchange.
Moving to Q4 GAAP EPS. We had 3 significant financial impacts related to the passage of recent U.S. tax reforms. We are recording a $1.9 billion tax charge related to the repatriation of our foreign earnings. $1.4 billion of this amount will be paid over 8 years, with the first 2 installments to be paid in 2018. The additional $0.5 billion represents foreign withholding taxes that will be paid upon repatriation of those earnings. This tax charge is largely offset by the reversal of our $1.8 billion deferred tax liability established primarily in 2014 in anticipation of repatriating foreign earnings. We also are recording a $3 billion deferred tax liability to address other areas of U.S. tax reform, primarily a global minimum tax that will now be applicable to our foreign earnings. This tax will impact our ongoing tax rate and cash taxes. We have recorded these amounts provisionally using reasonable estimates and the amounts may change in 2018. I will cover the impact of these changes on our go-forward tax rate in our 2018 guidance discussion.
As a result of these charges in Q4, our GAAP EPS was negative $2.51, down $7.82 versus last year. The decrease in GAAP EPS was driven by the aforementioned tax impacts and the lapping of prior year noncash GAAP income tax benefit of approximately $4.6 billion related to our legal entity restructuring at the time. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q4, we generated $796 million of free cash flow. Full year free cash flow was $2.5 billion, above our guidance range due to the timing of certain cash tax payments and capital expenditures.
Turning to Slide 14, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $11.3 billion, with $2.2 billion located in the U.S. In Q4, we repurchased 24.9 million shares at an average price of $36.99 per share, amounting to $922 million in total. This brings our repurchases for the year to $2.7 billion. Repurchases and separation are now $6.8 billion, which is approximately 19% of shares outstanding at an average price of $29.54. We ended the year with $1.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
In light of U.S. tax reform, I would like to review our capital allocation policy, which we continue to believe drive significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees. We aim to preserve financial flexibility in order to have the resources to execute our strategy and drive long-term value creation. We will continue to invest in attractive opportunities to drive organic growth while balancing profitability over the long-term even if those investments are dilutive in the near term. We will supplement our organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments to improve our competitiveness in a rapidly evolving environment. Our M&A strategy continues to center on our geographic footprint, vertical expansion and tech and talent acquisitions.  We continue to optimize our financial flexibility, access to debt and cost of capital. We believe that our current rating of BBB+ maintains a practical flexibility and aim to maintain this rating as we continue to execute on our capital allocation plans. Finally, we are committed to providing meaningful returns for our shareholders, and we believe that current valuations, share repurchases continue to be the optimal vehicle for capital return. While we will always adjust to future events, we expect to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders to approximately $3.5 billion per year over the next 2 years in the form of share repurchases inclusive of dilution offset. Our board has approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization to enable us to execute on this plan, and we have already returned $750 million in Q1 through an accelerated share repurchase. We will continually evaluate our capital allocation strategy as we move forward, ensuring that we drive optimal value on behalf of our shareholders.
Before turning to guidance, I'd like to highlight some key topics relevant to our business in 2018.
I want to spend a moment to discuss the impact of a new revenue standard which we will adopt beginning with our Q1 results. There are several impacts of the new standard on our financial reporting. The primary change relates to clearly defining who our customer is and realigning how we record incentive spend based on this definition. There is also an immaterial change in the timing of revenue recognition for certain fees on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. 
Our sellers are the main source of our Marketplace revenue. Certain incentives solely for our buyers, such as coupons and rewards, will now be recorded as sales and marketing expense instead of contra revenue going forward. The impact of this change would've amounted to $363 million and $322 million for 2017 and '16, respectively, and our 2017 operating margin would've been 28.4% under the new standard. Ultimately, this is simply a change in how we will present our financials, resulting in increased revenue, increased expenses and a lower operating margin with no impact to operating income.  Please refer to the exhibit on our press release and our website financials for more details and our historical reconciliation of 2016 and '17 under the new revenue standard to help our investors understand our 2018 business outlook and future growth comparisons.
Now I'd like to talk about payments. As Devin discussed, we believe that there is a great opportunity to provide a better buyer experience to give our sellers more choices at better value and to capture better economics. This will be a multiyear effort, but we believe it is important to provide context today on the future economic opportunity. As a payment intermediator on the eBay Marketplace, we will be responsible for collecting funds from buyers and instructing our payment processor to disburse funds to sellers. Currently, this is done via our relationship with PayPal. In the new intermediation model, we will simplify our relationship with sellers and plan to charge them a single fee for our Marketplace and payment services.
When doing so, we expect to recognize the payment fees as revenue via an increase in our take rate and record the cost of payment processing and other related fees. When we reach a steady state, with the majority of our volume transition to this intermediated model, we would expect annualized incremental revenue of more than $2 billion. This estimate includes an expectation that we will take steps to lower the cost of selling on eBay via a  lower all-in take rate. Delivering on this revenue opportunity requires ongoing operational costs in areas such as product and technology, trust, risk, customer service and payment processing fees. Factoring in these costs, we believe the annualized incremental operating income could be $0.5 billion. While this isn't completely new business -- while this isn't a completely new business for us, given that we already act as a payment intermediary on other eBay platforms, it is important to keep in mind that this is a complex effort and may face delays along the way. However, we are moving quickly and are excited about the potential long-term benefits this creates for our ecosystem.
We have already begun investing in our payment strategy, well ahead of recognizing any material new income streams. For 2018, we expect this investment to cost us between $0.03 and $0.05 in EPS, which is factored into our guidance, and the investment is likely to increase in 2019. As a reminder, our operating agreement with PayPal remains in place until mid-2020, and our ability to offset the expense related to this investment is limited until the expiration of the existing agreement. We look forward to working with [ Audien ] our new partner and with PayPal in a new capacity to deliver on this significant opportunity.
Moving to full year guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting 2018 revenue between $10.9 billion and $11.1 billion, growing 7% to 9% on an FX-neutral basis and 10% to 12% on an as-reported basis. The midpoint of our projected growth assumes another point of GMV acceleration in our Marketplace platform. As discussed by Devin, we will continue to drive new experiences on our platform of structured data, the most impactful of which are helping buyers find the best choice and most relevance through product-based experiences and improved search and helping our sellers drive velocity through improved tools and workflows. We expect to deliver modest full year acceleration in StubHub GMV with monetization levels on par with Q4. And Classified should continue to see stable double-digit growth. We expect operating margin of 27% to 29% for the year, which at the midpoint, is down 40 basis points from 2017, normalizing for the new accounting standard mentioned earlier. This includes our investment to build out payment intermediation and continued investments in our brand and platform, offset by leverage in functional areas. We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 19% to 22%. We currently expect that U.S. tax reform will benefit our ongoing tax rate by approximately 1 point. This rate is positively impacted by the reduction of U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, but that benefit is largely offset by the global minimum tax and other foreign taxes that can no longer be credited against our U.S. tax liability. Our guidance range is slightly wider than normal driven by uncertainty and how all elements of U.S. tax reform will impact us going forward.
We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30 per share, up 12% to 15% as reported versus last year. This includes the impact of continued top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program and a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by our investments in payment intermediation. We expect free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This is lower than 2017 due to approximately $300 million in cash taxes related to repatriation and assumes capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 8% of revenue. Full year GAAP EPS is projected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share. GAAP EPS is impacted by the same drivers as non-GAAP EPS in addition to the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and the amortization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Turning to Q1 guidance on Slide 16. For Q1, we are projecting revenue of between $2.57 billion and $2.61 billion, growing 7% to 9% per year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 per share, representing 7% to 11% growth. EPS growth is driven primarily by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program. We're expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41 per share in Q1.
In summary, 2017 was a year where we delivered on our commitments and saw our strategy translate into Marketplace acceleration of GMV and revenue growth. U.S. Marketplace GMV has accelerated from 1% to 7% over the past 5 quarters during a period of unprecedented competition, while our international Marketplace delivered another year of 7% GMV growth. Classifieds continued to grow at the double digits, and StubHub ended the year well. For the year, we delivered 6% EPS growth in the face of 5 points of foreign exchange headwinds in addition to our incremental investments. We have remained disciplined capital allocators, returning $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in the last year alone and totaling $6.8 billion repurchased in separation. We executed several deals to further tech and talent expansion. And in Q3, we optimized our strategy in India by taking an ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for our eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment. 
Heading into 2018, we will stay consistent in our strategy, continuing to improve our user experiences while delivering profitable growth and strong capital return to our shareholders.

First of all, on payments, I don't -- just a technical detail. We have not made the decision to become a merchant of record. There are many ways that we can become a payment intermediary. MOR is one of them. That's a decision yet to be made, and it may actually change depending on the geography in which we operate in. But vis-à-vis sellers, we're fairly confident that we can lower the overall selling costs on eBay. We have not yet made final decisions, and it will be a process that will take some time to publicize our pricing to sellers. But what I want sellers to hear is that, number one, we have their experience in mind, we want to give them flexibility, increased payout options, and we want to lower their costs. So that was very much front and center in our mind, was when we made this very consequential decision. On acceleration, in '18, there are quite a few things. We've built a foundation of structured data that now has tentacles into almost everything we do. We have rolled out quite a significant number of new product experiences, like Guaranteed Delivery, Authentication and a product-based commerce experience, and we're going to scale those in 2018. So when we see -- and part of the impact that these initiatives are making, when we see the trajectory that our business is on, we're confident that we can continue to deliver improvement in the business. I'll go back and say, over 2.5 years, 2.5 years ago, when we started this journey, we said that we were going to address the core customer pain points and issues directly and head on. We said it wasn't going to be easy. We said that you could expect steady improvement and a strong return of capital along the way. We've done exactly that. We've seen the customer experience improve. We've seen the foundation of the house being short up. We've seen acceleration in the growth of the business, and we've been aggressive in returning capital to shareholders.

The operating agreement has not been extended and it will not be extended. This is a different agreement, which is a commercial agreement, which will run coterminous with the operating agreement and extend to 3 years beyond it. It is a different agreement which is a simple agreement to keep PayPal on as a form of payment in the eBay Marketplace. All the other terms of the operating agreement will end in June of 2020. Under that agreement, which is a public agreement that you've obviously read, we will move 5% in this year, we have the right to, and up to 10% in '19. And then as we said, in June of 2020, at some date beyond June of 2020, and we're not announcing a date today, we will move the majority of our customers. And it is currently anticipated that this will not be a kind of slow roll customer by customer. Beyond a certain date, which, over due course, we will announce, you will not be able to be on eBay selling or buying without this intermediated relationship with us. So we do intend -- we will, or I think we have published a blog from our corporate site which gives more detail on the migration, the benefits to sellers, the timing of this migration, as much detail as we're prepared to give, we put out now, and it can be accessed by our community. But I do anticipate that this will be a small amount of GMV this year with significant costs, as you heard from Scott, more GMV next year, but still relatively small with even more significant costs. And then in 2020 or some date beyond that, we'll move the entire base over to this new model. Scott, I don't know if you want to add anything on the economics?"

On the costs, the $0.03 to $0.05 as you called out and we called out for the year, I think right now, it's about building out the intermediation capability on -- and the associated customer, both seller and buyer flows, to make them a lot better, and there's a lot of background to that. The intermediated model that we spoke about, that kind of $1 billion on it, it's really not on the core eBay business. So it's not like we're dragging and dropping code from 1 country in the eBay core business to another. This is building out the core eBay Marketplace payment intermediation capability. And that's going to take product and technology. It's also going to start to require us to invest in areas like trust and risk, customer service, to be able to prepare ourselves to take on these volumes and do it in a compliant and safe way. To your second question, in terms of the scale, let me kind of lay out the $2 billion and the $0.5 billion in a little bit more detail just so we're clear. To your question, here's -- to start with, we're gated for the next 2.5 years at 5% and then 10%. And so how quickly we can then scale from there is going to be partially determined on our capabilities and partially determined on how quickly we can scale with our sellers and our buyers and role that globally. But our base assumption is that if you continue to grow the core Marketplace platform that the new payment intermediation model applies to and you assume a migration schedule that scales rapidly after the operating agreement expires mid 2020, you start to talk about a pretty high penetration rate with intermediated model as you head into the latter part of 2020 and 2021. So when I talk about a fully scaled kind of stable state, you start to talk about the latter part of 2020, 2021, even into 2022. And the $2 billion, to be clear, is then taking that new intermediated GMV, applying a take rate that will be discounted versus the existing PayPal rate and you quickly get to $2 billion or more of revenue. When we size the costs associated with that, both the 19 that we've already framed up -- sorry, the 18 that we already framed up as well as the 19 that we're thinking about, the first couple of years, there will be some burn associated with that. That's already incorporated into our guidance obviously for this year, but when you start to think about the associated cost, not only to get this up and running, but the ongoing cost that are going to be associated with [ Audien ] and with PayPal on the new model, we start to look at about $0.5 billion at scale when we're scaled up for the future."

Let me first say that I'm not sure that this is going to end up being the right metric going forward in part because structured data is now touching so many different things in so many different ways that what we tried to do over the last year or actually more is try to just provide that as some leading indicator of structured data's progress. We are going to the degree to evaluate that because the truth is, is that 14% is a little bit misleading in the sense that you would imply that only 14% is the impact of structured data. That's not really true. In fact, structured data is making an impact in many more areas where it's not formerly a page and traffic as we define it, but yet, it's adding value in areas like the guidance that we give to sellers and a bunch of other areas. I would say even with that said, as we move to this sort of end-to-end experience that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to see the core experience move to product base much more significantly. I'd expect that you'll see whole categories move to the default being searches on eBay or product base, discovering on eBay as product base. And the reason that we have the confidence to that is, we do like what we see in terms of improvement and conversion rates. We mentioned in the past that at the edge of those gains are double digit, they continue to be. As we get to the core, we're beginning to see improvements and we believe that we can deliver conversion gains as we move this product experience from the edge to the center. And that's what gives us the confidence to move faster. So we really like structured data in many ways as the foundation of everything we've done in this strategy over the last 2.5 years. It will continue to be. The 14% is a very narrow metric which we provided at the time to give investors clarity about our progress, but I don't think it accurately represents the overall impact that structured data is having and will have on the ecosystem as we go forward."

This is probably the fastest growing new business, for lack of a better term, launched in eBay in years. And as I said, 50% sequential revenue growth quarter-on-quarter, that is quite significant. Most of the driver has been surface area. We are increasing the surface area of availability to sellers. We're increasing the surface area of the exposure of promoted listing to buyers. So a lot of it is just we have started to make sure we tested our way in, and now we're on a very steep part of the curve, we're opening the aperture so that more and more sellers can use it and they should and more and more buyers get exposure to those items and they are converting. So we are very pleased that we are now in that flywheel, and the flywheel seems to be turning very well. On the brand, I think your supposition is right on. So step 1 was, we now have a unified brand around the world. Arguably, the first time in eBay's history. The brand was very fragmented, very different depending on the country you would show up in or the region. We have a unified brand expression now everywhere in the world, and we're managing it as one of the most important assets of our business with very -- very much with rigor and care. Step 1 on the messages we're delivering is vibrancy and getting a bit of the fun back to eBay and getting differentiated of eBay, but you can expect as this rolls forward for us to punch harder on functional messages. We don't want it to be dry, but we do want to educate people about what we do today. And what we do today is not all long-term, longtail items, it's not all options. In fact, that's a distinct minority. So you'll see the overall brand expression remains constant, but the message has evolved. And the message evolution will punch much harder on how our -- what do you do today and why eBay. I keep asking the question of the brand, why eBay? We will answer that question definitively on selection, value, convenience where we believe we actually have a phenomenal customer proposition, just not enough people know about it."

I'm very confident that it's hard to parse out every change and every bit of improvement by everything we've done, but I'm very confident that the mix of significant product changes and brand and the mix of everything we've talked about for 2.5 years in our strategy has directly impacted the U.S. business. Why do I feel that? I feel that because, yes, the external market has gotten better, but keep in mind we're now on 5 consecutive quarters of acceleration in the face of unprecedented competition. This is our most competitive market in the world, and actually it's the business that's getting the best the fastest. And we entered this holiday and we said we're going to compete and win. And I feel like we showed up really well this holiday, and we were one of the top shopping destinations again this holiday in the world. So I do feel really positive about the U.S. business. It doesn't mean it's going to continue linearly to accelerate, but we've made a lot of changes to this business. And with all the noise about competition, eBay is still bigger and more relevant than just about all of them combined. So I feel great about that. With StubHub, I'd say it's slightly different. StubHub definitely benefited from the landscape. There are things that they did that improved ecosystem for sure, but as we said in the remarks, I still think there's more work to do at StubHub. So I wouldn't get over our SKUs and assume, wow, great quarter and now we can just plug that in. I think we've always said, StubHub has a high beta based on what happens out in the world. It happens to be that the fourth quarter broke really well and we had a really good World Series, we had a really good baseball playoffs, we had really good college football. I don't -- that's not a strategy, counting on things not within our control. So we have more work to do at StubHub. As you heard from Scott, they'll grow faster, we hope, than last year, but I wouldn't plug quarter 4 in as a linear across 2018. We still have work to do."

Quarter 4 was a record quarter for us. Highlighted by the fifth straight quarter of volume acceleration in our U.S. Marketplace, flow strong growth had stepped up.

Highlighted by the fifth straight quarter of volume acceleration in our U.S. Marketplace, flow strong growth had stepped up. Overall total GMV grew 10% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. Total revenue was up 7%; and active buyers grew 5%, ending the year at 170 million. GMV and revenue on our Marketplace platform grew at 6%. Our StubHub platform grew volume at 15%, and our Classified platform grew revenue at 13%. Finally, we repurchased $922 million of our own shares, taking advantage of a share price that we do not believe reflects the long-term value of our company. 
In our Marketplace platform, volume growth accelerated by 1 point in the U.S., while international growth decelerated 3 points, driven in part by the timing and impact of Korean Thanksgiving and slower export trade due to the stronger British pound in Europe. eBay was again one of the top holiday shopping destinations for consumers around the world, and performance this quarter was driven by strong U.S. consumer spending and good execution on our key initiatives. 
Our new product rollouts, which leverage our structured data foundation, got good initial traction in Q4. Over 150,000 customers a day used guaranteed delivery while searching on eBay in U.S. during the holiday season. Group listings, which is the first time buyers are seeing a product-based commerce experience on eBay, performed well and set the foundation for the next set of changes we'll make this year. And finally, we began to ramp eBay Authenticate, where we're already seeing inventory scaling nicely and much higher conversion on like-for-like items. 
We continue to invest in brand advertising with a coordinated holiday activation across all of our key markets. Significantly changing consumer consideration is a long-term effort, and we plan to invest more heavily in our brand in 2018.
Lastly, our first-party advertising revenue continues to pick up momentum. Nearly 160,000 sellers used promoted listings to advertise over 100 million items in the quarter, driving over 50% sequential revenue growth in Q4. The rapid growth of promoted listings is enabling us to shift away from nonstrategic third-party advertising. 
Our StubHub platform had a good Q4 with a 13 point GMV growth acceleration, driven by a strong concert environment and good MLB Playoff and college football performances. While we don't expect growth in 2018 to be at the same level as Q4 due to the ongoing ticketing landscape challenges we discussed last quarter, StubHub continues to be the world's favorite destination for fans looking to buy event tickets.
And Classifieds continues to enjoy robust vibrancy and double-digit growth, with mobile and eBay Kleinanzeigen continuing to be standout performers. 
Now taking a step back and putting Q4 in the context of the past 2.5 years, we've made great progress against our key strategic priorities to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while sharpening the eBay brand. This strategy is enabling us to transform the eBay experience and accelerate the growth of our business. We've significantly simplified and improved our customer experience and built equity in our brand. We've built a strong foundation of structured data, with the majority of our listings now tied to our product catalog and 14% of all traffic landing on catalog-enabled experiences. And we've done this while accelerating growth in our core eBay platform by nearly 3 points.
Looking to 2018, our strategy remains unchanged. We intend to raise the bar on our customer experience and again accelerate growth despite tougher comps. We'll focus on key areas of our user experience, including search, delivery and returns, customer service and payments, while continually planting the seeds of technology innovation. Let me share a few examples of our plans.
We will take the next step in transforming our user experience, including on eBay search, by launching a full product-based commerce experience for relevant inventory. This experience will leverage our structured data catalog in a more holistic way than we've previously done. We'll do this while also focusing on our overall search experience using data and AI to improve our recall and relevance. We'll continue to shrink delivery times by expanding Guaranteed Delivery and work with our sellers to provide retail-standard experiences for consumers. This will include enabling a vastly simplified returns process for buyers and sellers. 
Our technology innovation continues to focus on emerging platforms such as artificial intelligence, voice and image technology, virtual and augmented reality and distributed commerce. I've often said that eBay runs on AI, powering many aspects of our buying and selling experience. In 2018, we'll focus our AI capabilities on computer vision, personalization, search and dynamic pricing capabilities for our sellers. AR, VR and mixed reality are becoming viable platforms for development. As this tech becomes more consumer-friendly and accessible, eBay will take advantage of their unique capabilities, delivering immersive and engaging buying and selling experiences.
And there is a step-change opportunity to remove friction from the user experience by allowing users to interact with eBay by simply typing a message or using their voice to engage a digital assistant. In 2018, we plan on taking the first step towards unifying conversational commerce with the core eBay shopping experience, providing seamless voice or text assistance when needed within our desktop and app platforms. 
2018 will be a year of significant focus on customer service. In 2017, we on-shored a significant number of support roles, and that trend will continue this year, enabling us to provide top-tier live support to a broader set of our customer base. And for customers looking for fast self-service, we're rolling out brand-new AI-enabled mobile and desktop pages to address their service requests. And finally, we anticipate that our digital assistant will have the capability of directly handling certain service requests instantly and without human intervention.
Finally, let me touch on our strategy and approach for payments on eBay. We've been looking closely at the customer payments experience and the economics under our existing PayPal relationship. After careful consideration, we believe that we can offer a more seamless experience while giving buyers and sellers more choice for payment and payout options. At the same time, we believe we can capture significantly better economics while reducing overall selling costs. Therefore, we have made the decision to intermediate payments on eBay. We have already begun building this capability, and we'll move as quickly as we can under the terms of our operating agreement with PayPal. I'm excited to announce a deal with Adyen, a leading global payment processor, to be our primary partner in this effort. We are looking forward to working with Adyen, who we believe are uniquely qualified to support us in this transition. They power payment processing for a number of the world's leading global marketplaces and bring to our partnership a broad global footprint with a flexible and scalable technology platform. 
We've also aligned on terms for a new commercial agreement with PayPal to include them as a way to pay at checkout under our intermediated payment model. PayPal's been a great partner for eBay, and we look forward to a continued strong partnership with them going forward. 
We've built a world-class team to execute on this payment opportunity, including senior executives from companies such as PayPal, Alipay and Amazon Payments. In 2021, we expect to have transitioned a majority of our Marketplace customers to our new payment experience.
In summary, we've made good progress in 2017, delivering fundamental customer improvements while accelerating growth and improving the operating performance of the business. We enter 2018 with a healthier ecosystem and on a path for further acceleration this year. Looking forward to a year of significant progress to the benefit of our global community, of buyers and sellers, shareholders and employees.
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financials and our 2018 guidance."
27862,549105091,1377636,"eBay Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-01-31,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q4 financials, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Please note that my commentary on our 2017 financial performance is based on revenue accounting standards in place as of 2017 year-end.In Q4, we delivered G",2744,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q4 financials, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Please note that my commentary on our 2017 financial performance is based on revenue accounting standards in place as of 2017 year-end.
In Q4, we delivered GMV of $24.4 billion, increasing 10% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. We generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.59 of non-GAAP EPS, $796 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $920 million -- $922 million of our stock. 
Let's start with Q4 active buyers on Slide 5.  In the quarter, trailing 12-month growth was 5% year-over-year, resulting in 170 million active buyers. Active buyer growth in our Marketplace platform decelerated slightly, offset by strength at StubHub. The extended Thanksgiving holiday in Korea was the primary driver of the Marketplace growth deceleration. 
On Slide 6, in Q4, we enabled $24.4 billion of GMV, up 7%. By geography, the U.S. generated $9.9 billion of GMV, up 8%, accelerating 3 points versus the prior quarter. International delivered $14.6 billion of GMV, up 6%, down 3 points versus the prior quarter. 
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 7% organically, consistent with the prior quarter. We delivered $2 billion of transaction revenue, up 7%, and $578 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 6%. 
Transitioning to our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. Q4 GMV grew 6%, with U.S. GMV accelerating by 1 point to 7%, and international GMV growing 6%, a 3-point deceleration. International growth was impacted by the extended Korean Thanksgiving holiday, slowing U.K. export growth due to a stronger pound and softer consumer spending in Germany. Underlying these trends, we saw our B2C segment grow 6%, relatively constant with prior quarters. C2C grew 7% year-over-year, another quarter of good growth, aided by our ongoing efforts to simplify consumer selling and drive engagement. 
Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Transaction revenue grew 7%, driven by volume growth and the impact of our Q2 pricing changes, partially offset by heavier promotional spend in the holiday season. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 3%, decelerating 3 points versus Q3 as we continue to shift our advertising efforts away from nonstrategic third-party ad placements and towards our first-party promoted listings product. This will favor transaction revenue, putting ongoing pressure on MS&O revenue growth. For the full year, the Marketplace platform generated $84 billion of GMV, growing 6%, 1.5 points faster than 2016; and $7.6 billion in revenue, also up 6%, 2 points faster than the prior year.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 15%, accelerating 13 points from Q3 due to a stronger-than-expected event landscape, led by concerts, a great World Series and strong college football matchups. 
StubHub revenue grew 10%, up 5 points versus Q3, driven by volume, offset by a lower take rate and seasonal incentives to take advantage of a strong market opportunity. In 2017, StubHub grew GMV 5% to $4.5 billion and delivered $1 billion in revenue, growing 9% year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 10, our Classifieds platform continues to innovate and serve more than 250 million monthly unique visitors. In Q4, Classifieds had another strong quarter of 13% revenue growth. We continue to see good vertical performance and strength in advertising revenue. For the full year, Classifieds generated $897 million of revenue, up 12%.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q4, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 31%, which is down 100 basis points versus last year, 40 basis of -- basis points of which was due to the impact of foreign exchange. Cost of revenue increased slightly year-over-year as a percentage of revenue, driven primarily by our first-party inventory program in Korea. Q4 sales and marketing expense was up 100 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by the increased investment in our ongoing brand campaign. Product development was down slightly year-over-year due to leverage, partially offset by increased investments in product. G&A expense was down 50 basis points as we delivered further operating leverage. 
For the year, operating margin was 29.5%, down 160 basis points. Foreign exchange impacted full year margin by 70 basis points, and the remaining impact was driven by our investments in Marketplace product and marketing initiatives and growth of our first-party inventory program in Korea.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q4, we delivered $0.59 in non-GAAP EPS, up 9%, driven by revenue growth, the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by the impact of foreign exchange.
Moving to Q4 GAAP EPS. We have 3 significant financial impacts related to the passage of recent U.S. tax reform. We are recording a $1.9 billion tax charge related to the repatriation of our foreign earnings. $1.4 billion of this amount will be paid over 8 years, with the first 2 installments to be paid in 2018. The additional $0.5 billion represents foreign withholding taxes that will be paid upon repatriation of those earnings. This tax charge is largely offset by the reversal of our $1.8 billion deferred tax liability established primarily in 2014 in anticipation of repatriating foreign earnings. We also are recording a $3 billion deferred tax liability to address other areas of U.S. tax reform, primarily a global minimum tax that will now be applicable to our foreign earnings. This tax will impact our ongoing tax rate and cash taxes. We have recorded these amounts provisionally using reasonable estimates, and the amounts may change in 2018. I will cover the impact of these changes on our go-forward tax rate in our 2018 guidance discussion.
As a result of these charges in Q4, our GAAP EPS was negative $2.51, down $7.82 versus last year. The decrease in GAAP EPS was driven by the aforementioned tax impacts and the lapping of prior year noncash GAAP income tax benefit of approximately $4.6 billion related to our legal entity restructuring at the time. As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q4, we generated $796 million of free cash flow. Full year free cash flow was $2.5 billion, above our guidance range, due to the timing of certain cash tax payments and capital expenditures.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $11.3 billion, with $2.2 billion located in the U.S. In Q4, we repurchased 24.9 million shares at an average price of $36.99 per share, amounting to $922 million in total. This brings our repurchases for the year to $2.7 billion. Repurchases and separation are now $6.8 billion, which is approximately 19% of shares outstanding at an average price of $29.54. We ended the year with $1.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
In light of U.S. tax reform, I would like to review our capital allocation policy, which we continue to believe drive significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees. We aim to preserve financial flexibility in order to have the resources to execute our strategy and drive long-term value creation. We will continue to invest in attractive opportunities to drive organic growth while balancing profitability over the long-term, even if those investments are dilutive in the near term. We will supplement our organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments to improve our competitiveness in a rapidly evolving environment. Our M&A strategy continues to center on our geographic footprint, vertical expansion and tech and talent acquisitions. 
We continue to optimize our financial flexibility, access to debt and cost of capital. We believe that our current rating of BBB+ maintains a practical flexibility and aim to maintain this rating as we continue to execute on our capital allocation plans. 
Finally, we are committed to providing meaningful returns for our shareholders, and we believe, at current valuations, share repurchases continue to be the optimal vehicle for capital return. While we will always adjust to future events, we expect to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders to approximately $3.5 billion per year over the next 2 years in the form of share repurchases, inclusive of dilution offset. Our board has approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization to enable us to execute on this plan, and we have already returned $750 million in Q1 through an accelerated share repurchase. We will continually evaluate our capital allocation strategy as we move forward, ensuring that we drive optimal value on behalf of our shareholders.
Before turning to guidance, I'd like to highlight some key topics relevant to our business in 2018.
I want to spend a moment to discuss the impact of a new revenue standard which we will adopt beginning with our Q1 results. There are several impacts of the new standard on our financial reporting. The primary change relates to clearly defining who our customer is and realigning how we record incentive spend based on this definition. There is also an immaterial change in the timing of revenue recognition for certain fees on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. 
As sellers are the main source of our Marketplace revenue, certain incentives solely for our buyers such as coupons and rewards will now be recorded as sales and marketing expense instead of contra-revenue going forward. The impact of this change would've amounted to $363 million and $322 million for 2017 and '16, respectively, and our 2017 operating margin would've been 28.4% under the new standard. Ultimately, this is simply a change in how we will present our financials, resulting in increased revenue, increased expenses and a lower operating margin with no impact to operating income.  Please refer to the exhibit on our press release and our website financials for more details and a historical reconciliation of 2016 and '17 under the new revenue standard to help our investors understand our 2018 business outlook and future growth comparisons.
Now I'd like to talk about payments. As Devin discussed, we believe that there is a great opportunity to provide a better buyer experience to give our sellers more choices at better value and to capture better economics. This will be a multiyear effort, but we believe it is important to provide context today on the future economic opportunity. 
As a payment intermediator on the eBay Marketplace, we will be responsible for collecting funds from buyers and instructing our payment processor to disburse funds to sellers. Currently, this is done via our relationship with PayPal. In the new intermediation model, we will simplify our relationship with sellers and plan to charge them a single fee for our Marketplace and payment services.
When doing so, we expect to recognize the payment fees as revenue via an increase in our take rate and record the cost of payment processing and other related fees. When we reach a steady state, with the majority of our volume transitioned to this intermediated model, we would expect annualized incremental revenue of more than $2 billion. This estimate includes an expectation that we will take steps to lower the cost of selling on eBay via a  lower all-in take rate. 
Delivering on this revenue opportunity requires ongoing operational costs in areas such as product and technology, trust, risk, customer service and payment processing fees. Factoring in these costs, we believe the annualized incremental operating income could be $0.5 billion. While this isn't completely new business -- while this isn't a completely new business for us, given that we already act as a payment intermediary on other eBay platforms, it is important to keep in mind that this is a complex effort and may face delays along the way. However, we are moving quickly and are excited about the potential long-term benefits this creates for our ecosystem.
We have already begun investing in our payment strategy, well ahead of recognizing any material new income streams. For 2018, we expect this investment to cost us between $0.03 and $0.05 in EPS, which is factored into our guidance, and the investment is likely to increase in 2019. As a reminder, our operating agreement with PayPal remains in place until mid-2020, and our ability to offset the expense related to this investment is limited until the expiration of the existing agreement. We look forward to working with Adyen as our new partner and with PayPal in a new capacity to deliver on this significant opportunity.
Moving to full year guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting 2018 revenue between $10.9 billion and $11.1 billion, growing 7% to 9% on an FX-neutral basis and 10% to 12% on an as-reported basis. The midpoint of our projected growth assumes another point of GMV acceleration in our Marketplace platform. As discussed by Devin, we will continue to drive new experiences on our platform of structured data, the most impactful of which are helping buyers find the best choice and most relevance through product-based experiences and improved search and helping our sellers drive velocity through improved tools and workflows. We expect to deliver modest full year acceleration in StubHub GMV with monetization levels on par with Q4. And Classifieds should continue to see stable double-digit growth. 
We expect operating margin of 27% to 29% for the year, which, at the midpoint, is down 40 basis points from 2017, normalizing for the new accounting standard mentioned earlier. This includes our investment to build out payment intermediation and continued investments in our brand and platform, offset by leverage in functional areas. 
We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 19% to 22%. We currently expect that U.S. tax reform will benefit our ongoing tax rate by approximately 1 point. This rate is positively impacted by the reduction of U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, but that benefit is largely offset by the global minimum tax and other foreign taxes that can no longer be credited against our U.S. tax liability. Our guidance range is slightly wider than normal, driven by uncertainty in how all elements of U.S. tax reform will impact us going forward.
We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30 per share, up 12% to 15% as reported versus last year. This includes the impact of continued top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program and a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by our investments in payment intermediation. 
We expect free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This is lower than 2017 due to approximately $300 million in cash taxes related to repatriation and assumes capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 8% of revenue. Full year GAAP EPS is projected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share. GAAP EPS is impacted by the same drivers as non-GAAP EPS in addition to the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and the amortization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Turning to Q1 guidance on Slide 16. For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.57 billion and $2.61 billion, growing 7% to 9% per year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 per share, representing 7% to 11% growth. EPS growth is driven primarily by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41 per share in Q1.
In summary, 2017 was a year where we delivered on our commitments and saw our strategy translate into Marketplace acceleration of GMV and revenue growth. U.S. Marketplace GMV has accelerated from 1% to 7% over the past 5 quarters during a period of unprecedented competition, while our international Marketplace delivered another year of 7% GMV growth. Classifieds continued to grow at the double digits, and StubHub ended the year well. 
For the year, we delivered 6% EPS growth in the face of 5 points of foreign exchange headwinds in addition to our incremental investments. We have remained disciplined capital allocators, returning $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in the last year alone and totaling $6.8 billion, repurchase and separation. We executed several deals to further tech and talent expansion. And in Q3, we optimized our strategy in India by taking an ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for our eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment. 
Heading into 2018, we will stay consistent in our strategy, continuing to improve our user experiences while delivering profitable growth and strong capital return to our shareholders.

First of all, on payments, I don't -- just a technical detail. We have not made the decision to become a merchant of record. There are many ways that we could become a payment intermediary. MoR is one of them. That's a decision yet to be made, and it may actually change depending on the geography in which we operate in. But vis-à-vis sellers, we're fairly confident that we can lower the overall selling cost on eBay. We have not yet made final decisions, and it will be a process that will take some time to publicize our pricing to sellers. But what I want sellers to hear is that, number one, we have their experience in mind. We want to give them flexibility, increased payout options, and we want to lower their costs. So that was very much front and center in our mind was -- when we made this very consequential decision. On acceleration in '18, there are quite a few things. We've built a foundation of structured data that now has tentacles into almost everything we do. We have rolled out quite a significant number of new product experiences like Guaranteed Delivery, authentication and a product-based commerce experience, and we're going to scale those in 2018. So when we see in part the impact that these initiatives are making, when we see the trajectory that our business is on, we're confident that we can continue to deliver improvement in the business. I'll go back and say, over 2.5 years, 2.5 years ago, when we started this journey, we said that we were going to address the core customer pain points and issues directly and head on. We said it wasn't going to be easy. We said that you could expect steady improvement and a strong return of capital along the way. We've done exactly that. We've seen the customer experience improve. We've seen the foundation of the house being shored up. We've seen acceleration in the growth of the business, and we've been aggressive in returning capital to shareholders.

Beyond a certain date, which over due course we will announce, you will not be able to be on eBay selling or buying without this intermediated relationship with us. So we do intend -- we will -- or I think we have published a blog from our corporate site which gives more detail on the migration, the benefits to sellers, the timing of this migration. As much detail as we're prepared to give, we put out now, and it can be accessed by our community. But I do anticipate that this will be a small amount of GMV this year with significant cost, as you heard from Scott, more GMV next year but still relatively small with even more significant costs.

On the costs, the $0.03 to $0.05, as you called out and we called out for the year, it's -- think, right now, it's about building out the intermediation capability on -- and the associated customer, both seller and buyer flows, to make them a lot better, and there's a lot of background to that. The intermediated model that we spoke about, the $10-ish billion that's on it, it's really not on the core eBay business. So it's not like we're dragging and dropping code from one country in the eBay core business to another. This is building out the core eBay Marketplace payment intermediation capability, and that's going to take product and technology. It's also going to start to require us to invest in areas like trust and risk, customer service, to be able to prepare ourselves to take on these volumes and do it in a compliant and safe way. In -- to your second question, in terms of the scale, let me kind of lay out the $2 billion and the $0.5 billion in a little bit more detail just so we're clear. And to your question, here's -- to start with, we're gated for the next 2.5 years at 5% and then 10%. And so how quickly we can then scale from there is going to be partially determined on our capabilities and partially determined on how quickly we can scale with our sellers and our buyers and roll that globally. But our base assumption is that if you continue to grow the core Marketplaces platform that the new payment intermediation model applies to and you assume a migration schedule that scales rapidly after the operating agreement expires mid-2020, you start to talk about a pretty high penetration rate with intermediated model as you head into the latter part of 2020 and 2021. So when I talk about a fully scaled kind of stable state, you start to talk about the latter part of 2020, 2021, even into 2022. And the $2 billion, to be clear, is then taking that new intermediated GMV, applying a take rate that'll be discounted versus the existing PayPal rate, and you quickly get to $2 billion or more of revenue. When we size the costs associated with that, both the '19 that we've already framed up -- sorry, the '18 that we already framed up as well as the '19 that we're thinking about, the first couple of years, there'll be some burn associated with that. That's already incorporated into our guidance, obviously, for this year, but when you start to think about the associated costs, not only to get this up and running but the ongoing costs that are going to be associated with Adyen and with PayPal on the new model, we start to look at about $0.5 billion at scale when we're scaled up for the future."

Let me first say that I'm not sure that this is going to end up being the right metric going forward, in part because structured data is now touching so many different things in so many different ways that what we tried to do over the last year, or actually more, is try to just provide that as some leading indicator of structured data's progress. We're going to continue to evaluate that because the truth is that 14% is a little bit misleading in the sense that you would imply that only 14% is the impact of structured data. That's not really true. In fact, structured data is making an impact in many more areas where it's not formally a page and traffic as we define it, but yet, it's adding value in areas like the guidance that we give to sellers and a bunch of other areas. I would say, even with that said, as we move to this sort of end-to-end experience that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to see the core experience move to product base much more significantly. I'd expect that you'll see whole categories move to the default being searches on eBay, our product base, discovering on eBay's product base. And the reason that we have the confidence to do that is we are -- we do like what we see in terms of improvement in conversion rates. We mentioned in the past that, at the edge, those gains are double digit; they continue to be. As we get to the core, we're beginning to see improvements, and we believe that we can deliver conversion gains as we move this product experience from the edge to the center, and that's what gives us the confidence to move faster. So we really like structured data. In many ways, it is the foundation of everything we've done in this strategy over the last 2.5 years. It will continue to be. The 14% is a very narrow metric which we provided at the time to give investors clarity about our progress, but I don't think it accurately represents the overall impact that structured data is having and will have on the ecosystem as we go forward."

This is probably the fastest growing new business, for lack of a better term, launched in eBay in years. And it -- as I said, 50% sequential revenue growth quarter-on-quarter, that is quite significant. Most of the driver has been surface area. We are increasing the surface area of availability to sellers. We're increasing the surface area of the exposure of promoted listing to buyers. So a lot of it is just we have started and made sure we tested our way in, and now we're on a very steep part of the curve where we're opening the aperture so that more and more sellers can use it, and they should, and more and more buyers get exposure to those items and they are converting. So we are very pleased that we are now in that flywheel, and the flywheel seems to be turning very well. On the brand, I think your supposition is right on. So step 1 was, we now have a unified brand around the world, arguably the first time in eBay's history. The brand was very fragmented, very different depending on the country you would show up in or the region. We have a unified brand expression now everywhere in the world, and we're managing it as one of the most important assets of our business with -- very much with rigor and care. Step 1 on the messages we're delivering is vibrancy and getting a bit of the fun back to eBay and getting differentiation of eBay. But you can expect, as this rolls forward, for us to punch harder on functional messages. We don't want it to be dry, but we do want to educate people about what we do today. And what we do today is not all long-term, long-tail items, it's not all auctions. In fact, that's a distinct minority. So you'll see the overall brand expression remain constant, but the message has evolved. And the message evolution will punch much harder on how our -- what do you do today and why eBay? I keep asking the question of the brand, why eBay? We will answer that question definitively on selection, value, convenience, where we believe we actually have a phenomenal customer proposition, just not enough people know about it."

And the growth would've been, for MS&O, in the mid-teens if promoted listings were actually part of MS&O.

Why do I feel that? I feel that because, yes, the external market has gotten better, but keep in mind, we're now on 5 consecutive quarters of acceleration in the face of unprecedented competition. This is our most competitive market in the world, and actually, it's the business that's getting the best the fastest. And we entered this holiday and we said we're going to compete and win. And I feel like we showed up really well this holiday, and we were one of the top shopping destinations again this holiday in the world. So I do feel really positive about the U.S. business. It doesn't mean it's going to continue linearly to accelerate, but we've made a lot of changes to this business, and with all the noise about competition, eBay is still bigger and more relevant than just about all of them combined. So I feel great about that. With StubHub, I'd say it's slightly different. StubHub definitely benefited from the landscape. There are things that they did that improved the ecosystem for sure, but as we said in the remarks, I still think there's more work to do at StubHub. So I wouldn't get over our skis and assume, wow, great quarter and now we can just plug that in. I think we've always said, StubHub has a high beta based on what happens out in the world. It happens to be that the fourth quarter broke really well and we had really good World Series, we had really good baseball playoffs, we had really good college football. I don't -- that's not a strategy, counting on things not within our control. So we have more work to do at StubHub. As you heard from Scott, they'll grow faster, we hope, than last year, but I wouldn't plug quarter 4 in as a linear across 2018. We still have work to do."

We're not going to point out anything more than that, but I think you'll find it to be quite comprehensive. On the $10 billion, I think the question was -- is that, those are -- as Scott said, it's off-platform, non-PayPal GMV, so that's correct. And finally, off eBay, that's not our intention. Just to be clear, we're not building a payments business to go compete with Apple Pay. We're not competing with PayPal, we're not rebuilding PayPal. We're building an intermediated payment service for the benefit of eBay customers on the eBay Marketplace. That's what we're doing."

Quarter 4 was a record quarter for us. Highlighted by the fifth straight quarter of volume acceleration in our U.S. Marketplace, plus strong growth at StubHub. Overall total GMV grew 10% on an as-reported basis",1323,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Quarter 4 was a record quarter for us. Highlighted by the fifth straight quarter of volume acceleration in our U.S. Marketplace, plus strong growth at StubHub. Overall total GMV grew 10% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. Total revenue was up 7%; and active buyers grew 5%, ending the year at 170 million. GMV and revenue on our Marketplace platform grew at 6%. Our StubHub platform grew volume at 15%, and our Classified platform grew revenue at 13%. Finally, we repurchased $922 million of our own shares, taking advantage of a share price that we do not believe reflects the long-term value of our company. 
In our Marketplace platform, volume growth accelerated by 1 point in the U.S., while international growth decelerated 3 points, driven in part by the timing and impact of Korean Thanksgiving and slower export trade due to the stronger British pound in Europe. eBay was again one of the top holiday shopping destinations for consumers around the world, and performance this quarter was driven by strong U.S. consumer spending and good execution on our key initiatives. 
Our new product rollouts, which leverage our structured data foundation, got good initial traction in Q4. Over 150,000 customers a day used guaranteed delivery while searching on eBay in U.S. during the holiday season. Group listings, which is the first time buyers are seeing a product-based commerce experience on eBay, performed well and set the foundation for the next set of changes we'll make this year. And finally, we began to ramp eBay Authenticate, where we're already seeing inventory scaling nicely and much higher conversion on like-for-like items. 
We continue to invest in brand advertising with a coordinated holiday activation across all of our key markets. Significantly changing consumer consideration is a long-term effort, and we plan to invest more heavily in our brand in 2018.
Lastly, our first-party advertising revenue continues to pick up momentum. Nearly 160,000 sellers used promoted listings to advertise over 100 million items in the quarter, driving over 50% sequential revenue growth in Q4. The rapid growth of promoted listings is enabling us to shift away from nonstrategic third-party advertising. 
Our StubHub platform had a good Q4 with a 13-point GMV growth acceleration, driven by a strong concert environment and good MLB Playoff and college football performances. While we don't expect growth in 2018 to be at the same level as Q4 due to the ongoing ticketing landscape challenges we discussed last quarter, StubHub continues to be the world's favorite destination for fans looking to buy event tickets.
And Classifieds continues to enjoy robust vibrancy and double-digit growth, with mobile and eBay Kleinanzeigen continuing to be standout performers. 
Now taking a step back and putting Q4 in the context of the past 2.5 years, we've made great progress against our key strategic priorities to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while sharpening the eBay brand. This strategy is enabling us to transform the eBay experience and accelerate the growth of our business. We've significantly simplified and improved our customer experience and built equity in our brand. We've built a strong foundation of structured data, with the majority of our listings now tied to our product catalog and 14% of all traffic landing on catalog-enabled experiences. And we've done this while accelerating growth in our core eBay platform by nearly 3 points.
Looking to 2018, our strategy remains unchanged. We intend to raise the bar on our customer experience and again accelerate growth despite tougher comps. We'll focus on key areas of our user experience, including search, delivery and returns, customer service and payments, while continually planting the seeds of technology innovation. Let me share a few examples of our plans.
We will take the next step in transforming our user experience, including on eBay search, by launching a full product-based commerce experience for relevant inventory. This experience will leverage our structured data catalog in a more holistic way than we've previously done. We'll do this while also focusing on our overall search experience using data and AI to improve our recall and relevance. We'll continue to shrink delivery times by expanding Guaranteed Delivery and work with our sellers to provide retail-standard experiences for consumers. This will include enabling a vastly simplified returns process for buyers and sellers. 
Our technology innovation continues to focus on emerging platforms such as artificial intelligence, voice and image technology, virtual and augmented reality and distributed commerce. I've often said that eBay runs on AI, powering many aspects of our buying and selling experience. In 2018, we'll focus our AI capabilities on computer vision, personalization, search and dynamic pricing capabilities for our sellers. AR, VR and mixed reality are becoming viable platforms for development. As this tech becomes more consumer-friendly and accessible, eBay will take advantage of their unique capabilities, delivering immersive and engaging buying and selling experiences.
And there is a step-change opportunity to remove friction from the user experience by allowing users to interact with eBay by simply typing a message or using their voice to engage a digital assistant. In 2018, we plan on taking the first step towards unifying conversational commerce with the core eBay shopping experience, providing seamless voice or text assistance when needed within our desktop and app platforms. 
2018 will be a year of significant focus on customer service. In 2017, we on-shored a significant number of support roles, and that trend will continue this year, enabling us to provide top-tier live support to a broader set of our customer base. And for customers looking for fast self-service, we're rolling out brand-new AI-enabled mobile and desktop pages to address their service requests. And finally, we anticipate that our digital assistant will have the capability of directly handling certain service requests instantly and without human intervention.
Finally, let me touch on our strategy and approach for payments on eBay. We've been looking closely at the customer payments experience and the economics under our existing PayPal relationship. After careful consideration, we believe that we can offer a more seamless experience while giving buyers and sellers more choice for payment and payout options. At the same time, we believe we can capture significantly better economics while reducing overall selling costs. Therefore, we have made the decision to intermediate payments on eBay. We have already begun building this capability, and we'll move as quickly as we can under the terms of our operating agreement with PayPal. I'm excited to announce a deal with Adyen, a leading global payment processor, to be our primary partner in this effort. We are looking forward to working with Adyen, who we believe are uniquely qualified to support us in this transition. They power payment processing for a number of the world's leading global marketplaces and bring to our partnership a broad global footprint with a flexible and scalable technology platform. 
We've also aligned on terms for a new commercial agreement with PayPal to include them as a way to pay at checkout under our intermediated payment model. PayPal's been a great partner for eBay, and we look forward to a continued strong partnership with them going forward. 
We've built a world-class team to execute on this payment opportunity, including senior executives from companies such as PayPal, Alipay and Amazon Payments. In 2021, we expect to have transitioned a majority of our Marketplace customers to our new payment experience.
In summary, we've made good progress in 2017, delivering fundamental customer improvements while accelerating growth and improving the operating performance of the business. We enter 2018 with a healthier ecosystem and on a path for further acceleration this year. Looking forward to a year of significant progress to the benefit of our global community, of buyers and sellers, shareholders and employees.
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financials and our 2018 guidance."
27862,549105091,1377668,"eBay Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-01-31,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q4 financials, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Please note that my commentary on our 2017 financial performance is based on revenue accounting standards in place as of 2017 year-end.In Q4, we delivered G",2744,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q4 financials, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Please note that my commentary on our 2017 financial performance is based on revenue accounting standards in place as of 2017 year-end.
In Q4, we delivered GMV of $24.4 billion, increasing 10% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. We generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.59 of non-GAAP EPS, $796 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $920 million -- $922 million of our stock. 
Let's start with Q4 active buyers on Slide 5.  In the quarter, trailing 12-month growth was 5% year-over-year, resulting in 170 million active buyers. Active buyer growth in our Marketplace platform decelerated slightly, offset by strength at StubHub. The extended Thanksgiving holiday in Korea was the primary driver of the Marketplace growth deceleration. 
On Slide 6, in Q4, we enabled $24.4 billion of GMV, up 7%. By geography, the U.S. generated $9.9 billion of GMV, up 8%, accelerating 3 points versus the prior quarter. International delivered $14.6 billion of GMV, up 6%, down 3 points versus the prior quarter. 
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 7% organically, consistent with the prior quarter. We delivered $2 billion of transaction revenue, up 7%, and $578 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 6%. 
Transitioning to our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. Q4 GMV grew 6%, with U.S. GMV accelerating by 1 point to 7%, and international GMV growing 6%, a 3-point deceleration. International growth was impacted by the extended Korean Thanksgiving holiday, slowing U.K. export growth due to a stronger pound and softer consumer spending in Germany. Underlying these trends, we saw our B2C segment grow 6%, relatively constant with prior quarters. C2C grew 7% year-over-year, another quarter of good growth, aided by our ongoing efforts to simplify consumer selling and drive engagement. 
Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Transaction revenue grew 7%, driven by volume growth and the impact of our Q2 pricing changes, partially offset by heavier promotional spend in the holiday season. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 3%, decelerating 3 points versus Q3 as we continue to shift our advertising efforts away from nonstrategic third-party ad placements and towards our first-party promoted listings product. This will favor transaction revenue, putting ongoing pressure on MS&O revenue growth. For the full year, the Marketplace platform generated $84 billion of GMV, growing 6%, 1.5 points faster than 2016; and $7.6 billion in revenue, also up 6%, 2 points faster than the prior year.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 15%, accelerating 13 points from Q3 due to a stronger-than-expected event landscape, led by concerts, a great World Series and strong college football matchups. 
StubHub revenue grew 10%, up 5 points versus Q3, driven by volume, offset by a lower take rate and seasonal incentives to take advantage of a strong market opportunity. In 2017, StubHub grew GMV 5% to $4.5 billion and delivered $1 billion in revenue, growing 9% year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 10, our Classifieds platform continues to innovate and serve more than 250 million monthly unique visitors. In Q4, Classifieds had another strong quarter of 13% revenue growth. We continue to see good vertical performance and strength in advertising revenue. For the full year, Classifieds generated $897 million of revenue, up 12%.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q4, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 31%, which is down 100 basis points versus last year, 40 basis of -- basis points of which was due to the impact of foreign exchange. Cost of revenue increased slightly year-over-year as a percentage of revenue, driven primarily by our first-party inventory program in Korea. Q4 sales and marketing expense was up 100 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by the increased investment in our ongoing brand campaign. Product development was down slightly year-over-year due to leverage, partially offset by increased investments in product. G&A expense was down 50 basis points as we delivered further operating leverage. 
For the year, operating margin was 29.5%, down 160 basis points. Foreign exchange impacted full year margin by 70 basis points, and the remaining impact was driven by our investments in Marketplace product and marketing initiatives and growth of our first-party inventory program in Korea.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q4, we delivered $0.59 in non-GAAP EPS, up 9%, driven by revenue growth, the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by the impact of foreign exchange.
Moving to Q4 GAAP EPS. We have 3 significant financial impacts related to the passage of recent U.S. tax reform. We are recording a $1.9 billion tax charge related to the repatriation of our foreign earnings. $1.4 billion of this amount will be paid over 8 years, with the first 2 installments to be paid in 2018. The additional $0.5 billion represents foreign withholding taxes that will be paid upon repatriation of those earnings. This tax charge is largely offset by the reversal of our $1.8 billion deferred tax liability established primarily in 2014 in anticipation of repatriating foreign earnings. We also are recording a $3 billion deferred tax liability to address other areas of U.S. tax reform, primarily a global minimum tax that will now be applicable to our foreign earnings. This tax will impact our ongoing tax rate and cash taxes. We have recorded these amounts provisionally using reasonable estimates, and the amounts may change in 2018. I will cover the impact of these changes on our go-forward tax rate in our 2018 guidance discussion.
As a result of these charges in Q4, our GAAP EPS was negative $2.51, down $7.82 versus last year. The decrease in GAAP EPS was driven by the aforementioned tax impacts and the lapping of prior year noncash GAAP income tax benefit of approximately $4.6 billion related to our legal entity restructuring at the time. As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q4, we generated $796 million of free cash flow. Full year free cash flow was $2.5 billion, above our guidance range, due to the timing of certain cash tax payments and capital expenditures.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $11.3 billion, with $2.2 billion located in the U.S. In Q4, we repurchased 24.9 million shares at an average price of $36.99 per share, amounting to $922 million in total. This brings our repurchases for the year to $2.7 billion. Repurchases since separation are now $6.8 billion, which is approximately 19% of shares outstanding at an average price of $29.54. We ended the year with $1.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
In light of U.S. tax reform, I would like to review our capital allocation policy, which we continue to believe drives significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees. We aim to preserve financial flexibility in order to have the resources to execute our strategy and drive long-term value creation. We will continue to invest in attractive opportunities to drive organic growth while balancing profitability over the long-term, even if those investments are dilutive in the near term. We will supplement our organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments to improve our competitiveness in a rapidly evolving environment. Our M&A strategy continues to center on our geographic footprint, vertical expansion and tech and talent acquisitions. 
We continue to optimize our financial flexibility, access to debt and cost of capital. We believe that our current rating of BBB+ maintains a practical flexibility and aim to maintain this rating as we continue to execute on our capital allocation plans. 
Finally, we are committed to providing meaningful returns for our shareholders, and we believe, at current valuations, share repurchases continue to be the optimal vehicle for capital return. While we will always adjust to future events, we expect to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders to approximately $3.5 billion per year over the next 2 years in the form of share repurchases, inclusive of dilution offset. Our board has approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization to enable us to execute on this plan, and we have already returned $750 million in Q1 through an accelerated share repurchase. We will continually evaluate our capital allocation strategy as we move forward, ensuring that we drive optimal value on behalf of our shareholders.
Before turning to guidance, I'd like to highlight some key topics relevant to our business in 2018.
I want to spend a moment to discuss the impact of a new revenue standard which we will adopt beginning with our Q1 results. There are several impacts of the new standard on our financial reporting. The primary change relates to clearly defining who our customer is and realigning how we record incentive spend based on this definition. There is also an immaterial change in the timing of revenue recognition for certain fees on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. 
As sellers are the main source of our Marketplace revenue, certain incentives solely for our buyers such as coupons and rewards will now be recorded as sales and marketing expense instead of contra-revenue going forward. The impact of this change would've amounted to $363 million and $322 million for 2017 and '16, respectively, and our 2017 operating margin would've been 28.4% under the new standard. Ultimately, this is simply a change in how we will present our financials, resulting in increased revenue, increased expenses and a lower operating margin with no impact to operating income.  Please refer to the exhibit on our press release and our website financials for more details and a historical reconciliation of 2016 and '17 under the new revenue standard to help our investors understand our 2018 business outlook and future growth comparisons.
Now I'd like to talk about payments. As Devin discussed, we believe that there is a great opportunity to provide a better buyer experience to give our sellers more choices at better value and to capture better economics. This will be a multiyear effort, but we believe it is important to provide context today on the future economic opportunity. 
As a payment intermediator on the eBay Marketplace, we will be responsible for collecting funds from buyers and instructing our payment processor to disburse funds to sellers. Currently, this is done via our relationship with PayPal. In the new intermediation model, we will simplify our relationship with sellers and plan to charge them a single fee for our Marketplace and payment services.
When doing so, we expect to recognize the payment fees as revenue via an increase in our take rate and record the cost of payment processing and other related fees. When we reach a steady state, with the majority of our volume transitioned to this intermediated model, we would expect annualized incremental revenue of more than $2 billion. This estimate includes an expectation that we will take steps to lower the cost of selling on eBay via a  lower all-in take rate. 
Delivering on this revenue opportunity requires ongoing operational costs in areas such as product and technology, trust, risk, customer service and payment processing fees. Factoring in these costs, we believe the annualized incremental operating income could be $0.5 billion. While this isn't completely new business -- while this isn't a completely new business for us, given that we already act as a payment intermediary on other eBay platforms, it is important to keep in mind that this is a complex effort and may face delays along the way. However, we are moving quickly and are excited about the potential long-term benefits this creates for our ecosystem.
We have already begun investing in our payment strategy, well ahead of recognizing any material new income streams. For 2018, we expect this investment to cost us between $0.03 and $0.05 in EPS, which is factored into our guidance, and the investment is likely to increase in 2019. As a reminder, our operating agreement with PayPal remains in place until mid-2020, and our ability to offset the expense related to this investment is limited until the expiration of the existing agreement. We look forward to working with Adyen as our new partner and with PayPal in a new capacity to deliver on this significant opportunity.
Moving to full year guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting 2018 revenue between $10.9 billion and $11.1 billion, growing 7% to 9% on an FX-neutral basis and 10% to 12% on an as-reported basis. The midpoint of our projected growth assumes another point of GMV acceleration in our Marketplace platform. As discussed by Devin, we will continue to drive new experiences on our platform of structured data, the most impactful of which are helping buyers find the best choice and most relevance through product-based experiences and improved search and helping our sellers drive velocity through improved tools and workflows. We expect to deliver modest full year acceleration in StubHub GMV with monetization levels on par with Q4. And Classifieds should continue to see stable double-digit growth. 
We expect operating margin of 27% to 29% for the year, which, at the midpoint, is down 40 basis points from 2017, normalizing for the new accounting standard mentioned earlier. This includes our investment to build out payment intermediation and continued investments in our brand and platform, offset by leverage in functional areas. 
We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 19% to 22%. We currently expect that U.S. tax reform will benefit our ongoing tax rate by approximately 1 point. This rate is positively impacted by the reduction of U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, but that benefit is largely offset by the global minimum tax and other foreign taxes that can no longer be credited against our U.S. tax liability. Our guidance range is slightly wider than normal, driven by uncertainty in how all elements of U.S. tax reform will impact us going forward.
We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30 per share, up 12% to 15% as reported versus last year. This includes the impact of continued top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program and a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by our investments in payment intermediation. 
We expect free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This is lower than 2017 due to approximately $300 million in cash taxes related to repatriation and assumes capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 8% of revenue. Full year GAAP EPS is projected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share. GAAP EPS is impacted by the same drivers as non-GAAP EPS in addition to the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and the amortization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Turning to Q1 guidance on Slide 16. For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.57 billion and $2.61 billion, growing 7% to 9% per year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 per share, representing 7% to 11% growth. EPS growth is driven primarily by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41 per share in Q1.
In summary, 2017 was a year where we delivered on our commitments and saw our strategy translate into Marketplace acceleration of GMV and revenue growth. U.S. Marketplace GMV has accelerated from 1% to 7% over the past 5 quarters during a period of unprecedented competition, while our international Marketplace delivered another year of 7% GMV growth. Classifieds continued to grow at the double digits, and StubHub ended the year well. 
For the year, we delivered 6% EPS growth in the face of 5 points of foreign exchange headwinds in addition to our incremental investments. We have remained disciplined capital allocators, returning $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in the last year alone and totaling $6.8 billion, repurchase and separation. We executed several deals to further tech and talent expansion. And in Q3, we optimized our strategy in India by taking an ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for our eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment. 
Heading into 2018, we will stay consistent in our strategy, continuing to improve our user experiences while delivering profitable growth and strong capital return to our shareholders.

First of all, on payments, I don't -- just a technical detail. We have not made the decision to become a merchant of record. There are many ways that we could become a payment intermediary. MoR is one of them. That's a decision yet to be made, and it may actually change depending on the geography in which we operate in. But vis-à-vis sellers, we're fairly confident that we can lower the overall selling cost on eBay. We have not yet made final decisions, and it will be a process that will take some time to publicize our pricing to sellers. But what I want sellers to hear is that, number one, we have their experience in mind. We want to give them flexibility, increased payout options, and we want to lower their costs. So that was very much front and center in our mind was -- when we made this very consequential decision. On acceleration in '18, there are quite a few things. We've built a foundation of structured data that now has tentacles into almost everything we do. We have rolled out quite a significant number of new product experiences like Guaranteed Delivery, authentication and a product-based commerce experience, and we're going to scale those in 2018. So when we see in part the impact that these initiatives are making, when we see the trajectory that our business is on, we're confident that we can continue to deliver improvement in the business.

We said it wasn't going to be easy. We said that you could expect steady improvement and a strong return of capital along the way. We've done exactly that. We've seen the customer experience improve. We've seen the foundation of the house being shored up. We've seen acceleration in the growth of the business, and we've been aggressive in returning capital to shareholders. You can expect more of that in 2018."

Beyond a certain date, which over due course we will announce, you will not be able to be on eBay selling or buying without this intermediated relationship with us. So we do intend -- we will -- or I think we have published a blog from our corporate site which gives more detail on the migration, the benefits to sellers, the timing of this migration. As much detail as we're prepared to give, we put out now, and it can be accessed by our community. But I do anticipate that this will be a small amount of GMV this year with significant cost, as you heard from Scott, more GMV next year but still relatively small with even more significant costs.

On the costs, the $0.03 to $0.05, as you called out and we called out for the year, it's -- think, right now, it's about building out the intermediation capability on -- and the associated customer, both seller and buyer flows, to make them a lot better, and there's a lot of background to that. The intermediated model that we spoke about, the $10-ish billion that's on it, it's really not on the core eBay business. So it's not like we're dragging and dropping code from one country in the eBay core business to another. This is building out the core eBay Marketplace payment intermediation capability, and that's going to take product and technology. It's also going to start to require us to invest in areas like trust and risk, customer service, to be able to prepare ourselves to take on these volumes and do it in a compliant and safe way. In -- to your second question, in terms of the scale, let me kind of lay out the $2 billion and the $0.5 billion in a little bit more detail just so we're clear. And to your question, here's -- to start with, we're gated for the next 2.5 years at 5% and then 10%. And so how quickly we can then scale from there is going to be partially determined on our capabilities and partially determined on how quickly we can scale with our sellers and our buyers and roll it out globally. But our base assumption is that if you continue to grow the core Marketplaces platform that the new payment intermediation model applies to and you assume a migration schedule that scales rapidly after the operating agreement expires mid-2020, you start to talk about a pretty high penetration rate with intermediated model as you head into the latter part of 2020 and 2021. So when I talk about a fully scaled kind of stable state, you start to talk about the latter part of 2020, 2021, even into 2022. And the $2 billion, to be clear, is then taking that new intermediated GMV, applying a take rate that'll be discounted versus the existing PayPal rate, and you quickly get to $2 billion or more of revenue. When we size the costs associated with that, both the '19 that we've already framed up -- sorry, the '18 that we already framed up as well as the '19 that we're thinking about, the first couple of years, there'll be some burn associated with that. That's already incorporated into our guidance, obviously, for this year, but when you start to think about the associated costs, not only to get this up and running but the ongoing costs that are going to be associated with Adyen and with PayPal on the new model, we start to look at about $0.5 billion at scale when we're scaled up for the future."

Let me first say that I'm not sure that this is going to end up being the right metric going forward, in part because structured data is now touching so many different things in so many different ways that what we tried to do over the last year, or actually more, is try to just provide that as some leading indicator of structured data's progress. We're going to continue to evaluate that because the truth is that 14% is a little bit misleading in the sense that you would imply that only 14% is the impact of structured data. That's not really true. In fact, structured data is making an impact in many more areas where it's not formally a page and traffic as we define it, but yet, it's adding value in areas like the guidance that we give to sellers and a bunch of other areas. I would say, even with that said, as we move to this sort of end-to-end experience that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to see the core experience move to product base much more significantly. I'd expect that you'll see whole categories move to the default being searches on eBay, our product base, discovering on eBay's product base. And the reason that we have the confidence to do that is we are -- we do like what we see in terms of improvement in conversion rates. We mentioned in the past that, at the edge, those gains are double digit; they continue to be. As we get to the core, we're beginning to see improvements, and we believe that we can deliver conversion gains as we move this product experience from the edge to the center, and that's what gives us the confidence to move faster. So we really like structured data. In many ways, it is the foundation of everything we've done in this strategy over the last 2.5 years. It will continue to be. The 14% is a very narrow metric which we provided at the time to give investors clarity about our progress, but I don't think it accurately represents the overall impact that structured data is having and will have on the ecosystem as we go forward."

This is probably the fastest growing new business, for lack of a better term, launched in eBay in years. And it -- as I said, 50% sequential revenue growth quarter-on-quarter, that is quite significant. Most of the driver has been surface area. We are increasing the surface area of availability to sellers. We're increasing the surface area of the exposure of promoted listing to buyers. So a lot of it is just we have started and made sure we tested our way in, and now we're on a very steep part of the curve where we're opening the aperture so that more and more sellers can use it, and they should, and more and more buyers get exposure to those items and they are converting. So we are very pleased that we are now in that flywheel, and the flywheel seems to be turning very well. On the brand, I think your supposition is right on. So step 1 was, we now have a unified brand around the world, arguably the first time in eBay's history. The brand was very fragmented, very different depending on the country you would show up in or the region. We have a unified brand expression now everywhere in the world, and we're managing it as one of the most important assets of our business with -- very much with rigor and care. Step 1 on the messages we're delivering is vibrancy and getting a bit of the fun back to eBay and getting differentiation of eBay. But you can expect, as this rolls forward, for us to punch harder on functional messages. We don't want it to be dry, but we do want to educate people about what we do today. And what we do today is not all long-term, long-tail items, it's not all auctions. In fact, that's a distinct minority. So you'll see the overall brand expression remain constant, but the message has evolved. And the message evolution will punch much harder on how our -- what do you do today and why eBay? I keep asking the question of the brand, why eBay? We will answer that question definitively on selection, value, convenience, where we believe we actually have a phenomenal customer proposition, just not enough people know about it."

And the growth would've been, for MS&O, in the mid-teens if promoted listings were actually part of MS&O.

Why do I feel that? I feel that because, yes, the external market has gotten better, but keep in mind, we're now on 5 consecutive quarters of acceleration in the face of unprecedented competition. This is our most competitive market in the world, and actually, it's the business that's getting the best the fastest. And we entered this holiday and we said we're going to compete and win. And I feel like we showed up really well this holiday, and we were one of the top shopping destinations again this holiday in the world. So I do feel really positive about the U.S. business. It doesn't mean it's going to continue linearly to accelerate, but we've made a lot of changes to this business, and with all the noise about competition, eBay is still bigger and more relevant than just about all of them combined. So I feel great about that. With StubHub, I'd say it's slightly different. StubHub definitely benefited from the landscape. There are things that they did that improved the ecosystem for sure, but as we said in the remarks, I still think there's more work to do at StubHub. So I wouldn't get over our skis and assume, wow, great quarter and now we can just plug that in. I think we've always said, StubHub has a high beta based on what happens out in the world. It happens to be that the fourth quarter broke really well and we had really good World Series, we had really good baseball playoffs, we had really good college football. I don't -- that's not a strategy, counting on things not within our control. So we have more work to do at StubHub.

Just to be clear, we're not building a payments business to go compete with Apple Pay. We're not competing with PayPal, we're not rebuilding PayPal. We're building an intermediated payment service for the benefit of eBay customers on the eBay Marketplace. That's what we're doing."

Quarter 4 was a record quarter for us. Highlighted by the fifth straight quarter of volume acceleration in our U.S. Marketplace, plus strong growth at StubHub. Overall total GMV grew 10% on an as-reported basis",1323,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Quarter 4 was a record quarter for us. Highlighted by the fifth straight quarter of volume acceleration in our U.S. Marketplace, plus strong growth at StubHub. Overall total GMV grew 10% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. Total revenue was up 7%; and active buyers grew 5%, ending the year at 170 million. GMV and revenue on our Marketplace platform grew at 6%. Our StubHub platform grew volume at 15%, and our Classified platform grew revenue at 13%. Finally, we repurchased $922 million of our own shares, taking advantage of a share price that we do not believe reflects the long-term value of our company. 
In our Marketplace platform, volume growth accelerated by 1 point in the U.S., while international growth decelerated 3 points, driven in part by the timing and impact of Korean Thanksgiving and slower export trade due to the stronger British pound in Europe. eBay was again one of the top holiday shopping destinations for consumers around the world, and performance this quarter was driven by strong U.S. consumer spending and good execution on our key initiatives. 
Our new product rollouts, which leverage our structured data foundation, got good initial traction in Q4. Over 150,000 customers a day used guaranteed delivery while searching on eBay in U.S. during the holiday season. Group listings, which is the first time buyers are seeing a product-based commerce experience on eBay, performed well and set the foundation for the next set of changes we'll make this year. And finally, we began to ramp eBay Authenticate, where we're already seeing inventory scaling nicely and much higher conversion on like-for-like items. 
We continue to invest in brand advertising with a coordinated holiday activation across all of our key markets. Significantly changing consumer consideration is a long-term effort, and we plan to invest more heavily in our brand in 2018.
Lastly, our first-party advertising revenue continues to pick up momentum. Nearly 160,000 sellers used promoted listings to advertise over 100 million items in the quarter, driving over 50% sequential revenue growth in Q4. The rapid growth of promoted listings is enabling us to shift away from nonstrategic third-party advertising. 
Our StubHub platform had a good Q4 with a 13-point GMV growth acceleration, driven by a strong concert environment and good MLB Playoff and college football performances. While we don't expect growth in 2018 to be at the same level as Q4 due to the ongoing ticketing landscape challenges we discussed last quarter, StubHub continues to be the world's favorite destination for fans looking to buy event tickets.
And Classifieds continues to enjoy robust vibrancy and double-digit growth, with mobile and eBay Kleinanzeigen continuing to be standout performers. 
Now taking a step back and putting Q4 in the context of the past 2.5 years, we've made great progress against our key strategic priorities to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while sharpening the eBay brand. This strategy is enabling us to transform the eBay experience and accelerate the growth of our business. We've significantly simplified and improved our customer experience and built equity in our brand. We've built a strong foundation of structured data, with the majority of our listings now tied to our product catalog and 14% of all traffic landing on catalog-enabled experiences. And we've done this while accelerating growth in our core eBay platform by nearly 3 points.
Looking to 2018, our strategy remains unchanged. We intend to raise the bar on our customer experience and again accelerate growth despite tougher comps. We'll focus on key areas of our user experience, including search, delivery and returns, customer service and payments, while continually planting the seeds of technology innovation. Let me share a few examples of our plans.
We will take the next step in transforming our user experience, including on eBay search, by launching a full product-based commerce experience for relevant inventory. This experience will leverage our structured data catalog in a more holistic way than we've previously done. We'll do this while also focusing on our overall search experience using data and AI to improve our recall and relevance. We'll continue to shrink delivery times by expanding Guaranteed Delivery and work with our sellers to provide retail-standard experiences for consumers. This will include enabling a vastly simplified returns process for buyers and sellers. 
Our technology innovation continues to focus on emerging platforms such as artificial intelligence, voice and image technology, virtual and augmented reality and distributed commerce. I've often said that eBay runs on AI, powering many aspects of our buying and selling experience. In 2018, we'll focus our AI capabilities on computer vision, personalization, search and dynamic pricing capabilities for our sellers. AR, VR and mixed reality are becoming viable platforms for development. As this tech becomes more consumer-friendly and accessible, eBay will take advantage of their unique capabilities, delivering immersive and engaging buying and selling experiences.
And there is a step-change opportunity to remove friction from the user experience by allowing users to interact with eBay by simply typing a message or using their voice to engage a digital assistant. In 2018, we plan on taking the first step towards unifying conversational commerce with the core eBay shopping experience, providing seamless voice or text assistance when needed within our desktop and app platforms. 
2018 will be a year of significant focus on customer service. In 2017, we on-shored a significant number of support roles, and that trend will continue this year, enabling us to provide top-tier live support to a broader set of our customer base. And for customers looking for fast self-service, we're rolling out brand-new AI-enabled mobile and desktop pages to address their service requests. And finally, we anticipate that our digital assistant will have the capability of directly handling certain service requests instantly and without human intervention.
Finally, let me touch on our strategy and approach for payments on eBay. We've been looking closely at the customer payments experience and the economics under our existing PayPal relationship. After careful consideration, we believe that we can offer a more seamless experience while giving buyers and sellers more choice for payment and payout options. At the same time, we believe we can capture significantly better economics while reducing overall selling costs. Therefore, we have made the decision to intermediate payments on eBay. We have already begun building this capability, and we'll move as quickly as we can under the terms of our operating agreement with PayPal. I'm excited to announce a deal with Adyen, a leading global payment processor, to be our primary partner in this effort. We are looking forward to working with Adyen, who we believe are uniquely qualified to support us in this transition. They power payment processing for a number of the world's leading global marketplaces and bring to our partnership a broad global footprint with a flexible and scalable technology platform. 
We've also aligned on terms for a new commercial agreement with PayPal to include them as a way to pay at checkout under our intermediated payment model. PayPal's been a great partner for eBay, and we look forward to a continued strong partnership with them going forward. 
We've built a world-class team to execute on this payment opportunity, including senior executives from companies such as PayPal, Alipay and Amazon Payments. In 2021, we expect to have transitioned a majority of our Marketplace customers to our new payment experience.
In summary, we've made good progress in 2017, delivering fundamental customer improvements while accelerating growth and improving the operating performance of the business. We enter 2018 with a healthier ecosystem and on a path for further acceleration this year. Looking forward to a year of significant progress to the benefit of our global community, of buyers and sellers, shareholders and employees.
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financials and our 2018 guidance."
27862,549105091,1377755,"eBay Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2018",2018-01-31,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q4 financials, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Please note that my commentary on our 2017 financial performance is based on revenue accounting standards in place as of 2017 year-end.In Q4, we delivered G",2744,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q4 financials, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Please note that my commentary on our 2017 financial performance is based on revenue accounting standards in place as of 2017 year-end.
In Q4, we delivered GMV of $24.4 billion, increasing 10% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-neutral basis. We generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.59 of non-GAAP EPS, $796 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $920 million -- $922 million of our stock. 
Let's start with Q4 active buyers on Slide 5.  In the quarter, trailing 12-month growth was 5% year-over-year, resulting in 170 million active buyers. Active buyer growth in our Marketplace platform decelerated slightly, offset by strength at StubHub. The extended Thanksgiving holiday in Korea was the primary driver of the Marketplace growth deceleration. 
On Slide 6, in Q4, we enabled $24.4 billion of GMV, up 7%. By geography, the U.S. generated $9.9 billion of GMV, up 8%, accelerating 3 points versus the prior quarter. International delivered $14.6 billion of GMV, up 6%, down 3 points versus the prior quarter. 
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 7% organically, consistent with the prior quarter. We delivered $2 billion of transaction revenue, up 7%, and $578 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 6%. 
Transitioning to our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. Q4 GMV grew 6%, with U.S. GMV accelerating by 1 point to 7%, and international GMV growing 6%, a 3-point deceleration. International growth was impacted by the extended Korean Thanksgiving holiday, slowing U.K. export growth due to a stronger pound and softer consumer spending in Germany. Underlying these trends, we saw our B2C segment grow 6%, relatively constant with prior quarters. C2C grew 7% year-over-year, another quarter of good growth, aided by our ongoing efforts to simplify consumer selling and drive engagement. 
Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Transaction revenue grew 7%, driven by volume growth and the impact of our Q2 pricing changes, partially offset by heavier promotional spend in the holiday season. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 3%, decelerating 3 points versus Q3 as we continue to shift our advertising efforts away from nonstrategic third-party ad placements and towards our first-party promoted listings product. This will favor transaction revenue, putting ongoing pressure on MS&O revenue growth. For the full year, the Marketplace platform generated $84 billion of GMV, growing 6%, 1.5 points faster than 2016; and $7.6 billion in revenue, also up 6%, 2 points faster than the prior year.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 15%, accelerating 13 points from Q3 due to a stronger-than-expected event landscape, led by concerts, a great World Series and strong college football matchups. 
StubHub revenue grew 10%, up 5 points versus Q3, driven by volume, offset by a lower take rate and seasonal incentives to take advantage of a strong market opportunity. In 2017, StubHub grew GMV 5% to $4.5 billion and delivered $1 billion in revenue, growing 9% year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 10, our Classifieds platform continues to innovate and serve more than 250 million monthly unique visitors. In Q4, Classifieds had another strong quarter of 13% revenue growth. We continue to see good vertical performance and strength in advertising revenue. For the full year, Classifieds generated $897 million of revenue, up 12%.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q4, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 31%, which is down 100 basis points versus last year, 40 basis of -- basis points of which was due to the impact of foreign exchange. Cost of revenue increased slightly year-over-year as a percentage of revenue, driven primarily by our first-party inventory program in Korea. Q4 sales and marketing expense was up 100 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by the increased investment in our ongoing brand campaign. Product development was down slightly year-over-year due to leverage, partially offset by increased investments in product. G&A expense was down 50 basis points as we delivered further operating leverage. 
For the year, operating margin was 29.5%, down 160 basis points. Foreign exchange impacted full year margin by 70 basis points, and the remaining impact was driven by our investments in Marketplace product and marketing initiatives and growth of our first-party inventory program in Korea.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q4, we delivered $0.59 in non-GAAP EPS, up 9%, driven by revenue growth, the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by the impact of foreign exchange.
Moving to Q4 GAAP EPS. We have 3 significant financial impacts related to the passage of recent U.S. tax reform. We are recording a $1.9 billion tax charge related to the repatriation of our foreign earnings. $1.4 billion of this amount will be paid over 8 years, with the first 2 installments to be paid in 2018. The additional $0.5 billion represents foreign withholding taxes that will be paid upon repatriation of those earnings. This tax charge is largely offset by the reversal of our $1.8 billion deferred tax liability established primarily in 2014 in anticipation of repatriating foreign earnings. We also are recording a $3 billion deferred tax liability to address other areas of U.S. tax reform, primarily a global minimum tax that will now be applicable to our foreign earnings. This tax will impact our ongoing tax rate and cash taxes. We have recorded these amounts provisionally using reasonable estimates, and the amounts may change in 2018. I will cover the impact of these changes on our go-forward tax rate in our 2018 guidance discussion.
As a result of these charges in Q4, our GAAP EPS was negative $2.51, down $7.82 versus last year. The decrease in GAAP EPS was driven by the aforementioned tax impacts and the lapping of prior year noncash GAAP income tax benefit of approximately $4.6 billion related to our legal entity restructuring at the time. As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q4, we generated $796 million of free cash flow. Full year free cash flow was $2.5 billion, above our guidance range, due to the timing of certain cash tax payments and capital expenditures.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $11.3 billion, with $2.2 billion located in the U.S. In Q4, we repurchased 24.9 million shares at an average price of $36.99 per share, amounting to $922 million in total. This brings our repurchases for the year to $2.7 billion. Repurchases since separation are now $6.8 billion, which is approximately 19% of shares outstanding at an average price of $29.54. We ended the year with $1.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
In light of U.S. tax reform, I would like to review our capital allocation policy, which we continue to believe drives significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees. We aim to preserve financial flexibility in order to have the resources to execute our strategy and drive long-term value creation. We will continue to invest in attractive opportunities to drive organic growth while balancing profitability over the long-term, even if those investments are dilutive in the near term. We will supplement our organic growth plans with disciplined acquisitions and investments to improve our competitiveness in a rapidly evolving environment. Our M&A strategy continues to center on our geographic footprint, vertical expansion and tech and talent acquisitions. 
We continue to optimize our financial flexibility, access to debt and cost of capital. We believe that our current rating of BBB+ maintains a practical flexibility and aim to maintain this rating as we continue to execute on our capital allocation plans. 
Finally, we are committed to providing meaningful returns for our shareholders, and we believe, at current valuations, share repurchases continue to be the optimal vehicle for capital return. While we will always adjust to future events, we expect to accelerate our return of capital to shareholders to approximately $3.5 billion per year over the next 2 years in the form of share repurchases, inclusive of dilution offset. Our board has approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization to enable us to execute on this plan, and we have already returned $750 million in Q1 through an accelerated share repurchase. We will continually evaluate our capital allocation strategy as we move forward, ensuring that we drive optimal value on behalf of our shareholders.
Before turning to guidance, I'd like to highlight some key topics relevant to our business in 2018.
I want to spend a moment to discuss the impact of a new revenue standard which we will adopt beginning with our Q1 results. There are several impacts of the new standard on our financial reporting. The primary change relates to clearly defining who our customer is and realigning how we record incentive spend based on this definition. There is also an immaterial change in the timing of revenue recognition for certain fees on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. 
As sellers are the main source of our Marketplace revenue, certain incentives solely for our buyers such as coupons and rewards will now be recorded as sales and marketing expense instead of contra-revenue going forward. The impact of this change would've amounted to $363 million and $322 million for 2017 and '16, respectively, and our 2017 operating margin would've been 28.4% under the new standard. Ultimately, this is simply a change in how we will present our financials, resulting in increased revenue, increased expenses and a lower operating margin with no impact to operating income.  Please refer to the exhibit on our press release and our website financials for more details and a historical reconciliation of 2016 and '17 under the new revenue standard to help our investors understand our 2018 business outlook and future growth comparisons.
Now I'd like to talk about payments. As Devin discussed, we believe that there is a great opportunity to provide a better buyer experience to give our sellers more choices at better value and to capture better economics. This will be a multiyear effort, but we believe it is important to provide context today on the future economic opportunity. 
As a payment intermediator on the eBay Marketplace, we will be responsible for collecting funds from buyers and instructing our payment processor to disburse funds to sellers. Currently, this is done via our relationship with PayPal. In the new intermediation model, we will simplify our relationship with sellers and plan to charge them a single fee for our Marketplace and payment services.
When doing so, we expect to recognize the payment fees as revenue via an increase in our take rate and record the cost of payment processing and other related fees. When we reach a steady state, with the majority of our volume transitioned to this intermediated model, we would expect annualized incremental revenue of more than $2 billion. This estimate includes an expectation that we will take steps to lower the cost of selling on eBay via a  lower all-in take rate. 
Delivering on this revenue opportunity requires ongoing operational costs in areas such as product and technology, trust, risk, customer service and payment processing fees. Factoring in these costs, we believe the annualized incremental operating income could be $0.5 billion. While this isn't completely new business -- while this isn't a completely new business for us, given that we already act as a payment intermediary on other eBay platforms, it is important to keep in mind that this is a complex effort and may face delays along the way. However, we are moving quickly and are excited about the potential long-term benefits this creates for our ecosystem.
We have already begun investing in our payment strategy, well ahead of recognizing any material new income streams. For 2018, we expect this investment to cost us between $0.03 and $0.05 in EPS, which is factored into our guidance, and the investment is likely to increase in 2019. As a reminder, our operating agreement with PayPal remains in place until mid-2020, and our ability to offset the expense related to this investment is limited until the expiration of the existing agreement. We look forward to working with Adyen as our new partner and with PayPal in a new capacity to deliver on this significant opportunity.
Moving to full year guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting 2018 revenue between $10.9 billion and $11.1 billion, growing 7% to 9% on an FX-neutral basis and 10% to 12% on an as-reported basis. The midpoint of our projected growth assumes another point of GMV acceleration in our Marketplace platform. As discussed by Devin, we will continue to drive new experiences on our platform of structured data, the most impactful of which are helping buyers find the best choice and most relevance through product-based experiences and improved search and helping our sellers drive velocity through improved tools and workflows. We expect to deliver modest full year acceleration in StubHub GMV with monetization levels on par with Q4. And Classifieds should continue to see stable double-digit growth. 
We expect operating margin of 27% to 29% for the year, which, at the midpoint, is down 40 basis points from 2017, normalizing for the new accounting standard mentioned earlier. This includes our investment to build out payment intermediation and continued investments in our brand and platform, offset by leverage in functional areas. 
We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 19% to 22%. We currently expect that U.S. tax reform will benefit our ongoing tax rate by approximately 1 point. This rate is positively impacted by the reduction of U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, but that benefit is largely offset by the global minimum tax and other foreign taxes that can no longer be credited against our U.S. tax liability. Our guidance range is slightly wider than normal, driven by uncertainty in how all elements of U.S. tax reform will impact us going forward.
We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30 per share, up 12% to 15% as reported versus last year. This includes the impact of continued top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program and a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by our investments in payment intermediation. 
We expect free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This is lower than 2017 due to approximately $300 million in cash taxes related to repatriation and assumes capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 8% of revenue. Full year GAAP EPS is projected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share. GAAP EPS is impacted by the same drivers as non-GAAP EPS in addition to the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and the amortization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Turning to Q1 guidance on Slide 16. For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.57 billion and $2.61 billion, growing 7% to 9% per year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 per share, representing 7% to 11% growth. EPS growth is driven primarily by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41 per share in Q1.
In summary, 2017 was a year where we delivered on our commitments and saw our strategy translate into Marketplace acceleration of GMV and revenue growth. U.S. Marketplace GMV has accelerated from 1% to 7% over the past 5 quarters during a period of unprecedented competition, while our international Marketplace delivered another year of 7% GMV growth. Classifieds continued to grow at the double digits, and StubHub ended the year well. 
For the year, we delivered 6% EPS growth in the face of 5 points of foreign exchange headwinds in addition to our incremental investments. We have remained disciplined capital allocators, returning $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases in the last year alone and totaling $6.8 billion, repurchase and separation. We executed several deals to further tech and talent expansion. And in Q3, we optimized our strategy in India by taking an ownership interest in Flipkart in exchange for our eBay India business and a $500 million cash investment. 
Heading into 2018, we will stay consistent in our strategy, continuing to improve our user experiences while delivering profitable growth and strong capital return to our shareholders.

We have not yet made final decisions, and it will be a process that will take some time to publicize our pricing to sellers. But what I want sellers to hear is that, number one, we have their experience in mind. We want to give them flexibility, increased payout options, and we want to lower their costs. So that was very much front and center in our mind was -- when we made this very consequential decision. On acceleration in '18, there are quite a few things. We've built a foundation of structured data that now has tentacles into almost everything we do. We have rolled out quite a significant number of new product experiences like Guaranteed Delivery, authentication and a product-based commerce experience, and we're going to scale those in 2018. So when we see in part the impact that these initiatives are making, when we see the trajectory that our business is on, we're confident that we can continue to deliver improvement in the business. I'll go back and say, over 2.5 years, 2.5 years ago, when we started this journey, we said that we were going to address the core customer pain points and issues directly and head on. We said it wasn't going to be easy. We said that you could expect steady improvement and a strong return of capital along the way. We've done exactly that. We've seen the customer experience improve. We've seen the foundation of the house being shored up. We've seen acceleration in the growth of the business, and we've been aggressive in returning capital to shareholders. You can expect more of that in 2018."

Beyond a certain date, which over due course we will announce, you will not be able to be on eBay selling or buying without this intermediated relationship with us.

As much detail as we're prepared to give, we put out now, and it can be accessed by our community. But I do anticipate that this will be a small amount of GMV this year with significant cost, as you heard from Scott, more GMV next year but still relatively small with even more significant costs.

The intermediated model that we spoke about, the $10-ish billion that's on it, it's really not on the core eBay business. So it's not like we're dragging and dropping code from one country in the eBay core business to another. This is building out the core eBay Marketplace payment intermediation capability, and that's going to take product and technology. It's also going to start to require us to invest in areas like trust and risk, customer service, to be able to prepare ourselves to take on these volumes and do it in a compliant and safe way. In -- to your second question, in terms of the scale, let me kind of lay out the $2 billion and the $0.5 billion in a little bit more detail just so we're clear. And to your question, here's -- to start with, we're gated for the next 2.5 years at 5% and then 10%. And so how quickly we can then scale from there is going to be partially determined on our capabilities and partially determined on how quickly we can scale with our sellers and our buyers and roll it out globally. But our base assumption is that if you continue to grow the core Marketplaces platform that the new payment intermediation model applies to and you assume a migration schedule that scales rapidly after the operating agreement expires mid-2020, you start to talk about a pretty high penetration rate with intermediated model as you head into the latter part of 2020 and 2021. So when I talk about a fully scaled kind of stable state, you start to talk about the latter part of 2020, 2021, even into 2022. And the $2 billion, to be clear, is then taking that new intermediated GMV, applying a take rate that'll be discounted versus the existing PayPal rate, and you quickly get to $2 billion or more of revenue. When we size the costs associated with that, both the '19 that we've already framed up -- sorry, the '18 that we already framed up as well as the '19 that we're thinking about, the first couple of years, there'll be some burn associated with that. That's already incorporated into our guidance, obviously, for this year, but when you start to think about the associated costs, not only to get this up and running but the ongoing costs that are going to be associated with Adyen and with PayPal on the new model, we start to look at about $0.5 billion at scale when we're scaled up for the future."

Let me first say that I'm not sure that this is going to end up being the right metric going forward, in part because structured data is now touching so many different things in so many different ways that what we tried to do over the last year, or actually more, is try to just provide that as some leading indicator of structured data's progress. We're going to continue to evaluate that because the truth is that 14% is a little bit misleading in the sense that you would imply that only 14% is the impact of structured data. That's not really true. In fact, structured data is making an impact in many more areas where it's not formally a page and traffic as we define it, but yet, it's adding value in areas like the guidance that we give to sellers and a bunch of other areas. I would say, even with that said, as we move to this sort of end-to-end experience that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to see the core experience move to product base much more significantly. I'd expect that you'll see whole categories move to the default being searches on eBay, our product base, discovering on eBay's product base. And the reason that we have the confidence to do that is we are -- we do like what we see in terms of improvement in conversion rates. We mentioned in the past that, at the edge, those gains are double digit; they continue to be. As we get to the core, we're beginning to see improvements, and we believe that we can deliver conversion gains as we move this product experience from the edge to the center, and that's what gives us the confidence to move faster. So we really like structured data. In many ways, it is the foundation of everything we've done in this strategy over the last 2.5 years. It will continue to be. The 14% is a very narrow metric which we provided at the time to give investors clarity about our progress, but I don't think it accurately represents the overall impact that structured data is having and will have on the ecosystem as we go forward."

This is probably the fastest growing new business, for lack of a better term, launched in eBay in years. And it -- as I said, 50% sequential revenue growth quarter-on-quarter, that is quite significant. Most of the driver has been surface area. We are increasing the surface area of availability to sellers. We're increasing the surface area of the exposure of promoted listing to buyers. So a lot of it is just we have started and made sure we tested our way in, and now we're on a very steep part of the curve where we're opening the aperture so that more and more sellers can use it, and they should, and more and more buyers get exposure to those items and they are converting. So we are very pleased that we are now in that flywheel, and the flywheel seems to be turning very well. On the brand, I think your supposition is right on. So step 1 was, we now have a unified brand around the world, arguably the first time in eBay's history. The brand was very fragmented, very different depending on the country you would show up in or the region. We have a unified brand expression now everywhere in the world, and we're managing it as one of the most important assets of our business with -- very much with rigor and care. Step 1 on the messages we're delivering is vibrancy and getting a bit of the fun back to eBay and getting differentiation of eBay. But you can expect, as this rolls forward, for us to punch harder on functional messages. We don't want it to be dry, but we do want to educate people about what we do today. And what we do today is not all long-term, long-tail items, it's not all auctions. In fact, that's a distinct minority. So you'll see the overall brand expression remain constant, but the message has evolved. And the message evolution will punch much harder on how our -- what do you do today and why eBay? I keep asking the question of the brand, why eBay? We will answer that question definitively on selection, value, convenience, where we believe we actually have a phenomenal customer proposition, just not enough people know about it."

Why do I feel that? I feel that because, yes, the external market has gotten better, but keep in mind, we're now on 5 consecutive quarters of acceleration in the face of unprecedented competition. This is our most competitive market in the world, and actually, it's the business that's getting the best the fastest. And we entered this holiday and we said we're going to compete and win. And I feel like we showed up really well this holiday, and we were one of the top shopping destinations again this holiday in the world. So I do feel really positive about the U.S. business. It doesn't mean it's going to continue linearly to accelerate, but we've made a lot of changes to this business, and with all the noise about competition, eBay is still bigger and more relevant than just about all of them combined. So I feel great about that. With StubHub, I'd say it's slightly different. StubHub definitely benefited from the landscape. There are things that they did that improved the ecosystem for sure, but as we said in the remarks, I still think there's more work to do at StubHub. So I wouldn't get over our skis and assume, wow, great quarter and now we can just plug that in. I think we've always said, StubHub has a high beta based on what happens out in the world. It happens to be that the fourth quarter broke really well and we had really good World Series, we had really good baseball playoffs, we had really good college football. I don't -- that's not a strategy, counting on things not within our control. So we have more work to do at StubHub.

Total GMV and revenue were up 7%, while active buyers grew 4% to 171 million. GMV and revenue in our Marketplace platform grew at 7%, with U.S. Marketplace GMV growing at 7%, while international GMV grew 6%. StubHub platforms grew volume at 13%, and Classifieds platforms grew revenue at 10%. Finally, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we recently announced the acquisition of Giosis Japan, expanding our presence in one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world.
As I've consistently communicated, we're focused on delivering the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while also sharpening our brand. This includes ongoing work to build an extensive product catalog, launching and scaling new finding experiences and more recently beginning to build payment intermediation capabilities on eBay. In Q1, we made progress on each of these areas. Let me share some examples.
Over the past year, we moved the majority of our SEO and paid search traffic to land on new product and browse pages that use our product catalog. We've also begun using our catalog to simplify both business and consumer selling, with sellers now being able to save time and money by relying on catalog level attributes to list and promote their inventory. This quarter, we began focusing our efforts on organic traffic, launching a full product-based commerce experience to a subset of buyers in the U.S. Users searching for a number of specific products are now landing directly on a product-based search result. This is an important first step towards moving a material amount of our GMV to product-driven experiences over time. In Q2, we plan to roll this experience out to more products such as iPhones, iPads, TVs and kitchen appliances. We believe this will simplify eBay's search as well as better highlight our natural inventory and price advantages. We'll continue to expand this effort over the next 6 months with a focus on driving higher conversion. We're also scaling the new authentication and guaranteed delivery services we launched in Q4. This quarter, we expanded our authentication to several European markets and into the luxury watch category. Conversion on authenticated inventory is twice that of similar non-authenticated inventory, which highlights the importance buyers place on trust for high-value purchases. With guaranteed delivery, we're seeing increased buyer purchase frequency and high satisfaction scores. With only a small number of sellers currently invited into the program, we have over 30 million items live in the U.S., which is a sizable increase from Q4, and many sellers who are using guaranteed delivery are seeing significant increases in sales.
Brand advertising continues to be a key investment area for us with ongoing activations across our major markets. We saw some early positive movement on consideration metrics in Q1. Changing consumer perception and behavior takes significant time, but this early validation is a helpful guidepost. In Q2, you will see our brand campaign evolve to directly address the eBay value proposition, clearly explain our inventory and price advantages and define what makes eBay unique. 
We recently announced our Spring Seller Update, which included a number of improvements to existing programs, including expansion of guaranteed delivery to more sellers, a streamlined shipping label experience, improved price guidance, a simpler returns policy and enhanced seller protection. We also expanded our first-party advertising program with the launch of promoted listings white which is focused on smaller sellers. We continue to get significant traction with promoted listings. With nearly 200,000 sellers advertise 130 million items in the quarter, driving more than 200% year-on-year revenue growth. Finally, we're taking definitive steps to deliver the intermediated payments opportunity that we laid out in January. We made excellent progress in Q1 on our product build and go-to-market plans while also finalizing the commercial agreement with PayPal to be a form of payment, among others, in our new intermediated payments experience. We'll launch an employee beta this summer and then incorporate our learnings into an initial market test, where we'll further learn and iterate. We expect to start small and grow our penetration, building towards intermediating up to 5% of GMV in North America this year. We've received very positive market feedback from sellers who see the potential advantage of more efficient payment process, better economics and increased buyer demand. 
StubHub had a good quarter, driven by strong international growth, a record Super Bowl and a strong college football playoff performance, and we recently announced the hiring of Sukhinder Singh Cassidy as StubHub's new President. 
Our Classified platform delivered another quarter of double-digit growth with continued strong performance in eBay Kleinanzeigen and good growth in our emerging markets. We continue to drive meaningful synergy between our platforms. And in Q1, we launched the new motors offering for dealers in the U.K. which combines eBay Motors and Gumtree. We're also growing eBay listings on classifieds, which we expect to deliver nearly $200 million of GMV this year. 
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we recently announced the deal to expand our presence in Japan, one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world. With the acquisition of Giosis Japan, a leading e-commerce platform, combined with our existing export business, we will now have a Japanese business that generates over $1 billion of GMV annually with strong double-digit growth and a large market opportunity. Through this acquisition, we will be able to offer Japanese consumers more access to eBay's global inventory and broaden our presence in a dynamic, underpenetrated market with strong potential.
In summary, we continue to make progress, improving the eBay customer experience while delivering strong operating results. As I've indicated previously, this improvement won't always be linear, but Q1 was a good start to the year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitment. 
Now let me turn it over to Scott and he'll provide more details on our quarterly results and our outlook."

Let's begin with Q1 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q1, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $495 million of operating cash flow and $337 million in free cash flow, while repur",1642,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q1 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q1, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $495 million of operating cash flow and $337 million in free cash flow, while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.
Moving to active buyers on Slide 5. In the quarter, trailing 12-month buyer growth was 4% year-over-year, a 1-point deceleration versus Q4. The deceleration was driven by some near-term headwinds in Korea and on our core eBay platform. In Korea, we are lapping active buyer increases related to mobile guest checkout improvements we made, in addition to ongoing impact from the Q4 extended holiday. In our core eBay platform, we have seen some pressure on growth over the past couple of quarters from first-time buyers who buy in low ASP tranches. We are actively working to reverse this trend through a number of initiatives such as our under-10 micro sites that we launched in Q1. Growing active buyers remains an important focus for us, and as we expect, many of our efforts, including brand advertising and our new user experiences to drive more active buyer growth over the long term.
On Slide 6, in Q1, we enabled $23.6 billion of GMV, up 7%. By geography, the U.S. generated $9.5 billion of GMV, while international delivered $14.1 billion of GMV, both growing 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 7%, stable versus the prior quarter. We delivered $2 billion of transaction revenue, up 8%, and $557 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 5%. 
Diving a bit deeper into our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. Q1 GMV grew 7%, slightly higher than the prior quarter. U.S. GMV maintained 7% growth, while international grew 6%, driven by growth acceleration in Korea after the Q4 extended holiday, offset by softer consumer spending in the U.K. Underlying these trends, our B2C and C2C segments grew at 7% and 6%, respectively. Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 7%, a 1-point acceleration versus the prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 7%, with promoted listings contributing roughly 1 point of growth. Transaction take rate is lower year-over-year due to hedging activity recognized in net revenues, offset by reduced seller incentives and promoted listings. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 4%, accelerating 1 point versus Q4.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 13%, driven by a healthy event landscape, including a record Super Bowl and accelerating international growth. StubHub revenue grew 9%, driven by volume, offset by lower MS&O revenue and a slightly lower take rate. 
On Slide 10, in Q1, Classifieds grew revenue 10%, with ongoing strength in our Classifieds platforms in Germany. The 3-point deceleration versus Q4 was driven by lapping price increases in our motors vertical and some display advertising headwind as traffic shifts to mobile devices.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 27.9% which was down 100 basis points versus last year, driven by increased investments in sales and marketing and product development. This includes a 30 basis point drag from foreign exchange primarily showing up in sales and marketing. As a reminder, our operating margin now includes the impact of buyer incentives in marketing expense due to the new revenue standard adopted this quarter. Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year by 60 basis points. Investments and customer service and growth of our first-party inventory program in Korea were more than offset in savings and site operations. Q1 sales and marketing expense was up 120 basis points, driven by promotional and brand spending. We continually manage our marketing mix and shift spend between various channels. In Q1, we spent heavier on buyer-facing promotions that are now reported as sales and marketing expense, while dialing back our seller incentives that are recorded as counter revenue. We also continued to invest in global brand advertising, focus more heavily this quarter on fashion and parts and accessories campaigns.
Product development costs were up 70 basis points as we continue to invest in our product experiences across all of our platforms, including investment in AI and payment intermediation. G&A was down year-over-year through operating leverage.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q1, we delivered $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, up 9%. EPS growth was driven by operational growth and the net benefit of share repurchases, offset by a higher tax rate. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.40 versus the prior year of $0.94. As a reminder, the prior year included a noncash GAAP income tax benefit of $695 million related to our legal entity restructuring. As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures on our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q1, we generated $337 million of free cash flow, which is down 25%. This was primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and a slight increase in CapEx this quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $9.8 billion. During the quarter, $750 million of debt matured and was repaid, reducing our total debt to $9.2 billion. In Q1, as part of our ongoing commitment to provide meaningful returns for our shareholders, we repurchased 24.2 million shares at an average price of $41.71 a share, amounting to $1 billion in total. We ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. In Q2, we executed a new $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. These actions are in line with our capital return commitment of approximately $3.5 billion per year over the next 2 years in the form of share repurchases, inclusive of dilution offset.
Now I'd like to build on Devin's comments about payments and further clarify how we're thinking about the opportunity. As I discussed in January, we expect annualized incremental revenue of more than $2 billion, once the majority of the volume of our core Marketplace platform has transitioned to the intermediated model. We assume a migration schedule that begins to expand when the operating agreement with PayPal ends in mid 2020 and scales through 2021. This estimate includes an expectation that we will take steps to reduce the cost of selling on eBay via a lower all-in take rate. We also expect incremental operating profit of approximately $0.5 billion at scale, which we will capture regardless of the payment method chosen by our buyers. As Devin mentioned, we are actively investing to build our product and capabilities related to intermediated payments and improving the customer experience. We expect the level of investment to increase over time, although this amount remains in the range of $0.03 to $0.05 of EPS in 2018.
Turning to Q2 guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.68 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of 6% to 8%. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.52, up 10% to 14% on an as-reported basis. EPS growth will be driven by revenue growth, the net benefit of our share repurchase program and foreign exchange. For Q2, we expect the GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.37. Our full year non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged from January. As a reminder, for the year, we expect revenue in the range of $10.9 billion to $11.1 billion, growing 7% and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. This guidance continues to imply at the midpoint a point of acceleration from our Marketplace platform. We expect operating margin of 27% to 29%, and non-GAAP effective tax rate between 19% and 22%, and a non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30 per share. Additionally, we continue to expect CapEx at 6% to 8% of revenue and free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Full year GAAP EPS also remains unchanged, projected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share. GAAP EPS is impacted by the same drivers as non-GAAP EPS, in addition to the amortization of intangibles stock-based compensation and the amortization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Now I'd like to provide some additional context on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As announced in February, we are excited to expand eBay's footprint in Japan with the acquisition of the Giosis Japan business. We expect this transaction to close in the next few weeks. The impact has not been included in our current full year guidance. However, we expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive to revenue and dilutive to non-GAAP EPS, but within the ranges of our Q2 and full year non-GAAP guidance, all else equal. We also expect to recognize a one-time GAAP EPS gain related to our original investment in Giosis, not reflected in our GAAP guidance. We have also been preparing for the EU general data protection regulation, or GDPR, that goes into effect on May 25. We embrace this opportunity to have -- to demonstrate and deepen our commitment to data privacy, and our teams have been working to update our policy, systems and processes to ensure that we are compliant. We have also been working with our advised -- with our advertising partners to understand any future requirements and implications to our shared revenue streams. We are not currently assuming any material impact to our outlook as a result of that work, but this is an area we will continue to monitor through implementation. 
In summary, our focus through the remainder of the year will be on accelerating GMV by ramping up our product-based experiences and continuing to drive our brand campaign to increase traffic to these experiences. While growth may not be always be perfectly linear, we believe that we are on the right path to continued Marketplace platform acceleration while delivering profitable growth and strong capital returns to our shareholders.

We have some differences country by country. That includes, even if you look at the experience that what happened not only in core eBay search but out in SEO and out on the edge, I'd say we're pleased with where we are. We obviously wouldn't be rolling it out if we weren't getting conversion gains. You can expect us to continue to roll that out throughout the balance of the year. And as I said, that will start in Q2 with us rolling a whole new bunch of products and categories into this product-based research. And from there, we'll continue to widen. It's a continual process of test and learn. It's not linear, but I think we are where we expected to be, and we're pretty pleased with the results.

It's a business at scale. As I mentioned, we're now at $1 billion. And the growth has been really strong and really consistent. And we feel like they're getting a lot of Japanese buyers, particularly millennial buyers. Their growth has been very consistent, and they have not yet had the benefit of global supply, to the second part of your question. So we felt like this is the time. They are reaching that tipping point where it's becoming a scale and meaningful high-growth platform. We think we can add a lot of benefit to Giosis and they can help us. So they have a nice broad Japanese seller base that will complement our smaller base, which has been exporting, and we'll take all of that inventory and export it to all of our marketplaces around the world like we do. And the first thing we'll do is we'll bring a base global supply into Japan for the benefit of Japanese consumers. So I'm really excited by this. And I agree with you, japan's been a large market. It is not really been meaningful to eBay for its 21-year history, and my hope is it now it will, and we're really excited."

We've -- first of all, on brand, we're going to keep that on. We're seeing early signs. We've always said it would take a long time, and we do think the payoff is large but it takes time, and we're going to keep that on and keep evolving the brand campaign. And we -- this is one of the top brands in the world, but we think that there's a big opportunity to close the consumer consideration gap. There should be more people shopping on eBay because it's a great product with great inventory. And there's some that just don't consider us because they don't know what we do. So we're going to work hard to close that gap, it takes time, but I'm really glad that we're doing that. The second component is promotions, and promotional activity is now in that line, and we're experimenting with a lot of different things. Now that we feel that our product is evolving, we're getting better at conversion. We like the experience that our consumers are getting. We're being aggressive and experimental with our promotions, and we're always disciplined. But we did some promotions this quarter, last quarter, Q1, that we haven't done before, like in the U.S. and in general, we were happy with what we saw and we'll keep experimenting with that. So right now, we're happy with where we are. We always watch our marketing expense carefully for a return on investment, and we're leaning into drive not just growth, but our future barriers to entry on things like our brand."

So we're really happy with that, and it's great to be a partner with the NFL. I think what we said at the time, and I still believe, is the net impact of that might be slightly positive to growth and slightly negative to the -- to expenses because we're obviously paying a share for those integrated tickets. It's early -- the NFL just announced their schedule, I think, a few days ago, so it's a little early to gauge how that is all going.

So for instance, as we started to see a little bit of a delay and the opportunity -- in tax payments and the opportunity to jump in and kind of incent the buyer base and our nonbuyer base to be able to activate on eBay in a more material way, you saw us lean in more in March than you have in the past and you're seeing some of those big coupons that are out there trying to drive higher ASP, higher item, higher value items on the site.

One is the front end that customers will see and one is the back end which is the ledger, which accounts for the money. The front end is being built very rapidly, and I'm really pleased with the progress there. The ledger will take more time.

That's very rare and very unique. So brands that may, years ago, have been skeptical of selling on eBay are now successfully coming to our platform, and they are coming at an increasing rate.

On one -- on advertising, just to remind you, we've been on this journey now for a year or 2 where we are growing a first-party advertising business, which is existing sellers on our Marketplace can promote their items, and we have been short -- slowly but surely moving out of some of the third-party advertising that really was almost all of the advertising business that we have on the Marketplace. We would never entirely get out of third-party advertising. We still think there's healthy advertising, but basically we're on a journey to which if you're a brand or you're a seller and you want our significant customer base or volume, you've got to have a store on eBay and you've got to promote it through 1P. We're now -- a year ago, we said it was starting to scale, and obviously, we've talked about this the last 3 quarters. This is a rapidly growing exciting business now. Last quarter, we saw 200% growth. It doesn't yet really show up because we're bleeding third-party down as we grow first party, but eventually, we think that is going to be a meaningful contributor to growth. We think there's lots of runway. Although our growth is fast, we're under penetrated, and there's a lot of room to grow the first-party business, and we're very, very focused on that. So I -- it's one of the things that we think will be a growth driver of this business for the next several years."

Total GMV and revenue were up 7%, while active buyers grew 4% to 171 million. GMV and revenue in our Marketplace platform grew at 7%, with U.S. Marketplace GMV growing at 7%, while international GMV grew 6%. StubHub platforms grew volume at 13%, and Classified platforms grew revenue at 10%. Finally, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we recently announced the acquisition of Giosis Japan, expanding our presence in one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world.
As I've consistently communicated, we're focused on delivering the best choice, the most relevant and a powerful selling platform while also sharpening our brand. This includes ongoing work to build an extensive product catalog, launching and scaling new finding experiences and more recently beginning to build payment intermediation capabilities on eBay. In Q1, we made progress on each of these areas. Let me share some examples.
Over the past year, we moved the majority of our SEO and paid search traffic to land on new product and browse pages that use our product catalog. We've also begun using our catalog to simplify both business and consumer selling, with sellers now being able to save time and money by relying on catalog-level attributes to list and promote their inventory. This quarter, we began focusing our efforts on organic traffic, launching a full product-based commerce experience to a subset of buyers in the U.S. Users searching for a number of specific products are now landing directly on a product-based search result. This is an important first step towards moving a material amount of our GMV to product-driven experiences over time.
In Q2, we plan to roll this experience out to more products such as iPhones, iPads, TVs and kitchen appliances. We believe this will simplify eBay's search as well as better highlight our natural inventory and price advantages. We'll continue to expand this effort over the next 6 months with a focus on driving higher conversion.
We're also scaling the new authentication and guaranteed delivery services we launched in Q4. This quarter, we expanded authentication to several European markets and into the luxury watch category. Conversion on authenticated inventory is twice that of similar non-authenticated inventory, which highlights the importance buyers place on trust for high-value purchases. With guaranteed delivery, we're seeing increased buyer purchase frequency and high satisfaction scores. With only a small number of sellers currently invited into the program, we have over 30 million items live in the U.S., which is a sizable increase from Q4, and many sellers who are using guaranteed delivery are seeing significant increases in sales.
Brand advertising continues to be a key investment area for us with ongoing activations across our major markets. We saw some early positive movement on consideration metrics in Q1. Changing consumer perception and behavior takes significant time, but this early validation is a helpful guidepost. In Q2, you will see our brand campaign evolve to directly address the eBay value proposition, clearly explain our inventory and price advantages and define what makes eBay unique.
We recently announced our Spring Seller Update, which included a number of improvements to existing programs, including expansion of guaranteed delivery to more sellers, a streamlined shipping label experience, improved price guidance, a simpler returns policy and enhanced seller protection.
We also expanded our first-party advertising program with the launch of Promoted Listings Lite, which is focused on smaller sellers. We continue to get significant traction with promoted listings. We had nearly 200,000 sellers advertise 130 million items in the quarter, driving more than 200% year-on-year revenue growth.
Finally, we're taking definitive steps to deliver the intermediated payments opportunity that we laid out in January. We made excellent progress in Q1 on our product build and go-to-market plans while also finalizing the commercial agreement with PayPal to be a form of payment, among others, in our new intermediated payments experience. We'll launch an employee beta this summer and then incorporate our learnings into an initial market test, where we'll further learn and iterate. We expect to start small and grow our penetration, building towards intermediating up to 5% of GMV in North America this year. We've received very positive market feedback from sellers who see the potential advantage of more efficient payment process, better economics and increased buyer demand.
StubHub had a good quarter, driven by strong international growth, a record Super Bowl and a strong college football playoff performance. And we recently announced the hiring of Sukhinder Singh Cassidy as StubHub's new President.
Our Classified platform delivered another quarter of double-digit growth with continued strong performance in eBay Kleinanzeigen and good growth in our emerging markets. We continue to drive meaningful synergy between our platforms. And in Q1, we launched the new motors offering for dealers in the U.K., which combines eBay Motors and Gumtree. We're also growing eBay listings on classifieds, which we expect to deliver nearly $200 million of GMV this year.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we recently announced the deal to expand our presence in Japan, one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world. With the acquisition of Giosis Japan, a leading e-commerce platform, combined with our existing export business, we will now have a Japanese business that generates over $1 billion of GMV annually with strong double-digit growth and a large market opportunity. Through this acquisition, we will be able to offer Japanese consumers more access to eBay's global inventory and broaden our presence in a dynamic, underpenetrated market with strong potential.
In summary, we continue to make progress, improving the eBay customer experience while delivering strong operating results. As I've indicated previously, this improvement won't always be linear, but Q1 was a good start to the year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitment.
Now let me turn it over to Scott, and he'll provide more details on our quarterly results and our outlook."

Let's begin with Q1 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation.

Let's begin with Q1 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q1, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $495 million of operating cash flow and $337 million in free cash flow, while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.
Moving to active buyers on Slide 5. In the quarter, trailing 12-month buyer growth was 4% year-over-year, a 1 point deceleration versus Q4. The deceleration was driven by some near-term headwinds in Korea and on our core eBay platform. In Korea, we are lapping active buyer increases related to mobile guest checkout improvements we made in addition to ongoing impact from the Q4 extended holiday. In our core eBay platform, we have seen some pressure on growth over the past couple of quarters from first-time buyers who buy in low ASP tranches. We are actively working to reverse this trend through a number of initiatives such as our under-10 micro sites that we launched in Q1. Growing active buyers remains an important focus for us, and as we expect, many of our efforts, including brand advertising and our new user experiences to drive more active buyer growth over the long term.
On Slide 6, in Q1, we enabled $23.6 billion of GMV, up 7%. By geography, the U.S. generated $9.5 billion of GMV, while international delivered $14.1 billion of GMV, both growing 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 7%, stable versus the prior quarter. We delivered $2 billion of transaction revenue, up 8%, and $557 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 5%. 
Diving a bit deeper into our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. Q1 GMV grew 7%, slightly higher than the prior quarter. U.S. GMV maintained 7% growth, while international grew 6%, driven by growth acceleration in Korea after the Q4 extended holiday, offset by softer consumer spending in the U.K. Underlying these trends, our B2C and C2C segments grew at 7% and 6%, respectively. Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 7%, a 1 point acceleration versus the prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 7%, with promoted listings contributing roughly 1 point of growth. Transaction take rate is lower year-over-year due to hedging activity recognized in net revenues, offset by reduced seller incentives and promoted listings. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 4%, accelerating 1 point versus Q4.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 13%, driven by a healthy event landscape, including a record Super Bowl and accelerating international growth. StubHub revenue grew 9%, driven by volume, offset by lower MS&O revenue and a slightly lower take rate.
On Slide 10, in Q1, Classifieds grew revenue 10%, with ongoing strength in our Classifieds platforms in Germany. The 3 point deceleration versus Q4 was driven by lapping price increases in our motors vertical and some display advertising headwinds as traffic shifts to mobile devices.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 27.9%, which was down 100 basis points versus last year, driven by increased investments in sales and marketing and product development. This includes a 30 basis point drag from foreign exchange primarily showing up in sales and marketing. As a reminder, our operating margin now includes the impact of buyer incentives in marketing expense due to the new revenue standard adopted this quarter.
Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year by 60 basis points. Investments in customer service and growth of our first-party inventory program in Korea were more than offset in savings in site operations. Q1 sales and marketing expense was up 120 basis points, driven by promotional and brand spending. We continually manage our marketing mix and shift spend between various channels.
In Q1, we spent heavier on buyer-facing promotions that are now recorded as sales and marketing expense while dialing back our seller incentives that are recorded as contra-revenue. We also continued to invest in global brand advertising, focused more heavily this quarter on fashion and parts and accessories campaigns.
Product development costs were up 70 basis points as we continue to invest in our product experiences across all of our platforms, including investment in AI and payment intermediation. G&A was down year-over-year through operating leverage.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q1, we delivered $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, up 9%. EPS growth was driven by operational growth and the net benefit of share repurchases, offset by a higher tax rate. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.40 versus the prior year of $0.94. As a reminder, the prior year included a noncash GAAP income tax benefit of $695 million related to our legal entity restructuring. As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q1, we generated $337 million of free cash flow, which is down 25%. This was primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and a slight increase in CapEx this quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $9.8 billion. During the quarter, $750 million of debt matured and was repaid, reducing our total debt to $9.2 billion. In Q1, as part of our ongoing commitment to provide meaningful returns for our shareholders, we repurchased 24.2 million shares at an average price of $41.71 a share, amounting to $1 billion in total. We ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. In Q2, we executed a new $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. These actions are in line with our capital return commitment of approximately $3.5 billion per year over the next 2 years in the form of share repurchases, inclusive of dilution offset.
Now I'd like to build on Devin's comments about payments and further clarify how we're thinking about the opportunity. As I discussed in January, we expect annualized incremental revenue of more than $2 billion once the majority of the volume of our core Marketplace platform has transitioned to the intermediated model. We assume a migration schedule that begins to expand when the operating agreement with PayPal ends in mid-2020 and scales through 2021. This estimate includes an expectation that we will take steps to reduce the cost of selling on eBay via a lower all-in take rate.
We also expect incremental operating profit of approximately $0.5 billion at scale, which we will capture regardless of the payment method chosen by our buyers. As Devin mentioned, we are actively investing to build our product and capabilities related to intermediated payments and improving the customer experience. We expect the level of investment to increase over time, although this amount remains in the range of $0.03 to $0.05 of EPS in 2018.
Turning to Q2 guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.68 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of 6% to 8%. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.52, up 10% to 14% on an as-reported basis. EPS growth will be driven by revenue growth, the net benefit of our share repurchase program and foreign exchange. For Q2, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.37. Our full year non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged from January.
As a reminder, for the year, we expect revenue in the range of $10.9 billion to $11.1 billion, growing 7% and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. This guidance continues to imply at the midpoint a point of acceleration from our Marketplace platform. We expect operating margin of 27% to 29%, a non-GAAP effective tax rate between 19% and 22% and a non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30 per share.
Additionally, we continue to expect CapEx at 6% to 8% of revenue and free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Full year GAAP EPS also remains unchanged, projected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share. GAAP EPS is impacted by the same drivers as non-GAAP EPS, in addition to the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and the amortization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Now I'd like to provide some additional context on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As announced in February, we are excited to expand eBay's footprint in Japan with the acquisition of the Giosis Japan business. We expect this transaction to close in the next few weeks. The impact has not been included in our current full year guidance. However, we expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive to revenue and dilutive to non-GAAP EPS but within the ranges of our Q2 and full year non-GAAP guidance, all else equal. We also expect to recognize a onetime GAAP EPS gain related to our original investment in Giosis not reflected in our GAAP guidance.
We have also been preparing for the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that goes into effect on May 25. We embrace this opportunity to have -- to demonstrate and deepen our commitment to data privacy, and our teams have been working to update our policy, systems and processes to ensure that we are compliant. We have also been working with our advised -- with our advertising partners to understand any future requirements and implications to our shared revenue streams. We are not currently assuming any material impact to our outlook as a result of that work, but this is an area we will continue to monitor through implementation.
In summary, our focus through the remainder of the year will be on accelerating GMV by ramping up our product-based experiences and continuing to drive our brand campaign to increase traffic to these experiences. While growth may not be always be perfectly linear, we believe that we are on the right path to continued Marketplace platform acceleration while delivering profitable growth and strong capital returns to our shareholders.

We have some differences country by country. That includes -- even if you look at the experience that would -- what happened not only in core eBay search but out in SEO and out on the edge, I'd say we're pleased with where we are. We obviously wouldn't be rolling it out if we weren't getting conversion gains. You can expect us to continue to roll that out throughout the balance of the year. And as I said, that will start in Q2 with us rolling a whole new bunch of products and categories into this product-based search. And from there, we'll continue to widen. It's a continual process of test and learn. It's not linear, but I think we are where we expected to be, and we're pretty pleased with the results.

And we -- this is one of the top brands in the world, but we think that there's a big opportunity to close the consumer consideration gap. There should be more people shopping on eBay because it's a great product with great inventory. And there are some that just don't consider us because they don't know what we do. So we're going to work hard to close that gap. It takes time, but I'm really glad that we're doing that. The second component is promotions, and promotional activity is now in that line, and we're experimenting with a lot of different things. Now that we feel that our product is evolving, we're getting better at conversion. We like the experience that our consumers are getting. We're being aggressive and experimental with our promotions, and we're always disciplined. But we did some promotions this quarter, last quarter, Q1, that we haven't done before, like in the U.S. And in general, we were happy with what we saw, and we'll keep experimenting with that. So right now, we're happy with where we are. We always watch our marketing expense carefully for a return on investment, and we're leaning in to drive not just growth but our future barriers to entry on things like our brand."

What that means is that we'll integrate with the teams in the NFL so that we can now have barcode scanning and mobile ticketing, seamless ticketing. So that's a real positive. That means both we'll have high-quality supply directly from NFL teams and a great customer experience with lower customer support because we see lower customer issues and customer support when we have fully integrated tickets and mobile scanning. So we're really happy with that, and it's great to be a partner with the NFL. I think what we said at the time, and I still believe, is the net impact of that might be slightly positive to growth and slightly negative to the -- to expenses because we're obviously paying a share for those integrated tickets. It's early -- the NFL just announced their schedule, I think, a few days ago, so it's a little early to gauge how that is all going. But it's -- we've been really happy with the relationship we have with Major League Baseball, and this is similar to that. It's a similar arrangement where we're partnered with the league and what we're getting is high-quality supply and a great fan experience through integration, and in return, we're giving up a little bit of that revenue."

One is the front end that customers will see and one is the back end which is the ledger, which accounts for the money. The front end is being built very rapidly, and I'm really pleased with the progress there. The ledger will take more time.

Always has been. It just that the means are evolving. On one -- on advertising, just to remind you, we've been on this journey now for a year or 2 where we are growing a first-party advertising business, which is existing sellers on our Marketplace can promote their items, and we have been short -- slowly but surely moving out of some of the third-party advertising that really was almost all of the advertising business that we have on the Marketplace. We would never entirely get out of third-party advertising. We still think there's healthy advertising. But basically, we're on a journey to which if you're a brand or you're a seller and you want our significant customer base or volume, you've got to have a store on eBay and you've got to promote it through 1P. We're now -- a year ago, we said it was starting to scale, and obviously, we've talked about this the last 3 quarters. This is a rapidly growing, exciting business now. Last quarter, we saw 200% growth. It doesn't yet really show up because we're bleeding third party down as we grow first party, but eventually, we think that is going to be a meaningful contributor to growth. We think there's lots of runway. Although our growth is fast, we're under-penetrated. And there's a lot of room to grow the first-party business, and we're very, very focused on that. So I -- it's one of the things that we think will be a growth driver of this business for the next several years."

Total GMV and revenue were up 7%, while active buyers grew 4% to 171 million. GMV and revenue in our Marketplace platform grew at 7%, with U.S. Marketplace GMV growing at 7%, while international GMV grew 6%. StubHub platforms grew volume at 13%, and Classified platforms grew revenue at 10%. Finally, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we recently announced the acquisition of Giosis Japan, expanding our presence in one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world.
As I've consistently communicated, we're focused on delivering the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while also sharpening our brand. This includes ongoing work to build an extensive product catalog, launching and scaling new finding experiences and more recently beginning to build payment intermediation capabilities on eBay. In Q1, we made progress on each of these areas. Let me share some examples.
Over the past year, we moved the majority of our SEO and paid search traffic to land on new product and browse pages that use our product catalog. We've also begun using our catalog to simplify both business and consumer selling, with sellers now being able to save time and money by relying on catalog-level attributes to list and promote their inventory. This quarter, we began focusing our efforts on organic traffic, launching a full product-based commerce experience to a subset of buyers in the U.S. Users searching for a number of specific products are now landing directly on a product-based search result. This is an important first step towards moving a material amount of our GMV to product-driven experiences over time.
In Q2, we plan to roll this experience out to more products such as iPhones, iPads, TVs and kitchen appliances. We believe this will simplify eBay's search as well as better highlight our natural inventory and price advantages. We'll continue to expand this effort over the next 6 months with a focus on driving higher conversion.
We're also scaling the new authentication and guaranteed delivery services we launched in Q4. This quarter, we expanded authentication to several European markets and into the luxury watch category. Conversion on authenticated inventory is twice that of similar non-authenticated inventory, which highlights the importance buyers place on trust for high-value purchases. With guaranteed delivery, we're seeing increased buyer purchase frequency and high satisfaction scores. With only a small number of sellers currently invited into the program, we have over 30 million items live in the U.S., which is a sizable increase from Q4, and many sellers who are using guaranteed delivery are seeing significant increases in sales.
Brand advertising continues to be a key investment area for us with ongoing activations across our major markets. We saw some early positive movement on consideration metrics in Q1. Changing consumer perception and behavior takes significant time, but this early validation is a helpful guidepost. In Q2, you will see our brand campaign evolve to directly address the eBay value proposition, clearly explain our inventory and price advantages and define what makes eBay unique.
We recently announced our Spring Seller Update, which included a number of improvements to existing programs, including expansion of guaranteed delivery to more sellers, a streamlined shipping label experience, improved price guidance, a simpler returns policy and enhanced seller protection.
We also expanded our first-party advertising program with the launch of Promoted Listings Lite, which is focused on smaller sellers. We continue to get significant traction with promoted listings. We had nearly 200,000 sellers advertise 130 million items in the quarter, driving more than 200% year-on-year revenue growth.
Finally, we're taking definitive steps to deliver the intermediated payments opportunity that we laid out in January. We made excellent progress in Q1 on our product build and go-to-market plans while also finalizing the commercial agreement with PayPal to be a form of payment, among others, in our new intermediated payments experience. We'll launch an employee beta this summer and then incorporate our learnings into an initial market test, where we'll further learn and iterate. We expect to start small and grow our penetration, building towards intermediating up to 5% of GMV in North America this year. We've received very positive market feedback from sellers who see the potential advantage of more efficient payment process, better economics and increased buyer demand.
StubHub had a good quarter, driven by strong international growth, a record Super Bowl and a strong college football playoff performance. And we recently announced the hiring of Sukhinder Singh Cassidy as StubHub's new President.
Our Classified platform delivered another quarter of double-digit growth with continued strong performance in eBay Kleinanzeigen and good growth in our emerging markets. We continue to drive meaningful synergy between our platforms. And in Q1, we launched the new motors offering for dealers in the U.K., which combines eBay Motors and Gumtree. We're also growing eBay listings on classifieds, which we expect to deliver nearly $200 million of GMV this year.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we recently announced the deal to expand our presence in Japan, one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world. With the acquisition of Giosis Japan, a leading e-commerce platform, combined with our existing export business, we will now have a Japanese business that generates over $1 billion of GMV annually with strong double-digit growth and a large market opportunity. Through this acquisition, we will be able to offer Japanese consumers more access to eBay's global inventory and broaden our presence in a dynamic, underpenetrated market with strong potential.
In summary, we continue to make progress, improving the eBay customer experience while delivering strong operating results. As I've indicated previously, this improvement won't always be linear, but Q1 was a good start to the year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitment.
Now let me turn it over to Scott, and he'll provide more details on our quarterly results and our outlook."

The deceleration was driven by some near-term headwinds in Korea and on our core eBay platform. In Korea, we are lapping active buyer increases related to mobile guest checkout improvements we made in addition to ongoing impact from the Q4 extended holiday. In our core eBay platform, we have seen some pressure on growth over the past couple of quarters from first-time buyers who buy in low ASP tranches. We are actively working to reverse this trend through a number of initiatives such as our under-10 micro sites that we launched in Q1. Growing active buyers remains an important focus for us, and as we expect, many of our efforts, including brand advertising and our new user experiences to drive more active buyer growth over the long term.
On Slide 6, in Q1, we enabled $23.6 billion of GMV, up 7%. By geography, the U.S. generated $9.5 billion of GMV, while international delivered $14.1 billion of GMV, both growing 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 7%, stable versus the prior quarter. We delivered $2 billion of transaction revenue, up 8%, and $557 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 5%. 
Diving a bit deeper into our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. Q1 GMV grew 7%, slightly higher than the prior quarter. U.S. GMV maintained 7% growth, while international grew 6%, driven by growth acceleration in Korea after the Q4 extended holiday, offset by softer consumer spending in the U.K. Underlying these trends, our B2C and C2C segments grew at 7% and 6%, respectively. Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 7%, a 1 point acceleration versus the prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 7%, with promoted listings contributing roughly 1 point of growth. Transaction take rate is lower year-over-year due to hedging activity recognized in net revenues, offset by reduced seller incentives and promoted listings. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 4%, accelerating 1 point versus Q4.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 13%, driven by a healthy event landscape, including a record Super Bowl and accelerating international growth. StubHub revenue grew 9%, driven by volume, offset by lower MS&O revenue and a slightly lower take rate.
On Slide 10, in Q1, Classifieds grew revenue 10%, with ongoing strength in our Classifieds platforms in Germany. The 3 point deceleration versus Q4 was driven by lapping price increases in our motors vertical and some display advertising headwinds as traffic shifts to mobile devices.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 27.9%, which was down 100 basis points versus last year, driven by increased investments in sales and marketing and product development. This includes a 30 basis point drag from foreign exchange primarily showing up in sales and marketing. As a reminder, our operating margin now includes the impact of buyer incentives in marketing expense due to the new revenue standard adopted this quarter.
Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year by 60 basis points. Investments in customer service and growth of our first-party inventory program in Korea were more than offset in savings in site operations. Q1 sales and marketing expense was up 120 basis points, driven by promotional and brand spending. We continually manage our marketing mix and shift spend between various channels.
In Q1, we spent heavier on buyer-facing promotions that are now recorded as sales and marketing expense while dialing back our seller incentives that are recorded as contra-revenue. We also continued to invest in global brand advertising, focused more heavily this quarter on fashion and parts and accessories campaigns.
Product development costs were up 70 basis points as we continue to invest in our product experiences across all of our platforms, including investment in AI and payment intermediation. G&A was down year-over-year through operating leverage.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q1, we delivered $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, up 9%. EPS growth was driven by operational growth and the net benefit of share repurchases, offset by a higher tax rate. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.40 versus the prior year of $0.94. As a reminder, the prior year included a noncash GAAP income tax benefit of $695 million related to our legal entity restructuring. As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q1, we generated $337 million of free cash flow, which is down 25%. This was primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and a slight increase in CapEx this quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $9.8 billion. During the quarter, $750 million of debt matured and was repaid, reducing our total debt to $9.2 billion. In Q1, as part of our ongoing commitment to provide meaningful returns for our shareholders, we repurchased 24.2 million shares at an average price of $41.71 a share, amounting to $1 billion in total. We ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. In Q2, we executed a new $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. These actions are in line with our capital return commitment of approximately $3.5 billion per year over the next 2 years in the form of share repurchases, inclusive of dilution offset.
Now I'd like to build on Devin's comments about payments and further clarify how we're thinking about the opportunity. As I discussed in January, we expect annualized incremental revenue of more than $2 billion once the majority of the volume of our core Marketplace platform has transitioned to the intermediated model. We assume a migration schedule that begins to expand when the operating agreement with PayPal ends in mid-2020 and scales through 2021. This estimate includes an expectation that we will take steps to reduce the cost of selling on eBay via a lower all-in take rate.
We also expect incremental operating profit of approximately $0.5 billion at scale, which we will capture regardless of the payment method chosen by our buyers. As Devin mentioned, we are actively investing to build our product and capabilities related to intermediated payments and improving the customer experience. We expect the level of investment to increase over time, although this amount remains in the range of $0.03 to $0.05 of EPS in 2018.
Turning to Q2 guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.68 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of 6% to 8%. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.52, up 10% to 14% on an as-reported basis. EPS growth will be driven by revenue growth, the net benefit of our share repurchase program and foreign exchange. For Q2, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.37. Our full year non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged from January.
As a reminder, for the year, we expect revenue in the range of $10.9 billion to $11.1 billion, growing 7% and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. This guidance continues to imply at the midpoint a point of acceleration from our Marketplace platform. We expect operating margin of 27% to 29%, a non-GAAP effective tax rate between 19% and 22% and a non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30 per share.
Additionally, we continue to expect CapEx at 6% to 8% of revenue and free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Full year GAAP EPS also remains unchanged, projected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share. GAAP EPS is impacted by the same drivers as non-GAAP EPS, in addition to the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and the amortization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Now I'd like to provide some additional context on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As announced in February, we are excited to expand eBay's footprint in Japan with the acquisition of the Giosis Japan business. We expect this transaction to close in the next few weeks. The impact has not been included in our current full year guidance. However, we expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive to revenue and dilutive to non-GAAP EPS but within the ranges of our Q2 and full year non-GAAP guidance, all else equal. We also expect to recognize a onetime GAAP EPS gain related to our original investment in Giosis not reflected in our GAAP guidance.
We have also been preparing for the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that goes into effect on May 25. We embrace this opportunity to have -- to demonstrate and deepen our commitment to data privacy, and our teams have been working to update our policy, systems and processes to ensure that we are compliant. We have also been working with our advised -- with our advertising partners to understand any future requirements and implications to our shared revenue streams. We are not currently assuming any material impact to our outlook as a result of that work, but this is an area we will continue to monitor through implementation.
In summary, our focus through the remainder of the year will be on accelerating GMV by ramping up our product-based experiences and continuing to drive our brand campaign to increase traffic to these experiences. While growth may not be always be perfectly linear, we believe that we are on the right path to continued Marketplace platform acceleration while delivering profitable growth and strong capital returns to our shareholders.

We obviously wouldn't be rolling it out if we weren't getting conversion gains. You can expect us to continue to roll that out throughout the balance of the year. And as I said, that will start in Q2 with us rolling a whole new bunch of products and categories into this product-based search. And from there, we'll continue to widen. It's a continual process of test and learn. It's not linear, but I think we are where we expected to be, and we're pretty pleased with the results.

So we're going to work hard to close that gap. It takes time, but I'm really glad that we're doing that.

And so you when you step back across all of those levers, it was relatively linear. But now that contra-revenue for buyers is in marketing expense, what you'll see is the kind of within month, within week incentives that we drive to take advantage of what's going on in the market. So for instance, as we started to see a little bit of a delay and the opportunity -- in tax payments and the opportunity to jump in and kind of incent the buyer base and our nonbuyer base to be able to activate on eBay in a more material way, you saw us lean in more in March than you have in the past. And you're seeing some of those big coupons that were out there trying to drive higher ASP, higher item -- higher-value items on the site. And yes, I think you should expect that to continue. We've been signaling that for a number of quarters, that between brand and our marketing incentives, that we'll be out trying to bring new active buyers in this ecosystem and drive GMV."

We're very focused on making sure, because this is new, that buyers get more choice, as we said before, and that sellers see both a lower cost of selling as well as just a seamless integrated experience. On the specifics of your question, I don't want to get too technical, but there are roughly -- there are kind of 2 pieces of payment intermediation at a high level of generality. One is the front end that customers will see and one is the back end which is the ledger, which accounts for the money. The front end is being built very rapidly, and I'm really pleased with the progress there. The ledger will take more time. And actually, what we'll do with the 5% market test is we'll actually use audience ledger and then we'll build the eBay ledger in the background. That won't come in until we move into 2019. But I'm pretty pleased with where we are. It's -- there's a lot of work to do. It is a meaningful product build and migration, but we're obviously incredibly focused on this.

Brands are increasingly coming to eBay. We're extremely pleased with the rate of brand acquisition. I think they're coming to eBay because the retail landscape is changing. They get sales from multiple channels that may not be around in a few years, and they're looking at their alternatives. And eBay is one of the very few at-scale marketplaces in the world, and we don't compete with our sellers. That's very rare and very unique. So brands that may, years ago, have been skeptical of selling on eBay are now successfully coming to our platform, and they are coming at an increasing rate. There was a time when eBay was very focused on big retailers. We're not now. That doesn't mean that we wouldn't situationally partner with a big retailer here or there, but we're not at all dependent on big retailers for our GMV. And quite frankly, it's not an area of significant focus for us. It is about brands and it's about our small and medium-sized sellers. That's always been the engine of our growth."

Some of them, we're happy with; some of them, we're not. And we'll try and we won't repeat. But I suspect that you'll see us evolve into acquiring healthy customer cohorts and reactivating our existing base are the 2 most important -- 2 most important priorities of our marketing spend. Always has been. It just that the means are evolving. On one -- on advertising, just to remind you, we've been on this journey now for a year or 2 where we are growing a first-party advertising business, which is existing sellers on our Marketplace can promote their items, and we have been short -- slowly but surely moving out of some of the third-party advertising that really was almost all of the advertising business that we have on the Marketplace. We would never entirely get out of third-party advertising. We still think there's healthy advertising. But basically, we're on a journey to which if you're a brand or you're a seller and you want our significant customer base or volume, you've got to have a store on eBay and you've got to promote it through 1P. We're now -- a year ago, we said it was starting to scale, and obviously, we've talked about this the last 3 quarters. This is a rapidly growing, exciting business now. Last quarter, we saw 200% growth. It doesn't yet really show up because we're bleeding third party down as we grow first party, but eventually, we think that is going to be a meaningful contributor to growth. We think there's lots of runway. Although our growth is fast, we're under-penetrated. And there's a lot of room to grow the first-party business, and we're very, very focused on that. So I -- it's one of the things that we think will be a growth driver of this business for the next several years."

Total GMV and revenue were up 7%, while active buyers grew 4% to 171 million. GMV and revenue in our Marketplace platform grew at 7%, with U.S. Marketplace GMV growing at 7%, while international GMV grew 6%. StubHub platforms grew volume at 13%, and Classified platforms grew revenue at 10%. Finally, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we recently announced the acquisition of Giosis Japan, expanding our presence in one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world.
As I've consistently communicated, we're focused on delivering the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while also sharpening our brand. This includes ongoing work to build an extensive product catalog, launching and scaling new finding experiences and more recently beginning to build payment intermediation capabilities on eBay. In Q1, we made progress on each of these areas. Let me share some examples.
Over the past year, we moved the majority of our SEO and paid search traffic to land on new product and browse pages that use our product catalog. We've also begun using our catalog to simplify both business and consumer selling, with sellers now being able to save time and money by relying on catalog-level attributes to list and promote their inventory. This quarter, we began focusing our efforts on organic traffic, launching a full product-based commerce experience to a subset of buyers in the U.S. Users searching for a number of specific products are now landing directly on a product-based search result. This is an important first step towards moving a material amount of our GMV to product-driven experiences over time.
In Q2, we plan to roll this experience out to more products such as iPhones, iPads, TVs and kitchen appliances. We believe this will simplify eBay's search as well as better highlight our natural inventory and price advantages. We'll continue to expand this effort over the next 6 months with a focus on driving higher conversion.
We're also scaling the new authentication and guaranteed delivery services we launched in Q4. This quarter, we expanded authentication to several European markets and into the luxury watch category. Conversion on authenticated inventory is twice that of similar non-authenticated inventory, which highlights the importance buyers place on trust for high-value purchases. With guaranteed delivery, we're seeing increased buyer purchase frequency and high satisfaction scores. With only a small number of sellers currently invited into the program, we have over 30 million items live in the U.S., which is a sizable increase from Q4, and many sellers who are using guaranteed delivery are seeing significant increases in sales.
Brand advertising continues to be a key investment area for us with ongoing activations across our major markets. We saw some early positive movement on consideration metrics in Q1. Changing consumer perception and behavior takes significant time, but this early validation is a helpful guidepost. In Q2, you will see our brand campaign evolve to directly address the eBay value proposition, clearly explain our inventory and price advantages and define what makes eBay unique.
We recently announced our Spring Seller Update, which included a number of improvements to existing programs, including expansion of guaranteed delivery to more sellers, a streamlined shipping label experience, improved price guidance, a simpler returns policy and enhanced seller protection.
We also expanded our first-party advertising program with the launch of Promoted Listings Lite, which is focused on smaller sellers. We continue to get significant traction with promoted listings. We had nearly 200,000 sellers advertise 130 million items in the quarter, driving more than 200% year-on-year revenue growth.
Finally, we're taking definitive steps to deliver the intermediated payments opportunity that we laid out in January. We made excellent progress in Q1 on our product build and go-to-market plans while also finalizing the commercial agreement with PayPal to be a form of payment, among others, in our new intermediated payments experience. We'll launch an employee beta this summer and then incorporate our learnings into an initial market test, where we'll further learn and iterate. We expect to start small and grow our penetration, building towards intermediating up to 5% of GMV in North America this year. We've received very positive market feedback from sellers who see the potential advantage of more efficient payment process, better economics and increased buyer demand.
StubHub had a good quarter, driven by strong international growth, a record Super Bowl and a strong college football playoff performance. And we recently announced the hiring of Sukhinder Singh Cassidy as StubHub's new President.
Our Classified platform delivered another quarter of double-digit growth with continued strong performance in eBay Kleinanzeigen and good growth in our emerging markets. We continue to drive meaningful synergy between our platforms. And in Q1, we launched the new motors offering for dealers in the U.K., which combines eBay Motors and Gumtree. We're also growing eBay listings on classifieds, which we expect to deliver nearly $200 million of GMV this year.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we recently announced the deal to expand our presence in Japan, one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world. With the acquisition of Giosis Japan, a leading e-commerce platform, combined with our existing export business, we will now have a Japanese business that generates over $1 billion of GMV annually with strong double-digit growth and a large market opportunity. Through this acquisition, we will be able to offer Japanese consumers more access to eBay's global inventory and broaden our presence in a dynamic, underpenetrated market with strong potential.
In summary, we continue to make progress, improving the eBay customer experience while delivering strong operating results. As I've indicated previously, this improvement won't always be linear, but Q1 was a good start to the year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver on our full year commitment.
Now let me turn it over to Scott, and he'll provide more details on our quarterly results and our outlook."

Let's begin with Q1 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q1, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $495 million of operating cash flow and $337 million in free cash flow, while repur",1642,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q1 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q1, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $495 million of operating cash flow and $337 million in free cash flow, while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.
Moving to active buyers on Slide 5. In the quarter, trailing 12-month buyer growth was 4% year-over-year, a 1 point deceleration versus Q4. The deceleration was driven by some near-term headwinds in Korea and on our core eBay platform. In Korea, we are lapping active buyer increases related to mobile guest checkout improvements we made in addition to ongoing impact from the Q4 extended holiday. In our core eBay platform, we have seen some pressure on growth over the past couple of quarters from first-time buyers who buy in low ASP tranches. We are actively working to reverse this trend through a number of initiatives such as our under-10 micro sites that we launched in Q1. Growing active buyers remains an important focus for us, and as we expect, many of our efforts, including brand advertising and our new user experiences to drive more active buyer growth over the long term.
On Slide 6, in Q1, we enabled $23.6 billion of GMV, up 7%. By geography, the U.S. generated $9.5 billion of GMV, while international delivered $14.1 billion of GMV, both growing 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 7%, stable versus the prior quarter. We delivered $2 billion of transaction revenue, up 8%, and $557 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 5%. 
Diving a bit deeper into our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. Q1 GMV grew 7%, slightly higher than the prior quarter. U.S. GMV maintained 7% growth, while international grew 6%, driven by growth acceleration in Korea after the Q4 extended holiday, offset by softer consumer spending in the U.K. Underlying these trends, our B2C and C2C segments grew at 7% and 6%, respectively. Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 7%, a 1 point acceleration versus the prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 7%, with promoted listings contributing roughly 1 point of growth. Transaction take rate is lower year-over-year due to hedging activity recognized in net revenues, offset by reduced seller incentives and promoted listings. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 4%, accelerating 1 point versus Q4.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 13%, driven by a healthy event landscape, including a record Super Bowl and accelerating international growth. StubHub revenue grew 9%, driven by volume, offset by lower MS&O revenue and a slightly lower take rate.
On Slide 10, in Q1, Classifieds grew revenue 10%, with ongoing strength in our Classifieds platforms in Germany. The 3 point deceleration versus Q4 was driven by lapping price increases in our motors vertical and some display advertising headwinds as traffic shifts to mobile devices.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q1, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 27.9%, which was down 100 basis points versus last year, driven by increased investments in sales and marketing and product development. This includes a 30 basis point drag from foreign exchange primarily showing up in sales and marketing. As a reminder, our operating margin now includes the impact of buyer incentives in marketing expense due to the new revenue standard adopted this quarter.
Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year by 60 basis points. Investments in customer service and growth of our first-party inventory program in Korea were more than offset in savings in site operations. Q1 sales and marketing expense was up 120 basis points, driven by promotional and brand spending. We continually manage our marketing mix and shift spend between various channels.
In Q1, we spent heavier on buyer-facing promotions that are now recorded as sales and marketing expense while dialing back our seller incentives that are recorded as contra-revenue. We also continued to invest in global brand advertising, focused more heavily this quarter on fashion and parts and accessories campaigns.
Product development costs were up 70 basis points as we continue to invest in our product experiences across all of our platforms, including investment in AI and payment intermediation. G&A was down year-over-year through operating leverage.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q1, we delivered $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, up 9%. EPS growth was driven by operational growth and the net benefit of share repurchases, offset by a higher tax rate. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.40 versus the prior year of $0.94. As a reminder, the prior year included a noncash GAAP income tax benefit of $695 million related to our legal entity restructuring. As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q1, we generated $337 million of free cash flow, which is down 25%. This was primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and a slight increase in CapEx this quarter.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $9.8 billion. During the quarter, $750 million of debt matured and was repaid, reducing our total debt to $9.2 billion. In Q1, as part of our ongoing commitment to provide meaningful returns for our shareholders, we repurchased 24.2 million shares at an average price of $41.71 a share, amounting to $1 billion in total. We ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. In Q2, we executed a new $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. These actions are in line with our capital return commitment of approximately $3.5 billion per year over the next 2 years in the form of share repurchases, inclusive of dilution offset.
Now I'd like to build on Devin's comments about payments and further clarify how we're thinking about the opportunity. As I discussed in January, we expect annualized incremental revenue of more than $2 billion once the majority of the volume of our core Marketplace platform has transitioned to the intermediated model. We assume a migration schedule that begins to expand when the operating agreement with PayPal ends in mid-2020 and scales through 2021. This estimate includes an expectation that we will take steps to reduce the cost of selling on eBay via a lower all-in take rate.
We also expect incremental operating profit of approximately $0.5 billion at scale, which we will capture regardless of the payment method chosen by our buyers. As Devin mentioned, we are actively investing to build our product and capabilities related to intermediated payments and improving the customer experience. We expect the level of investment to increase over time, although this amount remains in the range of $0.03 to $0.05 of EPS in 2018.
Turning to Q2 guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.68 billion, representing FX-neutral growth of 6% to 8%. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.52, up 10% to 14% on an as-reported basis. EPS growth will be driven by revenue growth, the net benefit of our share repurchase program and foreign exchange. For Q2, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.37. Our full year non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged from January.
As a reminder, for the year, we expect revenue in the range of $10.9 billion to $11.1 billion, growing 7% and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. This guidance continues to imply at the midpoint a point of acceleration from our Marketplace platform. We expect operating margin of 27% to 29%, a non-GAAP effective tax rate between 19% and 22% and a non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.30 per share.
Additionally, we continue to expect CapEx at 6% to 8% of revenue and free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Full year GAAP EPS also remains unchanged, projected to be $1.65 to $1.75 per share. GAAP EPS is impacted by the same drivers as non-GAAP EPS, in addition to the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and the amortization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Now I'd like to provide some additional context on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As announced in February, we are excited to expand eBay's footprint in Japan with the acquisition of the Giosis Japan business. We expect this transaction to close in the next few weeks. The impact has not been included in our current full year guidance. However, we expect this acquisition to be modestly accretive to revenue and dilutive to non-GAAP EPS but within the ranges of our Q2 and full year non-GAAP guidance, all else equal. We also expect to recognize a onetime GAAP EPS gain related to our original investment in Giosis not reflected in our GAAP guidance.
We have also been preparing for the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that goes into effect on May 25. We embrace this opportunity to have -- to demonstrate and deepen our commitment to data privacy, and our teams have been working to update our policy, systems and processes to ensure that we are compliant. We have also been working with our advised -- with our advertising partners to understand any future requirements and implications to our shared revenue streams. We are not currently assuming any material impact to our outlook as a result of that work, but this is an area we will continue to monitor through implementation.
In summary, our focus through the remainder of the year will be on accelerating GMV by ramping up our product-based experiences and continuing to drive our brand campaign to increase traffic to these experiences. While growth may not be always be perfectly linear, we believe that we are on the right path to continued Marketplace platform acceleration while delivering profitable growth and strong capital returns to our shareholders.

We obviously wouldn't be rolling it out if we weren't getting conversion gains. You can expect us to continue to roll that out throughout the balance of the year. And as I said, that will start in Q2 with us rolling a whole new bunch of products and categories into this product-based search. And from there, we'll continue to widen. It's a continual process of test and learn. It's not linear, but I think we are where we expected to be, and we're pretty pleased with the results.

And we -- this is one of the top brands in the world, but we think that there's a big opportunity to close the consumer consideration gap. There should be more people shopping on eBay because it's a great product with great inventory. And there are some that just don't consider us because they don't know what we do. So we're going to work hard to close that gap. It takes time, but I'm really glad that we're doing that. The second component is promotions, and promotional activity is now in that line, and we're experimenting with a lot of different things.

And quite frankly, it's not an area of significant focus for us. It is about brands and it's about our small and medium-sized sellers. That's always been the engine of our growth."

We care that the customer cohorts we bring in have a positive customer lifetime value. And there are new tools in our arsenal, and we're trying many of them. Some of them, we're happy with; some of them, we're not. And we'll try and we won't repeat. But I suspect that you'll see us evolve into acquiring healthy customer cohorts and reactivating our existing base are the 2 most important -- 2 most important priorities of our marketing spend. Always has been. It just that the means are evolving. On one -- on advertising, just to remind you, we've been on this journey now for a year or 2 where we are growing a first-party advertising business, which is existing sellers on our Marketplace can promote their items, and we have been short -- slowly but surely moving out of some of the third-party advertising that really was almost all of the advertising business that we have on the Marketplace. We would never entirely get out of third-party advertising. We still think there's healthy advertising. But basically, we're on a journey to which if you're a brand or you're a seller and you want our significant customer base or volume, you've got to have a store on eBay and you've got to promote it through 1P. We're now -- a year ago, we said it was starting to scale, and obviously, we've talked about this the last 3 quarters. This is a rapidly growing, exciting business now. Last quarter, we saw 200% growth. It doesn't yet really show up because we're bleeding third party down as we grow first party, but eventually, we think that is going to be a meaningful contributor to growth. We think there's lots of runway. Although our growth is fast, we're under-penetrated. And there's a lot of room to grow the first-party business, and we're very, very focused on that. So I -- it's one of the things that we think will be a growth driver of this business for the next several years."

In Q2, we continue to execute our strategy, improving the core eBay experience, investing in service and clarifying our brand while pursuing significant opportunities in advertising and payments. Total GMV was up 7%, and revenue was up 6%, while active buyers grew 4%. With the addition of buyers from our recent acquisition in Japan, we now have 175 million active buyers. GMV in our Marketplace platform grew at 7% year-on-year with U.S. Marketplace GMV growing at 6%, while international GMV grew 7%. Our StubHub platforms grew volume at 5%, and our Classifieds platforms grew revenue at 10%. Finally, we repurchased nearly 1 billion -- we returned nearly $1 billion to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we closed our acquisition in Japan. While we delivered strong earnings growth this quarter, we encountered some revenue headwinds from foreign exchange and weaker StubHub event landscape which will put pressure on our revenue for the second half. In addition, while core Marketplace GMV growth remains steady, we do not expect some of the key initiatives to deliver GMV acceleration until later in the year. None of this changes our strategy and approach, and we expect to deliver core GMV growth acceleration in the second half of 2018. We're focusing to an even greater extent on initiatives that will have the greatest impact on our customers and our business, including further scaling product-based commerce, Guaranteed Delivery and our new C2C selling flow, while launching a series of innovative new buyer experiences. At the same time, we're stopping work on less critical projects that are not moving the needle or are more speculative.
Now let me update you on some of the progress we made in Q2. We continue to build on our structured data efforts, including our new product-based commerce experience. We've added 12 product lines representing roughly 3% of GMV to a fully product-based experience, and we plan to expand this to more branded high velocity products in the second half. Users that are new to eBay are responding well to product-based commerce with improved conversion. However, this is yet to translate to our existing active buyers, and we'll continue iterating on this experience until we see those conversion gains across most of our base. We continue to scale Guaranteed Delivery in the U.S., and we recently launched in Australia. We exited Q2 with nearly 300,000 sellers and 80 million live listings in the program, both significant increases versus the prior quarter. In the quarter, Guaranteed Delivery purchases represented 5% of volume and with 95% order delivery accuracy. Within our broader advertising efforts, promoted listings continued its strong growth trajectory. We launched several enhancements in Q2, including a new item recommendation tool to guide sellers on which inventory they should promote. We now have over 300,000 sellers promoting over 150 million listings, leading to revenue growth in excess of 150%, offsetting declines in nonstrategic third-party advertising. We're also adding first-party services recently launching Highline search ads, which enables sellers to bid for better placement from the top of search results. Finally, we're seeing minimal disruption to date from GDPR to our third-party advertising revenue in Europe.
Ensuring our users have access to great customer service is an important priority for us. We continue to scale our premium service offering, Concierge, to more top buyers and sellers. Customers with access to this offering show high satisfaction and are driving higher buyer and selling activity. We recently launched a program aimed at new buyers using proactive outreach whenever we see an issue with a first purchase. We're also simplifying and modernizing our self-service platforms with an entirely new AI-based experience now live in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Australia. And we're moving more of our customer service roles in-house with hundreds of new eBay service jobs hired over the last year, reducing our reliance on outsourced roles.
We continue to advertise our brands to drive awareness and consideration of eBay this quarter. While our brand campaign has been well-regarded externally, it's not yet materially moved the needle on consideration, which is key to driving new buyer acquisition. We'll be back in market with new advertising campaign this quarter, while also activating multiple marketing channels in the second half of the year to drive traffic in buyer activity.
Finally, we're making good progress on building our managed payment service. We recently announced that Steve Fisher, our CTO, has moved roles and will now focus solely on delivering this critical initiative for us. Product development is well underway, and we expect to launch an internal beta next week. We've also identified the sellers who will be invited into the initial phase of our new payments experience this fall, and we're looking forward to sharing additional plans in this area with our sellers at eBay Open next week.
Looking at StubHub, Q2 saw strong NBA and NHL performance in the U.S. and continued strength internationally, offset by a softer event landscape in our 3 largest genres: concerts, theater and Major League Baseball. We expect StubHub to continue to face these landscape challenges in the second half of the year. And Classifieds delivered another quarter of strong growth, driven primarily by our platforms in Germany.
Before I close, I'd like to address the Supreme Court decision on Internet sales tax. In the recent South Dakota versus Wayfair ruling, the court left undecided some significant issues, such as what constitutes substantial Nexus requiring an out-of-state seller to collect sales tax. The court did make clear that state tax laws must provide protection for small sellers. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on our business in 2018. Beyond that, any impact will depend upon a number of factors that will take time to play out, including whether the federal government preempts the states or otherwise enacts legislation to protect small business as well as the effect on states that enact marketplace collection obligations. In the Supreme Court case, South Dakota set a small business exemption threshold of $100,000, which we believe is far too low for states that are more populous. However, hypothetically, if that threshold were applied to each individual state, approximately 80% of our GMV would be excluded from sales tax. You can expect us to continue to work with our community and Congress to urge lawmakers to provide clear tax rules with a strong small business exemption that will allow our sellers to continue to grow and flourish. Regardless of how it plays out, eBay sellers currently have the ability to collect applicable taxes on their eBay transactions, and we will have the capability to collect and remit sales tax on behalf of our sellers should that become a requirement.
In summary, we continue to make progress improving the eBay customer experience. While the first half of 2018 has brought some unanticipated challenges that I outlined earlier, we expect core acceleration in the second half while delivering very strong earnings growth. 
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financial results and on our outlook."

Let's begin with Q2 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation.

Let's begin with Q2 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q2, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $188 million of free cash flow, and we repurchased approximately $1 billion of our stock. Finally, in the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Giosis Qoo10 program platform, which expands eBay's footprint in Japan. 
Moving to active buyers. In the quarter, we increased our total active buyer base to 175 million, including 3 million buyers from our Japan acquisition. Our trailing 12-month growth was stable at 4%, including our new Japan buyers on a pro forma basis. Growth, excluding Japan, was 3%, down 1 point versus the prior quarter, due primarily to the lapping of new buyers from fidget spinners in the prior year. Scaling of new user experiences and our broader marketing programs will continue to be a key area of focus to drive more active buyer growth.
On Slide 6, in Q2, we enabled $23.6 billion of total GMV, up 7%. The U.S. generated $9.3 billion of GMV, up 5%, while international delivered $14.4 billion of GMV, up 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated total net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 6% on an FX-neutral basis and up 6% organically, both down 1 point versus the prior quarter. As Devin mentioned, we encountered unexpected headwinds from a weaker events landscape for StubHub and a stronger U.S. dollar, which more than offset revenue from our Japan acquisition. We delivered $2.1 billion of transaction revenue, up 7%, and $563 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 5%.
Turning to our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. GMV grew 7% in Q2, flat versus the prior quarter, including approximately 60 basis points, driven by the Japan acquisition. U.S. GMV grew 6%, decelerating 1 point quarter-over-quarter due to lapping C2C growth in the prior year and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on exports. International GMV accelerated 1 point to 7%, driven by the addition of Japan. Total Marketplace's revenue was $2.1 billion, up 6%. Transaction revenue grew 7%, with promoted listings contributing roughly [ a ] point of growth. Transaction take rate is slightly lower year-over-year due to hedging activity recognized in net revenues and some mixed pressure from growth of lower take rate categories, offset by reduced seller incentives and strong promoted listings growth. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 2%, a deceleration of 2 points versus the prior quarter as we continue to reduce nonstrategic third party ad placements in favor of promoted listings.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 5% year-over-year, decelerating 8 points from Q1, while revenue grew 3%, decelerating 6 points, reflecting a softer event landscape.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q2, Classifieds grew revenue 10%, flat versus Q1. We continue to see strong performance from Germany and our motors platform, while managing advertising monetization pressure from the ongoing shift to mobile.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q2, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2%, which is down 120 basis points versus last year, driven by increased investments in payments, marketing and Japan. As a reminder, our operating margin now includes the impact of buyer incentives in marketing expense due to the revenue accounting standards 606 adopted this year. Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year by 50 basis points, helped by efficiencies in our customer service organization. Q2 sales and marketing expense is up 170 basis points, driven by promotional spending on our Marketplace platform, StubHub and the addition of our Japan acquisition. Product development costs were up 30 basis points as we continue to invest in our product experiences across all of our platforms, including building out managed payments. G&A was down year-over-year through operating leverage.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q2, we delivered $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, up 17% versus prior year. EPS growth was driven by volume growth, the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by our investments in managed payments, marketing and Japan. As we stated at the beginning of the year, our guidance range for tax was slightly wider than normal, driven by uncertainty on how all elements of U.S. tax reform would impact us. In Q2, we initiated actions to mitigate some of these elements and therefore, refined our estimates, providing a net benefit to the quarter of $0.03 as well as a benefit to our go-forward tax rate. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up $0.61 versus the prior year, driven by the lapping of last year's noncash income tax charge of $311 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of a deferred tax asset and 3 discrete items in this quarter. Let me give color on each of these.
First, we took a disciplined look across our cost base and took action to create capacity to invest more marketing in the second half while delivering on earnings growth. The reduction was completed in the second quarter resulting in a pretax restructuring charge of $84 million. Second, as part of our acquisition in Japan, we relinquished our investment in Giosis' non-Japanese businesses, recording a one-time gain of $266 million. Finally, we recognized a gain associated with the warrant agreement entered into with a service provider.
As always, you can a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
Moving to Slide 13. In Q2, we generated $188 million of free cash flow, which is down 64% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by timing differences of cash tax payments related to both U.S. tax reform and other international tax payments. CapEx was 7% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and nonequity investments of $8.6 billion. Our capital allocation strategy is designed to manage the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility for organic opportunities and M&A balanced against capital return to drive long-term shareholder value. In May, we completed the acquisition of Giosis Qoo10 platform in exchange for $306 million in cash and the previously mentioned relinquishment of our investment in Giosis' non-Japanese business. We also announced the intention to sell our holdings in Flipkart and expect gross proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approval. During Q2, as part of our ongoing commitment to provide meaningful returns for our shareholders, we repurchased $989 million of our stock. Since separation, we have repurchased 281 million shares or approximately 23% to shares outstanding at an average price of $31.40 a share, amounting to $8.8 billion in total. We ended the quarter with $5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
Before walking through guidance on Slide 15, let me provide a little more context on how the stronger U.S. dollar will impact our full year results. As you know, we have a global business with nearly 60% of our revenue from markets outside the U.S. The U.S. dollar has strengthened versus our main international currencies by approximately 4% compared to what we guided in January. At current exchange rates, revenue is negatively impacted by approximately $150 million for the full year. Our earnings for the full year are largely protected from currency movements, but revenue will continue to be partially exposed if the dollar continues to strengthen. On an organic FX-neutral basis, the mid to high end of our guidance assumes Marketplace's GMV acceleration will come from further scaling our new product experiences, including product-based commerce and Guaranteed Delivery while ensuring we invest more heavily in our marketing programs. For StubHub, while we do not guide by platform, we are not currently assuming any improvement in the trajectory of the market in the second half, and we will also be lapping a particularly robust Q4 in the prior year.
We are now projecting 2018 revenue between $10.75 billion and $10.85 billion, growing 6% to 7% on an organic FX-neutral basis and 8% to 9% on an as-reported basis. We expect operating margin at the mid to low end of the 27% to 29% range for the year, driven primarily by our Japan acquisition. We now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 20%. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $3.5 billion per year over 2018 and 2019. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $2.28 to $2.32, up 14% to 16% as reported versus last year. This includes the impact of top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program and a lower tax rate, partially offset by our investments in managed payments in Japan. We expect free cash flow towards the lower end of the $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion range driven by our Japan acquisition and foreign exchange while the underlying cash flow dynamics of the company have not changed. This also includes [indiscernible] capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
Full year GAAP EPS is projected to be $1.91 to $2.01 per share. Any gain from the sale of our holdings in Flipkart is currently not factored into our GAAP guidance.
Turning to Q3 guidance on Slide 16. We are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.69 billion, growing 5% to 7% on an organic FX-neutral basis and 6% to 8% on an as-reported basis. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.54 to $0.56 per share, representing 14% to 18% growth. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41. 
In summary, we continue to execute our strategy and remain focused on improving the core eBay experience. We have made adjustments that enable us to continue to deliver strong earnings growth while we scaled the new experiences and invest more in our marketing efforts. Looking ahead, we are on track for payments testing in the second half, which is a very significant opportunity to improve the customer experience and deliver significant economic benefit for our sellers and shareholders over time.

I'll let Scott talk about the translation of revenue, but let me just talk about the business drivers. So there's really 2 significant drivers to the second half. The first is the product and customer experience and the second is marketing. On the product, we have some significant product changes coming into the market, some of which are already in the market performing well which we're going to scale. So I mentioned Guaranteed Delivery, already out, scaling, performing well. Our new C2C selling flow delivering meaningful consumer selling conversion scaling already out of the market. Structured data's tentacles are now touching every part of the company, and they're making a meaningful impact in many areas. The one area that we've still got to iterate is on the full product-based prior experience, where as I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing really good conversion from brand-new buyers who come to eBay, and we have some work to do on the existing base. So on the product side, we've been working, as you know, at this for quite a while. We've driven improved acceleration and better operating results over time, and we believe that, that will continue in the second half. At the same time, because we're seeing good performance of new buyers that come to eBay, we want to bring more of them. And to do that, we're going to continue to activate our marketing channels and market aggressively. We are responding to a competitive e-commerce landscape. We love our proposition. We think that when people come to eBay, that they see what a great proposition we have, so you can expect us to light up our brand in the second half further, you can expect us to be active in all marketing channels and to plus that up along with the new product releases. So all of that, obviously, helped us factor in to the guide on core acceleration. Scott can talk a little bit about the core GMV-to-revenue translation."

Look, we're in a very competitive market, and an e-commerce landscape that's equally -- that's really competitive. It's important for us to adapt our approach as we try to remain competitive and drive traffic and activity sellers inventory. And so we are increasingly focused as we've talked about in making sure that we're driving engagement and usage of the platform. And whether that's from increasing share of wallet with our existing buyers or attracting new buyers, and so the promotional activity is intended to do both of those. And while we're on the topic, when you think about those incentives, there's a wide variety of different incentives that you've seen, both in the Kontron, in the form of seller couponing as well as buyer coupons, marketing expense, box boosters, et cetera, and we've been leveraging those promotions more heavily in recent times, and I think we've been pretty clear, and it's been showing up in marketing as a percentage of revenue. And look, I think you should expect, and as implied in our guidance, that, that will continue, and certainly, the rearchitecture of our cost base that we did in June was intended to enable that without having an impact to earnings. In terms of the actual EPS impact, what we're trying to architect on a GAAP non-GAAP basis is that there is no impact to revenue and there is no impact to non-GAAP EPS from the restructuring that we did. However, we've enabled a significant amount of ad marketing incremental to our original plans to buffer the second half."

In this case, because we had, at the top, particularly of the technology organization, a significant reorganization with Steve moving to payments, it gave us an opportunity several years into this journey to take a deep look and to say, okay, we need to plus these things up and there are other areas that we just weren't getting a return on them.

I would highlight that there's actually a couple underlying dynamics that we've called out in the past and that continue and will continue to pressure in a rolling 12-month metric for the time being. First off, as we kind of talked about, there's a fidget spinner dynamic that, in Q2 of last year, brought a lot of low ASP items that were a lot of new buyers as well, and we have not retained those new buyers to the extent that we have in the past. They're kind of one and done, if you will, buying those fidget spinners, and they were very low ASP items. So as we lap that, that certainly makes it feel like the underlying growth rate is decelerating when, in fact, it's more a one-off aspect of that. And that same thing is pressuring active buyers, but now, the other thing we talked about was, we had been savoring higher ASP branded items in our search, and as that has -- then that has kind of offset some of the ASP pressure -- or sorry, some of the pressure that we got from the fidget spinners in the sold item number pushing ASP up a bit, but really sold items down. So hopefully, that's clear. But that's the dynamic between those 2 both active buyers and sold items."

And on some of the far ones, we're continuing and some we're not. And again, I don't want to get into a laundry list of small projects, but the overall reduction force was not very large and it reflects the fact that we stopped things that I think should have been stopped and that resource was not we allocable. On the question about the second half, like part of it, I think, Heath, is things that it's not that they didn't deliver but they're taking longer than we probably would have hoped in January. So I'll look at where we have Guaranteed Delivery in C2C in the market and many of the tentacles of structured data. I'm really pleased with what they've done, but we have not been able to move them out of as fast as originally I would've hoped, quite honestly. And in some ways, that gives me confidence that we will get benefit from it, we just need to move them out to -- and get more surface area. Another great example would be the brand. So on brand, I'm really happy that we are investing and we're sticking to investing in our brand. I think everybody that I've spoken to from our customers to our investors understands that we have an incredible brand, but one that can be easily misunderstood and it's our job to close that perception gap. But brands take time, and we -- when I look at the underlying metrics, I think I said at last call or the one before, what I'm holding our brand spend accountable for is moving aided consideration, and we are beginning to see aided consideration move. It hasn't yet translated to our buyer growth number. I believe it will, but we've got to be persistent and run the company for the long-term and not shut it off because it didn't make an impact this quarter. So there's an example of things that I think are both projects that we shut down our projects that we believe will swing through and deliver for us in the second half and beyond."

I got a lot of questions a year ago about why we weren't moving faster, and my answer was always because we don't -- we want to make it work for both new customers and existing customers. And many of the things we've done, I believe, have done that. But when we -- not everything is that easy. And when you have a very large habituated Marketplace and you're making substantial changes to the user experience, some of it takes time, and that time may be design challenges, its front-end product challenges. I think we're on to a really powerful product experience that both simplifies eBay, but equally doesn't mimic anyone else and it shows what we're great at, which is the spectrum of value, our incredible advantage in inventory and in prices for consumers without necessarily having any commodity high velocity items, having them wade through hundreds of thousands of individual listings. That's what we're trying to accomplish. You get a new buyer who is not habituated to a way of doing things and they love it. Existing buyers have -- take more time and we have to thread the needle about not disrupting their experience, but also bringing out about that trade off of simplicity, but differentiation. And we see pockets of it, but it does take time, and overall, I feel very good about it, I feel like we're absolutely on the right path and I feel confident that we're going to get the benefit out of that, in particular, that we're expecting. What the second part of the question was on -- oh, brand versus promo. You know what, the way look at it is, we spend an experiment in a variety of different ways to driving value in the Marketplace. For me, value means what it says. I've often also said you can buy growth, it's not that hard, there are plenty of companies out there that do it. We've always been disciplined in the way that we spent, and we're always experimenting. So yes, we do promos now. The market -- a couple of years ago, we added strong deals program to the holiday. Why did we do that? We did it because consumers were demanding it. And what we found is if we do it the right way, we don't just get growth in that holiday quarter, we get the CLD benefit of those customers. I'd say we're experimenting right now with these promos. We're experimenting with generating activity, bringing new customers in and then seeing what happens, and it's kind of early to look at the cohort of customers that have come in through this promotional activity to know whether we'll get the value, but that's exactly why we're doing it, so that we can measure it and make sure that we're not destroying value that we're adopting to the market, but also getting value out of every marketing dollar or promo dollar."

We'll start with export, meaning, Indian sellers selling on other Marketplace platforms around the world, that was something that we turned over to Flipkart.

It's also got a partnership with flybys which is a big national loyalty network for purchasing credit outside our network to things like groceries and gas and other things. In Germany, it's preferential access to deals and other benefits. So I -- right now, when I look at Australia that just introduced this, the uptake, early, it's super early, but the uptake has well exceeded our expectations. We're very pleased with where that went, including this week where you saw a lot of global retail activity, and we use the opportunity around Prime Day to market our propositions, and we saw a great uptake of eBay Plus in Australia around this week, which I'm really, really pleased with. Could eBay Plus move out? I think it could. We're obviously looking at that.

In Q2, we continue to execute our strategy, improving the core eBay experience, investing in service and clarifying our brand while pursuing significant opportunities in advertising and payments. Total GMV",1186,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. 
In Q2, we continue to execute our strategy, improving the core eBay experience, investing in service and clarifying our brand while pursuing significant opportunities in advertising and payments. 
Total GMV was up 7%, and revenue was up 6%, while active buyers grew 4%. With the addition of buyers from our recent acquisition in Japan, we now have 175 million active buyers. GMV in our Marketplace platform grew at 7% year-on-year, with U.S. Marketplace GMV growing at 6%, while international GMV grew 7%. Our StubHub platforms grew volume at 5%, and our Classifieds platforms grew revenue at 10%. Finally, we repurchased nearly 1 billion -- we returned nearly $1 billion to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we closed our acquisition in Japan. 
While we delivered strong earnings growth this quarter, we encountered some revenue headwinds from foreign exchange and a weaker StubHub event landscape which will put pressure on our revenue for the second half. In addition, while core Marketplace GMV growth remains steady, we do not expect some of the key initiatives to deliver GMV acceleration until later in the year. None of this changes our strategy and approach, and we expect to deliver core GMV growth acceleration in the second half of 2018. We're focusing to an even greater extent on initiatives that will have the greatest impact on our customers and our business, including further scaling product-based commerce, Guaranteed Delivery and our new C2C selling flow, while launching a series of innovative new buyer experiences. At the same time, we're stopping work on less critical projects that are not moving the needle or are more speculative.
Now let me update you on some of the progress we made in Q2. We continue to build on our structured data efforts, including our new product-based commerce experience. We've added 12 product lines representing roughly 3% of GMV to a fully product-based experience, and we plan to expand this to more branded high-velocity products in the second half. Users that are new to eBay are responding well to product-based commerce with improved conversion. However, this is yet to translate to our existing active buyers, and we'll continue iterating on this experience until we see those conversion gains across most of our base. We continue to scale Guaranteed Delivery in the U.S., and we recently launched in Australia. We exited Q2 with nearly 300,000 sellers and 80 million live listings in the program, both significant increases versus the prior quarter. 
In the quarter, Guaranteed Delivery purchases represented 5% of volume and -- with 95% order delivery accuracy. Within our broader advertising efforts, promoted listings continued its strong growth trajectory. We launched several enhancements in Q2, including a new item recommendation tool to guide sellers on which inventory they should promote. We now have over 300,000 sellers promoting over 150 million listings, leading to revenue growth in excess of 150%, offsetting declines in nonstrategic third-party advertising. We're also adding additional first-party services, recently launching Highline Search Ads, which enables sellers to bid for header placement from the top of search results. Finally, we're seeing minimal disruption to date from GDPR to our third-party advertising revenue in Europe.
Ensuring our users have access to great customer service is an important priority for us. We continue to scale our premium service offering, Concierge, to more top buyers and sellers. Customers with access to this offering show high satisfaction and are driving higher buyer and selling activity. We recently launched a program aimed at new buyers using proactive outreach whenever we see an issue with a first purchase. We're also simplifying and modernizing our self-service platforms with an entirely new AI-based experience now live in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Australia. And we're moving more of our customer service roles in-house with hundreds of new eBay service jobs hired over the last year, reducing our reliance on outsourced roles.
We continued to advertise our brands to drive awareness and consideration of eBay this quarter. While our brand campaign has been well-regarded externally, it's not yet materially moved the needle on consideration, which is key to driving new buyer acquisition. We'll be back in market with new advertising campaign this quarter while also activating multiple marketing channels in the second half of the year to drive traffic in buyer activity.
Finally, we're making good progress on building our managed payment service. We recently announced that Steve Fisher, our CTO, has moved roles and will now focus solely on delivering this critical initiative for us. Product development is well underway, and we expect to launch an internal beta next week. We've also identified the sellers who will be invited into the initial phase of our new payments experience this fall, and we're looking forward to sharing additional plans in this area with our sellers at eBay Open next week.
Looking at StubHub, Q2 saw strong NBA and NHL performance in the U.S. and continued strength internationally, offset by a softer event landscape in our 3 largest genres: concerts, theater and Major League Baseball. We expect StubHub to continue to face these landscape challenges in the second half of the year. And Classifieds delivered another quarter of strong growth, driven primarily by our platforms in Germany.
Before I close, I'd like to address the Supreme Court decision on Internet sales tax. In the recent South Dakota versus Wayfair ruling, the court left undecided some significant issues, such as what constitutes substantial nexus, requiring an out-of-state seller to collect sales tax. The court did make clear that state tax laws must provide protection for small sellers. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on our business in 2018. Beyond that, any impact will depend upon a number of factors that will take time to play out, including whether the federal government preempts the states or otherwise enacts legislation to protect small business as well as the effect on states that enact marketplace collection obligations. In the Supreme Court case, South Dakota set a small business exemption threshold of $100,000, which we believe is far too low for states that are more populous. However, hypothetically, if that threshold were applied to each individual state, approximately 80% of our GMV would be excluded from sales tax. 
You can expect us to continue to work with our community and Congress to urge lawmakers to provide clear tax rules with a strong small business exemption that will allow our sellers to continue to grow and flourish. Regardless of how it plays out, eBay sellers currently have the ability to collect applicable taxes on their eBay transactions, and we will have the capability to collect and remit sales tax on behalf of our sellers should that become a requirement.
In summary, we continue to make progress improving the eBay customer experience. While the first half of 2018 has brought some unanticipated challenges that I outlined earlier, we expect core acceleration in the second half while delivering very strong earnings growth. 
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financial results and on our outlook."

Let's begin with Q2 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q2, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $188 million of free cash flow, and we repurchased approximately $1 billion of ou",1679,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q2 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. 
In Q2, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $188 million of free cash flow, and we repurchased approximately $1 billion of our stock. Finally, in the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Giosis' Qoo10 program -- platform, which expands eBay's footprint in Japan. 
Moving to active buyers. In the quarter, we increased our total active buyer base to 175 million, including 3 million buyers from our Japan acquisition. Our trailing 12-month growth was stable at 4%, including our new Japan buyers on a pro forma basis. Growth, excluding Japan, was 3%, down 1 point versus the prior quarter, due primarily to the lapping of new buyers from fidget spinners in the prior year. Scaling of new user experiences and our broader marketing programs will continue to be a key area of focus to drive more active buyer growth.
On Slide 6, in Q2, we enabled $23.6 billion of total GMV, up 7%. The U.S. generated $9.3 billion of GMV, up 5%, while international delivered $14.4 billion of GMV, up 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated total net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 6% on an FX-neutral basis and up 6% organically, both down 1 point versus the prior quarter. As Devin mentioned, we encountered unexpected headwinds from a weaker events landscape for StubHub and a stronger U.S. dollar, which more than offset revenue from our Japan acquisition. 
We delivered $2.1 billion of transaction revenue, up 7%, and $563 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 5%.
Turning to our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. GMV grew 7% in Q2, flat versus the prior quarter, including approximately 60 basis points, driven by the Japan acquisition. U.S. GMV grew 6%, decelerating 1 point quarter-over-quarter due to lapping C2C growth in the prior year and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on exports. International GMV accelerated 1 point to 7%, driven by the addition of Japan. 
Total Marketplace's revenue was $2.1 billion, up 6%. Transaction revenue grew 7%, with promoted listings contributing roughly a point of growth. Transaction take rate is slightly lower year-over-year due to hedging activity recognized in net revenues and some mix pressure from growth of lower take rate categories, offset by reduced seller incentives and strong promoted listings growth. 
Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 2%, a deceleration of 2 points versus the prior quarter as we continue to reduce nonstrategic third-party ad placements in favor of promoted listings.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 5% year-over-year, decelerating 8 points from Q1, while revenue grew 3%, decelerating 6 points, reflecting a softer event landscape.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q2, Classifieds grew revenue 10%, flat versus Q1. We continue to see strong performance from Germany and our motors platform, while managing advertising monetization pressure from the ongoing shift to mobile.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q2, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2%, which is down 120 basis points versus last year, driven by increased investments in payments, marketing and Japan. As a reminder, our operating margin now includes the impact of buyer incentives and marketing expense due to the revenue accounting standard 606 adopted this year. 
Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year by 50 basis points, helped by efficiencies in our customer service organization. Q2 sales and marketing expense was up 170 basis points, driven by promotional spending on our Marketplace platform, StubHub and the addition of our Japan acquisition. Product development costs were up 30 basis points as we continue to invest in our product experiences across all of our platforms, including building out managed payments. G&A was down year-over-year through operating leverage.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q2, we delivered $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, up 17% versus prior year. EPS growth was driven by volume growth, the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by our investments in managed payments, marketing and Japan. 
As we stated at the beginning of the year, our guidance range for tax was slightly wider than normal, driven by uncertainty on how all elements of U.S. tax reform would impact us. In Q2, we initiated actions to mitigate some of these elements and therefore, refined our estimates, providing a net benefit to the quarter of $0.03 as well as a benefit to our go-forward tax rate. 
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up $0.61 versus the prior year, driven by the lapping of last year's noncash income tax charge of $311 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of a deferred tax asset and 3 discrete items in this quarter. Let me give color on each of these.
First, we took a disciplined look across our cost base and took action to create capacity to invest more marketing in the second half while delivering on earnings growth. The reduction was completed in the second quarter resulting in a pretax restructuring charge of $84 million. Second, as part of our acquisition in Japan, we relinquished our investment in Giosis' non-Japanese businesses, recording a one-time gain of $266 million. Finally, we recognized a gain associated with the warrant agreement entered into with a service provider.
As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
Moving to Slide 13. In Q2, we generated $188 million of free cash flow, which is down 64% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by timing differences of cash tax payments related to both U.S. tax reform and other international tax payments. CapEx was 7% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and non-equity investments of $8.6 billion. Our capital allocation strategy is designed to manage the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility for organic opportunities and M&A balanced against capital return to drive long-term shareholder value. In May, we completed the acquisition of Giosis' Qoo10 platform in exchange for $306 million in cash and the previously mentioned relinquishment of our investment in Giosis' non-Japanese business. We also announced the intention to sell our holdings in Flipkart and expect gross proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approval. 
During Q2, as part of our ongoing commitment to provide meaningful returns for our shareholders, we repurchased $989 million of our stock. Since separation, we have repurchased 281 million shares or approximately 23% of shares outstanding at an average price of $31.40 a share, amounting to $8.8 billion in total. We ended the quarter with $5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
Before walking through guidance on Slide 15, let me provide a little more context on how the stronger U.S. dollar will impact our full year results. As you know, we have a global business, with nearly 60% of our revenue from markets outside the U.S. The U.S. dollar has strengthened versus our main international currencies by approximately 4% compared to what we guided in January. At current exchange rates, revenue is negatively impacted by approximately $150 million for the full year. Our earnings for the full year are largely protected from currency movements, but revenue will continue to be partially exposed if the dollar continues to strengthen. On an organic FX-neutral basis, the mid- to high end of our guidance assumes Marketplace's GMV acceleration will come from further scaling our new product experiences, including product-based commerce and Guaranteed Delivery while ensuring we invest more heavily in our marketing programs. For StubHub, while we do not guide by platform, we are not currently assuming any improvement in the trajectory of the market in the second half, and we will also be lapping a particularly robust Q4 in the prior year.
We are now projecting 2018 revenue between $10.75 billion and $10.85 billion, growing 6% to 7% on an organic FX-neutral basis and 8% to 9% on an as-reported basis. We expect operating margin at the mid- to a low end of the 27% to 29% range for the year, driven primarily by our Japan acquisition. We now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 20%. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $3.5 billion per year over 2018 and 2019. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $2.28 to $2.32, up 14% to 16% as reported versus last year. This includes the impact of top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program and a lower tax rate, partially offset by our investments in managed payments in Japan. We expect free cash flow towards the lower end of the $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion range, driven by our Japan acquisition and foreign exchange while the underlying cash flow dynamics of the company have not changed. This also includes to assume capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
Full year GAAP EPS is projected to be $1.91 to $2.01 per share. Any gain from the sale of our holdings in Flipkart is currently not factored into our GAAP guidance.
Turning to Q3 guidance on Slide 16. We are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.69 billion, growing 5% to 7% on an organic FX-neutral basis and 6% to 8% on an as-reported basis. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.54 to $0.56 per share, representing 14% to 18% growth. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41. 
In summary, we continue to execute our strategy and remain focused on improving the core eBay experience. We have made adjustments that enable us to continue to deliver strong earnings growth while we scaled the new experiences and invest more in our marketing efforts. Looking ahead, we are on track for payments testing in the second half, which is a very significant opportunity to improve the customer experience and deliver significant economic benefit for our sellers and shareholders over time.

So there are really 2 significant drivers to the second half. The first is the product and customer experience, and the second is marketing. On the product, we have some significant product changes coming into the market, some of which are already in the market performing well which we're going to scale. So I mentioned Guaranteed Delivery, already out, scaling, performing well. Our new C2C selling flow, delivering meaningful consumer selling conversion, scaling, already out in the market. Structured data's tentacles are now touching every part of the company, and they're making a meaningful impact in many areas. The one area that we've still got to iterate is on the full product-based buyer experience, where, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing really good conversion from brand-new buyers who come to eBay, and we have some work to do on the existing base. So on the product side, we've been working, as you know, at this for quite a while. We've driven improved acceleration and better operating results over time, and we believe that, that will continue in the second half. At the same time, because we're seeing good performance of new buyers that come to eBay, we want to bring more of them. And to do that, we're going to continue to activate our marketing channels and market aggressively. We are responding to a competitive e-commerce landscape. We love our proposition. We think that when people come to eBay, that they see what a great proposition we have. So you can expect us to light up our brand in the second half further, you can expect us to be active in all marketing channels and to plus that up along with the new product releases. So all of that, obviously, helped us factor in to the guide on core acceleration. Scott can talk a little bit about the core GMV-to-revenue translation."

We do have, as I called out, some pretty good lapping with a very strong quarter in Q4 from StubHub, that given their current trajectory and the market landscape is a pressure versus last time we spoke as well."

Look, we're in a very competitive market and an e-commerce landscape that's equally -- that's really competitive. It's important for us to adapt our approach as we try to remain competitive and drive traffic and activity of our sellers' inventory. And so we are increasingly focused as we've talked about in making sure that we're driving engagement and usage of the platform, and whether that's from increasing share of wallet with our existing buyers or attracting new buyers. And so the promotional activity is intended to do both of those. And while we're on the topic, when you think about those incentives, there's a wide variety of different incentives that you've seen, both in the contra, in the form of seller couponing as well as buyer coupons, marketing expense, box boosters, et cetera. And we've been leveraging those promotions more heavily in recent times, and I think we've been pretty clear, and it's been showing up in marketing as a percentage of -- as revenue. And look, I think you should expect, and as implied in our guidance, that, that will continue, and certainly. The re-architecture of our cost base that we did in June was intended to enable that without having an impact to earnings. In terms of the actual EPS impact, what we're trying to architect on a GAAP -- non-GAAP basis is that there is no impact to revenue and there is no impact to non-GAAP EPS from the restructuring that we did. However, we've enabled a significant amount of marketing incremental to our original plans to buffer the second half."

In this case, because we had, at the top, particularly of the technology organization, a significant reorganization with Steve moving to payments, it gave us an opportunity several years into this journey to take a deep look and to say, okay, we need to plus these things up, and there were other areas that we just weren't getting a return on them.

I would highlight that there's actually a couple underlying dynamics that we've called out in the past and that continue and will continue to pressure in a rolling 12-month metric for the time being. First off, as we kind of talked about, there was fidget spinner dynamic that, in Q2 of last year, brought a lot of low ASP items that were a lot of new buyers as well, and we have not retained those new buyers to the extent that we have in the past. They were kind of one and done, if you will, buying those fidget spinners, and they were very low ASP items. So as we lap that, that certainly makes it feel like the underlying growth rate is decelerating when, in fact, it's more a one-off aspect of that. And that same thing is pressuring active buyers. But now, the other thing we talked about was we had been favoring higher ASP branded items in our search, and as that has -- then that has kind of offset some of the ASP pressure -- or sorry, some of the pressure that we got from the fidget spinners in the sold item number, pushing ASP up a bit, but really sold items down. So hopefully, that's clear. But that's the dynamic between those 2, both active buyers and sold items."

And we've experimented with all kinds of new mediums of human-to-computer interface, and we've experimented with just a lot of -- I think it's very healthy for us to constantly experiment and have a portfolio of projects that are both near and far. And on some of the far ones, we're continuing and some we're not. And again, I don't want to get into a laundry list of small projects, but the overall reduction of force was not very large and it reflects the fact that we stopped things that I think should have been stopped and that resource was not re-allocable. On the question about the second half, like part of it, I think, Heath, is things that it's not that they didn't deliver but they're taking longer than we probably would have hoped in January. So I look at where we have Guaranteed Delivery in C2C in the market and many of the tentacles of structured data, I'm really pleased with what they've done, but we have not been able to move them out as fast as originally I would've hoped, quite honestly. And in some ways, that gives me confidence that we will get benefit from it, we just need to move them out to -- and get more surface area. Another great example would be the brand. So on brand, I'm really happy that we are investing and we're sticking to investing in our brand. I think everybody that I've spoken to from our customers to our investors understands that we have an incredible brand, but one that can be easily misunderstood, and it's our job to close that perception gap. But brands take time, and we -- when I look at the underlying metrics, I think I said at last call or the one before, what I'm holding our brand spend accountable for is moving aided consideration, and we are beginning to see aided consideration move. It hasn't yet translated to our buyer growth number. I believe it will, but we've got to be persistent and run the company for the long-term and not shut it off because it didn't make an impact this quarter. So there's an example of things that I think are both, projects that we shut down our projects that we believe will swing through and deliver for us in the second half and beyond."

I got a lot of questions a year ago about why we weren't moving faster, and my answer was always because we don't -- we want to make it work for both new customers and existing customers. And many of the things we've done, I believe, have done that. But when we -- not everything is that easy. And when you have a very large habituated Marketplace and you're making substantial changes to the user experience, some of it takes time, and that time may be design challenges, its front-end product challenges. I think we're on to a really powerful product experience that both simplifies eBay, but equally doesn't mimic anyone else and it shows what we're great at, which is the spectrum of value, our incredible advantage in inventory and in prices for consumers without necessarily having, in commodity high-velocity items, having them wade through hundreds of thousands of individual listings. That's what we're trying to accomplish. You get a new buyer who is not habituated to a way of doing things and they love it. Existing buyers have -- take more time, and we have to thread the needle about not disrupting their experience, but also bringing about that trade off of simplicity but differentiation. And we see pockets of it, but it does take time. And overall, I feel very good about it, I feel like we're absolutely on the right path, and I feel confident that we're going to get the benefit out of that, in particular, that we're expecting. What -- the second part of the question was on -- oh, brand versus promo. You know what, the way I look at it is we spend an experiment in a variety of different ways to drive value in the Marketplace. For me, value means what it says. I've often also said you can buy growth, it's not that hard, there are plenty of companies out there that do it. We've always been disciplined in the way that we spend, and we're always experimenting. So yes, we do promos now. The market -- a couple of years ago, we added a strong deals program to the holiday. Why did we do that? We did it because consumers were demanding it. And what we found is if we do it the right way, we don't just get growth in that holiday quarter, we get the [ CLB ] benefit of those customers. I'd say we're experimenting right now with these promos. We're experimenting with generating activity, bringing new customers in and then seeing what happens. And it's kind of early to look at the cohort of customers that have come in through this promotional activity to know whether we'll get the value, but that's exactly why we're doing it so that we can measure it and make sure that we're not destroying value that we're adopting to the market, but also getting value out of every marketing dollar or promo dollar."

And as we said, right now, we don't see any particular reason to believe the landscape will get better in the second half, but to me, StubHub's underlying market position, business position has not changed."

But you tell me what's going to happen with the trade wars and I'll let you know. But so far, we're -- we've steered the business clear of anything that's happened to date. On India, so the first step will be when the Flipkart transaction closes. As you heard Scott say, we'll monetize our investment in Flipkart. Then the anticipation is that we'll come back in to the Indian market through both an import and an export strategy. We'll start with export, meaning Indian sellers selling on other marketplace platforms around the world. That was something that we turned over to Flipkart. We're going to get that back upon the closing of the transaction. So we'll light up the Indian seller base to sell across all of our major markets. And the second step will be the reintroduction of ebayindia.com. And I don't yet have any timing on that because we don't -- we're not exactly sure when the Flipkart transaction's going to close. But the idea would be to lead with exports and imports, to lead with -- India with differentiated import inventory, and from the moment the transaction closes, to have the export business up and running. That's our approach."

In Q2, we continue to execute our strategy, improving the core eBay experience, investing in service and clarifying our brand while pursuing significant opportunities in advertising and payments. Total GMV",1187,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. 
In Q2, we continue to execute our strategy, improving the core eBay experience, investing in service and clarifying our brand while pursuing significant opportunities in advertising and payments. 
Total GMV was up 7%, and revenue was up 6%, while active buyers grew 4%. With the addition of buyers from our recent acquisition in Japan, we now have 175 million active buyers. GMV in our Marketplace platform grew at 7% year-on-year, with U.S. Marketplace GMV growing at 6%, while international GMV grew 7%. Our StubHub platforms grew volume at 5%, and our Classifieds platforms grew revenue at 10%. Finally, we repurchased nearly 1 billion -- we returned nearly $1 billion to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we closed our acquisition in Japan. 
While we delivered strong earnings growth this quarter, we encountered some revenue headwinds from foreign exchange and a weaker StubHub event landscape, which will put pressure on our revenue for the second half. In addition, while core Marketplace GMV growth remains steady, we do not expect some of the key initiatives to deliver GMV acceleration until later in the year. None of this changes our strategy and approach, and we expect to deliver core GMV growth acceleration in the second half of 2018. We're focusing to an even greater extent on initiatives that will have the greatest impact on our customers and our business, including further scaling product-based commerce, Guaranteed Delivery and our new C2C selling flow, while launching a series of innovative new buyer experiences. At the same time, we're stopping work on less critical projects that are not moving the needle or are more speculative.
Now let me update you on some of the progress we made in Q2. We continue to build on our structured data efforts, including our new product-based commerce experience. We've added 12 product lines representing roughly 3% of GMV to a fully product-based experience, and we plan to expand this to more branded high-velocity products in the second half. Users that are new to eBay are responding well to product-based commerce with improved conversion. However, this has yet to translate to our existing active buyers, and we'll continue iterating on this experience until we see those conversion gains across most of our base. We continue to scale Guaranteed Delivery in the U.S., and we recently launched in Australia. We exited Q2 with nearly 300,000 sellers and 80 million live listings in the program, both significant increases versus the prior quarter. 
In the quarter, Guaranteed Delivery purchases represented 5% of volume and -- with 95% order delivery accuracy. Within our broader advertising efforts, promoted listings continued its strong growth trajectory. We launched several enhancements in Q2, including a new item recommendation tool to guide sellers on which inventory they should promote. We now have over 300,000 sellers promoting over 150 million listings, leading to revenue growth in excess of 150%, offsetting declines in nonstrategic third-party advertising. We're also adding additional first-party services, recently launching Highline Search Ads, which enables sellers to bid for header placement from the top of search results. Finally, we're seeing minimal disruption to date from GDPR to our third-party advertising revenue in Europe.
Ensuring our users have access to great customer service is an important priority for us. We continue to scale our premium service offering, Concierge, to more top buyers and sellers. Customers with access to this offering show high satisfaction and are driving higher buyer and selling activity. We recently launched a program aimed at new buyers using proactive outreach whenever we see an issue with a first purchase. We're also simplifying and modernizing our self-service platforms with an entirely new AI-based experience now live in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Australia. And we're moving more of our customer service roles in-house, with hundreds of new eBay service jobs hired over the last year, reducing our reliance on outsourced roles.
We continued to advertise our brands to drive awareness and consideration of eBay this quarter. While our brand campaign has been well-regarded externally, it's not yet materially moved the needle on consideration, which is key to driving new buyer acquisition. We'll be back in market with a new advertising campaign this quarter while also activating multiple marketing channels in the second half of the year to drive traffic and buyer activity.
Finally, we're making good progress on building our managed payment service. We recently announced that Steve Fisher, our CTO, has moved roles and will now focus solely on delivering this critical initiative for us. Product development is well underway, and we expect to launch an internal beta next week. We've also identified the sellers who will be invited into the initial phase of our new payments experience this fall, and we're looking forward to sharing additional plans in this area with our sellers at eBay Open next week.
Looking at StubHub, Q2 saw strong NBA and NHL performance in the U.S. and continued strength internationally, offset by a softer event landscape in our 3 largest genres: Concerts, theater and Major League Baseball. We expect StubHub to continue to face these landscape challenges in the second half of the year. And Classifieds delivered another quarter of strong growth, driven primarily by our platforms in Germany.
Before I close, I'd like to address the Supreme Court decision on Internet sales tax. In the recent South Dakota v. Wayfair ruling, the court left undecided some significant issues, such as what constitutes substantial nexus requiring an out-of-state seller to collect sales tax. The court did make clear that state tax laws must provide protection for small sellers. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on our business in 2018. Beyond that, any impact will depend upon a number of factors that will take time to play out, including whether the federal government preempts the states or otherwise enacts legislation to protect small business, as well as the effect on states that enact marketplace collection obligations. In the Supreme Court case, South Dakota set a small business exemption threshold of $100,000, which we believe is far too low for states that are more populous. However, hypothetically, if that threshold were applied to each individual state, approximately 80% of our GMV would be excluded from sales tax. 
You can expect us to continue to work with our community and Congress to urge lawmakers to provide clear tax rules with a strong small business exemption that will allow our sellers to continue to grow and flourish. Regardless of how it plays out, eBay sellers currently have the ability to collect applicable taxes on their eBay transactions, and we will have the capability to collect and remit sales tax on behalf of our sellers, should that become a requirement.
In summary, we continue to make progress improving the eBay customer experience. While the first half of 2018 has brought some unanticipated challenges that I outlined earlier, we expect core acceleration in the second half while delivering very strong earnings growth. 
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financial results and on our outlook."

Moving to active buyers. In the quarter, we increased our total active buyer base to 175 million, including 3 million buyers from our Japan acquisition. Our trailing 12-month growth was stable at 4%, including our new Japan buyers on a pro forma basis. Growth, excluding Japan, was 3%, down 1 point versus the prior quarter, due primarily to the lapping of new buyers from fidget spinners in the prior year. Scaling of new user experiences and our broader marketing programs will continue to be a key area of focus to drive more active buyer growth.
On Slide 6, in Q2, we enabled $23.6 billion of total GMV, up 7%. The U.S. generated $9.3 billion of GMV, up 5%, while international delivered $14.4 billion of GMV, up 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated total net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 6% on an FX-neutral basis and up 6% organically, both down 1 point versus the prior quarter. As Devin mentioned, we encountered unexpected headwinds from a weaker events landscape for StubHub and a stronger U.S. dollar, which more than offset revenue from our Japan acquisition. 
We delivered $2.1 billion of transaction revenue, up 7%, and $563 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 5%.
Turning to our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. GMV grew 7% in Q2, flat versus the prior quarter, including approximately 60 basis points driven by the Japan acquisition. U.S. GMV grew 6%, decelerating 1 point quarter-over-quarter due to lapping C2C growth in the prior year and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on exports. International GMV accelerated 1 point to 7%, driven by the addition of Japan. 
Total Marketplaces revenue was $2.1 billion, up 6%. Transaction revenue grew 7%, with promoted listings contributing roughly a point of growth. Transaction take rate is slightly lower year-over-year due to hedging activity recognized in net revenues and some mix pressure from growth of lower take rate categories, offset by reduced seller incentives and strong promoted listings growth. 
Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 2%, a deceleration of 2 points versus the prior quarter as we continue to reduce nonstrategic third-party ad placements in favor of promoted listings.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 5% year-over-year, decelerating 8 points from Q1, while revenue grew 3%, decelerating 6 points, reflecting a softer event landscape.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q2, Classifieds grew revenue 10%, flat versus Q1. We continue to see strong performance from Germany and our Motors platform, while managing advertising monetization pressure from the ongoing shift to mobile.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q2, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2%, which is down 120 basis points versus last year, driven by increased investments in payments, marketing and Japan. As a reminder, our operating margin now includes the impact of buyer incentives and marketing expense, due to the revenue accounting standard 606 adopted this year. 
Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year by 50 basis points, helped by efficiencies in our customer service organization. Q2 sales and marketing expense was up 170 basis points, driven by promotional spending on our Marketplace platform, StubHub and the addition of our Japan acquisition. Product development costs were up 30 basis points as we continue to invest in our product experiences across all of our platforms, including building out managed payments. G&A was down year-over-year through operating leverage.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q2, we delivered $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, up 17% versus prior year. EPS growth was driven by volume growth, the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by our investments in managed payments, marketing and Japan. 
As we stated at the beginning of the year, our guidance range for tax was slightly wider than normal, driven by uncertainty on how all elements of U.S. tax reform would impact us. In Q2, we initiated actions to mitigate some of these elements and therefore, refined our estimates, providing a net benefit to the quarter of $0.03 as well as a benefit to our go-forward tax rate. 
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up $0.61 versus the prior year, driven by the lapping of last year's noncash income tax charge of $311 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of a deferred tax asset and 3 discrete items in this quarter. Let me give color on each of these.
First, we took a disciplined look across our cost base and took action to create capacity to invest more marketing in the second half while delivering on earnings growth. The reduction was completed in the second quarter resulting in a pretax restructuring charge of $84 million. Second, as part of our acquisition in Japan, we relinquished our investment in Giosis' non-Japanese businesses, recording a one-time gain of $266 million. Finally, we recognized a gain associated with the warrant agreement entered into with a service provider.
As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
Moving to Slide 13. In Q2, we generated $188 million of free cash flow, which is down 64% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by timing differences of cash tax payments related to both U.S. tax reform and other international tax payments. CapEx was 7% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $8.6 billion. Our capital allocation strategy is designed to manage the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility for organic opportunities and M&A, balanced against capital return to drive long-term shareholder value. In May, we completed the acquisition of Giosis' Qoo10 platform in exchange for $306 million in cash and the previously mentioned relinquishment of our investment in Giosis' non-Japanese business. We also announced the intention to sell our holdings in Flipkart and expect gross proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approval. 
During Q2, as part of our ongoing commitment to provide meaningful returns for our shareholders, we repurchased $989 million of our stock. Since separation, we have repurchased 281 million shares or approximately 23% of shares outstanding at an average price of $31.40 a share, amounting to $8.8 billion in total. We ended the quarter with $5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
Before walking through guidance on Slide 15, let me provide a little more context on how the stronger U.S. dollar will impact our full year results. As you know, we have a global business, with nearly 60% of our revenue from markets outside the U.S. The U.S. dollar has strengthened versus our main international currencies by approximately 4% compared to when we guided in January. At current exchange rates, revenue is negatively impacted by approximately $150 million for the full year. Our earnings for the full year are largely protected from currency movements, but revenue will continue to be partially exposed if the dollar continues to strengthen. On an organic FX-neutral basis, the mid- to high end of our guidance assumes Marketplace's GMV acceleration will come from further scaling our new product experiences, including product-based commerce and Guaranteed Delivery, while ensuring we invest more heavily in our marketing programs. For StubHub, while we do not guide by platform, we are not currently assuming any improvement in the trajectory of the market in the second half, and we will also be lapping a particularly robust Q4 in the prior year.
We are now projecting 2018 revenue between $10.75 billion and $10.85 billion, growing 6% to 7% on an organic FX-neutral basis and 8% to 9% on an as-reported basis. We expect operating margin at the mid- to the low end of the 27% to 29% range for the year, driven primarily by our Japan acquisition. We now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 20%. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $3.5 billion per year over 2018 and 2019. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $2.28 to $2.32 per share, up 14% to 16% as reported versus last year. This includes the impact of top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program and a lower tax rate, partially offset by our investments in managed payments and Japan. We expect free cash flow towards the lower end of the $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion range, driven by our Japan acquisition and foreign exchange, while the underlying cash flow dynamics of the company have not changed. This also includes -- to assume capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
Full year GAAP EPS is projected to be $1.91 to $2.01 per share. Any gain from the sale of our holdings in Flipkart is currently not factored into our GAAP guidance.
Turning to Q3 guidance on Slide 16. We are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.69 billion, growing 5% to 7% on an organic FX-neutral basis and 6% to 8% on an as-reported basis. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.54 to $0.56 per share, representing 14% to 18% growth. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41. 
In summary, we continue to execute our strategy and remain focused on improving the core eBay experience. We have made adjustments that enable us to continue to deliver strong earnings growth while we scale the new experiences and invest more in our marketing efforts. Looking ahead, we are on track for payments testing in the second half, which is a very significant opportunity to improve the customer experience and deliver significant economic benefit for our sellers and shareholders over time.

So there are really 2 significant drivers to the second half. The first is the product and customer experience, and the second is marketing. On the product, we have some significant product changes coming into the market, some of which are already in the market performing well which we're going to scale. So I mentioned Guaranteed Delivery, already out, scaling, performing well. Our new C2C selling flow, delivering meaningful consumer selling conversion, scaling, already out in the market. Structured data's tentacles are now touching every part of the company, and they're making a meaningful impact in many areas. The one area that we've still got to iterate is on the full product-based buyer experience, where, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing really good conversion from brand-new buyers who come to eBay, and we have some work to do on the existing base. So on the product side, we've been working, as you know, at this for quite a while. We've driven improved acceleration and better operating results over time, and we believe that, that will continue in the second half. At the same time, because we're seeing good performance of new buyers that come to eBay, we want to bring more of them. And to do that, we're going to continue to activate our marketing channels and market aggressively. We are responding to a competitive e-commerce landscape. We love our proposition. We think that when people come to eBay, that they see what a great proposition we have. So you can expect us to light up our brand in the second half further, you can expect us to be active in all marketing channels and to plus that up along with the new product releases. So all of that, obviously, helped us factor in to the guide on core acceleration. Scott can talk a little bit about the core GMV-to-revenue translation."

And in the new guide, essentially, what we're saying is at the high end, we'd have 1 point of acceleration in the second half of the year and stable in the first half. And that would translate through in the form of revenue much, much the same way. I wouldn't highlight any differences between GMV and revenue from the Marketplaces standpoint. We do have, as I called out, some pretty good lapping with a very strong quarter in Q4 from StubHub, that given their current trajectory and the market landscape, is a pressure versus the last time we spoke as well."

First off, on the marketing, yes, I'd say we spent more, and I think the additional sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue highlighted that. Look, we're in a very competitive market and an e-commerce landscape that's equally -- that's really competitive. It's important for us to adapt our approach as we try to remain competitive and drive traffic and activity or our sellers' inventory. And so we are increasingly focused, as we've talked about, in making sure that we're driving engagement and usage of the platform, and whether that's from increasing share of wallet with our existing buyers or attracting new buyers. And so the promotional activity is intended to do both of those. And while we're on the topic, when you think about those incentives, there's a wide variety of different incentives that you've seen, both in the contra, in the form of seller couponing as well as buyer coupons, marketing expense, Bucks boosters, et cetera. And we've been leveraging those promotions more heavily in recent times, and I think we've been pretty clear, and it's been showing up in marketing as a percentage of -- as revenue. And look, I think you should expect, and as implied there in our guidance, that, that will continue, and certainly, the re-architecture of our cost base that we did in June was intended to enable that without having an impact to earnings. In terms of the actual EPS impact, what we're trying to architect on a GAAP -- non-GAAP basis is that there is no impact to revenue and there is no impact to non-GAAP EPS from the restructuring that we did. However, we've enabled a significant amount of marketing incremental to our original plans to buffer the second half."

We do that always. In this case, because we had, at the top, particularly of the technology organization, a significant reorganization with Steve moving to payments, it gave us an opportunity several years into this journey to take a deep look and to say, okay, we need to plus these things up, and there were other areas that we just weren't getting a return on them.

I would highlight that there's actually a couple underlying dynamics that we've called out in the past and that continue and will continue to pressure in a rolling 12-month metric for the time being. First off, as we kind of talked about, there was a fidget spinner dynamic, that in Q2 of last year, brought a lot of low ASP items that were a lot of new buyers as well, and we have not retained those new buyers to the extent that we have in the past. They were kind of one and done, if you will, buying those fidget spinners, and they were very low ASP items. So as we lap that, that certainly makes it feel like the underlying growth rate is decelerating, when in fact, it's more a one-off aspect of that. And that same thing is pressuring active buyers. But now, the other thing we talked about was we had been favoring higher ASP branded items in our search, and as that has -- then that has kind of offset some of the ASP pressure -- or sorry, some of the pressure that we got from the fidget spinners in the sold item number, pushing ASP up a bit, but really, sold items down. So hopefully, that's clear. But that's the dynamic between those 2, both active buyers and sold items."

And we've experimented with all kinds of new mediums of human-to-computer interface, and we've experimented with just a lot of -- I think it's very healthy for us to constantly experiment and have a portfolio of projects that are both near and far. And on some of the far ones, we're continuing and some we're not. And again, I don't want to get into a laundry list of small projects, but the overall reduction of force was not very large and it reflects the fact that we stopped things that I think should have been stopped and that resource was not re-allocable. On the question about the second half, like part of it, I think, Heath, is things that it's not that they didn't deliver but they're taking longer than we probably would have hoped in January. So I look at where we have Guaranteed Delivery in C2C in the market and many of the tentacles of structured data, I'm really pleased with what they've done, but we have not been able to move them out as fast as I originally would've hoped, quite honestly. And in some ways, that gives me confidence that we will get benefit from it, we just need to move them out to -- and get more surface area. Another great example would be the brand. So on brand, I'm really happy that we are investing and we're sticking to investing in our brand. I think everybody that I've spoken to from our customers to our investors understands that we have an incredible brand, but one that can be easily misunderstood, and it's our job to close that perception gap. But brands take time, and we -- when I look at the underlying metrics, I said, I think, last call or the one before, what I'm holding our brand spend accountable for is moving aided consideration. And we are beginning to see aided consideration move. It hasn't yet translated to our buyer growth number. I believe it will, but we've got to be persistent and run the company for the long-term and not shut it off because it didn't make an impact this quarter. So there's an example of things that I think are both, projects that we shut down, or projects that we believe will swing through and deliver for us in the second half and beyond."

I got a lot of questions a year ago about why we weren't moving faster, and my answer was always because we don't -- we want to make it work for both new customers and existing customers. And many of the things we've done, I believe, have done that. But when we -- not everything is that easy. And when you have a very large, habituated Marketplace and you're making substantial changes to the user experience, some of it takes time, and that time may be design challenges, its front-end product challenges. I think we're on to a really powerful product experience that both simplifies eBay, but equally doesn't mimic anyone else and it shows what we're great at, which is the spectrum of value, our incredible advantage in inventory and in prices for consumers, without necessarily having, in commodity, high-velocity items, having them wade through hundreds of thousands of individual listings. That's what we're trying to accomplish. You get a new buyer who is not habituated to a way of doing things and they love it. Existing buyers have -- take more time, and we have to thread the needle about not disrupting their experience, but also bringing about that trade-off of simplicity but differentiation. And we see pockets of it, but it does take time. And overall, I feel very good about it, I feel like we're absolutely on the right path, and I feel confident that we're going to get the benefit out of it, that in particular, that we're expecting. What -- the second part of the question was on -- oh, brand versus promo. You know what, the way I look at it is we spend and experiment in a variety of different ways to drive value in the Marketplace. For me, value means what it says. I've often also said you can buy growth, it's not that hard, there are plenty of companies out there that do it. We've always been disciplined in the way that we spend, and we're always experimenting. So yes, we do promos now. The market -- a couple of years ago, we added a strong deals program for the holidays. Why did we do that? We did it because consumers were demanding it. And what we found is if we do it the right way, we don't just get growth in that holiday quarter, we get the CLV benefit of those customers. I'd say we're experimenting right now with these promos. We're experimenting with generating activity, bringing new customers in and then seeing what happens. And it's kind of early to look at the cohort of customers that have come in through this promotional activity to know whether we'll get the value, but that's exactly why we're doing it, so that we can measure it and make sure that we're not destroying value, that we're adopting to the market, but also getting value out of every marketing dollar or promo dollar."

On India, so the first step will be when the Flipkart transaction closes. As you heard Scott say, we'll monetize our investment in Flipkart. Then the anticipation is that we'll come back into the Indian market through both an import and an export strategy. We'll start with export, meaning Indian sellers selling on other marketplace platforms around the world. That was something that we turned over to Flipkart. We're going to get that back upon the closing of the transaction. So we'll light up the Indian seller base to sell across all of our major markets. And the second step will be the reintroduction of ebayindia.com. And I don't yet have any timing on that because we don't -- we're not exactly sure when the Flipkart transaction's going to close. But the idea would be to lead with exports and imports, to lead with India with differentiated import inventory, and from the moment the transaction closes, to have the export business up and running.

It's also got a partnership with flybuys, which is a big national loyalty network for purchasing credit outside our network, for things like groceries and gas and other things. In Germany, it's preferential access to deals and other benefits. So I -- right now, when I look at Australia that just introduced this, the uptake -- early, it's super early, but the uptake has well exceeded our expectations. We're very pleased with where that went, including this week, where you saw a lot of global retail activity. And we used the opportunity around Prime Day to market our propositions, and we saw a great uptake of eBay Plus in Australia around this week, which I'm really, really pleased with.

GMV in our Marketplace platform grew at 7% year-on-year, with U.S. Marketplace GMV growing at 6%, while international GMV grew 7%. Our StubHub platforms grew volume at 5%, and our Classifieds platforms grew revenue at 10%. Finally, we repurchased nearly 1 billion -- we returned nearly $1 billion to our shareholders through our share repurchase program, and we closed our acquisition in Japan. 
While we delivered strong earnings growth this quarter, we encountered some revenue headwinds from foreign exchange and a weaker StubHub event landscape, which will put pressure on our revenue for the second half. In addition, while core Marketplace GMV growth remains steady, we do not expect some of the key initiatives to deliver GMV acceleration until later in the year. None of this changes our strategy and approach, and we expect to deliver core GMV growth acceleration in the second half of 2018. We're focusing to an even greater extent on initiatives that will have the greatest impact on our customers and our business, including further scaling product-based commerce, Guaranteed Delivery and our new C2C selling flow, while launching a series of innovative new buyer experiences. At the same time, we're stopping work on less critical projects that are not moving the needle or are more speculative.
Now let me update you on some of the progress we made in Q2. We continue to build on our structured data efforts, including our new product-based commerce experience. We've added 12 product lines representing roughly 3% of GMV to a fully product-based experience, and we plan to expand this to more branded high-velocity products in the second half. Users that are new to eBay are responding well to product-based commerce with improved conversion. However, this has yet to translate to our existing active buyers, and we'll continue iterating on this experience until we see those conversion gains across most of our base. We continue to scale Guaranteed Delivery in the U.S., and we recently launched in Australia. We exited Q2 with nearly 300,000 sellers and 80 million live listings in the program, both significant increases versus the prior quarter. 
In the quarter, Guaranteed Delivery purchases represented 5% of volume and -- with 95% order delivery accuracy. Within our broader advertising efforts, promoted listings continued its strong growth trajectory. We launched several enhancements in Q2, including a new item recommendation tool to guide sellers on which inventory they should promote. We now have over 300,000 sellers promoting over 150 million listings, leading to revenue growth in excess of 150%, offsetting declines in nonstrategic third-party advertising. We're also adding additional first-party services, recently launching Highline Search Ads, which enables sellers to bid for header placement from the top of search results. Finally, we're seeing minimal disruption to date from GDPR to our third-party advertising revenue in Europe.
Ensuring our users have access to great customer service is an important priority for us. We continue to scale our premium service offering, Concierge, to more top buyers and sellers. Customers with access to this offering show high satisfaction and are driving higher buyer and selling activity. We recently launched a program aimed at new buyers using proactive outreach whenever we see an issue with a first purchase. We're also simplifying and modernizing our self-service platforms with an entirely new AI-based experience now live in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Australia. And we're moving more of our customer service roles in-house, with hundreds of new eBay service jobs hired over the last year, reducing our reliance on outsourced roles.
We continued to advertise our brands to drive awareness and consideration of eBay this quarter. While our brand campaign has been well-regarded externally, it's not yet materially moved the needle on consideration, which is key to driving new buyer acquisition. We'll be back in market with a new advertising campaign this quarter while also activating multiple marketing channels in the second half of the year to drive traffic and buyer activity.
Finally, we're making good progress on building our managed payment service. We recently announced that Steve Fisher, our CTO, has moved roles and will now focus solely on delivering this critical initiative for us. Product development is well underway, and we expect to launch an internal beta next week. We've also identified the sellers who will be invited into the initial phase of our new payments experience this fall, and we're looking forward to sharing additional plans in this area with our sellers at eBay Open next week.
Looking at StubHub, Q2 saw strong NBA and NHL performance in the U.S. and continued strength internationally, offset by a softer event landscape in our 3 largest genres: Concerts, theater and Major League Baseball. We expect StubHub to continue to face these landscape challenges in the second half of the year. And Classifieds delivered another quarter of strong growth, driven primarily by our platforms in Germany.
Before I close, I'd like to address the Supreme Court decision on Internet sales tax. In the recent South Dakota v. Wayfair ruling, the court left undecided some significant issues, such as what constitutes substantial nexus requiring an out-of-state seller to collect sales tax. The court did make clear that state tax laws must provide protection for small sellers. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on our business in 2018. Beyond that, any impact will depend upon a number of factors that will take time to play out, including whether the federal government preempts the states or otherwise enacts legislation to protect small business, as well as the effect on states that enact marketplace collection obligations. In the Supreme Court case, South Dakota set a small business exemption threshold of $100,000, which we believe is far too low for states that are more populous. However, hypothetically, if that threshold were applied to each individual state, approximately 80% of our GMV would be excluded from sales tax. 
You can expect us to continue to work with our community and Congress to urge lawmakers to provide clear tax rules with a strong small business exemption that will allow our sellers to continue to grow and flourish. Regardless of how it plays out, eBay sellers currently have the ability to collect applicable taxes on their eBay transactions, and we will have the capability to collect and remit sales tax on behalf of our sellers, should that become a requirement.
In summary, we continue to make progress improving the eBay customer experience. While the first half of 2018 has brought some unanticipated challenges that I outlined earlier, we expect core acceleration in the second half while delivering very strong earnings growth. 
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financial results and on our outlook."
27862,572896512,1503652,"eBay Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 18, 2018",2018-07-18,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q2 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q2, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $188 million of free cash flow and we repurchased approximately $1 billion of our",1682,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q2 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. 
In Q2, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, $188 million of free cash flow and we repurchased approximately $1 billion of our stock. Finally, in the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Giosis' Qoo10 program -- platform, which expands eBay's footprint in Japan. 
Moving to active buyers. In the quarter, we increased our total active buyer base to 175 million, including 3 million buyers from our Japan acquisition. Our trailing 12-month growth was stable at 4%, including our new Japan buyers on a pro forma basis. Growth, excluding Japan, was 3%, down 1 point versus the prior quarter, due primarily to the lapping of new buyers from fidget spinners in the prior year. Scaling of new user experiences and our broader marketing programs will continue to be a key area of focus to drive more active buyer growth.
On Slide 6, in Q2, we enabled $23.6 billion of total GMV, up 7%. The U.S. generated $9.3 billion of GMV, up 5%, while international delivered $14.4 billion of GMV, up 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated total net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 6% on an FX-neutral basis and up 6% organically, both down 1 point versus the prior quarter. As Devin mentioned, we encountered unexpected headwinds from a weaker events landscape for StubHub and a stronger U.S. dollar, which more than offset revenue from our Japan acquisition. 
We delivered $2.1 billion of transaction revenue, up 7%, and $563 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 5%.
Turning to our Marketplace platform on Slide 8. GMV grew 7% in Q2, flat versus the prior quarter, including approximately 60 basis points driven by the Japan acquisition. U.S. GMV grew 6%, decelerating 1 point quarter-over-quarter due to lapping C2C growth in the prior year and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on exports. International GMV accelerated 1 point to 7%, driven by the addition of Japan. 
Total Marketplaces revenue was $2.1 billion, up 6%. Transaction revenue grew 7%, with promoted listings contributing roughly a point of growth. Transaction take rate is slightly lower year-over-year due to hedging activity recognized in net revenues and some mix pressure from growth of lower take rate categories, offset by reduced seller incentives and strong promoted listings growth. 
Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 2%, a deceleration of 2 points versus the prior quarter as we continue to reduce nonstrategic third-party ad placements in favor of promoted listings.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub GMV grew 5% year-over-year, decelerating 8 points from Q1, while revenue grew 3%, decelerating 6 points, reflecting a softer event landscape.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q2, Classifieds grew revenue 10%, flat versus Q1. We continue to see strong performance from Germany and our Motors platform, while managing advertising monetization pressure from the ongoing shift to mobile.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q2, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 25.2%, which is down 120 basis points versus last year, driven by increased investments in payments, marketing and Japan. As a reminder, our operating margin now includes the impact of buyer incentives and marketing expense, due to the revenue accounting standard 606 adopted this year. 
Cost of revenue decreased year-over-year by 50 basis points, helped by efficiencies in our customer service organization. Q2 sales and marketing expense was up 170 basis points, driven by promotional spending on our Marketplace platform, StubHub and the addition of our Japan acquisition. Product development costs were up 30 basis points as we continue to invest in our product experiences across all of our platforms, including building out managed payments. G&A was down year-over-year through operating leverage.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q2, we delivered $0.53 of non-GAAP EPS, up 17% versus prior year. EPS growth was driven by volume growth, the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by our investments in managed payments, marketing and Japan. 
As we stated at the beginning of the year, our guidance range for tax was slightly wider than normal, driven by uncertainty on how all elements of U.S. tax reform would impact us. In Q2, we initiated actions to mitigate some of these elements and therefore, refined our estimates, providing a net benefit to the quarter of $0.03 as well as a benefit to our go-forward tax rate. 
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up $0.61 versus the prior year, driven by the lapping of last year's noncash income tax charge of $311 million caused by the foreign exchange remeasurement of a deferred tax asset and 3 discrete items in this quarter. Let me give color on each of these.
First, we took a disciplined look across our cost base and took action to create capacity to invest more marketing in the second half while delivering on earnings growth. The reduction was completed in the second quarter resulting in a pretax restructuring charge of $84 million. Second, as part of our acquisition in Japan, we relinquished our investment in Giosis' non-Japanese businesses, recording a one-time gain of $266 million. Finally, we recognized a gain associated with the warrant agreement entered into with a service provider.
As always, you can find a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
Moving to Slide 13. In Q2, we generated $188 million of free cash flow, which is down 64% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by timing differences of cash tax payments related to both U.S. tax reform and other international tax payments. CapEx was 7% of revenue.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $8.6 billion. Our capital allocation strategy is designed to manage the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility for organic opportunities and M&A, balanced against capital return to drive long-term shareholder value. In May, we completed the acquisition of Giosis' Qoo10 platform in exchange for $306 million in cash and the previously mentioned relinquishment of our investment in Giosis' non-Japanese business. We also announced the intention to sell our holdings in Flipkart and expect gross proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory approval. 
During Q2, as part of our ongoing commitment to provide meaningful returns for our shareholders, we repurchased $989 million of our stock. Since separation, we have repurchased 281 million shares or approximately 23% of shares outstanding at an average price of $31.40 a share, amounting to $8.8 billion in total. We ended the quarter with $5.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.
Before walking through guidance on Slide 15, let me provide a little more context on how the stronger U.S. dollar will impact our full year results. As you know, we have a global business, with nearly 60% of our revenue from markets outside the U.S. The U.S. dollar has strengthened versus our main international currencies by approximately 4% compared to when we guided in January. At current exchange rates, revenue is negatively impacted by approximately $150 million for the full year. Our earnings for the full year are largely protected from currency movements, but revenue will continue to be partially exposed if the dollar continues to strengthen. On an organic FX-neutral basis, the mid- to high end of our guidance assumes Marketplace's GMV acceleration will come from further scaling our new product experiences, including product-based commerce and Guaranteed Delivery, while ensuring we invest more heavily in our marketing programs. For StubHub, while we do not guide by platform, we are not currently assuming any improvement in the trajectory of the market in the second half, and we will also be lapping a particularly robust Q4 in the prior year.
We are now projecting 2018 revenue between $10.75 billion and $10.85 billion, growing 6% to 7% on an organic FX-neutral basis and 8% to 9% on an as-reported basis. We expect operating margin at the mid- to the low end of the 27% to 29% range for the year, driven primarily by our Japan acquisition. We now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 20%. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $3.5 billion per year over 2018 and 2019. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $2.28 to $2.32 per share, up 14% to 16% as reported versus last year. This includes the impact of top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program and a lower tax rate, partially offset by our investments in managed payments and Japan. We expect free cash flow towards the lower end of the $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion range, driven by our Japan acquisition and foreign exchange, while the underlying cash flow dynamics of the company have not changed. This also includes -- to assume capital expenditures in the range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
Full year GAAP EPS is projected to be $1.91 to $2.01 per share. Any gain from the sale of our holdings in Flipkart is currently not factored into our GAAP guidance.
Turning to Q3 guidance on Slide 16. We are projecting revenue between $2.64 billion and $2.69 billion, growing 5% to 7% on an organic FX-neutral basis and 6% to 8% on an as-reported basis. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.54 to $0.56 per share, representing 14% to 18% growth. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41. 
In summary, we continue to execute our strategy and remain focused on improving the core eBay experience. We have made adjustments that enable us to continue to deliver strong earnings growth while we scale the new experiences and invest more in our marketing efforts. Looking ahead, we are on track for payments testing in the second half, which is a very significant opportunity to improve the customer experience and deliver significant economic benefit for our sellers and shareholders over time.

So there are really 2 significant drivers to the second half. The first is the product and customer experience, and the second is marketing. On the product, we have some significant product changes coming into the market, some of which are already in the market performing well which we're going to scale. So I mentioned Guaranteed Delivery, already out, scaling, performing well. Our new C2C selling flow, delivering meaningful consumer selling conversion, scaling, already out in the market. Structured data's tentacles are now touching every part of the company, and they're making a meaningful impact in many areas. The one area that we've still got to iterate is on the full product-based buyer experience, where, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing really good conversion from brand-new buyers who come to eBay, and we have some work to do on the existing base. So on the product side, we've been working, as you know, at this for quite a while. We've driven improved acceleration and better operating results over time, and we believe that, that will continue in the second half. At the same time, because we're seeing good performance of new buyers that come to eBay, we want to bring more of them. And to do that, we're going to continue to activate our marketing channels and market aggressively. We are responding to a competitive e-commerce landscape. We love our proposition. We think that when people come to eBay, that they see what a great proposition we have. So you can expect us to light up our brand in the second half further, you can expect us to be active in all marketing channels and to plus that up along with the new product releases. So all of that, obviously, helped us factor in to the guide on core acceleration. Scott can talk a little bit about the core GMV-to-revenue translation."

And that would translate through in the form of revenue much, much the same way. I wouldn't highlight any differences between GMV and revenue from the Marketplaces standpoint. We do have, as I called out, some pretty good lapping with a very strong quarter in Q4 from StubHub, that given their current trajectory and the market landscape, is a pressure versus the last time we spoke as well."

First off, on the marketing, yes, I'd say we spent more, and I think the additional sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue highlighted that. Look, we're in a very competitive market and an e-commerce landscape that's equally -- that's really competitive. It's important for us to adapt our approach as we try to remain competitive and drive traffic and activity or our sellers' inventory. And so we are increasingly focused, as we've talked about, in making sure that we're driving engagement and usage of the platform, and whether that's from increasing share of wallet with our existing buyers or attracting new buyers. And so the promotional activity is intended to do both of those. And while we're on the topic, when you think about those incentives, there's a wide variety of different incentives that you've seen, both in the contra, in the form of seller couponing as well as buyer coupons, marketing expense, Bucks boosters, et cetera. And we've been leveraging those promotions more heavily in recent times, and I think we've been pretty clear, and it's been showing up in marketing as a percentage of -- as revenue. And look, I think you should expect, and as implied there in our guidance, that, that will continue, and certainly, the re-architecture of our cost base that we did in June was intended to enable that without having an impact to earnings. In terms of the actual EPS impact, what we're trying to architect on a GAAP -- non-GAAP basis is that there is no impact to revenue and there is no impact to non-GAAP EPS from the restructuring that we did. However, we've enabled a significant amount of marketing incremental to our original plans to buffer the second half."

I would highlight that there's actually a couple underlying dynamics that we've called out in the past and that continue and will continue to pressure in a rolling 12-month metric for the time being. First off, as we kind of talked about, there was a fidget spinner dynamic, that in Q2 of last year, brought a lot of low ASP items that were a lot of new buyers as well, and we have not retained those new buyers to the extent that we have in the past. They were kind of one and done, if you will, buying those fidget spinners, and they were very low ASP items. So as we lap that, that certainly makes it feel like the underlying growth rate is decelerating, when in fact, it's more a one-off aspect of that. And that same thing is pressuring active buyers. But now, the other thing we talked about was we had been favoring higher ASP branded items in our search, and as that has -- then that has kind of offset some of the ASP pressure -- or sorry, some of the pressure that we got from the fidget spinners in the sold item number, pushing ASP up a bit, but really, sold items down. So hopefully, that's clear. But that's the dynamic between those 2, both active buyers and sold items."

On the question about the second half, like part of it, I think, Heath, is things that it's not that they didn't deliver but they're taking longer than we probably would have hoped in January. So I look at where we have Guaranteed Delivery in C2C in the market and many of the tentacles of structured data, I'm really pleased with what they've done, but we have not been able to move them out as fast as I originally would've hoped, quite honestly. And in some ways, that gives me confidence that we will get benefit from it, we just need to move them out to -- and get more surface area. Another great example would be the brand. So on brand, I'm really happy that we are investing and we're sticking to investing in our brand. I think everybody that I've spoken to from our customers to our investors understands that we have an incredible brand, but one that can be easily misunderstood, and it's our job to close that perception gap. But brands take time, and we -- when I look at the underlying metrics, I said, I think, last call or the one before, what I'm holding our brand spend accountable for is moving aided consideration. And we are beginning to see aided consideration move. It hasn't yet translated to our buyer growth number. I believe it will, but we've got to be persistent and run the company for the long-term and not shut it off because it didn't make an impact this quarter. So there's an example of things that I think are both, projects that we shut down, or projects that we believe will swing through and deliver for us in the second half and beyond."

That kind of hides some underlying strength in a few of our larger markets, offset by some weakness in some of our smaller markets. But in particular, I'd call out Australia, and the U.K. and some modest improvement in Germany, where we feel pretty good about the underlying performance.

I got a lot of questions a year ago about why we weren't moving faster, and my answer was always because we don't -- we want to make it work for both new customers and existing customers. And many of the things we've done, I believe, have done that. But when we -- not everything is that easy. And when you have a very large, habituated Marketplace and you're making substantial changes to the user experience, some of it takes time, and that time may be design challenges, its front-end product challenges. I think we're on to a really powerful product experience that both simplifies eBay, but equally doesn't mimic anyone else and it shows what we're great at, which is the spectrum of value, our incredible advantage in inventory and in prices for consumers, without necessarily having, in commodity, high-velocity items, having them wade through hundreds of thousands of individual listings. That's what we're trying to accomplish. You get a new buyer who is not habituated to a way of doing things and they love it. Existing buyers have -- take more time, and we have to thread the needle about not disrupting their experience, but also bringing about that trade-off of simplicity but differentiation. And we see pockets of it, but it does take time. And overall, I feel very good about it, I feel like we're absolutely on the right path, and I feel confident that we're going to get the benefit out of it, that in particular, that we're expecting. What -- the second part of the question was on -- oh, brand versus promo. You know what, the way I look at it is we spend and experiment in a variety of different ways to drive value in the Marketplace. For me, value means what it says. I've often also said you can buy growth, it's not that hard, there are plenty of companies out there that do it. We've always been disciplined in the way that we spend, and we're always experimenting. So yes, we do promos now. The market -- a couple of years ago, we added a strong deals program for the holidays. Why did we do that? We did it because consumers were demanding it. And what we found is if we do it the right way, we don't just get growth in that holiday quarter, we get the CLV benefit of those customers. I'd say we're experimenting right now with these promos. We're experimenting with generating activity, bringing new customers in and then seeing what happens. And it's kind of early to look at the cohort of customers that have come in through this promotional activity to know whether we'll get the value, but that's exactly why we're doing it, so that we can measure it and make sure that we're not destroying value, that we're adopting to the market, but also getting value out of every marketing dollar or promo dollar."

On India, so the first step will be when the Flipkart transaction closes. As you heard Scott say, we'll monetize our investment in Flipkart. Then the anticipation is that we'll come back into the Indian market through both an import and an export strategy. We'll start with export, meaning Indian sellers selling on other marketplace platforms around the world. That was something that we turned over to Flipkart. We're going to get that back upon the closing of the transaction. So we'll light up the Indian seller base to sell across all of our major markets. And the second step will be the reintroduction of ebayindia.com. And I don't yet have any timing on that because we don't -- we're not exactly sure when the Flipkart transaction's going to close. But the idea would be to lead with exports and imports, to lead with India with differentiated import inventory, and from the moment the transaction closes, to have the export business up and running.

Underlying these results, GMV on our Marketplace platform grew 5%. Our StubHub platform grew volume at 7%, and our Classified platform grew revenue at 11%. Scott will go into more detail on our financial results in his section. 
We continue to make foundational investments to improve the long-term health and competitiveness of our Marketplace this quarter, while setting the stage for significant growth opportunities in Payments and Advertising. 
New eBay users are responding well to the evolution of our platform. And as we mentioned last quarter, our existing buyer base has been slower to adapt to these changes. This has limited our ability to scale some new experiences. And as we plan coming into Q3, we made significant marketing investments this quarter, with a focus on buyer incentives and top-of-funnel activities such as our brand campaign. While some of these activities were successful and will scale, others did not deliver a sufficient return. These dynamics, coupled with the impact of a strong dollar on our U.S. export business, led to a 2-point deceleration in Marketplace volume growth this quarter. 
Setting eBay up for future growth requires us to continue to build a comprehensive catalog, further simplifying and improve the user experience and address customer imperatives such as trust and shipping. It also requires that we redefine perceptions of eBay's brand in business. Given that we have a large, stable and successful business but must also build for the future, we're shifting our tactics to balance the needs of the habituated base of customers who are used to shopping on eBay in a certain way, while pursuing an even larger base of potential customers who have different expectations. We'll continue to focus on delivering significant product experience changes for new customers while evolving the experience for our existing base of users at a more measured pace. 
Similarly, we'll continue to market our brand, but we plan to target our marketing to focus more heavily on acquiring new buyers while reducing our overall investment. We expect that this will result in slower growth for a period of time as we grow our user base and change the mix of customers. However, this will also allow us to deliver strong earnings growth over this period of time through operational margin expansion and ongoing aggressive capital return while positioning the business for stronger growth in 2020 as Payments and Advertising continued ramp. 
Let me now discuss some of the progress we're making to improve the eBay user experience.
Structured data powered services are delivering benefits in SCO, consumer selling flows, price recommendations and new shipping services. We've taken the next step in building our comprehensive catalog by enabling sellers to contribute product information to our catalog for the first time, which will improve accuracy and coverage over time. And we continue testing new iterations of product-based commerce to find a balanced experience that drives higher conversion for both our new and existing consumers. Ultimately achieving this balance is the key to enabling a scale rollout for the experience. One of our key initiatives is to improve the shipping experience on eBay, and that's Guaranteed Delivery. This experience continues to gain share in the U.S., exiting the quarter with 9% of U.S. volume, and we recently launched this service in Australia. We're also reducing friction across our platform, simplifying registration and checkout while allowing unregistered users to save searches and add items to watch list without the need for an account. And we continue to scale our new consumer list and flow which leverages our catalog to simplify the selling process, which is leading to improved conversion of sale.
Looking at marketing. We rolled out the latest iteration of our brand campaign this quarter. We plan to continue activation of our brand messages, which highlight eBay as a mainstream commerce destination across multiple channels throughout the holiday shopping period, but we will further target and segment marketing spend, driving efficiency in our overall investment. 
As we've discussed previously, Advertising and Payments are 2 significant opportunities in front of us. Our total Marketplace Advertising portfolio is expected to top $600 million this year. Within this, we expect Promoted Listings to represent approximately $180 million. The strong growth of Promoted Listings has enabled us to continue to reduce our reliance on nonstrategic third-party Advertising. In Q3, we began expanding Promoted Listing placements and we've seen positive results across the board. We now have over 400,000 sellers promoting over 160 million listings, leading to revenue growth of 120%. We have further aggressive expansion plans for this service, and we believe that our total Advertising portfolio has the potential to contribute $1 billion in annual revenue in the next few years.
Looking at Payments. We're a month into our multiyear managed Payment journey, and we are more excited than ever about this opportunity. Our new experience is live, and it's working well in the U.S. With an early product, we have over 3,000 sellers enabled -- and they have enabled 900,000 transactions and 38 million of GMV thus far, which represents an annual run rate of over $0.5 billion. From the buyer perspective, our guest checkout buyers who have historically indexed credit card payments are showing higher conversion, and Apple Pay already has a 12% share of addressable volume. As I've said previously, managing our payments flow will allow us to simplify the end-to-end experience for buyers and sellers. In particular, most sellers can expect reduced cost per payment processing, with a simplified selling process and access to more buyers who will have more payment choices. Sellers are already realizing significant savings and a simpler interface with 1 place to manage their eBay business. We're working to expand the program with more sellers driving more volume and realizing more savings as we ramp to 5% in the U.S. At the same time, we'll continue to improve the experience, implementing new features and functionality, including new payment methods such as PayPal.
Shifting focus to other platforms. StubHub delivered modest volume acceleration in Q3, driven primarily by strength in concerts, partially offset by a weaker NFL performance, and Classified growth accelerated as well with continued strength in our German platforms, Kleinanzeigen and Mobile. 
In summary, we will continue to make investments to improve the long-term health and competitiveness of our Marketplace. We are evolving our approach and plan to further target our product and marketing resources to address the needs of both new and existing users. At the same time, we will invest aggressively to deliver significant growth opportunities in Payments and in Advertising. While this will result in a period of slower top line growth, we will grow operating income through margin expansion, and we'll continue to aggressively return capital to deliver strong earnings growth.
Let me now turn to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financial results and on our outlook."

Let's begin with Q3 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q3, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS and $381 million of free cash flow, while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock. Mo",1695,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q3 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q3, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS and $381 million of free cash flow, while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock. 
Moving to active buyers. In the quarter, we increased our total active buyer base to 177 million. Our trailing 12-month growth was 4%, stable versus the prior quarter, driving 2 million incremental active buyers. 
On Slide 6, in Q3, we enabled $22.7 billion of total GMV, up 5%, decelerating 2 points versus the prior quarter. By geography, the U.S. generated $9 billion of GMV, up 3%, while international delivered $13.7 billion of GMV, up 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated total net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 6% on an FX-neutral basis and up 5% organically. We delivered $2.1 billion of transaction revenue, up 5%, and $560 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 7%.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Marketplace's platform grew GMV by 5% in Q3, a 2-point deceleration versus the prior quarter. U.S. GMV grew 2%, decelerating 4 points quarter-over-quarter. While we anticipated some export headwinds coming into the quarter based on U.S. dollars strength, our product and marketing efforts did not scale to the extent we expected to offset this pressure. Underlying these GMV dynamics, volume brought by U.S. buyers, or GMV, grew 5% in Q3, a 1-point deceleration versus Q2, and while not to our aspirations, it decelerated more modestly than GMV. International GMV was stable at 7% with a full quarter from our Japan acquisition offsetting modest deceleration in the U.K. and other small markets. Total Marketplace's revenue was $2.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Transaction revenue grew 5%, in line with GMV, with Promoted Listings growing 120% and contributing over 1 point of growth to transaction revenue. Transaction take rate is slightly higher year-over-year due to the favorable impact of hedging activity and strong Promoted Listings growth, offset by geographic and category mix dynamics. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 3%, an acceleration of 1 point versus the prior quarter.
Moving to Slide 9, total GMV for StubHub grew 7%, accelerating 2 points from Q2, while revenue grew 7%.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q3, Classifieds grew revenue 11%, a 1-point acceleration versus Q2. 
On major cost drivers, in Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 26.4%, down 2 points versus the prior year, net of approximately 1 point of foreign exchange favorability. Cost of revenue increased nearly 1 point year-over-year, driven primarily by our first-party inventory program in Korea.
Q3 sales and marketing expense was up over 3 points, driven by marketing and promotional spending on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms and the addition of our Japan acquisition. Product development cost were down 1 point due to increased productivity across our product initiatives even as we redeploy into strategic opportunities such as managed payments and first-party advertising. G&A was down nearly 1 point through operating leverage, our fourth consecutive quarter of G&A productivity.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q3, we delivered $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS, up 19% versus prior year. EPS growth was driven by volume growth, and the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by our investments in managed payments, marketing and Japan. Our non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected due to the benefit of discrete items. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.73, up $0.25 versus last year. This includes a $313 million gain on the sale of our Flipkart stake and $126 million gain recognized due to the change in the fair value of a warrant agreement. Stock-based compensation for the quarter, including related taxes, was $127 million, up 7% as we continue to utilize equity programs to compete for talent in a highly competitive environment. While our non-GAAP financial results excludes stock-based compensation, we take considered approach to granting stock and per our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to offsetting this dilution via stock repurchases. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q3, we generated $381 million of free cash flow, which was down 47% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by a Flipkart cash tax payment and the timing of working capital flows pushing into Q4. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q3, and we now expect to be in the range of 6% to 7% of revenue for the year.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $9 billion, which includes the net -- Flipkart proceeds of nearly $1 billion. During Q3, as part of our ongoing commitment to capital return, we repurchased $1 billion of our stock. We ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, and you can expect us to continue to be aggressive buyers of our own stock.
Turning to our Q4 guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting revenue between $2.85 billion and $2.89 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth of 4% to 5%. Implied in our guidance is continued pressure on Marketplace volume growth, driven by ongoing export pressure from the stronger dollar and similar dynamics with our product and marketing efforts. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 to $0.69 per share, representing growth of 14% to 18% on an as-reported basis. EPS growth will be driven by top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program, foreign exchange and a lower tax rate, partially offset by our investments in managed payments in Japan. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.87 to $0.92 per share. This includes a $389 million benefit resulting from an adjustment to the deferred income taxes effects of the U.S. tax reform, reducing the provisional amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.
For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $10.72 billion to $10.76 billion, representing organic FX-neutral revenue growth of approximately 6%. We expect operating margin in the range [ of ] 27% to 28%, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.29 to $2.31 per share.
We now expect free cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. This is lower than our previous guidance due primarily to the Flipkart cash tax payment. While our free cash flow in 2018 has been negatively impacted by a number of cash tax payments related to the effects of U.S. tax reform and the Flipkart sale, the underlying cash flow dynamics of the company have not changed. And we are updating our full year GAAP EPS guidance to $2.62 to $2.67 per share.
Given our recent performance and the shift in our approach that Devin referenced in his remarks, we thought it would be helpful to give some initial context on our expectations for 2019. First, we will exit this year having delivered approximately 6% FX-neutral organic revenue growth, which is 1 point below the low end of our original guidance range of 7% to 9%. That said, we still expect to deliver between $2.29 to $2.31 per share of non-GAAP EPS, which is at or above the upper end of our original EPS guidance range of $2.25 to $2.30 per share. As we look forward to 2019, we believe it is prudent to manage our product and marketing costs to better aligns our growth profile. At the same time, we have 2 significant growth opportunities in Advertising and Payments that require ongoing investment. In Advertising, we will continue to drive significant growth in Promoted Listings, providing our sellers with new tools to drive growth while increasing adoption, coverage and monetization. We expect Promoted Listings to double in 2019, which will benefit Marketplace transaction revenue growth by more than 1 point, while seeing more modest declines in our nonstrategic third-party Advertising. As Devin mentioned, we believe our overall ad portfolio could easily generate $1 billion of revenue a few years from now.
With Payments, as we highlighted earlier, we are seeing good traction in our first test market. Prices for participating sellers are lower, and we have leveraged our scale to negotiate beneficial pricing on processing costs. Based on our early results, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on an annual revenue opportunity of over $2 billion with incremental operating profit of approximately $0.5 billion once the majority of the volume on our core Marketplace platform has transitioned.
Looking at buyer payment preferences. As expected, we have seen some friction from buyers who are accustomed to paying with PayPal, which was required on eBay for a number of years. However, we are seeing higher conversion with buyers who are more accustomed to paying with a credit card. As a frame of reference, eBay guest users who are offered all payment methods, including PayPal, choose to pay with a credit or debit card nearly 80% of the time. And at StubHub where buyers have similar choice of payment methods, we already see 90% using credit cards for the transactions. Additionally, buyers are excited about alternative payments like Apple Pay where we are already seeing strong adoption with more than 1 in 10 customers on the iPhone and iPad choosing Apple Pay. These data points reinforce our belief that buyers ultimately want payment choice for their e-commerce transactions. 
Finally, we've hit our product milestones so far and expect to invest approximately $0.05 of EPS in 2018.
With all of this as context, our preliminary 2019 expectations are to grow GMV in revenue in the low to mid single digits. With growth at these lower levels, we expect to drive margin expansion and solid operating income growth while making significant payments -- investments in payments in our Advertising capabilities. We will continue to return capital to shareholders at accelerated levels similar to this year, while deploying capital to grow the M&A. This should ultimately result in double-digit EPS growth in the low to midteens.
We will give more detailed 2019 guidance on our January earnings call as per our normal process. And now we'd be happy to answer questions."

I mean, that is, in essence, the opportunity, what you just said, which is, the last period of time we've been growing in triple digits. As we said, we expect to continue to grow in triple digits next year, and I think that there are opportunities on both the source and the demand side. So on the source side, we continue to see more and more sellers adopt this. We're opening it up to more placements, and we're opening it up to more opportunities for sellers to promote their listings. So as an example, for a long period of time, consumer sellers didn't have that opportunity, now they do, and business sellers are getting more chances in different parts of our product flows to promote at their optional. I'll remind you that the promoting a listing is not an option for a seller. It's not a requirement. On the other side, ultimately, we've moved to fixed placements within both search and merchandising and some wares in our view item page. But I think where it will ultimately move is that an algorithm will decide, there won't be fixed positions, there will ultimately be a unified way that we can monetize pixels in every screen, and there may be some flows where it doesn't make sense to have any Promoted Listings because of cannibalization, there may be other flows where they may all be promoted because that's the highest way that we can monetize on behalf of not only ourselves, but on behalf of our sellers. So there is a lot of runway. I mean, I really think we're in the first inning of this, and we're -- I want to also be clear, we're going to be very careful of the buyer experience. We don't think a good buyer experience is to have every pixel on every page promoted. We've done a lot of good work simplifying and clarifying relevance and personalization. We don't want Promoted Listings to undermine it, but we don't think that it will, and we think we have so much runway for buyers and sellers on this that it will be, as we said in the prepared remarks, Advertising and Payments are 2 big new businesses on top of the existing eBay business."

Now look, I think as context, remember last year, we held marketing flat as a percentage of revenue, while as we enter 2018, talked about leading into marketing throughout the year really on a number of different fronts. And to your question, some of these have worked out well and others haven't, and just let me try to break down a few. First off, as we entered the year and a little bit last year, we were spending on what we would call seller incentives or inventory incentives. And as we diagnosed the different cohorts and tranches of those customers and those transactions, what we've seen is that the COD and those are lower. And so the ROIs aren't as good over time. And so what you'll see as we head forward is less of that. Another aspect is the kind of middle of funnel,  if you will, driving more buyers to the ecosystem. And those are, candidly, there's not 1 ROI within that ecosystem. There's a number of different ways you can measure it and there's not 1 answer. Some lower-priced coupons for buyers have worked really well, some higher priced ones haven't worked as well, et cetera, but we continue to work on refining the ROIs the appropriate level of spend, making sure we're focused on both activity per buyer as well as new buyer acquisition. And finally, we shifted a fair amount of our spend to upper funnel, if you will. Brand, not just TV, but social and others. And obviously, that just takes longer. I'll let Devin weigh in on those aspects of it, but I think overall, we're still committed to a brand campaign, but the reality is, is it's going to take longer, and we expected that going into it. As related to that, to the outlook, what you can expect is that next year, we'll be getting leverage off of the 2018 base, reducing our marketing as a percentage of revenue and kind of deploying within those 3 buckets as I talked about.

So we need more of them. And I think part of that is messaging our brand. Brands are harder to measure than our lower funnel spend, as Scott said, but we're committed to it, we'll use all channels, and it will take time. This is 1 of the top 30 brands in the world. It's very well habituated so it does take time to change the perception of it, but we are committed to it. We will move it, and we will make sure that we invest appropriately and don't waste money while doing it."

Certain of our services have been well received across the board and others have been taking more time. An example of something that takes more time that is really going well with new customers but is taking more time is full product based commerce experience where we fully compress the product side. What we see is that, as you would expect, new customers who don't -- haven't shopped at eBay before come to it and they respond very well to that. Existing customers, some of them shop on eBay, they've been shopping at eBay for 20 years so it's a new experience and there's always some friction when you change an experience. I think some of it is time and habituation. Some of it is education. And as we said, our approach is going to change a little bit, which does slow things down a bit, and that is, we'll go fast with new customers and we'll go slower with the existing base. And over time, the mix will change. So we're still very confident in what we're doing, and we do believe that the existing base will evolve and it will come along. But we are very conscious that we don't want to screw up the existing ecosystem. We want -- we have a good, stable base of customers, a very successful business, and we don't want to disrupt that. So we'll be more aggressive with the new and we'll go a bit slower with the existing buyers and eventually will get them both there."

On payments, we're really happy with where we are. We have some product features and functions to roll out. As we said, PayPal will become a form of payment within managed payments at some point next year. We'll enter the second market at some point next year. But we're completely focused on customer benefits. We are completely focused on driving an integrated product experience at lower cost for sellers and payment choice for buyers, and that's exactly on our roadmap. And as I said, whatever we are, month, a little more than a month in, and this is going exactly as we would've hoped at this early stage. And what's really encouraging is that we're delivering real benefits to customers. You see it in the form of payment choices buyers are making. You see it in the savings and the feedback that we're getting from sellers. I'm really -- look, it's a long road but it's not that long. I'll remind you that the operating agreement with PayPal is up in June of 2020, and after that, we're free to do whatever we want, and we're racing as fast as we can to deliver customer benefits to get to that date. On EGD, we are investing in delivery, and we're seeing really good results with Guaranteed Delivery, and the share is going up. We're going to keep driving it up. I think the question is, do we need to invest more? I'm not sure right now. It's -- within the framework Scott discussed in '19, we will be making incremental investments in our delivery experience. The one thing I don't think we need to do is deploy large amounts of capital to build a warehouse strategy. I've never thought that. I don't believe that. And I think that we use data and we use the diversity of our inventory to close the gap. And just as 1 example, as we've said before, 2/3 of packages are delivered within 2 business days in the United States. That's pretty good, particularly given the breadth of our inventory. And we do that without a warehouse strategy. So we're going to keep driving hard to close delivery gaps. We're going to keep driving hard to give customers increased penetration free, more clarity on tracking and time, but we're on the right trajectory. Customers are responding well to that."

Let me start by saying this again. We are the only marketplace in the world that handles payments and checkout the way that we do because of the very unique relationship and history with PayPal. So I absolutely believe, aside from the direct economics, that we will have more buyers because there are many buyers in many jurisdictions where they have a preferred means of payment that we don't offer. And this unique situation of, in essence, of favoring/requiring PayPal for buyers, look, I think PayPal is a great company and there are a lot of customers who want to use PayPal and they will be able to. But there are -- we could give you dozens of examples of other payment choices that people want to make that we don't make available today, and we're going to as this rolls out. On the seller side, I don't want to minimize that as well. We need to reduce sellers costs. We need to deliver an integrated product experience. Every other Marketplace that you can mention, every other digital Marketplace, handles the way that they provide information to their sellers or their drivers or their home renters in 1 place. They say, here's your transactions and here's where the money went. Only in this eBay world do we say, here are your transactions and then go somewhere else to figure out where the money went. It really makes no sense, and that's the essence of what we're doing. We're going to bring it together for sellers. That means better economics for sellers and more competitiveness and ultimately a better checkout experience, not just on payment choice, but seamless checkout. I am very optimistic that when we get there to the other side and the majority of our transaction volume is through managed payments, we won't just pick up the direct economics of it, we'll also pick up a better experience and we'll see a direct impact on accelerating Marketplace dynamics."

On the seller base, I don't -- our business seller base continues to grow, and we're really happy with our inventory mix. We continue to grow the inventory on the Marketplace. If anything, this has been more of a demand side issue than a supply side issue over the last year. It's been a constraint on faster growth. There's been more demand side than supply side. I think the 1 caveat to that is something that we've talked about on prior calls, which is we continue to see good traction with brands, and we continue to evolve our brand experience so that brands have a comfortable place to sit within the eBay Marketplace. And by brands, I don't just mean direct from brands, but authorized resellers as well. So just recently, in the last couple of weeks, we rolled out a new direct from brand, direct from authorized reseller experience that you can see on the Marketplace, and the number of brands continues to grow because brands want choice. They want to sell on a Marketplace that has 177 million customers and doesn't compete with them. And that's pretty rare, and we're almost the only game in town that can say that. On the payment side -- or on the Promoted Listings side, again, I think it may be that we can acquire different types of inventory over time, but right now, we're seeing good traction with SMBs, we're seeing good traction with brands. We continue to grow on that. eBay has never been bigger, and the number of business, sellers or the amount of inventory as it is today. So I -- there may be opportunities, but again, I think more of the approach is how we approach the buyer side and navigate this divide between the existing and the new customers, and that's kind of where some of the focus was in our remarks."

And then Devin, just to come back to your branding campaign, I think that some of the key themes there are expecting results to take a little bit more time certainly and also targeting it a little bit more towards new buyers clearly. I'm curious about some of the creative, some of the messaging you talked about highlighting it as a major e-commerce destination, and while I'm certain I haven't seen all of the ads you're running, I've seen some, and I know that oftentimes featuring major brands are selling on the platform as well. I wonder do you see the messaging changing to focus a little bit more on educating those new buyers on some of the elements of eBay that they maybe don't know that it is just yet? For example, the level of fixed priced sales, the levels of Guaranteed Delivery, the levels of new goods sold. I'd just be curious to see on how the messaging may change in addition to the targeting."

I don't have the exact breakdown of Promoted Listings light versus Promoted Listings, but I don't think it's that meaningful a distinction. It's just some of that was just the way we segmented the product to allow consumers to adopt, and I think they're both basically a promoted listing placement. There's no difference in pricing, monetization or anything else. So I'd say that we continue to see good traction across the board with Promoted Listings. And as we said, we'll continue to -- as we drive triple digit growth in that area. On the brand, we continue to evolve it. I'd also distinguish, when you run a brand campaign, what gets the most attention is a TV spot, but TV's only 1 element of it. There are multiple aspects to it. There is social, there is the way we reach people through CRM, there is even the on-site experience of this brand. For me, what brand is, is about educating people about eBay, not about a particular thing that we're asking them to buy or sell. And yes, that message will continue to evolve. You'll see an evolution for holiday, you'll start to see the evolution even in the next few weeks as we evolve the campaign to be more direct. I think what's important is that eBay is a dynamic, vibrant place. We don't want the messages to be boring. There's a role for tutorials, and there's a role for brand. eBay is a dynamic, exciting Marketplace. We want to convey that while conveying our relevance and attributes of our business as they exist in 2018. So we're trying to get both of those right. And yes, you'll see it continue to evolve, and we've got a full plan for this holiday across all channels, and we'll do a lot of what you just said in various medium starting in the next few weeks."

On the first part, look, I think this period is a transitional period as we both move the base along to a significant evolution of our platform and prepare for what I hope will be an exciting 2020 and beyond. So no, I don't think it's a permanent approach. I think it's a most prudent approach given where we are now to get through whatever it is, 12, 15 months. But I do still believe we'll be able to drive acceleration in the core business and then drive 2 big businesses on top of that. Many of them, as we said, for various reasons don't really show up and make a material impact until 2020 and beyond. But I think this is the most prudent approach for this transitional period that we're in. On tariffs, I get there's a lot in that question, I guess you're talking about tariffs generally, about China, about the postal changes. I mean, I'd say on tariffs themselves, they've had very little impact, most of the tariffs have  been consumer goods and we haven't seen very much. On the proposed changes to the China import on the postal side, we don't -- it's a little early on that, but I'd point a couple of things. We actually think we're pretty well positioned if those changes take fruition. A majority of our China inventory is now warehoused in the United States. Obviously, they're not our warehouses, but we've helped our Chinese sellers with warehousing domestically so that wouldn't be subject to those quarters. We've also, this year, rolled out a shipping service called SpeedPack, and SpeedPack gives China sellers multiple delivery options that don't -- wouldn't be subject to the proposed postal changes. So I wouldn't say there's no impact, but actually in some ways, if the changes happen for everyone importing China inventory, we think we're about the best position given that we've been in this business for a long time, and we've taken a lot of changes to shrink time and distance and cost for Chinese sellers and build diversity at the last mile."

Our StubHub platform grew volume at 7%, and",1172,"Thanks, Selim. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, total GMV was up 5%, and revenue was up 6%, while our active buyer base grew 4% to 177 million. Underlying these results, GMV on our Marketplace platform grew 5%. Our StubHub platform grew volume at 7%, and our Classified platform grew revenue at 11%. Scott will go into more detail on our financial results in his section.
We continue to make foundational investments to improve the long-term health and competitiveness of our Marketplace this quarter while setting the stage for significant growth opportunities in Payments and Advertising. New eBay users are responding well to the evolution of our platform. But as we mentioned last quarter, our existing buyer base has been slower to adapt to these changes. This has limited our ability to scale some new experiences.
And as we plan coming into Q3, we made significant marketing investments this quarter, with a focus on buyer incentives and top-of-funnel activities such as our brand campaign. While some of these activities were successful and will scale, others did not deliver a sufficient return. These dynamics, coupled with the impact of a strong dollar on our U.S. export business, led to a 2 point deceleration in Marketplace volume growth this quarter.
Setting eBay up for future growth requires us to continue to build a comprehensive catalog, further simplify and improve the user experience and address customer imperatives such as trust and shipping. It also requires that we redefine perceptions of eBay's brand and business. Given that we have a large, stable and successful business but must also build for the future, we're shifting our tactics to balance the needs of a habituated base of customers who are used to shopping on eBay in a certain way while pursuing an even larger base of potential customers who have different expectations. We'll continue to focus on delivering significant product experience changes for new customers while evolving the experience for our existing base of users at a more measured pace.
Similarly, we'll continue to market our brand, but we plan to target our marketing to focus more heavily on acquiring new buyers while reducing our overall investment. We expect that this will result in slower growth for a period of time as we grow our user base and change the mix of customers. However, this will also allow us to deliver strong earnings growth over this period of time through operational margin expansion and ongoing aggressive capital return while positioning the business for stronger growth in 2020 as Payments and Advertising continued ramp.
Let me now discuss some of the progress we're making to improve the eBay user experience. Structured data powered services are delivering benefits in SCO, consumer selling flows, price recommendations and new shipping services. We've taken the next step in building our comprehensive catalog by enabling sellers to contribute product information to our catalog for the first time, which will improve accuracy and coverage over time. And we continue testing new iterations of product-based commerce to find a balanced experience that drives higher conversion for both our new and existing consumers.
Ultimately, achieving this balance is the key to enabling a scaled rollout for the experience. One of our key initiatives is to improve the shipping experience on eBay, and that's Guaranteed Delivery. This experience continues to gain share in the U.S., exiting the quarter with 9% of U.S. volume, and we recently launched this service in Australia. We're also reducing friction across our platform, simplifying registration and checkout while allowing unregistered users to save searches and add items to watch list without the need for an account. And we continue to scale our new consumer listing flow, which leverages our catalog to simplify the selling process, which is leading to improved conversion of sale.
Looking at marketing. We rolled out the latest iteration of our brand campaign this quarter. We plan to continue activation of our brand messages, which highlight eBay as a mainstream commerce destination across multiple channels throughout the holiday shopping period. But we will further target and segment marketing spend, driving efficiency in our overall investment.
As we've discussed previously, Advertising and Payments are 2 significant opportunities in front of us. Our total Marketplace Advertising portfolio is expected to top $600 million this year. Within this, we expect Promoted Listings to represent approximately $180 million. The strong growth of Promoted Listings has enabled us to continue to reduce our reliance on nonstrategic third-party advertising. In Q3, we began expanding Promoted Listing placements, and we've seen positive results across the board. We now have over 400,000 sellers promoting over 160 million listings, leading to revenue growth of 120%. We have further aggressive expansion plans for this service, and we believe that our total Advertising portfolio has the potential to contribute $1 billion in annual revenue in the next few years.
Looking at Payments. We're a month into our multiyear managed payment journey, and we are more excited than ever about this opportunity. Our new experience is live, and it's working well in the U.S. With an early product, we have over 3,000 sellers enabled -- and they have enabled 900,000 transactions and 38 million of GMV thus far, which represents an annual run rate of over $0.5 billion. From the buyer perspective, our guest checkout buyers who have historically indexed to credit card payments are showing higher conversion, and Apple Pay already has a 12% share of addressable volume.
As I've said previously, managing our payments flow will allow us to simplify the end-to-end experience for buyers and sellers. In particular, most sellers can expect reduced cost per payment processing with a simplified selling process and access to more buyers who will have more payment choices. Sellers are already realizing significant savings and a simpler interface with one place to manage their eBay business. We're working to expand the program with more sellers driving more volume and realizing more savings as we ramp to 5% in the U.S. At the same time, we'll continue to improve the experience, implementing new features and functionality, including new payment methods such as PayPal.
Shifting focus to other platforms. StubHub delivered modest volume acceleration in Q3, driven primarily by strength in concerts, partially offset by a weaker NFL performance. And Classified growth accelerated as well with continued strength in our German platforms, Kleinanzeigen and mobile.
In summary, we will continue to make investments to improve the long-term health and competitiveness of our Marketplace. We are evolving our approach and plan to further target our product and marketing resources to address the needs of both new and existing users. At the same time, we will invest aggressively to deliver significant growth opportunities in Payments and in Advertising. While this will result in a period of slower top line growth, we will grow operating income through margin expansion, and we'll continue to aggressively return capital to deliver strong earnings growth.
Let me now turn to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financial results and on our outlook."

Let's begin with Q3 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q3, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS and $381 million of free cash flow while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.Movi",1699,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q3 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q3, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS and $381 million of free cash flow while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.
Moving to active buyers. In the quarter, we increased our total active buyer base to 177 million. Our trailing 12-month growth was 4%, stable versus the prior quarter, driving 2 million incremental active buyers.
On Slide 6, in Q3, we enabled $22.7 billion of total GMV, up 5%, decelerating 2 points versus the prior quarter. By geography, the U.S. generated $9 billion of GMV, up 3%, while international delivered $13.7 billion of GMV, up 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated total net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 6% on an FX-neutral basis and up 5% organically. We delivered $2.1 billion of transaction revenue, up 5%, and $560 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 7%.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Marketplace's platform grew GMV by 5% in Q3, a 2 point deceleration versus the prior quarter. U.S. GMV grew 2%, decelerating 4 points quarter-over-quarter. While we anticipated some export headwinds coming into the quarter based on U.S. dollar strength, our product and marketing efforts did not scale to the extent we expected to offset this pressure. Underlying these GMV dynamics, volume bought by U.S. buyers, or GMV, grew 5% in Q3, a 1 point deceleration versus Q2. And while not to our aspirations, it decelerated more modestly than GMV. International GMV was stable at 7% with a full quarter from our Japan acquisition offsetting modest deceleration in the U.K. and other small markets. Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year.
Transaction revenue grew 5%, in line with GMV, with Promoted Listings growing 120% and contributing over a point of growth to transaction revenue. Transaction take rate is slightly higher year-over-year due to the favorable impact of hedging activity and strong Promoted Listings growth, offset by geographic and category mix dynamics. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 3%, an acceleration of 1 point versus the prior quarter.
Moving to Slide 9. Total GMV for StubHub grew 7%, accelerating 2 points from Q2, while revenue grew 7%.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q3, Classifieds grew revenue 11%, a 1 point acceleration versus Q2.
On major cost drivers, in Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 26.4%, down 2 points versus the prior year, net of approximately 1 point of foreign exchange favorability. Cost of revenue increased nearly 1 point year-over-year, driven primarily by our first-party inventory program in Korea.
Q3 sales and marketing expense was up over 3 points, driven by marketing and promotional spending on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms and the addition of our Japan acquisition. Product development costs were down 1 point due to increased productivity across our product initiatives even as we redeploy into strategic opportunities such as managed payments and first-party advertising. G&A was down nearly 1 point through operating leverage, our fourth consecutive quarter of G&A productivity.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q3, we delivered $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS, up 19% versus prior year. EPS growth was driven by volume growth and the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by our investments in managed payments, marketing and Japan. Our non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected due to the benefit of discrete items. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.73, up $0.25 versus last year. This includes a $313 million gain on the sale of our Flipkart stake and $126 million gain recognized due to the change in the fair value of a warrant agreement. Stock-based compensation for the quarter, including related taxes, was $127 million, up 7% as we continue to utilize equity programs to compete for talent in a highly competitive environment.
While our non-GAAP financial results excludes stock-based compensation, we take a considered approach to granting stock, and per our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to offsetting this dilution via stock repurchases. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q3, we generated $381 million of free cash flow, which was down 47% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by a Flipkart cash tax payment and the timing of working capital flows pushing into Q4. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q3 and we now expect to be in the range of 6% to 7% of revenue for the year.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $9 billion, which includes the net Flipkart proceeds of nearly $1 billion. During Q3, as part of our ongoing commitment to capital return, we repurchased $1 billion of our stock. We ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, and you can expect us to continue to be aggressive buyers of our own stock.
Turning to our Q4 guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting revenue between $2.85 billion and $2.89 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth of 4% to 5%. Implied in our guidance is continued pressure on Marketplace volume growth, driven by ongoing export pressure from the stronger dollar and similar dynamics with our product and marketing efforts.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 to $0.69 per share, representing growth of 14% to 18% on an as-reported basis. EPS growth will be driven by top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program, foreign exchange and a lower tax rate, partially offset by our investments in managed payments and Japan. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.87 to $0.92 per share. This includes a $389 million benefit resulting from an adjustment to the deferred income tax effects of the U.S. tax reform, reducing the provisional amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.
For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $10.72 billion to $10.76 billion, representing organic FX-neutral revenue growth of approximately 6%. We expect operating margin in the range of 27% to 28% and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.29 to $2.31 per share.
We now expect free cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. This is lower than our previous guidance due primarily to the Flipkart cash tax payment. While our free cash flow in 2018 has been negatively impacted by a number of cash tax payments related to the effects of U.S. tax reform and the Flipkart sale, the underlying cash flow dynamics of the company have not changed. And we are updating our full year GAAP EPS guidance to $2.62 to $2.67 per share.
Given our recent performance and the shift in our approach that Devin referenced in his remarks, we thought it would be helpful to give some initial context on our expectations for 2019. First, we will exit this year having delivered approximately 6% FX-neutral organic revenue growth, which is 1 point below the low end of our original guidance range of 7% to 9%. That said, we still expect to deliver between $2.29 and $2.31 per share of non-GAAP EPS, which is at or above the upper end of our original EPS guidance range of $2.25 to $2.30 per share.
As we look forward to 2019, we believe it is prudent to manage our product and marketing costs to better align to our growth profile. At the same time, we have 2 significant growth opportunities in Advertising and Payments that require ongoing investment.
In Advertising, we will continue to drive significant growth in Promoted Listings, providing our sellers with new tools to drive growth while increasing adoption, coverage and monetization. We expect Promoted Listings to double in 2019, which will benefit Marketplace transaction revenue growth by more than 1 point, while seeing more modest declines in our nonstrategic third-party Advertising. As Devin mentioned, we believe our overall ad portfolio could easily generate $1 billion of revenue a few years from now.
With Payments, as we highlighted earlier, we are seeing good traction in our first test market. Prices for participating sellers are lower, and we have leveraged our scale to negotiate beneficial pricing on processing costs Based on our early results, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on an annual revenue opportunity of over $2 billion with incremental operating profit of approximately $0.5 billion once the majority of the volume on our core Marketplace platform has transitioned.
Looking at buyer payment preferences. As expected, we have seen some friction from buyers who are accustomed to paying with PayPal, which was required on eBay for a number of years. However, we are seeing higher conversion with buyers who are more accustomed to paying with a credit card. As a frame of reference, eBay guest users who are offered all payment methods, including PayPal, choose to pay with a credit or a debit card nearly 80% of the time. And at StubHub, where buyers have similar choice of payment methods, we already see 90% using credit cards for their transactions.
Additionally, buyers are excited about alternative payments like Apple Pay, where we are already seeing strong adoption with more than 1 in 10 customers on the iPhone and iPad choosing Apple Pay. These data points reinforce our belief that buyers ultimately want payment choice for their e-commerce transactions. 
Finally, we've hit our product milestones so far and expect to invest approximately $0.05 of EPS in 2018.
With all of this as context, our preliminary 2019 expectations are to grow GMV and revenue in the low to mid single digits. With growth at these lower levels, we expect to drive margin expansion and solid operating income growth while making significant in payments -- investments in Payments and our Advertising capabilities. We will continue to return capital to shareholders at accelerated levels similar to this year while deploying capital to grow the M&A. This should ultimately result in double-digit EPS growth in the low to midteens.
We will give more detailed 2019 guidance on our January earnings call as per our normal process. And now we'd be happy to answer questions."

I mean, that is, in essence, the opportunity, what you just said, which is for the last period of time we've been growing in triple digits, as we said, we expect to continue to grow in triple digits next year, and I think that there are opportunities on both the source and the demand side. So on the source side, we continue to see more and more sellers adopt this. We're opening it up to more placements, and we're opening it up to more opportunities for sellers to promote their listings. So as an example, for a long period of time, consumer sellers didn't have that opportunity. Now they do. And business sellers are getting more chances in different parts of our product flows to promote at their option. I'll remind you that promoting a listing is an option for a seller. It's not a requirement. On the other side, ultimately, we've moved to fixed placements within both search and merchandising and some [ wares ] on our view item page. But I think that where it will ultimately move is that an algorithm will decide. There won't be fixed positions. There will ultimately be a unified way that we can monetize pixels on every screen. And there may be some flows where it doesn't make sense to have any Promoted Listings because of cannibalization, and there may be other flows where they may all be promoted because that's the highest way that we can monetize on behalf of not only ourselves but on behalf of our sellers. So there is a lot of runway. I mean, I really think we're in the first inning of this, and we're -- I want to also be clear, we're going to be very careful of the buyer experience. We don't think a good buyer experience is to have every pixel on every page promoted. We've done a lot of good work simplifying and clarifying relevance and personalization. We don't want Promoted Listings to undermine it, but we don't think that it will.

Look, I think as context, remember last year, we held marketing flat as a percentage of revenue while as we entered 2018, talked about leaning into marketing throughout the year really on a number of different fronts. And to your question, some of these have worked out well and others haven't, and just let me try and break down a few. First off, as we entered the year and a little bit last year, we were spending on what we would call seller incentives or inventory incentives. And as we diagnosed the different cohorts and tranches of those customers and those transactions, what we've seen is that the CLV in those are lower. And so the ROIs aren't as good over time. And so what you'll see as we head forward is less of that. Another aspect is the kind of middle of funnel,  if you will, driving more buyers to the ecosystem. And those are -- candidly, there's not one ROI within that ecosystem. There's a number of different ways you can measure it, and there's not one answer. Some lower-priced coupons for buyers have worked really well. Some higher-priced ones haven't worked as well, et cetera. But we continue to work on refining the ROIs, the appropriate level of spend, making sure we're focused on both activity per buyer as well as new buyer acquisition. And finally, we shifted a fair amount of our spend to upper funnel, if you will, brand, not just TV, but social and others. And obviously, that just takes longer. I'll let Devin weigh in on those aspects of it, but I think overall, we're still committed to a brand campaign. But the reality is, is it's going to take longer, and we expected that going into it. As related to that, to the outlook, what you can expect is that next year, we'll be getting leverage off of the 2018 base, reducing our marketing as a percentage of revenue and kind of deploying within those 3 buckets, as I talked about. Devin, you want to weigh in on the brand and [ some of the lessons we learned ]."

And we're seeing this, that new buyers are responding really well to the changes that we've made in the last few years. So we need more of them. And I think part of that is messaging our brand. Brands are harder to measure than our lower funnel spend, as Scott said, but we're committed to it. We'll use all channels, and it will take time. This is 1 of the top 30 brands in the world.

Certain of our services have been well received across the board, and others have been -- take more time. And an example of something that takes more time that is really going well with new customers but is taking more time is full product-based commerce experience, where we fully compress the product side. What we see is that, as you would expect, new customers who don't -- haven't shopped with eBay before come to it and they respond very well to that. Existing customers, some of them shop on eBay, they've been shopping at eBay for 20 years, so it's a new experience. And there's always some friction when you change an experience. I think some of it is time and habituation. Some of it is education. And as we said, our approach is going to change a little bit, which does slow things down a bit, and that is we'll go fast with new customers and we'll go slower with the existing base. And over time, the mix will change. So we're still very confident in what we're doing, and we do believe that the existing base will evolve and it will come along. But we are very conscious that we don't want to screw up the existing ecosystem. We want -- we have a good, stable base of customers, a very successful business, and we don't want to disrupt that. So we'll be more aggressive with the new and we'll go a bit slower with the existing buyers. And eventually, we'll get them both there."

They're not floating in space inside an eBay ecosystem. We are helping those assets quite a bit through the core -- synergies with the core. So again, we'll -- we've never said never to anything. Our job is to create value for shareholders, but this is the right portfolio for the company now, we believe. We'll always evaluate it.

On Payments, we're really happy with where we are. We have some product features and functions to roll out. As we said, PayPal will become a form of payment within managed payments at some point next year. We'll enter the second market at some point next year. But we're completely focused on customer benefits. We are completely focused on driving an integrated product experience at lower cost for sellers and payment choice for buyers, and that's exactly on our road map. And as I said, whatever we are, month, a little more than a month in, and this is going exactly as we would've hoped at this early stage. And what's really encouraging is that we're delivering real benefits to customers. You see it in the form of payment choices buyers are making. You see it in the savings and the feedback that we're getting from sellers. I'm really -- look, it's a long road but it's not that long. I'll remind you that the operating agreement with PayPal is up in June of 2020, and after that, we're free to do whatever we want. And we're racing as fast as we can to deliver customer benefits to get to that date. On EGD, we are investing in delivery. And we're seeing really good results with Guaranteed Delivery, and the share is going up. We're going to keep driving it up. I think the question is, do we need to invest more? I'm not sure right now. It's -- within the framework Scott discussed in '19, we will be making incremental investments in our delivery experience. The one thing I don't think we need to do is deploy large amounts of capital to build a warehouse strategy. I've never thought that. I don't believe that. And I think that we use data and we use the diversity of our inventory to close the gap. And just as one example, as we've said before, 2/3 of packages are delivered within 2 business days in the United States. That's pretty good, particularly given the breadth of our inventory. And we do that without a warehouse strategy. So we're going to keep driving hard to close delivery gaps. We're going to keep driving hard to give customers increased penetration free, more clarity on tracking and time, but we're on the right trajectory. Customers are responding well to that."

Let me start by saying this again. We are the only marketplace in the world that handles payments and checkout the way that we do because of the very unique relationship and history with PayPal. So I absolutely believe, aside from the direct economics, that we will have more buyers because there are many buyers in many jurisdictions where they have a preferred means of payment that we don't offer. And this unique situation of, in essence, of favoring/requiring PayPal for buyers, look, I think PayPal is a great company and there are a lot of customers who want to use PayPal and they will be able to. But there are -- we could give you dozens of examples of other payment choices that people want to make that we don't make available today, and we're going to as this rolls out. On the seller side, I don't want to minimize that as well. We need to reduce sellers' costs. We need to deliver an integrated product experience. Every other marketplace that you can mention, every other digital marketplace, handles the way that they provide information to their sellers or their drivers or their home renters in one place. They say, here's your transactions and here's where the money went. Only in this eBay world do we say, here are your transactions and then go somewhere else to figure out where the money went. It really makes no sense, and that's the essence of what we're doing. We're going to bring it together for sellers. That means better economics for sellers and more competitiveness and ultimately a better checkout experience not just on payment choice but seamless checkout. I am very optimistic that when we get there to the other side, and the majority of our transaction volume is through managed payments, we won't just pick up the direct economics of it. We'll also pick up a better experience, and we'll see a direct impact on accelerating Marketplace dynamics."

At this point this year, we're really lapping sort of pretty big games we made last year on our both product and marketing efforts that weren't repeated this year. And fundamentally, we started to lap and weren't able to offset the lapping of the gains that we made last year. So we feel, at this point, we're sort of limited by our ability to grow active buyers faster until we can scale our experiences for new buyers but at the same time, ensuring we don't disrupt our existing buyers. So if you look at our active buyer growth growing at about 4%, while it's not our aspiration, that level of stability and active buyer growth, combined with kind of stability now in active -- in GMV per active buyer, as we look forward, makes us more confident in how we stand, albeit not to our aspirations to date but certainly in line with the guidance that we've given for both Q4 and next year."

I wonder, is there any thought with the ramp in Advertising, if there are also opportunities to stimulate additional seller listing activity through perhaps varied Marketplace pricing? Or are you satisfied with the current pricing structure as it stands?"

On the seller base, I don't -- our business seller base continues to grow, and we're really happy with our inventory mix. We continue to grow the inventory on the Marketplace. If anything, this has been more of a deman",322,"Yes, thanks for the question, Colin. On the seller base, I don't -- our business seller base continues to grow, and we're really happy with our inventory mix. We continue to grow the inventory on the Marketplace. If anything, this has been more of a demand side issue than a supply side issue over the last year. It's been the constraint on faster growth. It's been more demand side than supply side. I think the one caveat to that is something that we've talked about on prior calls, which is we continue to see good traction with brands, and we continue to evolve our brand experience so that brands have a comfortable place to sit within the eBay Marketplace. And by brands, I don't just mean direct from brands but authorized resellers as well. So just recently, in the last couple of weeks, we rolled out a new direct from brand, direct from authorized reseller experience that you can see on the Marketplace. And the number of brands continues to grow because brands want choice. They want to sell on a marketplace that has 177 million customers and doesn't compete with them. And that's pretty rare, and we're almost the only game in town that can say that. On the Payments side -- or on the Promoted Listings side, again, I think it may be that we can acquire different types of inventory over time. But right now, we're seeing good traction with SMBs. We're seeing good traction with brands. We continue to grow on that. eBay has never been bigger in the number of business, sellers or the amount of inventory as it is today. So I -- there may be opportunities, but again, I think more of the approach is how we approach the buyer side and navigate this divide between the existing and the new customers. And that's kind of where some of the focus was in our remarks."

It seems to me that would be an important one for expanding that group of users, but I would just love to hear a little bit more about that. And then, Devin, just to come back to your branding campaign, I think that some of the key themes there are expecting results to take a little bit more time, certainly, and also targeting it a little bit more towards new buyers, clearly. I'm curious about some of the creative, some of the messaging you talked about, highlighting it as a major e-commerce destination. And while I'm certain I haven't seen all of the ads you're running, I've seen some, and I know they're oftentimes featuring major brands that are selling on the platform as well. I wonder, do you see the messaging changing to focus a little bit more on educating those new buyers on some of the elements of eBay that they maybe don't know that it is just yet? For example, the level of fixed priced sales, the levels of Guaranteed Delivery, the levels of new goods sold. I'd just be curious to see on how the messaging may change in addition to the targeting."

I don't have the exact breakdown of Promoted Listings Lite versus Promoted Listings, but I don't think it's that meaningful a distinction. It's just some of that was just the way we segmented the product to allow consumers to adopt, and I think they're both basically a promoted listing placement. There's no difference in pricing, monetization or anything else. So I'd say that we continue to see good traction across the board with Promoted Listings. And as we said, we'll continue to as we drive triple-digit growth in that area. On the brand, we continue to evolve it. I'd also distinguish. When you run a brand campaign, what gets the most attention is a TV spot, but TV's only one element of it. There are multiple aspects to it. There is social. There is the way we reach people through CRM. There is even the on-site experience of this brand. For me, what brand is, is about educating people about eBay, not about a particular thing that we're asking them to buy or sell. And yes, that message will continue to evolve. You'll see an evolution for holiday. You'll start to see the evolution even in the next few weeks as we evolve the campaign to be more direct. I think what's important is that eBay is a dynamic, vibrant place. We don't want the messages to be boring. There's a role for tutorials, and there's a role for brand. eBay is a dynamic, exciting marketplace. We want to convey that while conveying our relevance and the attributes of our business as they exist in 2018. So we're trying to get both of those right. And yes, you'll see it continue to evolve, and we've got a full plan for this holiday across all channels. And we'll do a lot of what you just said in various medium starting in the next few weeks."

On the first part, look, I think this period is a transitional period as we both move the base along to a significant evolution of our platform and prepare for what I hope will be an exciting 2020 and beyond. So no, I don't think it's a permanent approach. I think it's the most prudent approach given where we are now to get through whatever it is, 12, 15 months. But I do still believe we'll be able to drive acceleration in the core business and then drive 2 big businesses on top of that. Many of them, as we said, for various reasons, don't really show up and make a material impact until 2020 and beyond. But I think this is the most prudent approach for this transitional period that we're in. On tariffs, I get there's a lot in that question. I guess you're talking about tariffs generally, about China, about the postal changes. I mean, I'd say on tariffs themselves, they've had very little impact. Most of the tariffs have  been consumer goods, and we haven't seen very much. On the proposed changes to the China import on the postal side, we don't -- it's a little early on that, but I'd point a couple of things. We actually think we're pretty well positioned if those changes take fruition. A majority of our China inventory is now warehoused in the United States. Obviously, they're not our warehouses, but we've helped our Chinese sellers with warehousing domestically. So that wouldn't be subject to those corridors. We've also, this year, rolled out a shipping service called SpeedPak. And SpeedPak gives China sellers multiple delivery options that don't -- wouldn't be subject to the proposed postal changes. So I wouldn't say there's no impact. But actually in some ways, if the changes happen for everyone importing China inventory, we think we're about the best positioned given that we've been in this business for a long time, and we've taken a lot of changes to shrink time and distance and cost for Chinese sellers and build diversity at the last mile."

Our StubHub platform grew volume at 7%, and",1173,"Thanks, Selim. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, total GMV was up 5%, and revenue was up 6%, while our active buyer base grew 4% to 177 million. Underlying these results, GMV on our Marketplace platform grew 5%. Our StubHub platform grew volume at 7%, and our Classified platform grew revenue at 11%. Scott will go into more detail on our financial results in his section.
We continue to make foundational investments to improve the long-term health and competitiveness of our Marketplace this quarter while setting the stage for significant growth opportunities in Payments and Advertising. New eBay users are responding well to the evolution of our platform. But as we mentioned last quarter, our existing buyer base has been slower to adapt to these changes. This has limited our ability to scale some new experiences.
And as we plan coming into Q3, we made significant marketing investments this quarter, with a focus on buyer incentives and top-of-funnel activities such as our brand campaign. While some of these activities were successful and will scale, others did not deliver a sufficient return. These dynamics, coupled with the impact of a strong dollar on our U.S. export business, led to a 2 point deceleration in Marketplace volume growth this quarter.
Setting eBay up for future growth requires us to continue to build a comprehensive catalog, further simplify and improve the user experience and address customer imperatives such as trust in shipping. It also requires that we redefine perceptions of eBay's brand and business. Given that we have a large, stable and successful business but must also build for the future, we're shifting our tactics to balance the needs of a habituated base of customers who are used to shopping on eBay in a certain way while pursuing an even larger base of potential customers who have different expectations. We'll continue to focus on delivering significant product experience changes for new customers while evolving the experience for our existing base of users at a more measured pace.
Similarly, we'll continue to market our brand, but we plan to target our marketing to focus more heavily on acquiring new buyers while reducing our overall investment. We expect that this will result in slower growth for a period of time as we grow our user base and change the mix of customers. However, this will also allow us to deliver strong earnings growth over this period of time through operational margin expansion and ongoing aggressive capital return while positioning the business for stronger growth in 2020 as Payments and Advertising continue  to ramp.
Let me now discuss some of the progress we're making to improve the eBay user experience. Structured data powered services are delivering benefits in SCO, consumer selling flows, price recommendations and new shipping services. We've taken the next step in building our comprehensive catalog by enabling sellers to contribute product information to our catalog for the first time, which will improve accuracy and coverage over time. And we continue testing new iterations of product-based commerce to find a balanced experience that drives higher conversion for both our new and existing consumers.
Ultimately, achieving this balance is the key to enabling a scaled rollout for the experience. One of our key initiatives is to improve the shipping experience on eBay, and that's Guaranteed Delivery. This experience continues to gain share in the U.S., exiting the quarter with 9% of U.S. volume, and we recently launched this service in Australia. We're also reducing friction across our platform, simplifying registration and checkout while allowing unregistered users to save searches and add items to watch list without the need for an account. And we continue to scale our new consumer listing flow, which leverages our catalog to simplify the selling process, which is leading to improved conversion of sale.
Looking at marketing. We rolled out the latest iteration of our brand campaign this quarter. We plan to continue activation of our brand messages, which highlight eBay as a mainstream commerce destination across multiple channels throughout the holiday shopping period. But we will further target and segment marketing spend, driving efficiency in our overall investment.
As we've discussed previously, Advertising and Payments are 2 significant opportunities in front of us. Our total Marketplace Advertising portfolio is expected to top $600 million this year. Within this, we expect Promoted Listings to represent approximately $180 million. The strong growth of Promoted Listings has enabled us to continue to reduce our reliance on nonstrategic third-party advertising. In Q3, we began expanding Promoted Listing placements, and we've seen positive results across the board. We now have over 400,000 sellers promoting over 160 million listings, leading to revenue growth of 120%. We have further aggressive expansion plans for this service, and we believe that our total Advertising portfolio has the potential to contribute $1 billion in annual revenue in the next few years.
Looking at Payments. We're a month into our multiyear managed payment journey, and we are more excited than ever about this opportunity. Our new experience is live, and it's working well in the U.S. With an early product, we have over 3,000 sellers enabled -- and they have enabled 900,000 transactions and 38 million of GMV thus far, which represents an annual run rate of over $0.5 billion. From the buyer perspective, our guest checkout buyers who have historically indexed to credit card payments are showing higher conversion, and Apple Pay already has a 12% share of addressable volume.
As I've said previously, managing our payments flow will allow us to simplify the end-to-end experience for buyers and sellers. In particular, most sellers can expect reduced cost for payment processing with a simplified selling process and access to more buyers who will have more payment choices. Sellers are already realizing significant savings and a simpler interface with one place to manage their eBay business. We're working to expand the program with more sellers driving more volume and realizing more savings as we ramp to 5% in the U.S. At the same time, we'll continue to improve the experience, implementing new features and functionality, including new payment methods such as PayPal.
Shifting focus to other platforms. StubHub delivered modest volume acceleration in Q3, driven primarily by strength in concerts, partially offset by a weaker NFL performance. And Classified growth accelerated as well with continued strength in our German platforms, Kleinanzeigen and mobile.
In summary, we will continue to make investments to improve the long-term health and competitiveness of our Marketplace. We are evolving our approach and plan to further target our product and marketing resources to address the needs of both new and existing users. At the same time, we will invest aggressively to deliver significant growth opportunities in Payments and in Advertising. While this will result in a period of slower top line growth, we will grow operating income through margin expansion, and we'll continue to aggressively return capital to deliver strong earnings growth.
Let me now turn to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financial results and on our outlook."

Let's begin with Q3 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q3, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS and $381 million of free cash flow while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.Movi",1699,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q3 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q3, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS and $381 million of free cash flow while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.
Moving to active buyers. In the quarter, we increased our total active buyer base to 177 million. Our trailing 12-month growth was 4%, stable versus the prior quarter, driving 2 million incremental active buyers.
On Slide 6, in Q3, we enabled $22.7 billion of total GMV, up 5%, decelerating 2 points versus the prior quarter. By geography, the U.S. generated $9 billion of GMV, up 3%, while international delivered $13.7 billion of GMV, up 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated total net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 6% on an FX-neutral basis and up 5% organically. We delivered $2.1 billion of transaction revenue, up 5%, and $560 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 7%.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Marketplace's platform grew GMV by 5% in Q3, a 2 point deceleration versus the prior quarter. U.S. GMV grew 2%, decelerating 4 points quarter-over-quarter. While we anticipated some export headwinds coming into the quarter based on U.S. dollar strength, our product and marketing efforts did not scale to the extent we expected to offset this pressure. Underlying these GMV dynamics, volume bought by U.S. buyers, or GMV, grew 5% in Q3, a 1 point deceleration versus Q2. And while not to our aspirations, it decelerated more modestly than GMV. International GMV was stable at 7% with a full quarter from our Japan acquisition offsetting modest deceleration in the U.K. and other small markets. Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year.
Transaction revenue grew 5%, in line with GMV, with Promoted Listings growing 120% and contributing over a point of growth to transaction revenue. Transaction take rate is slightly higher year-over-year due to the favorable impact of hedging activity and strong Promoted Listings growth, offset by geographic and category mix dynamics. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 3%, an acceleration of 1 point versus the prior quarter.
Moving to Slide 9. Total GMV for StubHub grew 7%, accelerating 2 points from Q2, while revenue grew 7%.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q3, Classifieds grew revenue 11%, a 1 point acceleration versus Q2.
On major cost drivers, in Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 26.4%, down 2 points versus the prior year, net of approximately 1 point of foreign exchange favorability. Cost of revenue increased nearly 1 point year-over-year, driven primarily by our first-party inventory program in Korea.
Q3 sales and marketing expense was up over 3 points, driven by marketing and promotional spending on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms and the addition of our Japan acquisition. Product development costs were down 1 point due to increased productivity across our product initiatives even as we redeploy into strategic opportunities such as managed payments and first-party advertising. G&A was down nearly 1 point through operating leverage, our fourth consecutive quarter of G&A productivity.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q3, we delivered $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS, up 19% versus prior year. EPS growth was driven by volume growth and the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by our investments in managed payments, marketing and Japan. Our non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected due to the benefit of discrete items. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.73, up $0.25 versus last year. This includes a $313 million gain on the sale of our Flipkart stake and $126 million gain recognized due to the change in the fair value of a warrant agreement. Stock-based compensation for the quarter, including related taxes, was $127 million, up 7% as we continue to utilize equity programs to compete for talent in a highly competitive environment.
While our non-GAAP financial results excludes stock-based compensation, we take a considered approach to granting stock, and per our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to offsetting this dilution via stock repurchases. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q3, we generated $381 million of free cash flow, which was down 47% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by a Flipkart cash tax payment and the timing of working capital flows pushing into Q4. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q3 and we now expect to be in the range of 6% to 7% of revenue for the year.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $9 billion, which includes the net Flipkart proceeds of nearly $1 billion. During Q3, as part of our ongoing commitment to capital return, we repurchased $1 billion of our stock. We ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, and you can expect us to continue to be aggressive buyers of our own stock.
Turning to our Q4 guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting revenue between $2.85 billion and $2.89 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth of 4% to 5%. Implied in our guidance is continued pressure on Marketplace volume growth, driven by ongoing export pressure from the stronger dollar and similar dynamics with our product and marketing efforts.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 to $0.69 per share, representing growth of 14% to 18% on an as-reported basis. EPS growth will be driven by top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program, foreign exchange and a lower tax rate, partially offset by our investments in managed payments in Japan. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.87 to $0.92 per share. This includes a $389 million benefit resulting from an adjustment to the deferred income tax effects of the U.S. tax reform, reducing the provisional amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.
For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $10.72 billion to $10.76 billion, representing organic FX-neutral revenue growth of approximately 6%. We expect operating margin in the range of 27% to 28% and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.29 to $2.31 per share.
We now expect free cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. This is lower than our previous guidance due primarily to the Flipkart cash tax payment. While our free cash flow in 2018 has been negatively impacted by a number of cash tax payments related to the effects of U.S. tax reform and the Flipkart sale, the underlying cash flow dynamics of the company have not changed. And we are updating our full year GAAP EPS guidance to $2.62 to $2.67 per share.
Given our recent performance and the shift in our approach that Devin referenced in his remarks, we thought it would be helpful to give some initial context on our expectations for 2019. First, we will exit this year having delivered approximately 6% FX-neutral organic revenue growth, which is 1 point below the low end of our original guidance range of 7% to 9%. That said, we still expect to deliver between $2.29 and $2.31 per share of non-GAAP EPS, which is at or above the upper end of our original EPS guidance range of $2.25 to $2.30 per share.
As we look forward to 2019, we believe it is prudent to manage our product and marketing costs to better align to our growth profile. At the same time, we have 2 significant growth opportunities in Advertising and Payments that require ongoing investment.
In Advertising, we will continue to drive significant growth in Promoted Listings, providing our sellers with new tools to drive growth while increasing adoption, coverage and monetization. We expect Promoted Listings to double in 2019, which will benefit Marketplace transaction revenue growth by more than 1 point, while seeing more modest declines in our nonstrategic third-party Advertising. As Devin mentioned, we believe our overall ad portfolio could easily generate $1 billion of revenue a few years from now.
With Payments, as we highlighted earlier, we are seeing good traction in our first test market. Prices for participating sellers are lower, and we have leveraged our scale to negotiate beneficial pricing on processing costs. Based on our early results, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on an annual revenue opportunity of over $2 billion with incremental operating profit of approximately $0.5 billion once the majority of the volume on our core Marketplace platform has transitioned.
Looking at buyer payment preferences. As expected, we have seen some friction from buyers who are accustomed to paying with PayPal, which was required on eBay for a number of years. However, we are seeing higher conversion with buyers who are more accustomed to paying with a credit card. As a frame of reference, eBay guest users who are offered all payment methods, including PayPal, choose to pay with a credit or a debit card nearly 80% of the time. And at StubHub, where buyers have similar choice of payment methods, we already see 90% using credit cards for their transactions.
Additionally, buyers are excited about alternative payments like Apple Pay, where we are already seeing strong adoption with more than 1 in 10 customers on the iPhone and iPad choosing Apple Pay. These data points reinforce our belief that buyers ultimately want payment choice for their e-commerce transactions. 
Finally, we've hit our product milestones so far and expect to invest approximately $0.05 of EPS in 2018.
With all of this as context, our preliminary 2019 expectations are to grow GMV and revenue in the low to mid single digits. With growth at these lower levels, we expect to drive margin expansion and solid operating income growth while making significant in payments -- investments in Payments and our Advertising capabilities. We will continue to return capital to shareholders at accelerated levels similar to this year while deploying capital to grow the M&A.

I mean, that is, in essence, the opportunity, what you just said, which is for the last period of time we've been growing in triple digits, as we said, we expect to continue to grow in triple digits next year, and I think that there are opportunities on both the source and the demand side. So on the source side, we continue to see more and more sellers adopt this. We're opening it up to more placements, and we're opening it up to more opportunities for sellers to promote their listings. So as an example, for a long period of time, consumer sellers didn't have that opportunity. Now they do. And business sellers are getting more chances in different parts of our product flows to promote at their option. I'll remind you that promoting a listing is an option for a seller. It's not a requirement. On the other side, ultimately, we've moved to fixed placements within both search and merchandising and some wares on our view item page. But I think that where it will ultimately move is that an algorithm will decide. There won't be fixed positions. There will ultimately be a unified way that we can monetize pixels on every screen. And there may be some flows where it doesn't make sense to have any Promoted Listings because of cannibalization, and there may be other flows where they may all be promoted because that's the highest way that we can monetize on behalf of not only ourselves but on behalf of our sellers. So there is a lot of runway. I mean, I really think we're in the first inning of this, and we're -- I want to also be clear, we're going to be very careful of the buyer experience. We don't think a good buyer experience is to have every pixel on every page promoted. We've done a lot of good work simplifying and clarifying relevance and personalization. We don't want Promoted Listings to undermine it, but we don't think that it will. And we think we have so much runway for buyers and sellers on this that it will be -- as we said in the prepared remarks, Advertising and Payments are 2 big new businesses on top of the existing eBay business."

Look, I think as context, remember last year, we held marketing flat as a percentage of revenue while as we entered 2018, talked about leaning into marketing throughout the year really on a number of different fronts. And to your question, some of these have worked out well and others haven't, and just let me try and break down a few. First off, as we entered the year and a little bit last year, we were spending on what we would call seller incentives or inventory incentives. And as we diagnosed the different cohorts and tranches of those customers and those transactions, what we've seen is that the CLV in those are lower. And so the ROIs aren't as good over time. And so what you'll see as we head forward is less of that. Another aspect is the kind of middle of funnel,  if you will, driving more buyers to the ecosystem. And those are -- candidly, there's not one ROI within that ecosystem. There's a number of different ways you can measure it, and there's not one answer. Some lower-priced coupons for buyers have worked really well. Some higher-priced ones haven't worked as well, et cetera. But we continue to work on refining the ROIs, the appropriate level of spend, making sure we're focused on both activity per buyer as well as new buyer acquisition. And finally, we shifted a fair amount of our spend to upper funnel, if you will, brand, not just TV, but social and others. And obviously, that just takes longer. I'll let Devin weigh in on those aspects of it, but I think overall, we're still committed to a brand campaign. But the reality is, is it's going to take longer, and we expected that going into it. As related to that, to the outlook, what you can expect is that next year, we'll be getting leverage off of the 2018 base, reducing our marketing as a percentage of revenue and kind of deploying within those 3 buckets, as I talked about. Devin, you want to weigh in on the brand and then I'll take the last one."

And we're seeing this, that new buyers are responding really well to the changes that we've made in the last few years. So we need more of them. And I think part of that is messaging our brand. Brands are harder to measure than our lower funnel spend, as Scott said, but we're committed to it. We'll use all channels, and it will take time. This is 1 of the top 30 brands in the world.

Certain of our services have been well received across the board, and others have been -- take more time. And an example of something that takes more time that is really going well with new customers but is taking more time is full product-based commerce experience, where we fully compress the product side. What we see is that, as you would expect, new customers who don't -- haven't shopped with eBay before come to it and they respond very well to that. Existing customers, some of them shop on eBay, they've been shopping at eBay for 20 years, so it's a new experience. And there's always some friction when you change an experience. I think some of it is time and habituation. Some of it is education. And as we said, our approach is going to change a little bit, which does slow things down a bit, and that is we'll go fast with new customers and we'll go slower with the existing base. And over time, the mix will change. So we're still very confident in what we're doing, and we do believe that the existing base will evolve and it will come along. But we are very conscious that we don't want to screw up the existing ecosystem. We want -- we have a good, stable base of customers, a very successful business, and we don't want to disrupt that. So we'll be more aggressive with the new and we'll go a bit slower with the existing buyers. And eventually, we'll get them both there."

They're not floating in space inside an eBay ecosystem. We are helping those assets quite a bit through the core -- synergies with the core. So again, we'll -- we've never said never to anything. Our job is to create value for shareholders, but this is the right portfolio for the company now, we believe. We'll always evaluate it.

On Payments, we're really happy with where we are. We have some product features and functions to roll out. As we said, PayPal will become a form of payment within managed payments at some point next year. We'll enter the second market at some point next year. But we're completely focused on customer benefits. We are completely focused on driving an integrated product experience at lower cost for sellers and payment choice for buyers, and that's exactly on our road map. And as I said, whatever we are, month, a little more than a month in, and this is going exactly as we would've hoped at this early stage. And what's really encouraging is that we're delivering real benefits to customers. You see it in the form of payment choices buyers are making. You see it in the savings and the feedback that we're getting from sellers. I'm really -- look, it's a long road but it's not that long. I'll remind you that the operating agreement with PayPal is up in June of 2020, and after that, we're free to do whatever we want. And we're racing as fast as we can to deliver customer benefits to get to that date. On EGD, we are investing in delivery. And we're seeing really good results with Guaranteed Delivery, and the share is going up. We're going to keep driving it up. I think the question is, do we need to invest more? I'm not sure right now. It's -- within the framework Scott discussed in '19, we will be making incremental investments in our delivery experience. The one thing I don't think we need to do is deploy large amounts of capital to build a warehouse strategy. I've never thought that. I don't believe that. And I think that we use data and we use the diversity of our inventory to close the gap. And just as one example, as we've said before, 2/3 of packages are delivered within 2 business days in the United States. That's pretty good, particularly given the breadth of our inventory. And we do that without a warehouse strategy. So we're going to keep driving hard to close delivery gaps. We're going to keep driving hard to give customers increased penetration of free, more clarity on tracking and time, but we're on the right trajectory. Customers are responding well to that."

Let me start by saying this again. We are the only marketplace in the world that handles payments and checkout the way that we do because of the very unique relationship and history with PayPal. So I absolutely believe, aside from the direct economics, that we will have more buyers because there are many buyers in many jurisdictions where they have a preferred means of payment that we don't offer. And this unique situation of, in essence, of favoring/requiring PayPal for buyers, look, I think PayPal is a great company and there are a lot of customers who want to use PayPal and they will be able to. But there are -- we could give you dozens of examples of other payment choices that people want to make that we don't make available today, and we're going to as this rolls out. On the seller side, I don't want to minimize that as well. We need to reduce sellers' costs. We need to deliver an integrated product experience. Every other marketplace that you can mention, every other digital marketplace, handles the way that they provide information to their sellers or their drivers or their home renters in one place. They say, here's your transactions and here's where the money went. Only in this eBay world do we say, here are your transactions and then go somewhere else to figure out where the money went. It really makes no sense, and that's the essence of what we're doing. We're going to bring it together for sellers. That means better economics for sellers and more competitiveness and ultimately a better checkout experience not just on payment choice but seamless checkout. I am very optimistic that when we get there to the other side, and the majority of our transaction volume is through managed payments, we won't just pick up the direct economics of it. We'll also pick up a better experience, and we'll see a direct impact on accelerating Marketplace dynamics."

For example, you've spotlighted in the past the share of new product on eBay, whereas eBay clearly has already strong differentiation among older or used segments in retail. And then you mentioned also the economic benefit to sellers from managed payments, Devin. I wonder, is there any thought with the ramp in Advertising, if there are also opportunities to stimulate additional seller listing activity through perhaps varied Marketplace pricing? Or are you satisfied with the current pricing structure as it stands?"

On the seller base, I don't -- our business seller base continues to grow, and we're really happy with our inventory mix. We continue to grow the inventory on the Marketplace.

On the seller base, I don't -- our business seller base continues to grow, and we're really happy with our inventory mix. We continue to grow the inventory on the Marketplace. If anything, this has been more of a demand side issue than a supply side issue over the last year. It's been the constraint on faster growth. It's been more demand side than supply side. I think the one caveat to that is something that we've talked about on prior calls, which is we continue to see good traction with brands, and we continue to evolve our brand experience so that brands have a comfortable place to sit within the eBay Marketplace. And by brands, I don't just mean direct from brands but authorized resellers as well. So just recently, in the last couple of weeks, we rolled out a new direct from brand, direct from authorized reseller experience that you can see on the Marketplace. And the number of brands continues to grow because brands want choice. They want to sell on a marketplace that has 177 million customers and doesn't compete with them. And that's pretty rare, and we're almost the only game in town that can say that. On the Payments side -- or on the Promoted Listings side, again, I think it may be that we can acquire different types of inventory over time. But right now, we're seeing good traction with SMBs. We're seeing good traction with brands. We continue to grow on that. eBay has never been bigger in the number of business, sellers or the amount of inventory as it is today. So I -- there may be opportunities, but again, I think more of the approach is how we approach the buyer side and navigate this divide between the existing and the new customers. And that's kind of where some of the focus was in our remarks."

It seems to me that would be an important one for expanding that group of users, but I would just love to hear a little bit more about that. And then, Devin, just to come back to your branding campaign, I think that some of the key themes there are expecting results to take a little bit more time, certainly, and also targeting it a little bit more towards new buyers, clearly. I'm curious about some of the creative, some of the messaging you talked about, highlighting it as a major e-commerce destination. And while I'm certain I haven't seen all of the ads you're running, I've seen some, and I know they're oftentimes featuring major brands that are selling on the platform as well. I wonder, do you see the messaging changing to focus a little bit more on educating those new buyers on some of the elements of eBay that they maybe don't know that it is just yet? For example, the level of fixed priced sales, the levels of Guaranteed Delivery, the levels of new goods sold. I'd just be curious to see on how the messaging may change in addition to the targeting."

I don't have the exact breakdown of Promoted Listings Lite versus Promoted Listings, but I don't think it's that meaningful a distinction. It's just some of that was just the way we segmented the product to allow consumers to adopt, and I think they're both basically a promoted listing placement. There's no difference in pricing, monetization or anything else. So I'd say that we continue to see good traction across the board with Promoted Listings. And as we said, we'll continue to as we drive triple-digit growth in that area. On the brand, we continue to evolve it. I'd also distinguish. When you run a brand campaign, what gets the most attention is a TV spot, but TV's only one element of it. There are multiple aspects to it. There is social. There is the way we reach people through CRM. There is even the on-site experience is brand. For me, what brand is, is about educating people about eBay, not about a particular thing that we're asking them to buy or sell. And yes, that message will continue to evolve. You'll see an evolution for holiday. You'll start to see the evolution even in the next few weeks as we evolve the campaign to be more direct. I think what's important is that eBay is a dynamic, vibrant place. We don't want the messages to be boring. There's a role for tutorials, and there's a role for brand. eBay is a dynamic, exciting marketplace. We want to convey that while conveying our relevance and the attributes of our business as they exist in 2018. So we're trying to get both of those right. And yes, you'll see it continue to evolve, and we've got a full plan for this holiday across all channels. And we'll do a lot of what you just said in various medium starting in the next few weeks."

On the first part, look, I think this period is a transitional period as we both move the base along to a significant evolution of our platform and prepare for what I hope will be an exciting 2020 and beyond. So no, I don't think it's a permanent approach. I think it's the most prudent approach given where we are now to get through whatever it is, 12, 15 months. But I do still believe we'll be able to drive acceleration in the core business and then drive 2 big businesses on top of that. Many of them, as we said, for various reasons, don't really show up and make a material impact until 2020 and beyond. But I think this is the most prudent approach for this transitional period that we're in. On tariffs, I get there's a lot in that question. I guess you're talking about tariffs generally, about China, about the postal changes. I mean, I'd say on tariffs themselves, they've had very little impact. Most of the tariffs have  been consumer goods, and we haven't seen very much. On the proposed changes to the China import on the postal side, we don't -- it's a little early on that, but I'd point a couple of things. We actually think we're pretty well positioned if those changes take fruition. A majority of our China inventory is now warehoused in the United States. Obviously, they're not our warehouses, but we've helped our Chinese sellers with warehousing domestically. So that wouldn't be subject to those corridors. We've also, this year, rolled out a shipping service called SpeedPak. And SpeedPak gives China sellers multiple delivery options that don't -- wouldn't be subject to the proposed postal changes. So I wouldn't say there's no impact. But actually in some ways, if the changes happen for everyone importing China inventory, we think we're about the best positioned given that we've been in this business for a long time, and we've taken a lot of changes to shrink time and distance and cost for Chinese sellers and build diversity at the last mile."

Underlying these results, GMV on our Marketplace platform grew 5%. Our StubHub platform grew volume at 7%, and our Classified platform grew revenue at 11%. Scott will go into more detail on our financial results in his section.
We continue to make foundational investments to improve the long-term health and competitiveness of our Marketplace this quarter while setting the stage for significant growth opportunities in Payments and Advertising. New eBay users are responding well to the evolution of our platform. But as we mentioned last quarter, our existing buyer base has been slower to adapt to these changes. This has limited our ability to scale some new experiences.
And as we plan coming into Q3, we made significant marketing investments this quarter, with a focus on buyer incentives and top-of-funnel activities such as our brand campaign. While some of these activities were successful and will scale, others did not deliver a sufficient return. These dynamics, coupled with the impact of a strong dollar on our U.S. export business, led to a 2 point deceleration in Marketplace volume growth this quarter.
Setting eBay up for future growth requires us to continue to build a comprehensive catalog, further simplify and improve the user experience and address customer imperatives such as trust in shipping. It also requires that we redefine perceptions of eBay's brand and business. Given that we have a large, stable and successful business but must also build for the future, we're shifting our tactics to balance the needs of a habituated base of customers who are used to shopping on eBay in a certain way while pursuing an even larger base of potential customers who have different expectations. We'll continue to focus on delivering significant product experience changes for new customers while evolving the experience for our existing base of users at a more measured pace.
Similarly, we'll continue to market our brand, but we plan to target our marketing to focus more heavily on acquiring new buyers while reducing our overall investment. We expect that this will result in slower growth for a period of time as we grow our user base and change the mix of customers. However, this will also allow us to deliver strong earnings growth over this period of time through operational margin expansion and ongoing aggressive capital return while positioning the business for stronger growth in 2020 as Payments and Advertising continue to ramp.
Let me now discuss some of the progress we're making to improve the eBay user experience. Structured data powered services are delivering benefits in SCO, consumer selling flows, price recommendations and new shipping services. We've taken the next step in building our comprehensive catalog by enabling sellers to contribute product information to our catalog for the first time, which will improve accuracy and coverage over time. And we continue testing new iterations of product-based commerce to find a balanced experience that drives higher conversion for both our new and existing consumers.
Ultimately, achieving this balance is the key to enabling a scaled rollout for the experience. One of our key initiatives is to improve the shipping experience on eBay, and that's Guaranteed Delivery. This experience continues to gain share in the U.S., exiting the quarter with 9% of U.S. volume, and we recently launched this service in Australia. We're also reducing friction across our platform, simplifying registration and checkout while allowing unregistered users to save searches and add items to watch list without the need for an account. And we continue to scale our new consumer listing flow, which leverages our catalog to simplify the selling process, which is leading to improved conversion of sale.
Looking at marketing. We rolled out the latest iteration of our brand campaign this quarter. We plan to continue activation of our brand messages, which highlight eBay as a mainstream commerce destination across multiple channels throughout the holiday shopping period. But we will further target and segment marketing spend, driving efficiency in our overall investment.
As we've discussed previously, Advertising and Payments are 2 significant opportunities in front of us. Our total Marketplace Advertising portfolio is expected to top $600 million this year. Within this, we expect Promoted Listings to represent approximately $180 million. The strong growth of Promoted Listings has enabled us to continue to reduce our reliance on nonstrategic third-party advertising. In Q3, we began expanding Promoted Listing placements, and we've seen positive results across the board. We now have over 400,000 sellers promoting over 160 million listings, leading to revenue growth of 120%. We have further aggressive expansion plans for this service, and we believe that our total Advertising portfolio has the potential to contribute $1 billion in annual revenue in the next few years.
Looking at Payments. We're a month into our multiyear managed payment journey, and we are more excited than ever about this opportunity. Our new experience is live, and it's working well in the U.S. With an early product, we have over 3,000 sellers enabled -- and they have enabled 900,000 transactions and 38 million of GMV thus far, which represents an annual run rate of over $0.5 billion. From the buyer perspective, our guest checkout buyers who have historically indexed to credit card payments are showing higher conversion, and Apple Pay already has a 12% share of addressable volume.
As I've said previously, managing our payments flow will allow us to simplify the end-to-end experience for buyers and sellers. In particular, most sellers can expect reduced cost for payment processing with a simplified selling process and access to more buyers who will have more payment choices. Sellers are already realizing significant savings and a simpler interface with one place to manage their eBay business. We're working to expand the program with more sellers driving more volume and realizing more savings as we ramp to 5% in the U.S. At the same time, we'll continue to improve the experience, implementing new features and functionality, including new payment methods such as PayPal.
Shifting focus to other platforms. StubHub delivered modest volume acceleration in Q3, driven primarily by strength in concerts, partially offset by a weaker NFL performance. And Classified growth accelerated as well with continued strength in our German platforms, Kleinanzeigen and mobile.
In summary, we will continue to make investments to improve the long-term health and competitiveness of our Marketplace. We are evolving our approach and plan to further target our product and marketing resources to address the needs of both new and existing users. At the same time, we will invest aggressively to deliver significant growth opportunities in Payments and in Advertising. While this will result in a period of slower top line growth, we will grow operating income through margin expansion, and we'll continue to aggressively return capital to deliver strong earnings growth.
Let me now turn to Scott to provide more details on our quarterly financial results and on our outlook."

Let's begin with Q3 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q3, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS and $381 million of free cash flow while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.Movi",1698,"Thanks, Devin. Let's begin with Q3 performance, starting on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. In Q3, we generated $2.6 billion of total revenue, $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS and $381 million of free cash flow while repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.
Moving to active buyers. In the quarter, we increased our total active buyer base to 177 million. Our trailing 12-month growth was 4%, stable versus the prior quarter, driving 2 million incremental active buyers.
On Slide 6, in Q3, we enabled $22.7 billion of total GMV, up 5%, decelerating 2 points versus the prior quarter. By geography, the U.S. generated $9 billion of GMV, up 3%, while international delivered $13.7 billion of GMV, up 7%.
Moving to revenue. We generated total net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 6% on an FX-neutral basis and up 5% organically. We delivered $2.1 billion of transaction revenue, up 5%, and $560 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 7%.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Marketplace's platform grew GMV by 5% in Q3, a 2 point deceleration versus the prior quarter. U.S. GMV grew 2%, decelerating 4 points quarter-over-quarter. While we anticipated some export headwinds coming into the quarter based on U.S. dollar strength, our product and marketing efforts did not scale to the extent we expected to offset this pressure. Underlying these GMV dynamics, volume bought by U.S. buyers, or GMV, grew 5% in Q3, a 1 point deceleration versus Q2. And while not to our aspirations, it decelerated more modestly than GMV. International GMV was stable at 7% with a full quarter from our Japan acquisition offsetting modest deceleration in the U.K. and other small markets. Total Marketplace revenue was $2.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year.
Transaction revenue grew 5%, in line with GMV, with Promoted Listings growing 120% and contributing over a point of growth to transaction revenue. Transaction take rate is slightly higher year-over-year due to the favorable impact of hedging activity and strong Promoted Listings growth, offset by geographic and category mix dynamics. Marketing Services & Other revenue grew 3%, an acceleration of 1 point versus the prior quarter.
Moving to Slide 9. Total GMV for StubHub grew 7%, accelerating 2 points from Q2, while revenue grew 7%.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q3, Classifieds grew revenue 11%, a 1 point acceleration versus Q2.
On major cost drivers, in Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 26.4%, down 2 points versus the prior year, net of approximately 1 point of foreign exchange favorability. Cost of revenue increased nearly 1 point year-over-year, driven primarily by our first-party inventory program in Korea.
Q3 sales and marketing expense was up over 3 points, driven by marketing and promotional spending on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms and the addition of our Japan acquisition. Product development costs were down 1 point due to increased productivity across our product initiatives even as we redeploy into strategic opportunities such as managed payments and first-party advertising. G&A was down nearly 1 point through operating leverage, our fourth consecutive quarter of G&A productivity.
Turning to EPS on Slide 12. In Q3, we delivered $0.56 of non-GAAP EPS, up 19% versus prior year. EPS growth was driven by volume growth and the net benefit of share repurchases and a lower tax rate, offset by our investments in managed payments, marketing and Japan. Our non-GAAP tax rate was lower than expected due to the benefit of discrete items. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.73, up $0.25 versus last year. This includes a $313 million gain on the sale of our Flipkart stake and $126 million gain recognized due to the change in the fair value of a warrant agreement. Stock-based compensation for the quarter, including related taxes, was $127 million, up 7% as we continue to utilize equity programs to compete for talent in a highly competitive environment.
While our non-GAAP financial results excludes stock-based compensation, we take a considered approach to granting stock, and per our capital allocation strategy, we are committed to offsetting this dilution via stock repurchases. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q3, we generated $381 million of free cash flow, which was down 47% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by a Flipkart cash tax payment and the timing of working capital flows pushing into Q4. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q3 and we now expect to be in the range of 6% to 7% of revenue for the year.
Turning to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $9 billion, which includes the net Flipkart proceeds of nearly $1 billion. During Q3, as part of our ongoing commitment to capital return, we repurchased $1 billion of our stock. We ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, and you can expect us to continue to be aggressive buyers of our own stock.
Turning to our Q4 guidance on Slide 15. We are projecting revenue between $2.85 billion and $2.89 billion, representing organic FX-neutral growth of 4% to 5%. Implied in our guidance is continued pressure on Marketplace volume growth, driven by ongoing export pressure from the stronger dollar and similar dynamics with our product and marketing efforts.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 to $0.69 per share, representing growth of 14% to 18% on an as-reported basis. EPS growth will be driven by top line growth, the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program, foreign exchange and a lower tax rate, partially offset by our investments in managed payments in Japan. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.87 to $0.92 per share. This includes a $389 million benefit resulting from an adjustment to the deferred income tax effects of the U.S. tax reform, reducing the provisional amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.
For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $10.72 billion to $10.76 billion, representing organic FX-neutral revenue growth of approximately 6%. We expect operating margin in the range of 27% to 28% and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.29 to $2.31 per share.
We now expect free cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. This is lower than our previous guidance due primarily to the Flipkart cash tax payment. While our free cash flow in 2018 has been negatively impacted by a number of cash tax payments related to the effects of U.S. tax reform and the Flipkart sale, the underlying cash flow dynamics of the company have not changed. And we are updating our full year GAAP EPS guidance to $2.62 to $2.67 per share.
Given our recent performance and the shift in our approach that Devin referenced in his remarks, we thought it would be helpful to give some initial context on our expectations for 2019. First, we will exit this year having delivered approximately 6% FX-neutral organic revenue growth, which is 1 point below the low end of our original guidance range of 7% to 9%. That said, we still expect to deliver between $2.29 and $2.31 per share of non-GAAP EPS, which is at or above the upper end of our original EPS guidance range of $2.25 to $2.30 per share.
As we look forward to 2019, we believe it is prudent to manage our product and marketing costs to better align to our growth profile. At the same time, we have 2 significant growth opportunities in Advertising and Payments that require ongoing investment.
In Advertising, we will continue to drive significant growth in Promoted Listings, providing our sellers with new tools to drive growth while increasing adoption, coverage and monetization. We expect Promoted Listings to double in 2019, which will benefit Marketplace transaction revenue growth by more than 1 point, while seeing more modest declines in our nonstrategic third-party Advertising. As Devin mentioned, we believe our overall ad portfolio could easily generate $1 billion of revenue a few years from now.
With Payments, as we highlighted earlier, we are seeing good traction in our first test market. Prices for participating sellers are lower, and we have leveraged our scale to negotiate beneficial pricing on processing costs. Based on our early results, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on an annual revenue opportunity of over $2 billion with incremental operating profit of approximately $0.5 billion once the majority of the volume on our core Marketplace platform has transitioned.
Looking at buyer payment preferences. As expected, we have seen some friction from buyers who are accustomed to paying with PayPal, which was required on eBay for a number of years. However, we are seeing higher conversion with buyers who are more accustomed to paying with a credit card. As a frame of reference, eBay guest users who are offered all payment methods, including PayPal, choose to pay with a credit or a debit card nearly 80% of the time. And at StubHub, where buyers have similar choice of payment methods, we already see 90% using credit cards for their transactions.
Additionally, buyers are excited about alternative payments like Apple Pay, where we are already seeing strong adoption with more than 1 in 10 customers on the iPhone and iPad choosing Apple Pay. These data points reinforce our belief that buyers ultimately want payment choice for their e-commerce transactions. 
Finally, we've hit our product milestones so far and expect to invest approximately $0.05 of EPS in 2018.
With all of this as context, our preliminary 2019 expectations are to grow GMV and revenue in the low to mid-single digits. With growth at these lower levels, we expect to drive margin expansion and solid operating income growth while making significant in payments -- investments in Payments and our Advertising capabilities. We will continue to return capital to shareholders at accelerated levels similar to this year while deploying capital to grow the M&A. This should ultimately result in double-digit EPS growth in the low to midteens.
We will give more detailed 2019 guidance on our January earnings call as per our normal process. And now we'd be happy to answer questions."

I mean, that is, in essence, the opportunity, what you just said, which is for the last period of time we've been growing in triple digits, as we said, we expect to continue to grow in triple digits next year, and I think that there are opportunities on both the source and the demand side. So on the source side, we continue to see more and more sellers adopt this. We're opening it up to more placements, and we're opening it up to more opportunities for sellers to promote their listings. So as an example, for a long period of time, consumer sellers didn't have that opportunity. Now they do. And business sellers are getting more chances in different parts of our product flows to promote at their option. I'll remind you that promoting a listing is an option for a seller. It's not a requirement. On the other side, ultimately, we've moved to fixed placements within both search and merchandising and some wares on our view item page. But I think that where it will ultimately move is that an algorithm will decide. There won't be fixed positions. There will ultimately be a unified way that we can monetize pixels on every screen. And there may be some flows where it doesn't make sense to have any Promoted Listings because of cannibalization, and there may be other flows where they may all be promoted because that's the highest way that we can monetize on behalf of not only ourselves but on behalf of our sellers. So there is a lot of runway. I mean, I really think we're in the first inning of this, and we're -- I want to also be clear, we're going to be very careful of the buyer experience. We don't think a good buyer experience is to have every pixel on every page promoted. We've done a lot of good work simplifying and clarifying relevance and personalization. We don't want Promoted Listings to undermine it, but we don't think that it will. And we think we have so much runway for buyers and sellers on this that it will be -- as we said in the prepared remarks, Advertising and Payments are 2 big new businesses on top of the existing eBay business."

Look, I think as context, remember last year, we held marketing flat as a percentage of revenue while as we entered 2018, talked about leaning into marketing throughout the year really on a number of different fronts. And to your question, some of these have worked out well and others haven't, and just let me try and break down a few. First off, as we entered the year and a little bit last year, we were spending on what we would call seller incentives or inventory incentives. And as we diagnosed the different cohorts and tranches of those customers and those transactions, what we've seen is that the CLV in those are lower. And so the ROIs aren't as good over time. And so what you'll see as we head forward is less of that. Another aspect is the kind of middle of funnel, if you will, driving more buyers to the ecosystem. And those are -- candidly, there's not one ROI within that ecosystem. There's a number of different ways you can measure it, and there's not one answer. Some lower-priced coupons for buyers have worked really well. Some higher-priced ones haven't worked as well, et cetera. But we continue to work on refining the ROIs, the appropriate level of spend, making sure we're focused on both activity per buyer as well as new buyer acquisition. And finally, we shifted a fair amount of our spend to upper funnel, if you will, brand, not just TV, but social and others. And obviously, that just takes longer. I'll let Devin weigh in on those aspects of it, but I think overall, we're still committed to a brand campaign. But the reality is, is it's going to take longer, and we expected that going into it. As related to that, to the outlook, what you can expect is that next year, we'll be getting leverage off of the 2018 base, reducing our marketing as a percentage of revenue and kind of deploying within those 3 buckets, as I talked about. Devin, you want to weigh in on the brand and then I'll take the last one."

Certain of our services have been well received across the board, and others have been -- take more time. And an example of something that takes more time that is really going well with new customers but is taking more time is full product-based commerce experience, where we fully compress the product side. What we see is that, as you would expect, new customers who don't -- haven't shopped with eBay before come to it and they respond very well to that. Existing customers, some of them shop on eBay, they've been shopping at eBay for 20 years, so it's a new experience. And there's always some friction when you change an experience. I think some of it is time and habituation. Some of it is education. And as we said, our approach is going to change a little bit, which does slow things down a bit, and that is we'll go fast with new customers and we'll go slower with the existing base. And over time, the mix will change. So we're still very confident in what we're doing, and we do believe that the existing base will evolve and it will come along. But we are very conscious that we don't want to screw up the existing ecosystem. We want -- we have a good, stable base of customers, a very successful business, and we don't want to disrupt that. So we'll be more aggressive with the new and we'll go a bit slower with the existing buyers. And eventually, we'll get them both there."

And as I said, whatever we are, month, a little more than a month in, and this is going exactly as we would've hoped at this early stage. And what's really encouraging is that we're delivering real benefits to customers. You see it in the form of payment choices buyers are making. You see it in the savings and the feedback that we're getting from sellers. I'm really -- look, it's a long road but it's not that long. I'll remind you that the operating agreement with PayPal is up in June of 2020, and after that, we're free to do whatever we want. And we're racing as fast as we can to deliver customer benefits to get to that date. On EGD, we are investing in delivery. And we're seeing really good results with Guaranteed Delivery, and the share is going up. We're going to keep driving it up. I think the question is, do we need to invest more? I'm not sure right now. It's -- within the framework Scott discussed in '19, we will be making incremental investments in our delivery experience. The one thing I don't think we need to do is deploy large amounts of capital to build a warehouse strategy. I've never thought that. I don't believe that. And I think that we use data and we use the diversity of our inventory to close the gap. And just as one example, as we've said before, 2/3 of packages are delivered within 2 business days in the United States. That's pretty good, particularly given the breadth of our inventory. And we do that without a warehouse strategy. So we're going to keep driving hard to close delivery gaps. We're going to keep driving hard to give customers increased penetration of free, more clarity on tracking and time, but we're on the right trajectory. Customers are responding well to that."

Let me start by saying this again. We are the only marketplace in the world that handles payments and checkout the way that we do because of the very unique relationship and history with PayPal. So I absolutely believe, aside from the direct economics, that we will have more buyers because there are many buyers in many jurisdictions where they have a preferred means of payment that we don't offer. And this unique situation of, in essence, of favoring/requiring PayPal for buyers, look, I think PayPal is a great company and there are a lot of customers who want to use PayPal and they will be able to. But there are -- we could give you dozens of examples of other payment choices that people want to make that we don't make available today, and we're going to as this rolls out. On the seller side, I don't want to minimize that as well. We need to reduce sellers' costs. We need to deliver an integrated product experience. Every other marketplace that you can mention, every other digital marketplace, handles the way that they provide information to their sellers or their drivers or their home renters in one place. They say, here's your transactions and here's where the money went. Only in this eBay world do we say, here are your transactions and then go somewhere else to figure out where the money went. It really makes no sense, and that's the essence of what we're doing. We're going to bring it together for sellers. That means better economics for sellers and more competitiveness and ultimately a better checkout experience not just on payment choice but seamless checkout. I am very optimistic that when we get there to the other side, and the majority of our transaction volume is through managed payments, we won't just pick up the direct economics of it. We'll also pick up a better experience, and we'll see a direct impact on accelerating Marketplace dynamics."

So we'll buy something when it can add to our organic future but not to replace it. We have a lot of confidence on the path we're on. And if M&A can supplement that, then that's great, we'll do it. But we don't -- if implicit in the question was we have to buy something to replace the path we're on, we don't believe that at all. And I think for our investors, they don't want us to do that.

For example, you've spotlighted in the past the share of new product on eBay, whereas eBay clearly has already strong differentiation among older or used segments in retail. And then you mentioned also the economic benefit to sellers from managed payments, Devin. I wonder, is there any thought with the ramp in Advertising, if there are also opportunities to stimulate additional seller listing activity through perhaps varied Marketplace pricing? Or are you satisfied with the current pricing structure as it stands?"

On the seller base, I don't -- our business seller base continues to grow, and we're really happy with our inventory mix. We continue to grow the inventory on the Marketplace.

On the seller base, I don't -- our business seller base continues to grow, and we're really happy with our inventory mix. We continue to grow the inventory on the Marketplace. If anything, this has been more of a demand side issue than a supply side issue over the last year. It's been the constraint on faster growth. It's been more demand side than supply side. I think the one caveat to that is something that we've talked about on prior calls, which is we continue to see good traction with brands, and we continue to evolve our brand experience so that brands have a comfortable place to sit within the eBay Marketplace. And by brands, I don't just mean direct from brands but authorized resellers as well. So just recently, in the last couple of weeks, we rolled out a new direct from brand, direct from authorized reseller experience that you can see on the Marketplace. And the number of brands continues to grow because brands want choice. They want to sell on a marketplace that has 177 million customers and doesn't compete with them. And that's pretty rare, and we're almost the only game in town that can say that. On the Payments side -- or on the Promoted Listings side, again, I think it may be that we can acquire different types of inventory over time. But right now, we're seeing good traction with SMBs. We're seeing good traction with brands. We continue to grow on that. eBay has never been bigger in the number of business, sellers or the amount of inventory as it is today. So I -- there may be opportunities, but again, I think more of the approach is how we approach the buyer side and navigate this divide between the existing and the new customers. And that's kind of where some of the focus was in our remarks."

Could you maybe give us an update specifically on Promoted Listings Lite? I know that was a bit of a follow-up rollout and a bit more of a slimmed-down product. It seems to me that would be an important one for expanding that group of users, but I would just love to hear a little bit more about that. And then, Devin, just to come back to your branding campaign, I think that some of the key themes there are expecting results to take a little bit more time, certainly, and also targeting it a little bit more towards new buyers, clearly. I'm curious about some of the creative, some of the messaging you talked about, highlighting it as a major e-commerce destination. And while I'm certain I haven't seen all of the ads you're running, I've seen some, and I know they're oftentimes featuring major brands that are selling on the platform as well. I wonder, do you see the messaging changing to focus a little bit more on educating those new buyers on some of the elements of eBay that they maybe don't know that it is just yet? For example, the level of fixed priced sales, the levels of Guaranteed Delivery, the levels of new goods sold. I'd just be curious to see on how the messaging may change in addition to the targeting."

I don't have the exact breakdown of Promoted Listings Lite versus Promoted Listings, but I don't think it's that meaningful a distinction. It's just some of that was just the way we segmented the product to allow consumers to adopt, and I think they're both basically a promoted listing placement. There's no difference in pricing, monetization or anything else. So I'd say that we continue to see good traction across the board with Promoted Listings. And as we said, we'll continue to as we drive triple-digit growth in that area. On the brand, we continue to evolve it. I'd also distinguish. When you run a brand campaign, what gets the most attention is a TV spot, but TV's only one element of it. There are multiple aspects to it. There is social. There is the way we reach people through CRM. There is even the on-site experience is brand. For me, what brand is, is about educating people about eBay, not about a particular thing that we're asking them to buy or sell. And yes, that message will continue to evolve. You'll see an evolution for holiday. You'll start to see the evolution even in the next few weeks as we evolve the campaign to be more direct. I think what's important is that eBay is a dynamic, vibrant place. We don't want the messages to be boring. There's a role for tutorials, and there's a role for brand. eBay is a dynamic, exciting marketplace. We want to convey that while conveying our relevance and the attributes of our business as they exist in 2018. So we're trying to get both of those right. And yes, you'll see it continue to evolve, and we've got a full plan for this holiday across all channels. And we'll do a lot of what you just said in various medium starting in the next few weeks."

On the first part, look, I think this period is a transitional period as we both move the base along to a significant evolution of our platform and prepare for what I hope will be an exciting 2020 and beyond. So no, I don't think it's a permanent approach. I think it's the most prudent approach given where we are now to get through whatever it is, 12, 15 months. But I do still believe we'll be able to drive acceleration in the core business and then drive 2 big businesses on top of that. Many of them, as we said, for various reasons, don't really show up and make a material impact until 2020 and beyond. But I think this is the most prudent approach for this transitional period that we're in. On tariffs, I get there's a lot in that question. I guess you're talking about tariffs generally, about China, about the postal changes. I mean, I'd say on tariffs themselves, they've had very little impact. Most of the tariffs have been consumer goods, and we haven't seen very much. On the proposed changes to the China import on the postal side, we don't -- it's a little early on that, but I'd point a couple of things. We actually think we're pretty well positioned if those changes take fruition. A majority of our China inventory is now warehoused in the United States. Obviously, they're not our warehouses, but we've helped our Chinese sellers with warehousing domestically. So that wouldn't be subject to those corridors. We've also, this year, rolled out a shipping service called SpeedPak. And SpeedPak gives China sellers multiple delivery options that don't -- wouldn't be subject to the proposed postal changes. So I wouldn't say there's no impact. But actually in some ways, if the changes happen for everyone importing China inventory, we think we're about the best positioned given that we've been in this business for a long time, and we've taken a lot of changes to shrink time and distance and cost for Chinese sellers and build diversity at the last mile."
