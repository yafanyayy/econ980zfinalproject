We appreciate your interest in CME Group. 2017 was certainly an unusual year. Virtually every asset class experienced reduced volatility. So throughout the year, we focused on areas that we could control. That included adding new products, operating all of our markets in the most efficient manner and expanding our global customer base. We were aggressive in optimizing our operations. As you know, we sold investments we had in other exchanges, we wound down our European exchange and clearing house, we announced the exit of our credit default swaps clearing business and we focused on making investments in new product launches as well as our market data, audit and derived data functions. 
Focusing on increasing the efficiency of the organization has resulted in an another successful year of reducing our total controllable costs, while continuing to invest for the future. We also continued to evolve our sales strategy to help generate additional business and acquire new customers. Specific global sales campaigns were developed across every product area. We measured that success by tracking additional metrics. These efforts drove non-U.S. average daily volume up 10% for the year. This was achieved despite difficult comparables from the election year 2016. 
Also, we had 11% growth in our options franchise driven by increased trading on rollbacks. During 2017, we reach all-time highs in total open interest, along with records for the number of large open interest holders in several asset classes. This bodes well as market volatility normalizes. 
As we begin 2018, we saw all 6 product areas post solid growth in January as we continued to execute on our strategy. We also have seen open interest levels rise as our global clients are actively managing risk. These 2 measurements are extremely encouraging as we begin the year. 
With that, we'd like to open for your questions -- open the call for your questions. And I know we have a number of analysts that cover is so we ask that you ask one question and then get back into the queue. With that, we'll open it up for the questions."

So in terms of the tax reform, we've been very pleased with the tax reform we believe is good for our customers, intermediaries and good for the markets. In terms of what we're planning on doing with tax reform -- with the tax reform and additional cash flow, we're not specifically earmarking anything. We've given out our expense and CapEx guidance, which is increasing this year versus over the last several years. And this provides us more financial flexibility. In terms of the expense guidance, it's often in line with what we've been communicating, which is in the low single digits. The majority of the increase is driven by compensation. It's the usual cost-of-living increasing -- increases, the staffing related to growth initiatives. And finally, within our expense guidance, there is a change in pension accounting, which will impact our top line by about $4 million and there's no offset that we booked in the other income and expense section of our income statement. We haven't changed our capital return policy in light of tax reforms. So it's -- we think it's very positive. It's positive for our customers. And we think that it'll be helpful for all intermediaries and the customers."

We're chock-full of record I could point to doing in the we sent you guys. Going from a very strong record year in 2017, as you pointed out we started a record year so far and '18. What we're seeing is broad-based growth across the entire energy complex. We spend a lot of time spending WTI, we're -- actually have just posted a new record ABB-month in January, inclusive of not just WTI but also our gasoline contracts and heating level that we set multiple open interest record as well. What's really driving that is both broad-based participation but our record non-U.S. participation. You heard us talk about focusing on electronic fund our markets to be able to access a non-U.S. customer base. And in some of the documentations we've provided you guys, we're showing a significant growth in the non-U.S. participation of our markets. That is continuing into January of this year. Q4 of last year, the energy business was up 40% in customers from outside the U.S. But that's a function of the sales campaign that Terry referred to earlier. The efforts or investments we've made in the front-end of technology to access customers to provide liquidity 24/7 and we're seeing that flow through across into our commercial customer base, which has been the central focus point for the last 2.5 years on the business side and sales side, leveraging our regional sales people. So if you couple that with the results of the U.S. Energy Department figures that were just released yesterday, showing U.S. production topping 10 million barrels a day in production and almost 2 million barrels a day in exports, we see that as the continuing strong structural story behind WTI as the global benchmarking and our waterboarding products."

Last year, we had a record number of large open interest holders and a record open interest in each and every one of the financial asset classes. So continuing to penetrate a much larger customer base, in particular much larger customer base relative to alternative products. Another example we've been talking about continuously over the last few years, is our penetration of the cash treasury bond market. So currently, our treasury futures are trading at about 94.6% of the volume of the cash treasury bond market. That's up from the 80% area in last year and up from 55% if you go back 6 years ago. So we've seen tremendous growth there. This year very exciting again. We've just seen, the last couple of weeks, new record number of large open interest holders in our interest rate complex. We've seen a new record open interest in our foreign exchange complex. And we've seen records in our Eurodollar options on Globex. Actually we had a record day, just a couple of weeks ago. And very interesting thing, nothing we've talked about -- as spoke about earlier is the electronification of our markets, how it gives us much better access to international participants and how when you electronify a market, we see a much higher velocity of growth. So we had -- again, we had a record Eurodollar options volume date earlier this month, one. Two, on that day, very interestingly, we had a 47% electronic market. Not only that, but in fact, we did more volume on the box from Globex on that day than we did on the Eurodollar options, than we did in the pad. So the strategy that we've been following in terms of electronification has absolutely been working in terms of getting more participation, more global participants and higher velocity of growth. So we're very excited about our sales approaches, we're very excited also about the new products. On the new products side, a lot of excitement there with all of the new participants. So we had great growth in our weekly options, a lot of new weekly options. We launched Wednesday Weekly Treasury Options last year. They're doing over 18,000 a day. As you, I think know, in our S&P options over the last 1.5 years, we introduced Monday and Wednesday Weekly Options doing over 90,000 contracts a day. Our Ultra 10 contract, that we launched just a couple of years ago, doing 145,000 contracts a day. 2 years ago, we launched something called BTIC, basis trade index close on our equity complex. This is a functionality allowing participants to trade on the central note order book at a spread to the cash market close. That's trading 39,000 contracts a day in January. It's a very high RBC contract. So the innovation, the electronification, the sales campaigns are all increasing the number of participants. Derrick, I don't know if you want to jump in?"

Really our focal points in energy and we've got -- with so many records, future told me to stop sending them data to put into this thing, so I won't touch on those. Really the drivers behind the growth, I talked about the commercial customers, that has been our singular focal point from almost 2.5 years. And if you look at the growth, it's not just the volumes but the growth of the open interest and the large open interest holders and the data is in the deck, it shows you the success we're having in globally penetrating end-user customers. The breadth of our product portfolio in energy I mentioned before, not just crude oil in WTI but our nap gas, our gasoline contract, [ ARBA ], our heat oil contract, we're having a total franchise open interest record and volume record overall in both energy and metals, in January. So the strength continues. And I think true on the other side as well, particular strength in our industrial Metals in copper. The overlay to all of this, and Sean mentioned this as well is, you've heard us talking about focusing on growing our options complex. And options continues to accelerate and strengthen our order book in the futures as options traders tend to hedge their exposure in our underlying futures. And if you look at our starting point in January of '18, we came off a total year record in ADV for 2017 and we're setting an all-time options record in January of '18 as well. Our option ADV was up about 30% in January. And it's particular interesting, when you look at some of the commodities markets price action with the crude up at $65, it's really unclear whether that next $15 move is back to $50, with the [indiscernible] so far coming out of the U.S. or potentially up to $75 with some of the constrictions in the supply chain. That is a perfect environment for options. Our energy options in January is actually up 37%. This is a purpose-built market in fixed income, in energy, in equities for use of options and we've seen that. The investment that we've made in our options business across asset classes, both an accelerant to our underlying growth but it makes our futures value proposition that much more sticky as well. So I would say, despite the volatility profiles, you've seen us grow in low volatility environments, flat volatility environments and now selectively sharply increasing volatility environments. And our limit around here is to add customers, globalize business and enhance our customer experience around our product set."

The crypto market is something -- obviously it's brand new as far as a listed product goes. But I think when we're getting a lot of interest on our product that's been around actually for 9 years now. I think the interest is, obviously, all coming because of the appreciation of the value of their -- the product. And introducing futures to it is actually help mitigate some of the volatility in the product in and of itself. But as far as the regulation goes, we worked closely with the CFTC before we launched this product. We put new standards in place that we don't have on our other contracts such as higher margins, velocity and stop functionalities, similar to what we have on the equity markets on the percentages. So I think it's 7, 13 and 20 that we have on percentages as a market to it -- as the market increases or decreases. So I think, from our standpoint, CFTC, there's been some things in the news lately about how are they going to regulate these types of markets and really it's incumbent upon both of us. We've seen new markets historically, since at least I've been in this business, you can go back to the early '80s with cash settlement, nobody understood really what cash settlement was because every product had to be physically delivered and then people got more comfortable with different methodologies. So you could use that as an example of crypto currencies to some examples. This is new to the marketplace with the exception of as I said earlier, it's 9 years old. And we will continue to work with the regulator and as far as the growth of the product goes, this is one of those latency. The last thing I would ever want to do is to potentially lower the margins and just think that we could effectuate the tremendous amount of trade off of this. This is a very much a walk as we go through this, not run. So we will not do anything in the near term that we think could increase the trade at the point of introducing additional risk to the system. So I don't think if that completely answers your question because this is this topic is so broad and there's so many different opinions on it. So only thing I can say to you is, on the revenue side, it's going to be a, I think, a slow grower, which is fine. It's 1,500 open interest, we're trading 1,000 a day. That's obviously very small compared to the volume the CME Group has today. John referenced some new contracts that are trading 30,000 to 50,000 a day. That's not this product. We're also designing this product as you know to make sure that we do not attract small retail participants, that's not something that we wanted to be a part of. So our contract is much larger than our friends on the streets contract. And I think that is the prudent thing for us to do. So Sean, you can comment on it if you want. But I think from a regulatory standpoint, we're working close with the regulators on a daily basis. And from a revenue standpoint, this is going to be something that we'll be very methodical on."

Thank you for the question. We are very excited about the foreign exchange business. So the foreign exchange business last year, significantly outperforming the largest 2 cash market competitors in terms of volumes. And as I said earlier, we saw several new records, in terms of the large number of open interest holders last year. And we've just seen another one now in January. We were in the process of offering several new product that we're very excited about. We recently launched Wednesday Weekly Options, they actually back-to-back record days couple of weeks ago with the Bank of Canada meeting, of about 10,000 contract a day on the Tuesday and Wednesday of that week around the expiry. Putting that in perspective, we're running around 6% of our entire FX options complex is already being driven by this brand-new Wednesday Weekly expert. So we're really excited about that. In addition to that, we launched last year, monthly futures on our FX complex. So the monthlies are very exciting. Because for the first time, we are -- we have a product that's trading about 10,000 contracts a day. It's going to offer participants an alternative to FX forwards on the [indiscernible] dates as well as the FX swaps. In addition to that, we do expect sometime in the first half, to launch something called CME FX Link. With CME FX Link, we will be offering participants with our partner, Citigroup, which has already been announced, the single largest OTC FX dealer in the world, to bring the OTC markets and the futures markets together. So we're going to be able to trade the basis between spot FX and each of our fund FX future contracts. This is going to allow participants to do FX swaps. Spot FX against each of our monthly futures. So we're excited about being able to penetrate those marketplaces. If you think about the global FX markets and the most recent BIS results, the spot FX market has got about 1.7 trillion a day. Our quarterly FX futures, historically, have gone after that spot market. On the other hand, if you look at the deliverable forwards, the FX swaps and the currency swaps, those marketplaces make up about 3.1 trillion a day of the global OTC FX markets. With our new products, we're also going after those market places and those participants. So we're very excited about our business there, we're very excited about offering participants the lowest total cost most efficient product possible. In FX, the last thing I'd like to say is, we're following the same playbook that we've followed in interest rates. If you look over the last 6 years, what we've accomplished in interest rates is new products. 17% of our interest rate revenue in 2017 actually came from new products launched since 2010. We've been very focused on having a product that is a much lower cost, much better value proposition and getting in new participants. In FX, we're following the same exact playbook. I'm excited to tell you that in December, Greenwich Associates published the study showing that the CME futures, FX futures are far lower total cost, as much as 75% than the OTC market, while representing the same risk. This is the same study that Greenwich Associates published in regards to our interest rate futures back in 2015. So we're very excited about using the same playbook, about offering participants a wider state of products that penetrate a much larger percentage of the marketplace and trying to win over the OTC marketplace."

Relative to their -- there's a structural story in the gas market you've heard us talk about and it's actually absolutely playing out over the course the multiyear horizon. 2017, I think you saw a very tight range from a trading price perspective, we're starting to see that break out. Couple that with what we're seeing and the point you made earlier is it has been a significant structural change in the global natural gas market. Historically, natural gas was priced on an index versus oil. And we've seen that correlation break down as gas itself has been able to separate itself from oil. And now you're seeing a growing infrastructure for exportable Henry Hub gas in the 4-month LNG or liquid natural gas. There's 1 liquefaction plant that's alive down in the Gulf coast and there are actually 3 more coming online in the next 2 years. What that means, driven by the fracking revolution that generally we associate with crude oil and WTI come out of the Permian basin, there is a significant amount of natural gas Henry Hub, price natural gas coming out of the U.S. at a much lower price points. And we are now becoming a swing producer in the global natural gas market just as the U.S. has become the swing producer in the global crude market. The implications of that can, is that we're actually seeing an exportable form of Henry Hub priced, based on Henry Hub gas coming out of the U.S. that will eventually start to see significant shipment outside the U.S. as more of the fraction plans, line. We're seeing that reflected in our own business. Our natural gas business was up 8% to a record last year in 2017. In January, our business is up 55%. Nat gas futures have been at 744,000 contracts a day. As I mentioned, that's contributed overall energy record this year. And the last piece, I think, you talked about ClearPort versus electronic trading or Globex trading. We're actually seeing a shift from broker market -- market structure nat gas options to electronic trading of natural gas options. So not only have we grown our natural gas options business, we've converted that business, I think the first quarter of 2016, about 32% of our natural gas options traded electronically. And in January of this year, so 4 quarters later, that's north of 62%. So that's a market structure shift that is both reflective of the underlying connectivity of the global physical gas market but we're also seeing that reflected in terms of the venue shift from brokers to electronic. And we typically generate better revenues from the Globex-based business. And relative to the total non-U.S. growth in Jan, we're seeing that continue to grow apace. So growth in global participation and user participants at nat gas is following a very similar to what we put in place for WTI net structural story as well. So we're very excited about that. We are also right in the sake of what's called the gas season, natural gas from November to March. So typically, we see volume boost, but this is an outsized growth in January, which getting investments we've made, we think that we can continue to globalize participation as that market connects globally with Henry Hub at its core."

So we're investing in acquiring a global customer base and that typically is positive for our mix shift. Within the customer mix itself, as we focus on our commercial customers, that also typically carries a higher RPC than our base rate. Very few of our biggest commercial customers are actually members -- direct members, they change for various reasons. So as we continue to focus on to that end user customer base, good for the open interest and good for drawing financial participants in, but they also typically carry a high RPC. And finally, from a venue and a products mix perspective, you saw us post a very, very strong natural gas volumes and participation in both January as well as last December, also carries a higher RPC. And as we shift our businesses from brokers to electronic trading, typically that's positive to the RPC as well.

We appreciate your interest in CME Group. 2017 was certainly an unusual year. Virtually every asset class experienced reduced volatility. So throughout the year, we focused on areas that we could control. That included adding new products, operating all of our markets in the most efficient manner and expanding our global customer base. We were aggressive in optimizing our operations. As you know, we sold investments we had in other exchanges, we wound down our European exchange and clearing house, we announced the exit of our credit default swaps clearing business and we focused on making investments in new product launches as well as our market data, audit and derived data functions. 
Focusing on increasing the efficiency [ Audio Gap ] organization has resulted in another successful year of reducing our total controllable costs, while continuing to invest for the future. We also continued to evolve our sales strategy to help generate additional business and acquire new customers. Specific global sales campaigns were developed across every product area. We measured that success by tracking additional metrics. These efforts drove non-U.S. average daily volume up 10% for the year. This was achieved despite difficult comparables from the election year of 2016. 
Also, we had 11% growth in our options franchise driven by increased trading on rollbacks. During 2017, we reached all-time highs in total open interest, along with records for the number of large open interest holders in several asset classes. This bodes well as market volatility normalizes. 
As we begin 2018, we saw all 6 product areas post solid growth in January as we continued to execute on our strategy. We also have seen open interest levels rise as our global clients are actively managing risk. These 2 measurements are extremely encouraging as we begin the year.

In terms of the expense guidance, it's often in line with what we've been communicating, which is in the low single digits. The majority of the increase is driven by compensation. It's the usual cost-of-living increasing -- increases, the staffing related to growth initiatives. And finally, within our expense guidance, there is a change in pension accounting, which will impact our top line by about $4 million and there's no offset that we booked in the other income and expense section of our income statement.

Going from a very strong record year in 2017, as you pointed out we started with a record year so far in '18. What we're seeing is broad-based growth across the entire energy complex. We spend a lot of time talking about WTI, we're -- actually have just posted a new record ADV month in January, inclusive of not just WTI, but also our gasoline contracts and heating oil that we set multiple open interest records in as well. What's really driving that is both broad-based participation and our record non-U.S. participation. You've heard us talk about focusing on electrifying our markets to be able to access a non-U.S. customer base. And in some of the documentation we've provided you guys, we're showing a significant growth in the non-U.S. participation of our markets. That is continuing into January of this year. Q4 of last year, the energy business was up 40% in customers from outside the U.S. But that's a function of the sales campaign that Terry referred to earlier. The efforts or investments we made in the front-end of technology to access customers to provide liquidity 24/7 and we're seeing that flow through across into our commercial customer base, which has been the central focus point for the last 2.5 years on the business side and sales side, leveraging our regional sales people. So if you couple that with the results of the U.S. Energy Department figures that were just released yesterday, showing U.S. production topping 10 million barrels a day in production and almost 2 million barrels a day in exports, we see that as the continuing strong structural story behind WTI as a global benchmark in the waterborne products."

Last year, we had a record number of large open interest holders and a record open interest in each and every one of the financial's asset classes. So continuing to penetrate a much larger customer base, in particular much larger customer base relative to alternative products. Another example we've been talking about continuously over the last few years, is our penetration of the cash Treasury bond market. So currently, our treasury futures are trading about 94.6% of the volume of the cash Treasury bond market. That's up from the 80% area in last year and up from 55% if you go back 6 years ago. So we've seen tremendous growth there. This year very exciting again. We've just seen, the last couple of weeks, new record number of large open interest holders in our interest rate complex. We've seen a new record open interest in our foreign exchange complex. And we've seen records in our Eurodollar options on Globex. Actually we had a record day, just a couple of weeks ago. And very interesting thing, nothing we've talked about -- as spoke about earlier is the electronification of our markets, how it gives us much better access to international participants and how when you electronify a market, we see a much higher velocity of growth. So we had -- again, we had a record Eurodollar options volume date earlier this month, one. Two, on that day, very interestingly, we had a 47% electronic market. Not only that, but in fact, we did more volume on the box from Globex on that day than we did on the Eurodollar options, than we did in the pad. So the strategy that we've been following in terms of the electronification is absolutely working in terms of getting more participants, more global participants and higher velocity of growth. So we're very excited about our sales approaches, we're very excited also about the new products. On the new products side, a lot of excitement there with all of the new participants. So we had great growth in our weekly options, a lot of new weekly options. We launched Wednesday Weekly Treasury Options last year. They're doing over 18,000 a day. As you, I think know, in our S&P options over the last 1.5 years, we introduced Monday and Wednesday Weekly Options doing over 90,000 contracts a day. Our Ultra 10 contract, that we launched just a couple of years ago, doing 145,000 contracts a day. 2 years ago, we launched something called BTIC, basis trade index close on our equity complex. This is a functionality allowing participants to trade on the central limit order book at a spread to the cash market close. That's trading 39,000 contracts a day in January. It's a very high RPC contract. So the innovation, the electronification, the sales campaigns are all increasing the number of participants. Derek, I don't know if you want to jump in?"

Really our focal points in energy and we've got -- with so many records, Peschier told me to stop send them data to put into this thing, so I won't touch on those. Really the drivers behind the growth, I talked about the commercial customers, that has been our singular focal point for almost 2.5 years. And if you look at the growth, it's not just the volumes but the growth of the open interest and the large open interest holders, the data is in the deck, it shows you the success we're having in globally penetrating end-user customers. The breadth of our product portfolio in energy, I mentioned before, not just crude oil in WTI, but our nat gas, our gasoline contract, RBOB, our heating oil contract, we're having a total franchise open interest record and volume record overall in both energy and metals, in January, so the strength continues. And I think the true on the metal side as well, particular strength in our industrial metals in copper. The overlay to all of this, and Sean mentioned this as well is, you've heard us talk about focusing on growing our options complex. And options continues to accelerate and strengthen our order book in futures as options traders tend to hedge their exposures in our underlying futures. And if you look at our starting point in January of '18, we came off a total year record in ADV for 2017, and we're setting an all-time options record in January of '18 as well. Our option ADV overall was up about 30% in January. And it's particularly interesting, when you look at some of the commodities markets price action with crude oil up at $65, it's really unclear whether that next $15 move is back to $50, with the Globex so for coming out of the U.S. or potentially up to $75 with some of the constrictions in the supply chain. That is a perfect environment for options. So our energy options in January is actually up 37%. This is a purpose-built market in fixed income, in energy, in equities for use of options and we've seeing that. The investment that we've made in our options business across asset classes, both an accelerant to our underlying growth, but it makes our futures value proposition that much more sticky as well. So I would say, despite the volatility profiles, you've seen us grow in low volatility environments, flat volatility environments and now selectively sharply increasing volatility environments. And our remit around here is to continue to add customers, globalize business and enhance our customers' experience around our product set."

The crypto market is something -- obviously it's brand new as far as a listed product goes. But I think when we're getting a lot of interest on our product that's been around actually for 9 years now. I think the interest is, obviously, all coming because of the appreciation of the value of the product. And introducing futures to it is, actually, I think, help mitigate some of the volatility in the product in and of itself. But as far as the regulation goes, we worked closely with the CFTC before we launched this product. We put new standards in place that we don't have on our other contracts such as higher margins, velocity and stop functionalities, similar to what we have on the equity markets on the percentages. So I think it's 7, 13 and 20 that we have on percentages as a market to -- market volatility increases or decreases. So I think, from our standpoint, CFTC, there's been some things in the news lately about how are they going to regulate these types of markets and really, I think, it's incumbent upon both of us. We've seen new markets historically, since at least I've been in this business, you can go back to the early '80s with cash settlement, nobody understood really what cash settlement was because every product had to be physically delivered and then people got more comfortable with different methodologies. So you could use that as an example of cryptocurrencies to some example. This is new to the marketplace with the exception of as I said earlier, it's 9 years old. And we will continue to work with the regulator and as far as the growth of the product goes, this is one of those latency. The last thing I would ever want to do is to potentially lower the margins and just think that we could effectuate the tremendous amount of trade off of this. This is a very much a walk as we go through this, not run. So we will not do anything in the near term that we think that could increase the trade at the point of introducing additional risk to the system. So I don't know if that completely answers your question because this is -- this topic is so broad and there are so many different opinions on it. So only thing I can say to you is, on the revenue side, it's going to be a, I think, a slow grower, which is fine. It's 1,500 open interest, we're trading 1,000 a day. That's obviously very small in comparison to the volumes that CME Group has today. John referenced some new contracts that are trading 30,000 to 50,000 a day. That's not this product. We're also designing this product as you know to make sure that we do not attract small retail participants, that's not something that we wanted to be a part of. So our contract is much larger than our friends down the streets contract. And I think that is the prudent thing for us to do. So Sean, you can comment on it if you want. But I think from a regulatory standpoint, we're working close with the regulators on a daily basis. And from a revenue standpoint, this is going to be something that we'll be very methodical on."

Thank you for the question. We're very excited about the foreign exchange business. So the foreign exchange business last year, significantly outperforming the largest 2 cash market competitors in terms of volumes. And as I said earlier, we saw several new records, in terms of the large number of open interest holders last year. And we've just seen another one now in January. We were in the process of offering several new products that we're very excited about. We recently launched Wednesday Weekly Options, they actually had back-to-back record days a couple of weeks ago with the Bank of Canada meeting, of about 10,000 contracts a day on the Tuesday and Wednesday of that week around the expiry. Putting that in perspective, we're running around 6% of our entire FX options complex is already being driven by this brand-new Wednesday Weekly expiry. So we're really excited about that. In addition to that, we launched last year, monthly futures on our FX complex. So the monthlies are very exciting. Because for the first time, we are -- we have a product that's trading about 10,000 contracts a day. It's going to offer participants an alternate to FX forwards on the IMM dates as well as the FX swaps. In addition to that, we do expect sometime in the first half, to launch something called CME FX Link. With CME FX Link, we will be offering participants with our partner, Citigroup, which has already been announced, the single largest OTC FX dealer in the world, to bring the OTC markets and the futures markets together. So we're going to be able to trade the basis between spot FX and each of our fund FX futures contracts. This is going to allow participants to do FX swaps. Spot FX against each of our monthly futures. So we're excited about being able to penetrate those marketplaces. If you think about the global FX markets and the most recent BIS results, the spot FX market is about 1.7 trillion a day. Our quarterly FX futures, historically, have gone after that spot market. On the other hand, if you look at the deliverable forwards, the FX swaps and the currency swaps, those marketplaces make up about 3.1 trillion a day of the global OTC FX markets. With our new products, we're also going after those market places and those participants. So we're very excited about our business there, we're very excited about offering participants the lowest total cost most efficient product possible. In FX, the last thing I'd like to say is, we're following the same playbook that we've followed in interest rates. If you look over the last 6 years, what we've accomplished in interest rates is new products. 17% of our interest rate revenue in 2017, actually came from new product launched since 2010. We've been very focused on having a product that is a much lower cost, much better value proposition and getting in new participants. In FX, we're following the same exact playbook. I'm excited to tell you that in December, Greenwich Associates published a study showing that the CME futures, FX futures are a far lower total cost, as much as 75% than the OTC market, representing the same risk. This is the same study that Greenwich Associates published in regards to our interest rate futures back in 2015. So we're very excited about using the same playbook, about offering participants a wider state of products that penetrate a much larger percentage of the marketplace and trying to win over the OTC marketplace."

Where the differential market stands today. We've seen a surge in the ClearPort volumes more recently. So maybe how the gas business is sort of flowing into ClearPort and this migration from -- I am sorry, yes, into ClearPort and how the migration is working from ClearPort to Globex?

Well, I talk fast, Ken, so I'll try to keep up with you. Relative to the -- there's a structural story in the gas market you've heard us talk about and it's absolutely playing out over the course the multiyear horizon. 2017, I think you saw a very, very tight range from a trading price perspective, we're starting to see that breakout. Couple that with what we're seeing to the point you made earlier is there has been a significant structural change in the global natural gas market. Historically, natural gas was priced on an index versus oil. And we've seen that correlation break down as gas itself has been able to separate itself from oil. And now you're seeing a growing infrastructure for exportable Henry Hub gas in the form of LNG or liquid natural gas. There's 1 liquefaction plant that's alive down in the Gulf coast and there are, I think, 3 more coming online in the next 2 years. What that means, driven by the fracking revolution that generally we associate with crude oil and WTI come out of the Permian basin, there is a significant amount of natural gas, Henry Hub priced natural gas coming out of the U.S. at a much lower price points. And we are now becoming a swing producer in the global natural gas market just as the U.S. has become the swing producer in the global crude market. The implications of that can, is that we're actually seeing an exportable form of Henry Hub priced, based on Henry Hub gas coming out of the U.S. that will eventually start to see significant shipments outside the U.S. as more of the [indiscernible] plans come online. We're seeing that reflected in our own business. Our natural gas business was up 8% to a record last year in 2017. In January, our business is up 55%. Nat gas futures alone have been at 744,000 contracts a day. As I mentioned, that's contributed to our overall energy record this year. And there is the last piece, I think, you talked about ClearPort versus electronic trading or Globex trading. We're actually seeing a shift from broker market -- market structure nat gas options to electronic trading of natural gas options. So not only have we grown our natural gas options business, we've converted that business, I think the first quarter of 2016, about 32% of our natural gas options traded electronically. And in January of this year, so 4 quarters later, that's north of 62%. So that's a market structure shift that is both reflective of the underlying connectivity of the global physical gas market, but we're also seeing that reflected in terms of the venue shift from brokers to electronic. And we typically generate better revenues from the Globex-based business. And relative to the total non-U.S. growth in Jan, we're seeing that continue to grow apace. So growth in global participation end-user participants in our nat gas is following a very similar path to what we put in place for WTI net structural story as well. So we're very excited about that. We are also right in the sake of what's called the gas season, natural gas from November to March. So typically, we see volume boost, but this is an outsized growth in January, which given investments we've made, we think that we can continue to globalize participation as that market connects globally with Henry Hub at its core."

First of all, you've heard us talk a lot about our investments in scaling of our non-U.S. participation. Typically, we see the rates per contract associated with non-U.S. customers higher than our base rates. So we're investing in acquiring a global customer base and that typically is positive for our mix shift. Within the customer mix itself, as we focused on our commercial customers, that also typically carries a higher RPC than our base rate. Very few of our biggest commercial customers are actually members -- direct members, they change for various reasons. So as we continue to focus on to that end-user customer base, good for the open interest and good for drawing financial participants in, but they also typically carry a high RPC. And finally, from a venue and a products mix perspective, you saw us post a very, very strong natural gas volumes and participation in both January as well as last December, also carries a higher RPC. And as we shift businesses from brokers to electronic trading, typically that's positive to the RPC as well.

We are very pleased with the performance of our systems, we're able to handle these record volumes you heard from Sean and Derek, the number of records that we're setting. And when you take a look at some of the massive days such as the Brexit or the U.S. elections, we handled them without issue. In addition to the performance that we're doing -- performance at that our systems have, we're also very cognizant of security and that's an area that we continue to invest in to ensure that our -- ensure the integrity of our markets. So it is an area that we are continuously investing in and continuously innovating on. Just kind of circle back in terms of the tax reform, one of things I mentioned was, it's good for our customer base. In terms of our customer base, obviously, those that are corporations, you will see a significant reduction in taxes, which could help in terms of driving additional business onto our exchange with the lower tax rate and the ability to utilize our products relative to their risk management needs. Couple that with the change in accounting for hedging -- hedge accounting, I think both are positive."

So that's something we're keeping a very key close eye on. As you know, we were just deemed equivalent in the European Union within the last 2 years. We believe that, that will continue to be the same equivalence of rating, even though they're coming up with new regulation. There's a lot of people on the regulatory side here in the United States in our government and in our legislative branch that are aware that U.S. businesses have been deemed equivalent and want to make sure that we continue to have that status in the European Union.

We appreciate your interest in CME Group. 2017 was certainly an unusual year. Virtually every asset class experienced reduced volatility. So throughout the year, we focused on areas that we could control. That included adding new products, operating all of our markets in the most efficient manner and expanding our global customer base. We were aggressive in optimizing our operations. As you know, we sold investments we had in other exchanges, we wound down our European exchange and clearing house, we announced the exit of our credit default swaps clearing business and we focused on making investments in new product launches as well as our market data, audit and derived data functions. 
Focusing on increasing the efficiency [ Audio Gap ] organization has resulted in another successful year of reducing our total controllable costs, while continuing to invest for the future. We also continue to evolve our sales strategy to help generate additional business and acquire new customers. Specific global sales campaigns were developed across every product area. We measured that success by tracking additional metrics. These efforts drove non-U.S. average daily volume up 10% for the year. This was achieved despite difficult comparables from the election year of 2016. 
Also, we had 11% growth in our options franchise driven by increased trading on rollbacks. During 2017, we reached all-time highs in total open interest, along with records for the number of large open interest holders in several asset classes. This bodes well as market volatility normalizes. 
As we begin 2018, we saw all 6 product areas post solid growth in January as we continued to execute on our strategy. We also have seen open interest levels rise as our global clients are actively managing risk. These 2 measurements are extremely encouraging as we begin the year.

In terms of the expense guidance, it's often in line with what we've been communicating, which is in the low single digits. The majority of the increase is driven by compensation. It's the usual cost-of-living increasing -- increases, the staffing related to growth initiatives. And finally, within our expense guidance, there is a change in pension accounting, which will impact our top line by about $4 million and there's no offset that we booked in the other income and expense section of our income statement.

You've heard us talk about focusing on electronifying our markets to be able to access a non-U.S. customer base. And in some of the documentation we've provided you guys, we're showing that, a significant growth in the non-U.S. participation of our markets. That is continuing into January of this year. Q4 of last year, the energy business was up 40% in customers from outside the U.S. But that's a function of the sale campaign that Terry referred to earlier. The efforts and investment we've made in the front-end of technology to access customers to provide liquidity 24/7 and we're seeing that flow through across into our commercial customer base, which has been the central focus point for the last 2.5 years on the business side and sales side, leveraging our regional sales people. So if you couple that with the results of the U.S. Energy Department figures that were just released yesterday, showing U.S. production topping 10 million barrels a day in production and almost 2 million barrels a day in exports, we see that as the continuing strong structural story behind WTI as a global benchmark in the waterborne products."

Last year, we had a record number of large open interest holders and a record open interest in each and every one of the financial's asset classes. So we're continuing to penetrate a much larger customer base, in particular, much larger customer base relative to alternative products. Another example we've been talking about continuously over the last few years, is our penetration of the cash Treasury bond market. So currently, our treasury futures are trading about 94.6% of the volume of the cash Treasury bond market. That's up from the 80% area last year and up from 55% if you go back 6 years ago. So we've seen tremendous growth there. This year, very exciting again. We've just seen, in the last couple of weeks, a new record number of large open interest holders in our interest rate complex. We've seen a new record open interest in our foreign exchange complex. And we've seen records in our Eurodollar options on Globex. Actually, we had a record day, just a couple of weeks ago. And very interesting thing, nothing we've talked about -- as spoke about earlier is the electronification of our markets, how it gives us much better access to international participants and how when you electronify our markets, we see a much higher velocity of growth. So we had -- again, we had a record Eurodollar options volume date earlier this month, one. Two, on that day, very interestingly, we had a 47% electronic market. Not only that, but in fact, we did more volume on the box from Globex on that day than we did on the Eurodollar options, than we did in the pit. So the strategy that we've been following in terms of the electronification is absolutely working in terms of getting more participants, more global participants and higher velocity of growth. So we're very excited about our sales approaches, we're very excited also about new products. On the new products side, a lot of excitement there with all of the new participants. So we had great growth in our weekly options, a lot of new weekly options. We launched Wednesday Weekly Treasury Options last year. They're doing over 18,000 a day. As you, I think, know, in our S&P options over the last 1.5 years, we introduced Monday and Wednesday Weekly Options doing over 90,000 contracts a day. Our Ultra 10 contract that we launched just a couple of years ago, doing 145,000 contracts a day. Two years ago, we launched something called BTIC, basis trade index close on our equity complex. This is a functionality allowing participants to trade on the central limit order book at a spread to the cash market close. That's trading 39,000 contracts a day in January. It's a very high RPC contract. So the innovation, the electronification, the sales campaigns are all increasing the number of participants. Derek, I don't know if you want to jump in?"

Really, our focal point's on energy and we've got -- with so many records, Peschier told me to stop sending them data to put into this thing, so I won't touch on those. Really, the drivers behind the growth, I talked about the commercial customers, that has been our singular focal point for almost 2.5 years. And if you look at the growth, it's not just the volumes but the growth of the open interest and the large open interest holders, the data's in the deck, it shows you the success we're having in globally penetrating end-user customers. The breadth of our product portfolio in energy, I mentioned before, not just crude oil in WTI, but our nat gas, our gasoline contract, RBOB, our heating oil contract, we're having a total franchise open interest record and volume record overall in both energy and metals, in January, so the strength continues. And I think the -- true on the metal side as well, particular strength in our industrial metals in copper. The overlay to all of this, and Sean mentioned this as well is, you've heard us talk about focusing on growing our options complex. And options continues to accelerate and strengthen our order book in futures as options traders tend to hedge their exposures in our underlying futures. And if you look at our starting point in January of '18, we came off a total year record in ADV for 2017, and we're setting an all-time options record in January of '18 as well. Our option ADV overall was up about 30% in January. And it's particularly interesting, when you look at some of the commodities markets price action with crude oil up at $65, it's really unclear whether that next $15 move is back to $50, with the glut somehow coming out of the U.S. or potentially up to $75 with some of the constrictions in the supply chain. That is a perfect environment for options. So our energy options in January is actually up 37%. This is a purpose-built market in fixed income, in energy, in equities for use of options and we're seeing that. The investment that we've made in our options business across asset classes, both an accelerant to our underlying growth, but it makes our futures value proposition that much more sticky as well. So I would say, despite the volatility profiles, you've seen us grow in low volatility environments, flat volatility environments and now selectively sharply increasing volatility environments. And our remit around here is to continue to add customers, globalize business and enhance that customer experience around our product set."

The crypto market is something -- obviously it's brand new as far as a listed product goes. But I think when we're getting a lot of interest on a product that's been around actually for 9 years now, I think the interest is obviously all coming because of the appreciation of the value of the product. And introducing futures to it is actually, I think, helped mitigate some of the volatility in the product in and of itself. But as far as the regulation goes, we worked closely with the CFTC before we launched this product. We put new standards in place that we don't have on our other contracts such as higher margins, velocity and stop functionalities, similar to what we have on the equity markets on the percentages. So I think it's 7, 13 and 20 that we have on percentages as a market to -- market volatility increases or decreases. So I think, from our standpoint, the CFTC, there's been some things in the news lately about how are they going to regulate these types of markets and really, I think it's incumbent upon both of us. We've seen new markets historically, since at least I've been in this business, you can go back to the early '80s with cash settlement, nobody understood really what cash settlement was because every product had to be physically delivered and then people got more comfortable with different methodologies. So you could use that as an example of cryptocurrencies to some example. This is new to the marketplace with the exception, as I said earlier, it's 9 years old. And we will continue to work with the regulator and as far as the growth of the product goes, this is one of those wait and see. The last thing I would ever want to do was to potentially lower the margins and just think that we could effectuate a tremendous amount of trade off of this. This is very much a walk as we go through this, not run. So we will not do anything in the near term that we think that could increase the trade at the point of introducing additional risk to the system. So I don't know if that completely answers your question because this is -- this topic is so broad and there are so many different opinions on it. So only I can say to you is, on the revenue side, it's going to be, I think, a slow grower, which is fine. It's 1,500 open interest, we're trading 1,000 a day. That's obviously very small in comparison to the volumes that CME Group has today. John referenced some new contracts that are trading 30,000 to 50,000 a day. That's not this product. We also design this product, as you know, to make sure that we do not attract the small retail participants, that's not something that we wanted to be a part of. So our contract is much larger than our friends down the street's contract. And I think that is the prudent thing for us to do. So Sean, you can comment on it if you want. But I think from a regulatory standpoint, we're working close with the regulators on a daily basis. And from a revenue standpoint, this is going to be something that we'll be very methodical on."

Thank you for the question. We're very excited about the foreign exchange business. So the foreign exchange business last year, significantly outperforming the largest 2 cash market competitors in terms of volumes. And as I said earlier, we saw several new records, in terms of the large number of open interest holders last year. And we've just seen another one now in January. We were in the process of offering several new products that we're very excited about. We recently launched Wednesday Weekly Options, they actually had back-to-back record days a couple of weeks ago with the Bank of Canada meeting, of about 10,000 contracts a day on the Tuesday and Wednesday of that week around the expiry. Putting that in perspective, we're running around 6% of our entire FX options complex is already being driven by this brand-new Wednesday Weekly expiry. So we're really excited about that. In addition to that, we launched last year, monthly futures on our FX complex. So the monthlies are very exciting. Because for the first time, we are -- we have a product that's trading about 10,000 contracts a day. It's going to offer participants an alternate to FX forwards on the IMM dates as well as the FX swaps. In addition to that, we do expect sometime in the first half, to launch something called CME FX Link. With CME FX Link, we will be offering participants with our partner, Citigroup, which has already been announced, the single largest OTC FX dealer in the world, to bring the OTC markets and the futures markets together. So you're going to be able to trade the basis between spot FX and each of our front FX futures contracts. This is going to allow participants to do FX swaps. Spot FX against each of our monthly futures. So we're very excited about being able to penetrate those marketplaces. If you think about the global FX market and the most recent BIS results, the spot FX market is about 1.7 trillion a day. Our quarterly FX futures, historically, have gone after that spot market. On the other hand, if you look at the deliverable forwards, the FX swaps and the currency swaps, those marketplaces make up about 3.1 trillion a day of the global OTC FX market. With our new products, we're also going after those market places and those participants. So we're very excited about our business there, we're very excited about offering participants the lowest total cost most efficient product possible. In FX, the last thing I'd like to say is, we're following the same playbook that we've followed in interest rates. If you look over the last 6 years, what we've accomplished in interest rates is new products. 17% of our interest rate revenue in 2017, actually came from new product launched since 2010. We've been very focused on having a product that is a much lower cost, much better value proposition and getting in new participants. In FX, we're following the same exact playbook. I'm excited to tell you that in December, Greenwich Associates published a study showing that the CME futures, FX futures are a far lower total cost, as much as 75% than the OTC market, representing the same risk. This is the same study that Greenwich Associates published in regards to our interest rate futures back in 2015. So we're very excited about using the same playbook, about offering participants a wider set of products that penetrate a much larger percentage of the marketplace and trying to win over the OTC marketplace."

So I'm wondering how the natural gas market is evolving, we're obviously seeing more LNG capabilities coming online. But things that seem to impact gas trading in the past, don't seem or didn't seem to have the same impact more recently. Kind of think hurricanes in the Gulf and how gas reacted this round versus in years past. So maybe talk about how the gas trading market is evolving in the U.S.? Where the differential market stands today. We've seen a surge in ClearPort volumes more recently. So maybe how the gas business is sort of flowing into ClearPort and this migration from -- I'm sorry, yes, into ClearPort and how the migration is working from ClearPort to Globex? I think there's like 6 questions in there, but all gas related."

Well, you know I talk fast, Ken, so I'll try to keep up with you. Relative to the -- there's a structural story in the gas market you've heard us talk about and it's absolutely playing out over the course of the multiyear horizon. 2017, I think",573,"All right. Well, you know I talk fast, Ken, so I'll try to keep up with you. Relative to the -- there's a structural story in the gas market you've heard us talk about and it's absolutely playing out over the course of the multiyear horizon. 2017, I think you saw a very, very tight range from a trading price perspective, we're starting to see that breakout. Couple that with what we're seeing to the point you made earlier is there has been a significant structural change in the global natural gas market. Historically, natural gas was priced on an index versus oil. And we've seen that correlation break down as gas itself has been able to separate itself from oil. And now you're seeing a growing infrastructure for exportable Henry Hub gas in the form of LNG or liquid natural gas. There's 1 liquefaction plant that's alive down in the Gulf coast and there are, I think, 3 more coming online in the next 2 years. What that means, driven by the frac-ing revolution that generally we associate with crude oil and WTI coming out of the Permian basin, there's a significant amount of natural gas, Henry Hub priced natural gas coming out of the U.S. at a much lower price point. And we are now becoming a swing producer in the global natural gas market just as the U.S. has become the swing producer in the global crude market. The implications of that, Ken, is that we're actually seeing an exportable form of Henry Hub priced, basis Henry Hub gas, coming out of the U.S. that will eventually start to see significant shipments outside the U.S. as more liquefaction plants come online. We're seeing that reflected in our own business. Our natural gas business was up 8% to a record last year in 2017. In January, our business is up 55%. Nat gas futures alone has been 744,000 contracts a day. As I mentioned, that's contributed to our overall energy record this year. And the last piece, I think you talked about ClearPort versus electronic trading or Globex trading. We're actually seeing a shift from broker market -- market structure nat gas options to electronic trading of natural gas options. So not only have we grown our natural gas options business, we've converted that business, I think the first quarter of 2016, about 32% of our natural gas options traded electronically. And in January of this year, so 4 quarters later, that's north of 62%. So that's a market structure shift that is both reflective of the underlying connectivity of the global physical gas market, but we're also seeing that reflected in terms of the venue shift from brokers to electronic. And we typically generate better revenues from the Globex-based business. And relative to the total non-U.S. growth in Jan, we're seeing that continue to grow apace. So growth in global participation end-user participants in our nat gas is following a very similar path to what we put in place for WTI net structural story as well. So we're very excited about that. We are also right in the sake of what's called the gas season, natural gas from November to March. So typically, we see volume boost, but this is an outsized growth in January, which given investments we've made, we think that we can continue to globalize participation as that market connects globally with Henry Hub at its core."

First of all, you've heard us talk a lot about our investments and scaling of our non-U.S. participation. Typically, we see the rates per contract associated with non-U.S. customers higher than our base rates. So we're investing in acquiring a global customer base and that typically is positive for our mix shift. Within the customer mix itself, as we focused on our commercial customers, that also typically carries a higher RPC than our base rate. Very few of our biggest commercial customers are actually members -- direct members, they change for various reasons. So as we continue to focus on to that end-user customer base, good for the open interest and good for drawing financial participants in, but they also typically carry a high RPC. And finally, from a venue and a products mix perspective, you saw us post very, very strong natural gas volumes and participation in both January as well as last December, also carries a higher RPC. And as we shift businesses from brokers to electronic trading, typically that's positive to the RPC as well. So hopefully those 4 mix, whether it's product venue or client, give you a sense of what we're seeing in the energy side."

So that by 2021, I think the $1.3 trillion reduction in the balance sheet that they're looking for. This should have a very gradual positive impact on the need for additional hedging. As you know, the Federal Reserve, when they purchase treasury and mortgage-backed securities, were not price sensitive. However, the additional securities that will need to be purchased will be from price-sensitive buyers. And so therefore, on a gradual basis, it should help to increase our volumes."

So that's something we're keeping a very close eye on. As you know, we were just deemed equivalent in the European Union within the last 2 years. We believe that, that will continue to be the same equivalence of rating, even though they're coming up with new regulation. There's a lot of people on the regulatory side here in the United States in our government and in our legislative branch that are aware that U.S. businesses have been deemed equivalent and want to make sure that we continue to have that status in the European Union.

We appreciate your interest in CME Group. 2017 was certainly an unusual year. Virtually every asset class experienced reduced volatility. So throughout the year, we focused on areas that we could control. That included adding new products, operating all of our markets in the most efficient manner and expanding our global customer base. We were aggressive in optimizing our operations. As you know, we sold investments we had in other exchanges, we wound down our European exchange and clearing house, we announced the exit of our credit default swaps clearing business and we focused on making investments in new product launches as well as our market data, audit and derived data functions. 
Focusing on increasing the efficiency [ Audio Gap ] organization has resulted in another successful year of reducing our total controllable costs, while continuing to invest for the future. We also continue to evolve our sales strategy to help generate additional business and acquire new customers. Specific global sales campaigns were developed across every product area. We measured that success by tracking additional metrics. These efforts drove non-U.S. average daily volume up 10% for the year. This was achieved despite difficult comparables from the election year of 2016. 
Also, we had 11% growth in our options franchise driven by increased trading on rollbacks. During 2017, we reached all-time highs in total open interest, along with records for the number of large open interest holders in several asset classes. This bodes well as market volatility normalizes. 
As we begin 2018, we saw all 6 product areas post solid growth in January as we continued to execute on our strategy. We also have seen open interest levels rise as our global clients are actively managing risk. These 2 measurements are extremely encouraging as we begin the year. 
With that, we'd like to open your questions -- open the call for your questions. And I know we have a number of analysts that will cover us, so we'd ask that you ask one question and then get back into the queue. With that, we'll open it up to the questions."

We've given out our expense and CapEx guidance, which is increasing this year versus over the last several years. And this provides us more financial flexibility. In terms of the expense guidance, it's often in line with what we've been communicating, which is in the low single digits. The majority of the increase is driven by compensation. It's the usual cost-of-living increasing -- increases, the staffing related to growth initiatives. And finally, within our expense guidance, there is a change in pension accounting, which will impact our top line by about $4 million and there's no offset that we booked in the other income and expense section of our income statement. We haven't changed our capital return policy in light of tax reforms. So it's -- we think it's very positive. It's positive for our customers.

Going from a very strong record year in 2017, as you pointed out we started with a record year so far in '18. What we're seeing is broad-based growth across the entire energy complex. We spend a lot of time talking about WTI, we're -- actually have just posted a new record ADV month in January, inclusive of not just WTI, but also our gasoline contracts and heating oil that we set multiple open interest records in as well. What's really driving that is both broad-based participation, but our record non-U.S. participation. You've heard us talk about focusing on electronifying our markets to be able to access a non-U.S. customer base. And in some of the documentation we've provided you guys, we're showing that, a significant growth in the non-U.S. participation of our markets. That is continuing into January of this year. Q4 of last year, the energy business was up 40% in customers from outside the U.S. But that's a function of the sale campaign that Terry referred to earlier. The efforts and investment we've made in the front-end of technology to access customers to provide liquidity 24/7 and we're seeing that flow through across into our commercial customer base, which has been the central focus point for the last 2.5 years on the business side and sales side, leveraging our regional salespeople. So if you couple that with the results of the U.S. Energy Department figures that were just released yesterday, showing U.S. production topping 10 million barrels a day in production and almost 2 million barrels a day in exports, we see that as the continuing strong structural story behind WTI as a global benchmark in the waterborne products."

We've seen a new record open interest in our foreign exchange complex. And we've seen records in our Eurodollar options on Globex. Actually, we had a record day, just a couple of weeks ago. And very interesting thing, nothing we've talked about -- as spoke about earlier is the electronification of our markets, how it gives us much better access to international participants and how when you electronify our markets, we see a much higher velocity of growth. So we had -- again, we had a record Eurodollar options volume date earlier this month, one. Two, on that day, very interestingly, we had a 47% electronic market. Not only that, but in fact, we did more volume on the box from Globex on that day than we did on the Eurodollar options, than we did in the pit. So the strategy that we've been following in terms of the electronification is absolutely working in terms of getting more participants, more global participants and higher velocity of growth. So we're very excited about our sales approaches, we're very excited also about new products. On the new products side, a lot of excitement there with all of the new participants. So we had great growth in our weekly options, a lot of new weekly options. We launched Wednesday Weekly Treasury Options last year. They're doing over 18,000 a day. As you, I think, know, in our S&P options over the last 1.5 years, we introduced Monday and Wednesday Weekly Options doing over 90,000 contracts a day. Our Ultra 10 contract that we launched just a couple of years ago, doing 145,000 contracts a day. 2 years ago, we launched something called BTIC, basis trade index close on our equity complex. This is a functionality allowing participants to trade on the central limit order book at a spread to the cash market close. That's trading 39,000 contracts a day in January. It's a very high RPC contract. So the innovation, the electronification, the sales campaigns are all increasing the number of participants. Derek, I don't know if you want to jump in?"

Really, our focal point's on energy and we've got -- with so many records, Peschier told me to stop sending them data to put into this thing, so I won't touch on those. Really, the drivers behind the growth, I talked about the commercial customers, that has been our singular focal point for almost 2.5 years. And if you look at the growth, it's not just the volumes but the growth of the open interest and the large open interest holders, the data's in the deck, it shows you the success we're having in globally penetrating end-user customers. The breadth of our product portfolio in energy, I mentioned before, not just crude oil in WTI, but our nat gas, our gasoline contract, RBOB, our heating oil contract, we're having a total franchise open interest record and volume record overall in both energy and metals, in January, so the strength continues. And I think the -- true on the metal side as well, particular strength in our industrial metals in copper. The overlay to all of this, and Sean mentioned this as well is, you've heard us talk about focusing on growing our options complex. And options continues to accelerate and strengthen our order book in futures as options traders tend to hedge their exposures in our underlying futures. And if you look at our starting point in January of '18, we came off a total year record in ADV for 2017, and we're setting an all-time options record in January of '18 as well. Our option ADV overall was up about 30% in January. And it's particularly interesting, when you look at some of the commodities markets price action with crude oil up at $65, it's really unclear whether that next $15 move is back to $50, with the glut somehow coming out of the U.S. or potentially up to $75 with some of the constrictions in the supply chain. That is a perfect environment for options. So our energy options in January is actually up 37%. This is a purpose-built market in fixed income, in energy, in equities for use of options and we're seeing that. The investment that we've made in our options business across asset classes, both an accelerant to our underlying growth, but it makes our futures value proposition that much more sticky as well. So I would say, despite the volatility profiles, you've seen us grow in low volatility environments, flat volatility environments and now selectively sharply increasing volatility environments. And our remit around here is to continue to add customers, globalize business and enhance that customer experience around our product set."

I have said this before and I'll say it again, over the last 14 months, we are not looking to just acquire to acquire.

The crypto market is something -- obviously it's brand new as far as a listed product goes. But I think when we're getting a lot of interest on a product that's been around actually for 9 years now, I think the interest is obviously all coming because of the appreciation of the value of the product. And introducing futures to it is actually, I think, helped mitigate some of the volatility in the product in and of itself. But as far as the regulation goes, we worked closely with the CFTC before we launched this product. We put new standards in place that we don't have on our other contracts such as higher margins, velocity and stop functionalities, similar to what we have on the equity markets on the percentages. So I think it's 7, 13 and 20 that we have on percentages as a market to -- market volatility increases or decreases. So I think, from our standpoint, the CFTC, there's been some things in the news lately about how are they going to regulate these types of markets and really, I think it's incumbent upon both of us. We've seen new markets historically, since at least I've been in this business, you can go back to the early '80s with cash settlement, nobody understood really what cash settlement was because every product had to be physically delivered and then people got more comfortable with different methodologies. So you could use that as an example of cryptocurrencies to some example. This is new to the marketplace with the exception, as I said earlier, it's 9 years old. And we will continue to work with the regulator and as far as the growth of the product goes, this is one of those wait and see. The last thing I would ever want to do was to potentially lower the margins and just think that we could effectuate a tremendous amount of trade off of this. This is very much a walk as we go through this, not run. So we will not do anything in the near term that we think that could increase the trade at the point of introducing additional risk to the system. So I don't know if that completely answers your question because this is -- this topic is so broad and there are so many different opinions on it. So only I can say to you is, on the revenue side, it's going to be, I think, a slow grower, which is fine. It's 1,500 open interest, we're trading 1,000 a day. That's obviously very small in comparison to the volumes that CME Group has today. John referenced some new contracts that are trading 30,000 to 50,000 a day. That's not this product. We also design this product, as you know, to make sure that we do not attract the small retail participants, that's not something that we wanted to be a part of. So our contract is much larger than our friends down the street's contract. And I think that is the prudent thing for us to do. So Sean, you can comment on it if you want. But I think from a regulatory standpoint, we're working close with the regulators on a daily basis. And from a revenue standpoint, this is going to be something that we'll be very methodical on."

Thank you for the question. We're very excited about the foreign exchange business. So the foreign exchange business last year, significantly outperforming the largest 2 cash market competitors in terms of volumes. And as I said earlier, we saw several new records, in terms of the large number of open interest holders last year. And we've just seen another one now in January. We were in the process of offering several new products that we're very excited about. We recently launched Wednesday Weekly Options, they actually had back-to-back record days a couple of weeks ago with the Bank of Canada meeting, of about 10,000 contracts a day on the Tuesday and Wednesday of that week around the expiry. Putting that in perspective, we're running around 6% of our entire FX options complex is already being driven by this brand-new Wednesday Weekly expiry. So we're really excited about that. In addition to that, we launched last year, monthly futures on our FX complex. So the monthlies are very exciting. Because for the first time, we are -- we have a product that's trading about 10,000 contracts a day. It's going to offer participants an alternate to FX forwards on the IMM dates as well as the FX swaps. In addition to that, we do expect sometime in the first half, to launch something called CME FX Link. With CME FX Link, we will be offering participants with our partner, Citigroup, which has already been announced, the single largest OTC FX dealer in the world, to bring the OTC markets and the futures markets together. So you're going to be able to trade the basis between spot FX and each of our front FX futures contracts. This is going to allow participants to do FX swaps. Spot FX against each of our monthly futures. So we're very excited about being able to penetrate those marketplaces. If you think about the global FX market and the most recent BIS results, the spot FX market is about 1.7 trillion a day. Our quarterly FX futures, historically, have gone after that spot market. On the other hand, if you look at the deliverable forwards, the FX swaps and the currency swaps, those marketplaces make up about 3.1 trillion a day of the global OTC FX market. With our new products, we're also going after those marketplaces and those participants. So we're very excited about our business there, we're very excited about offering participants the lowest total cost most efficient product possible. In FX, the last thing I'd like to say is, we're following the same playbook that we've followed in interest rates. If you look over the last 6 years, what we've accomplished in interest rates is new products. 17% of our interest rate revenue in 2017, actually came from new product launched since 2010. We've been very focused on having a product that is a much lower cost, much better value proposition and getting in new participants. In FX, we're following the same exact playbook. I'm excited to tell you that in December, Greenwich Associates published a study showing that the CME futures, FX futures are a far lower total cost, as much as 75% than the OTC market, representing the same risk. This is the same study that Greenwich Associates published in regards to our interest rate futures back in 2015. So we're very excited about using the same playbook, about offering participants a wider set of products that penetrate a much larger percentage of the marketplace and trying to win over the OTC marketplace."

Well, you know I talk fast, Ken, so I'll try to keep up with you. Relative to the -- there's a structural story in the gas market you've heard us talk about and it's absolutely playing out over the course of the multiyear horizon. 2017, I think",573,"All right. Well, you know I talk fast, Ken, so I'll try to keep up with you. Relative to the -- there's a structural story in the gas market you've heard us talk about and it's absolutely playing out over the course of the multiyear horizon. 2017, I think you saw a very, very tight range from a trading price perspective, we're starting to see that breakout. Couple that with what we're seeing to the point you made earlier is there has been a significant structural change in the global natural gas market. Historically, natural gas was priced on an index versus oil. And we've seen that correlation break down as gas itself has been able to separate itself from oil. And now you're seeing a growing infrastructure for exportable Henry Hub gas in the form of LNG or liquid natural gas. There's 1 liquefaction plant that's alive down in the Gulf coast and there are, I think, 3 more coming online in the next 2 years. What that means, driven by the fracking revolution that generally we associate with crude oil and WTI coming out of the Permian Basin, there's a significant amount of natural gas, Henry Hub priced natural gas coming out of the U.S. at a much lower price point. And we are now becoming a swing producer in the global natural gas market just as the U.S. has become the swing producer in the global crude market. The implications of that, Ken, is that we're actually seeing an exportable form of Henry Hub priced, basis Henry Hub gas, coming out of the U.S. that will eventually start to see significant shipments outside the U.S. as more liquefaction plants come online. We're seeing that reflected in our own business. Our natural gas business was up 8% to a record last year in 2017. In January, our business is up 55%. Nat gas futures alone has been 744,000 contracts a day. As I mentioned, that's contributed to our overall energy record this year. And the last piece, I think you talked about ClearPort versus electronic trading or Globex trading. We're actually seeing a shift from broker market -- market structure nat gas options to electronic trading of natural gas options. So not only have we grown our natural gas options business, we've converted that business, I think the first quarter of 2016, about 32% of our natural gas options traded electronically. And in January of this year, so 4 quarters later, that's north of 62%. So that's a market structure shift that is both reflective of the underlying connectivity of the global physical gas market, but we're also seeing that reflected in terms of the venue shift from brokers to electronic. And we typically generate better revenues from the Globex-based business. And relative to the total non-U.S. growth in Jan, we're seeing that continue to grow apace. So growth in global participation end-user participants in our nat gas is following a very similar path to what we put in place for WTI net structural story as well. So we're very excited about that. We are also right in the sake of what's called the gas season, natural gas from November to March. So typically, we see volume boost, but this is an outsized growth in January, which given investments we've made, we think that we can continue to globalize participation as that market connects globally with Henry Hub at its core."

First of all, you've heard us talk a lot about our investments and scaling of our non-U.S. participation. Typically, we see the rates per contract associated with non-U.S. customers higher than our base rates. So we're investing in acquiring a global customer base and that typically is positive for our mix shift. Within the customer mix itself, as we focused on our commercial customers, that also typically carries a higher RPC than our base rate. Very few of our biggest commercial customers are actually members -- direct members, they change for various reasons. So as we continue to focus on to that end-user customer base, good for the open interest and good for drawing financial participants in, but they also typically carry a high RPC. And finally, from a venue and a products mix perspective, you saw us post very, very strong natural gas volumes and participation in both January as well as last December, also carries a higher RPC. And as we shift businesses from brokers to electronic trading, typically that's positive to the RPC as well. So hopefully those 4 mix, whether it's product venue or client, give you a sense of what we're seeing in the energy side."

And as John said, we want to thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest in CME Group. I hope you got a chance to read through the Q1 earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. As you can see, the strength of the quarter was broad-based across products and geographies as a significant number of customers actually turned the CME's market to management their risks. Many of the themes that we have spoken about in the past few years were clearly on display this quarter. Those include our focus on driving trading volume 24 hours a day, delivering additional innovative futures and options of products to meet client needs and drive additional revenue and remaining efficient on the expense side. A combination of those efforts led to over 50% adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share growth in Q1. At the end of the first quarter, we were pleased to announce the transaction with the Next Group. We are working diligently on the time line we outlined on the Analyst Call. The next shareholder vote has now been set for May 18. We have begun the process of seeking regulatory approvals and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year. 
With that short introduction, I would like to open the call for your questions and will start now."

In Q4, we saw some benefits of bringing the audit function in-house with approximately $6 million of settlements. And as we mentioned previously, we expect there to be fluctuations up and down in this line quarter-to-quarter depending on the realization of those settlements. We have been building a pipeline that is being worked. So we do expect those fluctuations to continue. Before I turn it over to Bryan to talk a little bit about what he's seeing in the market data business, as he indicated, the big change coming is the real-time market data price increase, which is going from $85 to $105 for screen, which went into effect in April. Real-time market data accounts for the majority of the market data revenue and since the announcement of price increases, we've seen a stable level of subscribers. So Bryan?"

There's a number in the the right now that we look forward to and hope to resolve in the next quarter. You saw what happened last quarter with the amount of settlements that took place. What's even more imperative to us is the correction of behavior. So what we are seeing is the stabilization in the context of what you may have seen in the past decline of screen counts. What we are seeing is an improvement in terms of the reporting of real-time screens. That in combination with the $20 adjustment in terms of going from $85 to $105, which took effect April 1 is something that we'll be watching closely. Also, with respect to the derived data, you need to keep in mind that some of those contractual arrangements can be quite chunky themselves and can take some time to be able to negotiate those agreements. So -- and I would just kind of cap it a little bit in the context that quarter-by-quarter and how those 2 areas hit.

So this is not passing around, but clients who are using the product for the defined purpose. With such a large renovation, I would say, right, where you'll bring together the OTC market and the futures market, it is going to take time for volumes to build and for additional participants to fully build automated trading. We're currently seeing primarily a dig point in click trading. We do expect over the coming weeks and months to see a greater number of automated traders. We know several firms that are building out, particularly end users they're building out their automated trading. If we look at the BTIC, BTIC very exciting results this year. Last year, we averaged less than 13,000 contracts a day. This year, we're averaging more than 40,000 contracts a day. So we've more than tripled the volume in the BTIC, great innovation last year. We've got nearly a $3 RPC. So very, very positive for the RPC for the entire equity complex. But I'd say great innovation. Thanks for asking about. We got the number of new launches that are coming up over the coming months. On May 7, we're going to several futures. On May 14, we're going to launch the on the equity indices. And then on May 21, we're launching Columbian peso, Chilean peso and CNY or the renminbi swap clearing. So we're very excited about the new product launches. In terms of the taco, taco trade at cash open. So it is the opening market equivalent to BTIC, which is basis trade index close. It is not a larger market as the close. So the opening market is a bit smaller, but we do expect similar set of participants with similar set of efficiencies delivered to them and we are hearing a lot of excitement around it."

This is John jumping in. We're excited about the launch. In terms of designing the contracts, we met face-to-face with more than 100 clients working with our sales team and our research team in order to design the contracts, and the marketplace is very excited about the launch. So in recent weeks, 80% of the calls actually so far are incoming from customers asking about it. So also gives us a big opportunity to engage with clients very closely on our interest rate products. Actually, in terms of that, semi-group is the natural home for the product. We are always looking at delivering efficiencies to the marketplace, efficiencies to our customers because we're offering intercommodity between our bonds futures and our Eurodollar futures and the new futures will be the single most efficient place to execute those future contracts in addition to that on the clearing side because we have interest in Eurodollar futures and hedge funds futures as well as treasury futures. You're going to see the greatest possible benefits in terms of margin and capital efficiencies. In terms of the uptick, I think, that's highly uncertain. I think, as we know, hundreds of trillions of dollars where the derivatives and securities in open interest in LIBOR and the several trillion dollars income, I think the last estimate from the alternative community was on the order of 9 trillion with securities in particular and the very large portion of those go out in terms of maturity for many years. So I don't personally see LIBOR going away anytime soon. I think it will remain extremely healthy. And that's what we're seeing in the marketplace. But I think will be quick new complementary opportunities for trading the basis or the risk between the 2. So is really a new opportunity for us in addition to the existing products. Another thing I would like to mention is our Eurodollar complex continues to say recently record open interest, record volumes. So we see greater excitement in our Eurodollar futures and options than ever before. So I don't see LIBOR going away anytime soon."

We have been watching the development of that market over the last 4, 5 years. They had some launch pushed up over the last 3 years. We look at regional benchmarks as highly complementary to global benchmarks. The story you can hear over the last couple of years is the rise of WTI as a global benchmark, and I think if you look at the results for WTI franchise over the last 3 years, whether it's in terms of the outpacing performance of WTI versus now surpassed levels of WTI versus. You can see that the world is demanding and international participation has proven that to be the case. When we look at regional benchmarks, like the Chinese product launch, we're encouraged by the opportunity for a broader set of domestic Chinese participants to be trading at regional benchmark. What we are seeing expecting is the bulk of that business and trades on all that Chinese physical benchmark has hedged back into either Brent, WTI or more likely crude contract, which is a product launch exchange, which we are majority owner of. So we think the positive correlation between the regional benchmarks in the energy line market likely provides a series of tradable regional benchmarks against the global WTI benchmark. Results year-to-date so far in our Asian Energy business is proving to be at record levels. Our Asian energy volume was up 43% in Q1. So that's really pacing the developments and growth of our Energy business complex globally.

As John said, we want to thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest in CME Group. I hope you got a chance to read through the Q1 earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. As you can see, the strength of the quarter was broad-based across products and geographies as a significant number of customers actually turned to CME's markets to manage their risks. Many of the themes that we have spoken about in the past few years were clearly on display this quarter. Those include our focus on driving trading volume 24 hours a day, delivering additional innovative features and options of products to meet client needs and drive additional revenue and remaining efficient on the expense side. A combination of those efforts led to over 50% adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share growth in Q1. At the end of the first quarter, we were pleased to announce the transaction with the NEX Group. We are working diligently on time line we outlined on the Analyst Call. The NEX shareholder vote has now been set for May 18. We have begun the process of seeking regulatory approvals, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year.
With that short introduction, we'd like to open the call for your questions, and we'll start now."

And as we mentioned previously, we expect there to be fluctuations up and down in this line quarter-to-quarter depending on the realization of those settlements. We've been building a pipeline that is being worked. So we do expect those fluctuations to continue. Before I turn it over to Bryan to talk a little bit about what he is seeing in the market data business, as you indicated, the big change coming is real-time market data price increase, which is going from $85 to $105 per screen, which went into effect in April. Real-time market data accounts for the majority of the market data revenue. And since the announcement of the price increases, we've seen a stable level of subscribers. So Bryan?"

There is a number that -- in the [ Harper ] right now that we look forward to and hope to resolve in the next quarter. You saw what happened last quarter with the amount of settlements that took place. What's even more imperative to us is the correction of behavior. So what we are seeing is stabilization in the context of what you may have seen in past decline of screen counts. What we are seeing is an improvement in terms of the reporting of real-time screens. That in combination with the $20 adjustment in terms of going from $85 to $105, which took effect April 1 is something that we'll be watching closely. Also, with respect to the derived data, you need to keep in mind that some of those contractual arrangements can be quite chunky themselves and can take some time to be able to negotiate those agreements. So I would just kind of temper that a little bit in the context of quarter-by-quarter and how those 2 areas hit."

So this is not a couple of [indiscernible] passing around, but some clients who are using the product for the defined purpose. With such a large innovation, I say, right where you're bringing together the OTC market and the futures market, it is going to take time for volumes to build and for additional participants to fully build automated trading. We're currently seeing primarily a tick point in click trading. We do expect over the coming weeks and months to see a greater number of automated traders. We know several firms that are building out, particularly end users that are building out their automated trading. If we look at the BTIC, BTIC very exciting result this year. Last year, we averaged less than 13,000 contracts a day. This year, we're averaging more than 40,000 contracts a day. So we more than tripled the volume in BTIC, great innovation last year, it got nearly a $3 RPC. So very, very positive for the RPC for the entire equity complex. But I'd say great innovation. Thanks for asking about TACO. We've got a number of new launches that are coming up over the coming months. On May 7, we're going to launch SOFR futures. On May 14, we're going to launch the TACO on the equity indices. And then on May 21, we're launching Columbian peso, Chilean peso and CNY or the renminbi interest rate swap clearing. So we're very excited about the new product launches. In terms of TACO, TACO trade at cash open. So it is the opening market equivalent to BTIC, which is Basis Trade Index Close. It is not as large market as the close. So the opening market a bit smaller, but we do expect similar set of participants with similar set of efficiencies delivered to them, and we are hearing a lot of excitement around it."

This is John jumping in. We are excited about the SOFR launch. In terms of designing the contracts, we met face-to-face with more than 100 clients working with our sales team and our research team in order to design the contracts, and the marketplace is very excited about the launch. So in recent weeks, 80% of the calls are actually in regards to SOFR or incoming from customers asking about it. So it'd also gives us a big opportunity to engage with clients very closely on our interest rate products. Actually, in terms of that, CME Group is the natural home for the product. We are always looking at delivering efficiencies to the marketplace, efficiencies to our customers because we are offering intercommodity spreads between our Fed funds futures and our Eurodollar futures, and the new SOFR futures will be the single most efficient place to execute those futures contracts in addition to that on the clearing side, because we have huge hope and interest in Eurodollar futures and Fed funds futures as well as Treasury futures, you're going to see the greatest possible benefits in terms of margin and capital efficiencies. In terms of the uptick, I think that's highly uncertain. I think, there is -- as we know, hundreds of trillions dollars worth of derivatives and securities in open interest in LIBOR and several trillion -- I think the last estimate from the Alternative Reference Rate Committee was on the order of 9 trillion with securities, in particular, and a very large portion of those go out in terms of maturity for many years. So I don't personally see LIBOR going away anytime soon. I think it will remain extremely healthy. And that's what we're seeing in the marketplace. But I think SOFR will be a quick, new, complementary opportunity for trading the basis or the risk between the 2. So I see SOFR as really a new opportunity for us in addition to the existing products. Another thing I'd like to mention is our Eurodollar complex continues to see recently record open interest, record volumes. So we see greater excitement in our Eurodollar futures and options than ever before. So I don't see LIBOR going away anytime soon."

They had some launch dates they pushed over the last 3 years. We look at regional benchmarks as highly complementary to global benchmarks. The story you can hear [indiscernible] over the last couple of years is the rise of WTI as a global water-borne benchmark. And I think if you look at the results for WTI franchise over the last 3 years, whether it's in terms of the outpacing performance of WTI versus Brent or the now surpassed levels of WTI versus Brent, you can see that the world is demanding and international participation has proven that to be the case. When we look at regional benchmarks, like a Chinese product launch, likely they are encouraged by the opportunity for more a broader set of domestic Chinese participants to be trading a regional benchmark. What we are seeing and expecting is the bulk of that business that trades on that Chinese physical benchmark gets hedged out back into either Brent, WTI or more likely DME's Oman sour crude contract, which is a product launched with Dubai Mercantile Exchange, which we are majority owner of. So we think the positive correlation between the regional benchmarks in the energy loan market likely provides a series of tradable regional benchmarks against the global WTI benchmark. Results year-to-date so far in our Asian Energy business is proving to be at record levels. Our Asian energy volume was up 43% in Q1. So that's really pacing the developments and growth of our Energy business complex globally. Though we see it as a positive, we've seen that between DME and WTI, and we will see that contracts evolve and likely connecting this to global market over time."

At the end of the first quarter, we were pleased to announce the transaction with the NEX Group. We are working diligently on the time line we outlined on the analyst call. The NEX shareholder vote has now been set for May 18. We have begun the process of seeking regulatory approvals, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year.
With that short introduction, we'd like to open the call for your questions, and we'll start now."

In Q4, we saw some benefits of bringing the audit function in-house with approximately $6 million of settlements. And as we mentioned previously, we expect there to be fluctuations up and down in this line quarter-to-quarter depending on the realization of those settlements. We've been building a pipeline that is being worked so we do expect those fluctuations to continue. Before I turn it over to Bryan to talk a little bit about what he is seeing in the market data business, as you indicated, the big change coming is the real-time market data price increase, which is going from $85 to $105 per screen, which went into effect in April. Real-time market data accounts for the majority of the market data revenue and since the announcement of the price increases, we've seen a stable level of subscribers. So Bryan?"

There is a number that are in the hopper right now that we look forward to and hope to resolve in the next quarter. You saw what happened last quarter with the amount of settlements that took place. What's even more imperative to us is the correction of behavior. So what we are seeing is a stabilization in the context of what you may have seen in past decline of screen counts. What we are seeing is an improvement in terms of the reporting of real-time screens. That in combination with the $20 adjustment in terms of going from $85 to $105, which took effect April 1, is something that we'll be watching closely. Also, with respect to the derived data, you need to keep in mind that some of those contractual arrangements can be quite chunky themselves and can take some time to be able to negotiate those agreements. So I would just kind of temper that a little bit in the context of quarter-by-quarter and how those 2 areas hit."

So this is not a couple of prop firms passing it around, but is in clients who are using the product for the defined purpose. With such a large innovation, I'd say, right, where you're bringing together the OTC market and the futures market, it is going to take time for volumes to build and for additional participants to fully build automated trading. We're currently seeing primarily a [ tick ] point in click trading. We do expect over the coming weeks and months to see a greater number of automated traders. We know of several firms that are building out, in particular end users that are building out their automated trading. If we look at the BTIC, BTIC very exciting result this year. Last year, we averaged less than 13,000 contracts a day. This year, we're averaging more than 40,000 contracts a day. So we've more than tripled the volume in the BTIC, great innovation last year. It's got nearly a $3 RPC. So very, very positive for the RPC for the entire equity complex. But I'd say great innovation. Thanks for asking about TACO. So we've got a number of new launches that are coming up over the coming months. On May 7, we're going to launch SOFR futures. On May 14, we're going to launch the TACO on the equity indices. And then on May 21, we're launching Colombian peso, Chilean peso and CNY or the renminbi interest rate swap clearing. So we're very excited about the new product launches. In terms of TACO, TACO trade at cash open so it is the opening market equivalent to BTIC, which is Basis Trade Index Close. It is not as large a market as the close. So the opening market a bit smaller, but we do expect similar set of participants with a similar set of efficiencies delivered to them, and we are hearing a lot of excitement around it."

This is Sean jumping in. We are excited about the SOFR launch. In terms of designing the contracts, we met face-to-face with more than 100 clients working with our sales team and our research team in order to design the contracts, and the marketplace is very excited about the launch. So in recent weeks, 80% of the calls actually in regards to SOFR are incoming from customers asking about it. So it also gives us a big opportunity to engage with clients very closely on our interest rate products. Actually, in terms of that, CME Group is the natural home for the product. We are always looking at delivering efficiencies to the marketplace, efficiencies to our customers because we are offering intercommodity spreads between our Fed funds futures and our Eurodollar futures, and the new SOFR futures will be the single most efficient place to execute those futures contracts in addition to that on the clearing side. Because we have huge open interest in Eurodollar futures and Fed funds futures as well as Treasury futures, you're going to see the greatest possible benefits in terms of margin and capital efficiencies. In terms of the uptake, I think that's highly uncertain. I think, there is -- as we know, hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of derivatives and securities in open interest in LIBOR and several trillion -- I think the last estimate from the Alternative Reference Rate Committee was on the order of 9 trillion worth of securities, in particular, and a very large portion of those go out in terms of maturity for many years. So I don't personally see LIBOR going away anytime soon. I think it will remain extremely healthy. And that's what we're seeing in the marketplace. But I think SOFR will be a great, new, complementary opportunity for trading the basis or the risk between the 2. So I see SOFR as really a new opportunity for us in addition to the existing products. Another thing I'd like to mention is our Eurodollar complex continues to see recently record open interest, record volumes. So we see greater excitement in our Eurodollar futures and options than ever before. So I don't see LIBOR going away anytime soon."

They had some launch dates they pushed over the last 3 years. We look at regional benchmarks as highly complementary to global benchmarks. The story you've been hearing us tell over the last couple of years is the rise of WTI as a global water-borne benchmark. And I think if you look at the results for our WTI franchise over the last 3 years, whether it's in terms of the outpacing performance of WTI versus Brent or the now surpassed levels of WTI versus Brent, you can see that the world is demanding, and international participation has proven that out to be the case. When we look at regional benchmarks, like the Chinese product launch, we're actually very encouraged by the opportunity for more a broader set of domestic Chinese participants to be trading at a regional benchmark. What we are seeing and expecting is the bulk of that business that trades on that Chinese physical benchmark gets hedged out back into either Brent, WTI or more likely DME's Oman sour crude contract, which is a product launched with the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, which we are majority owner of. So we think the positive correlation between the regional benchmarks in the energy loan market likely provides a series of tradable regional benchmarks against the global WTI benchmark. Results year-to-date so far in our Asian energy business is proving to be at record levels. Our Asian energy volume was up 43% in Q1. So that's really pacing the developments and growth of our energy business complex globally. Though we see it as a positive, we've seen that between DME and WTI, and we will see that contracts evolve and the likely connecting this to the global market over time."

Total NUV month-to-date, CME is down roughly 5%, but during this period, product areas have actually grown while the other 3 are down. When you add in the uncertainty of geopolitical issues and local volatility, which we are seeing on top of a traditionally slow month, the 5% down isn't a surprise to me.

We saw positive product mix pushing the total RBC higher to $0.757 during the quarter. market data rose 18% primarily driven by the screen fee increase, which went into effect in April. By beginning our expense discipline, we delivered adjusted operating margins similar to our record first quarter of this year. On an adjusted basis, total non-operating income increased 37% from $29 million in Q2 last year to $40 million during the second quarter this year driven primarily by the performance of our joint venture with S&P and the early held at the clearing house. However, sequentially, we saw a lower average cash balances held at that clearing house by participants in the second quarter as the customers rotated into treasuries, which offered a higher yield in hoarding cash. The net amount earned through managing cash was up 18% compared to Q2 of 2017 but was down from Q1. The strong revenue growth and careful expense management, adjusted net income and EPS both grew over 40% during the quarter. With that short summary, we like to open the call for questions, and we start now."

But we're also seeing is record large open interest holders in our market, and what's important, tying back the question that Bryan just answered is our non-U.S. growth story with Trump announcing tariffs that were coming on board that has created a significant concern about price risk. That drove a lot of the volume into participation in our contracts. This is very much a risk on environment as represented by the record volume and record open interest and large open interest holders. We're also seeing on the day that we saw record volumes overall in the complex back in June. Most important, we saw record levels of participation from non-U.S. participants. So as regulatory concerns come on board relative to tariffs or not, we're actually seeing people pile in. For example, with the announcement yesterday. Trump and a meeting that had a very positive impact. We are seeing our ag volumes overnight roughly come in at twice the amount. As of 7 o'clock called this morning, we had about 220,000 contracts in our ag contracts. We typically see a slowdown going into the 7 months of Q3. We're coming from record highs in Q1 and Q2, and our ag volume has also set a record over the course of Q2.

So in terms of the impact on the fed accounts or amounts for managing cash. In the first quarter, we had average cash balances of about $39.6 billion. That includes funds held at commercial banks as most funds held at the fed. In Q2, they went down to about $32.2 million. So they were down on average $7.4 billion versus Q1. The main driver for the lower cash balances is that the U.S. Treasury has been increasing net issuance of current refills, which had pushed yields higher and made the key bills more attractive than the returns that could be held holding cash. So for example, a 1-month treasury key Bill yield a neighborhood of about 190 basis points. So that reduction in the overall average balances has reduced our take from managing the cash for about $28 million in the first quarter to about $25 billion in the second quarter. So that should give you some color as to what occurred there. In terms of the audit findings. In the second quarter, audit findings were minimal. We had about little less than $2 million in audit findings in the second quarter impacting our market data. I think, what Bryan said is the most important, and that is, ""Bringing that audit function in-house has allowed us to insure that there is compliance with our agreements, which has in turn gave us a more confidence terms of the numbers that are being reported, which obviously impacted the go forward amount that we bill our associated with market data.""

So actually pleased at the performance so far, and we think it's a high compliment for cushion contract. We recently set that up. We actually launched an outright and a spread contract at the same time, and what the market has adopted is actually the spread contract back to WTI. So the market's very happy with the deep liquidity and the WTI contract on Globex. The cash-owned spread contract back in Houston is providing exactly what the market wants, which is a cash equivalent of the barrel delivered to the coast. So we're excited about the opportunity. We think it's actually validation of what we did two years ago and the market's got the best of all worlds, which is deep liquid markets in the WTI and Globex and the utility to cash all of that spread out to Houston with barrels that hit the water."

And maybe, what other segments you might hold expenses back in."

So compensation, as you indicated, is our largest growth in terms of expenses. It's up about $28 million the first half of this year versus first half of last year. 60% of the increase in the compensation line is incentive comps that this bonus and stock-based compensation. The balance is in bank conversation is because of the increases. We did have some increase in headcount. So if you exclude incentive-based compensation, our total adjusted expenses grew only 1.5% for the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, adjusted expenses were flat with last year if you exclude incentive-based compensation. 
So looking into the second half of the year, going forward, I would expect the pattern of our spend remain similar with the fourth quarter heavier than the first quarter, but I would expect the fourth quarter to be less than 3% growth compared to last year. And so what you're seeing is for the first half of the year, we've been able to offset our compensation, incentive compensation growth, through really a great expense management across the entire organization and in going into second half of the year, I expect professional services and other expenses and marketing to be lower, which will still allow us to achieve our targeted expense guidance of about 3%."

And thank you -- as John said, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CME group. I hope you got a chance to read through the Q2 earnings commentary that we provided earlier this morning. We had a very strong second quarter. We had record volume quarter in our agricultural product line and 4 additional asset classes grew double digits. 
Average daily volume was up 12% to more than 18 million contracts per day in Q2, following the record volumes in Q1. We reached a peak trading day of more than 50 million contracts on May 29. 
At the end of the first quarter, we announced the transaction with the NEX Group. As you know, the first order of business was the NEX shareholder approval, which was completed on May 19. We have begun our high-level integration planning process and are working closely with the teams of NEX. 
We continue to target a closing in the second half of this year. Global markets trading activity has slowed down during the month of July. July is, historically, one of the slower months of the year. Total ADV month-to-date at CME is down roughly 5%. But during this period 3 of our product areas have actually grown while the other 3 are down. 
When you add in the uncertainty of geopolitical issues and lower volatility, which we are seeing on top of a traditionally slow month, the 5% down isn't a surprise to me. As we all know, there are always ebbs and flows this time of year. It is worth noting that our open interest, as of this morning, is roughly 123 million contracts, which is up 10%, versus this point a year ago and has built nicely during the month of July. In addition, large open interest holder data across the 6 product areas remains very strong, and to me this is a better measurement. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to John to make a few financial highlights and we'll get into your questions. John?"

Market data rose 18% primarily driven by the screen fee increase, which went into effect in April. By maintaining our expense discipline, we delivered adjusted operating margins similar to our record first quarter of this year. On an adjusted basis, total nonoperating income increased 37% from $29 million in Q2 last year to $40 million during the second quarter this year, driven primarily by the performance of our joint venture with S&P and the earnings and cash held at the clearing house. However, sequentially, we saw a lower average cash balances held at that clearing house by participants in the second quarter, as customers rotated into treasuries, which offered a higher yield in holding cash. 
The net amount earned through managing cash was up 18% compared to Q2 of 2017, but was down from Q1. With strong revenue growth and careful expense management, adjusted net income and EPS both grew over 40% during the quarter.

And we actually had a series of records over the course of the -- this year in Q2. We had a monthly record -- total volume went record open insurance record [ quarter ] on track for the -- for -- continue to push those directions. What we're also seeing is record large open interest holders in our market. And what's important, tying back the question that Bryan just answered is our non-U.S. growth story, with Trump announcing tariffs that are coming on board that has created a significant concern about price risk. That drove a lot of the volume into participation in our contracts. This is very much a risk on environment as represented by the record volume and record open interest and large open interest holders. We're also seeing on the day that we saw record volumes overall in the complex back in June. Most important, we saw record levels of participation from non-U.S. participants. So as regulatory concerns come on board relative to tariffs or not, we're actually seeing people pile in. For example, with the announcement yesterday. Trump and Juncker meeting, that had a very positive impact. We've seeing our ag volumes overnight roughly come in at twice the amount. As of 7 o'clock this morning, we had about 220,000 contracts in our ag contracts. We typically see a slowdown going into the 7 months of Q3. We're coming from record highs in Q1 and Q2, and our ag volume has also set a record over the course of Q2. So we're seeing some seasonal basis of slowdown. But right now we're, as Terry mentioned before, starting from record levels of open insurance and global participation. So I think we feel good about what the balance of the year is going to bring. And we've seen immediate positive impact in our volumes based on the questions that have risen so far."

I'll walk you through, kind of, the Fed accounts and what occurred this quarter, then I'll hit the market data question. So in terms of the impact on the Fed accounts or the -- amounts that we held for managing cash. In the first quarter, we had average cash balances of about $39.6 billion, that includes funds held at commercial banks as well as funds held at the Fed. In Q2, they went down to about $32.2 billion. So they were down on average $7.4 billion versus Q1. The main driver for the lower cash balances is that the U.S. Treasury has been increasing net issuance of treasury bills, which has pushed yields higher and made the key bills more attractive than the returns that could be held holding cash. So for example, 1-month treasury key bill yields a neighborhood of about 190 basis points. So that reduction in the overall average balances has reduced our take from managing the cash for about $28 million in the first quarter to about $25 million in the second quarter. So that should give you some color as to what occurred there. In terms of the audit findings. In the second quarter, audit findings were minimal. We had about little less than $2 million in audit findings in the second quarter impacting market data. I think, what Bryan said is the most important and that is, ""Bringing that audit function in-house has allowed us to ensure that there's compliance with our agreements."" Which has in turn gave us more confidence in terms of the numbers that are being reported, which obviously impacted going forward amount that we bill -- associated with market data.

Working very closely with the alternative reference rate committee in the entire industry. And we lost, as you know, the SOFR future is back in May. The uptake so far has been good. We've had more than 60 participants, we have more than 21,000 contracts in open interest, and we're seeing only about 3,000 contracts a day, but that's normal for a new contract. People are using our functionality in terms of the intercommodity spreads that we built between our hedge fund futures and our SOFR futures have also -- Euro futures and our SOFR futures. So we're excited about it, we continue to market. We've had a number of marketing events, actually almost 1 a week in the last 3 weeks, and they are very well attended. Yesterday we held a webinar on SOFR in terms of the futures as well as interest rates swap clearing for SOFR, and we had more than 400 participants. In terms of the interest rate swaps, we do plan on launching SOFR-based interest rate swap clearing in September, and we're very excited about that as well. So we're looking forward to it. The next step for the industry is really to see issuance from corporate issuers. And we do have an announcement from one of the government agencies yesterday that they are going to begin issuing SOFR-based floaters soon. So that should help the marketplace to develop."

So we're actually pleased with the performance so far, and we think it's a high compliment for the Cushing contract. The reason we set that up, we actually launched an outright and a spread contract at the same time, we're letting the market choose whichever they wanted adopt and what the market has adopted is actually the spread contract back to WTI. So the market's very happy with the deep liquidity and the WTI contract on Globex. The cash-owned spread contract back in Houston is providing exactly what the market wants, which is a cash equivalent of the barrel delivered to the coast. So we're excited about the opportunity.

I think a lot of that is tied to the audit function, again, that we've been performing as we're in the field and we're building up those relationships, we're seeing a correction in behavior in the reporting of the screen count. So we're going to look at this, obviously, very closely. And in terms of audits as well, that's a lumpy area, I mentioned. What we're more interested in is making sure that we have correct behavior.

WTI is now a waterborne global benchmark. So when you look at the growth in our business in just volumes alone, our Asian business is up 43% and a large piece of that is the energy business that we're pushing out in terms of WTI utilization. So part of this is, yes, tied to economic cycles, but we're paid to make sure that we can build franchises and portfolios that are going to thrive whether regardless of the shape of the yield curve, volatility curve or industrial cycles. What we are seeing is when products become more relevant to global participants, we're in the best position to make sure that we're addressing that opportunity and that growth. So -- and so we're happy about the product selection, and to Bryan's point, we put a lot of effort into training, education and the ability to access our markets through intermediaries. And that's showing through in some of the strong growth, 43% revenue growth in our energy's franchise in China, for example.

We have got new initiatives globally to get new clients, that we believe are completely untapped, never used our markets that we'll be able to use our markets, so we're excited by that. The infrastructure that we're putting in different parts of Asia such as market regulations, other things that make sure people really understand our markets. So we're sending people over there to, again, educate and make sure people understand what the U.S. marketplace is all about.

So compensation, as you indicated, is our largest growth in terms of expenses. It's up about $28 million first half of this year versus first half of last year. 60% of the increase in the compensation line is incentive comps so that is bonus and stock-based compensation. The balance is in bank conversation is primarily driven by cost of living increases. We did have some increase in headcount. So if you exclude incentive-based compensation, our total adjusted expenses grew only 1.5% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis adjusted expenses were flat with last year if you exclude incentive-based compensation.
So looking into the second half of the year, so rolling it forward, I would expect the pattern of our spend to remain similar with the fourth quarter heavier than the first quarter. But I would expect the fourth quarter to be less than 3% growth compared to last year. And so what you're seeing is for the first half of the year, we've been able to offset our compensation -- incentive compensation growth, through really, I think, great expense management across the entire organization and rolling into second half of the year, I would expect professional services and other expenses and marketing to be lower, which will still allow us to achieve our targeted expense guidance of about 3%."

And thank you -- as John said, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CME group. I hope you got a chance to read through the Q2 earnings commentary that we provided earlier this morning. We had a very strong second quarter. We had a record volume quarter in our agricultural product line and 4 additional asset classes grew double digits. 
Average daily volume was up 12% to more than 18 million contracts per day in Q2, following the record volumes in Q1. We reached a peak trading day of more than 50 million contracts on May 29. 
At the end of the first quarter, we announced the transaction with the NEX Group. As you know, the first order of business was the NEX shareholder approval, which was completed on May 19. We have begun our high-level integration planning process and are working closely with the teams of NEX. 
We continue to target a closing in the second half of this year. Global markets trading activity has slowed down during the month of July. July is, historically, one of the slower months of the year. Total ADV month-to-date at CME is down roughly 5%. But during this period 3 of our product areas have actually grown while the other 3 are down. 
When you add in the uncertainty of geopolitical issues and lower volatility which we are seeing on top of a traditionally slow month, the 5% down isn't a surprise to me. As we all know, there are always ebbs and flows this time of year. It is worth noting that our open interest, as of this morning, is roughly 123 million contracts, which is up 10%, versus this point a year ago and has built nicely during the month of July. In addition, large open interest holder data across the 6 product areas remains very strong, and to me this is a better measurement.

Market data rose 18% primarily driven by the screen fee increase, which went into effect in April. By maintaining our expense discipline, we delivered adjusted operating margins similar to our record first quarter of this year. On an adjusted basis, total nonoperating income increased 37% from $29 million in Q2 last year to $40 million during the second quarter this year, driven primarily by the performance of our joint venture with S&P and the earnings on cash held at the clearing house. However, sequentially, we saw a lower average cash balances held at that clearing house by participants in the second quarter, as customers rotated into treasuries, which offered a higher yield than holding cash. 
The net amount earned through managing cash was up 18% compared to Q2 of 2017, but was down from Q1. With strong revenue growth and careful expense management, adjusted net income and EPS both grew over 40% during the quarter.

And we actually had a series of records over the course of the -- this year in Q2. We had a monthly record -- total volume [indiscernible] record of open interest record quarter on track for the -- for -- continue to push those directions. What we're also seeing is record large open interest holders in our market. And what's important, tying back the question that Bryan just answered is our non-U.S. growth story, with Trump announcing tariffs that are coming on board that has created a significant concern about price risk. That drove a lot of the volume into participation in our contracts. This is very much a risk-on environment as represented by the record volume and record open interest and large open interest holders. We're also seeing on the day that we saw record volumes overall in the [ complex ] back in June. Most important, we saw record levels of participation from non-U.S. participants. So as regulatory concerns come on board relative to tariffs or not, we're actually seeing people [ pile in. ] For example, with the announcement yesterday. Trump and Juncker meeting, that had a very positive impact. We've seen our ag volumes overnight roughly come in at twice the amount. As of 7 o'clock this morning, we had about 220,000 contracts in our ag contracts. We typically see a slowdown going into the summer months of Q3. We're coming from record highs in Q1 and Q2, and our ag volume also set a record over the course of Q2. So we're seeing some seasonal basis of slowdown. But right now we're, as Terry mentioned before, starting from record levels of open interest and global participation. So I think we feel good about what the balance of the year is going to bring. And we've seen immediate positive impact in our volumes based on the questions that have risen so far."

So the difference between Brazilian soybean prices, U.S. soybean prices, that's really where most of the story is being told, but I do think that will be ironed out.

I'll walk you through, kind of, the Fed accounts and what occurred this quarter, then I'll hit the market data question. So in terms of the impact on the Fed accounts or the -- amounts that we earn for managing cash. In the first quarter, we had average cash balances of about $39.6 billion, that includes funds held at commercial banks as well as funds held at the Fed. In Q2, they went down to about $32.2 billion. So they were down on average $7.4 billion versus Q1. The main driver for the lower cash balances is that the U.S. Treasury has been increasing net issuance of treasury bills, which has pushed yields higher and made the T-Bills more attractive than the returns that could be held holding cash. So for example, 1-month treasury T-Bill yields a neighborhood of about 190 basis points. So that reduction in the overall average balances has reduced our take from managing the cash from about $28 million in the first quarter to about $25 million in the second quarter. So that should give you some color as to what occurred there. In terms of the audit findings. In the second quarter, audit findings were minimal. We had about little less than $2 million in audit findings in the second quarter impacting market data. I think, what Bryan said is the most important and that is, bringing that audit function in-house has allowed us to insure that there's compliance with our agreements. Which has in turn gave us more confidence in terms of the numbers that are being reported, which obviously impacted going go forward amount that we bill -- associated with market data. So some pretty positive from a go-forward perspective with audits."

So when you look at the growth in our business in just volumes alone, our Asian business is up 43% and a large piece of that is the energy business that we're pushing out in terms of WTI utilization. So part of this is, yes, tied to economic cycles, but we're paid to make sure that we can build franchises and portfolios that are going to thrive whether -- regardless of the shape of the yield curve, volatility curve or industrial cycles. What we are seeing is when products become more relevant to global participants, we're in the best position to make sure that we're addressing that opportunity and that growth. So -- and so we're happy about the product selection, and to Bryan's point, we put a lot of effort into training, education and the ability to access our markets through intermediaries.

So compensation, as you indicated, is our largest growth in terms of expenses. It's up about $28 million first half of this year versus first half of last year. 60% of the increase in the compensation line is incentive comps so that is bonus and stock-based compensation. The balance is in [ bank ] compensation, is primarily driven by cost of living increases. We did have some increase in headcount. So if you exclude incentive-based compensation, our total adjusted expenses grew only 1.5% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis adjusted expenses were flat with last year if you exclude incentive-based compensation.
So looking into the second half of the year, so rolling it forward, I would expect the pattern of our spend to remain similar with the fourth quarter heavier than the first quarter. But I would expect the fourth quarter to be less than 3% growth compared to last year. And so what you're seeing is for the first half of the year, we've been able to offset our compensation -- incentive compensation growth, through really, I think, great expense management across the entire organization and rolling into second half of the year, I would expect professional services and other expenses and marketing to be lower, which will still allow us to achieve our targeted expense guidance of about 3%."

And thank you -- as John said, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CME group. I hope you got a chance to read through the Q2 earnings commentary that we provided earlier this morning. We had a very strong second quarter. We had a record volume quarter in our agricultural product line and 4 additional asset classes grew double digits. 
Average daily volume was up 12% to more than 18 million contracts per day in Q2, following the record volumes in Q1. We reached a peak trading day of more than 50 million contracts on May 29. 
At the end of the first quarter, we announced the transaction with the NEX Group. As you know, the first order of business was the NEX shareholder approval, which was completed on May 19. We have begun our high-level integration planning process and are working closely with the teams of NEX. 
We continue to target a closing in the second half of this year. Global markets trading activity has slowed down during the month of July. July is, historically, one of the slower months of the year. Total ADV month-to-date at CME is down roughly 5%. But during this period 3 of our product areas have actually grown while the other 3 are down. 
When you add in the uncertainty of geopolitical issues and lower volatility which we are seeing on top of a traditionally slow month, the 5% down isn't a surprise to me. As we all know, there are always ebbs and flows this time of year. It is worth noting that our open interest, as of this morning, is roughly 123 million contracts, which is up 10%, versus this point a year ago and has built nicely during the month of July. In addition, large open interest holder data across the 6 product areas remains very strong, and to me this is a better measurement.

On an adjusted basis, total nonoperating income increased 37% from $29 million in Q2 last year to $40 million during the second quarter this year, driven primarily by the performance of our joint venture with S&P and the earnings on cash held at the clearing house. However, sequentially, we saw a lower average cash balances held at that clearing house by participants in the second quarter, as customers rotated into treasuries, which offered a higher yield than holding cash. 
The net amount earned through managing cash was up 18% compared to Q2 of 2017, but was down from Q1. With strong revenue growth and careful expense management, adjusted net income and EPS both grew over 40% during the quarter. 
With that short summary, we'd like to open up the call for your questions, and we'll start now."

We had a monthly record -- total volume [indiscernible] record of open interest record quarter on track for the -- for -- continue to push those directions. What we're also seeing is record large open interest holders in our market. And what's important, tying back the question that Bryan just answered is our non-U.S. growth story, with Trump announcing tariffs that are coming on board that has created a significant concern about price risk. That drove a lot of the volume into participation in our contracts. This is very much a risk-on environment as represented by the record volume and record open interest and large open interest holders. We're also seeing on the day that we saw record volumes overall in the [ complex ] back in June. Most important, we saw record levels of participation from non-U.S. participants. So as regulatory concerns come on board relative to tariffs or not, we're actually seeing people [ pile in. ] For example, with the announcement yesterday. Trump and Juncker meeting, that had a very positive impact. We've seen our ag volumes overnight roughly come in at twice the amount. As of 7 o'clock this morning, we had about 220,000 contracts in our ag contracts. We typically see a slowdown going into the summer months of Q3. We're coming from record highs in Q1 and Q2, and our ag volume also set a record over the course of Q2. So we're seeing some seasonal basis of slowdown. But right now we're, as Terry mentioned before, starting from record levels of open interest and global participation. So I think we feel good about what the balance of the year is going to bring. And we've seen immediate positive impact in our volumes based on the questions that have risen so far."

I'll walk you through, kind of, the Fed accounts and what occurred this quarter, then I'll hit the market data question. So in terms of the impact on the Fed accounts or the -- amounts that we earn for managing cash. In the first quarter, we had average cash balances of about $39.6 billion, that includes funds held at commercial banks as well as funds held at the Fed. In Q2, they went down to about $32.2 billion. So they were down on average $7.4 billion versus Q1. The main driver for the lower cash balances is that the U.S. Treasury has been increasing net issuance of treasury bills, which has pushed yields higher and made the T-Bills more attractive than the returns that could be held holding cash. So for example, 1-month treasury T-Bill yields a neighborhood of about 190 basis points. So that reduction in the overall average balances has reduced our take from managing the cash from about $28 million in the first quarter to about $25 million in the second quarter. So that should give you some color as to what occurred there. In terms of the audit findings. In the second quarter, audit findings were minimal. We had about little less than $2 million in audit findings in the second quarter impacting market data. I think, what Bryan said is the most important and that is, bringing that audit function in-house has allowed us to ensure that there's compliance with our agreements. Which has in turn gave us more confidence in terms of the numbers that are being reported, which obviously impacted going go forward amount that we bill -- associated with market data.

And it actually continues to set open interest records where we've seen about 145 million to 150 million barrels worth of open interest right now sitting at the Houston point. So we're actually pleased with the performance so far, and we think it's a high compliment to the Cushing contract. The reason we set that up, we actually launched an outright and a spread contract at the same time, letting the market choose [indiscernible] they wanted adopt and what the market has adopted is actually the spread contract back to WTI. So the market's very happy with the deep liquidity and the WTI contract on [ Globex. ] The cash-owned spread contract back in Houston is providing exactly what the market wants, which is a cash equivalent of the barrel delivered to the coast.

And we're finding quite an excitement, and I do believe that the client base is really untapped there. So even though there could be economic downturns, I think we have an opportunity to go after additional subsets of clients throughout the Asian community."

Usually, you would expect expenses to grow faster in the back half of the year, but given the unchanged guidance, it kind of seems like the second half would only grow around 2% to 3% year-over-year.

So compensation, as you indicated, is our largest growth in terms of expenses. It's up about $28 million first half of this year versus first half of last year. 60% of the increase in the compensation line is incentive comps so that is bonus and stock-based compensation. The balance is in [ bank ] compensation, is primarily driven by cost of living increases. We did have some increase in headcount. So if you exclude incentive-based compensation, our total adjusted expenses grew only 1.5% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis adjusted expenses were flat with last year if you exclude incentive-based compensation.
So looking into the second half of the year, so rolling it forward, I would expect the pattern of our spend to remain similar with the fourth quarter heavier than the first quarter. But I would expect the fourth quarter to be less than 3% growth compared to last year. And so what you're seeing is for the first half of the year, we've been able to offset our compensation -- incentive compensation growth, through really, I think, great expense management across the entire organization and rolling into second half of the year, I would expect professional services and other expenses and marketing to be lower, which will still allow us to achieve our targeted expense guidance of about 3%."

And thank you -- as John said, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CME group. I hope you got a chance to read through the Q2 earnings commentary that we provided earlier this morning. We had a very strong second quarter. We had a record volume quarter in our agricultural product line and 4 additional asset classes grew double digits. 
Average daily volume was up 12% to more than 18 million contracts per day in Q2, following the record volumes in Q1. We reached a peak trading day of more than 50 million contracts on May 29. 
At the end of the first quarter, we announced the transaction with the NEX Group. As you know, the first order of business was the NEX shareholder approval, which was completed on May 19. We have begun our high-level integration planning process and are working closely with the teams of NEX. 
We continue to target a closing in the second half of this year. Global markets trading activity has slowed down during the month of July. July is, historically, one of the slower months of the year. Total ADV month-to-date at CME is down roughly 5%. But during this period 3 of our product areas have actually grown while the other 3 are down. 
When you add in the uncertainty of geopolitical issues and lower volatility which we are seeing on top of a traditionally slow month, the 5% down isn't a surprise to me. As we all know, there are always ebbs and flows this time of year. It is worth noting that our open interest, as of this morning, is roughly 123 million contracts, which is up 10%, versus this point a year ago and has built nicely during the month of July. In addition, large open interest holder data across the 6 product areas remains very strong, and to me this is a better measurement. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to John to make a few financial highlights and we'll get into your questions. John?"

Market data rose 18% primarily driven by the screen fee increase, which went into effect in April. By maintaining our expense discipline, we delivered adjusted operating margins similar to our record first quarter of this year. On an adjusted basis, total nonoperating income increased 37% from $29 million in Q2 last year to $40 million during the second quarter this year, driven primarily by the performance of our joint venture with S&P and the earnings on cash held at the clearing house. However, sequentially, we saw a lower average cash balances held at that clearing house by participants in the second quarter, as customers rotated into treasuries, which offered a higher yield than holding cash. 
The net amount earned through managing cash was up 18% compared to Q2 of 2017, but was down from Q1. With strong revenue growth and careful expense management, adjusted net income and EPS both grew over 40% during the quarter.

We had a monthly record -- total volume [indiscernible] record of open interest record quarter on track for the -- for -- continue to push those directions. What we're also seeing is record large open interest holders in our market. And what's important, tying back the question that Bryan just answered is our non-U.S. growth story, with Trump announcing tariffs that are coming on board that has created a significant concern about price risk. That drove a lot of the volume into participation in our contracts. This is very much a risk-on environment as represented by the record volume and record open interest and large open interest holders. We're also seeing on the day that we saw record volumes overall in the [ complex ] back in June. Most important, we saw record levels of participation from non-U.S. participants. So as regulatory concerns come on board relative to tariffs or not, we're actually seeing people [ pile in. ] For example, with the announcement yesterday. Trump and Juncker meeting, that had a very positive impact. We've seen our ag volumes overnight roughly come in at twice the amount. As of 7 o'clock this morning, we had about 220,000 contracts in our ag contracts. We typically see a slowdown going into the summer months of Q3. We're coming from record highs in Q1 and Q2, and our ag volume also set a record over the course of Q2. So we're seeing some seasonal basis of slowdown. But right now we're, as Terry mentioned before, starting from record levels of open interest and global participation. So I think we feel good about what the balance of the year is going to bring. And we've seen immediate positive impact in our volumes based on the questions that have risen so far."

I'll walk you through, kind of, the Fed accounts and what occurred this quarter, then I'll hit the market data question. So in terms of the impact on the Fed accounts or the -- amounts that we earn for managing cash. In the first quarter, we had average cash balances of about $39.6 billion, that includes funds held at commercial banks as well as funds held at the Fed. In Q2, they went down to about $32.2 billion. So they were down on average $7.4 billion versus Q1. The main driver for the lower cash balances is that the U.S. Treasury has been increasing net issuance of treasury bills, which has pushed yields higher and made the T-Bills more attractive than the returns that could be held holding cash. So for example, 1-month treasury T-Bill yields a neighborhood of about 190 basis points. So that reduction in the overall average balances has reduced our take from managing the cash from about $28 million in the first quarter to about $25 million in the second quarter. So that should give you some color as to what occurred there. In terms of the audit findings. In the second quarter, audit findings were minimal. We had about little less than $2 million in audit findings in the second quarter impacting market data. I think, what Bryan said is the most important and that is, bringing that audit function in-house has allowed us to ensure that there's compliance with our agreements. Which has in turn gave us more confidence in terms of the numbers that are being reported, which obviously impacted going go forward amount that we bill -- associated with market data.

We've had more than 60 participants, we have more than 21,000 contracts in open interest, and we're seeing only about 3,000 contracts a day, but that's normal for a new contract.

In terms of the interest rate swaps, we do plan on launching SOFR-based interest rate swap clearing in September, and we're very excited about that as well. So we're looking forward to it. The next step for the industry is really to see issuance from corporate issuers. And we do have an announcement from one of the government agencies yesterday that they are going to begin issuing SOFR-based floaters soon. So that should help the market place to develop."

And we are the natural home for the SOFR complex relative to being the lowest cost in terms of transacting with our intercommodity spreads between Eurodollars with a LIBOR-based product that exists in the market place as well as the huge open interest that we have in our industry complex across Fed funds, Eurodollars and treasuries, which allow the market place the optimal kind of post trade margin and capital efficiencies.

So when you look at the growth in our business in just volumes alone, our Asian business is up 43% and a large piece of that is the energy business that we're pushing out in terms of WTI utilization. So part of this is, yes, tied to economic cycles, but we're paid to make sure that we can build franchises and portfolios that are going to thrive whether -- regardless of the shape of the yield curve, volatility curve or industrial cycles. What we are seeing is when products become more relevant to global participants, we're in the best position to make sure that we're addressing that opportunity and that growth. So -- and so we're happy about the product selection, and to Bryan's point, we put a lot of effort into training, education and the ability to access our markets through intermediaries. And that's showing through in some of the strong growth, 43% revenue growth in our energy's franchise in China, for example.

We have got new initiatives globally to get new clients, that we believe are completely untapped, never used our markets that will be able to use our markets, so we're excited by that. The infrastructure that we're putting in different parts of Asia such as market regulations, other things that make sure people really understand our markets.

So compensation, as you indicated, is our largest growth in terms of expenses. It's up about $28 million first half of this year versus first half of last year. 60% of the increase in the compensation line is incentive comps so that is bonus and stock-based compensation. The balance is in [ bank ] compensation, is primarily driven by cost of living increases. We did have some increase in headcount. So if you exclude incentive-based compensation, our total adjusted expenses grew only 1.5% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis adjusted expenses were flat with last year if you exclude incentive-based compensation.
So looking into the second half of the year, so rolling it forward, I would expect the pattern of our spend to remain similar with the fourth quarter heavier than the first quarter. But I would expect the fourth quarter to be less than 3% growth compared to last year. And so what you're seeing is for the first half of the year, we've been able to offset our compensation -- incentive compensation growth, through really, I think, great expense management across the entire organization and rolling into second half of the year, I would expect professional services and other expenses and marketing to be lower, which will still allow us to achieve our targeted expense guidance of about 3%."

I hope you got a chance to read through the third quarter earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. We have made good progress with several initiatives during the quarter, so let me share a few of those highlights. The diversity of our deep liquid product offerings was important during Q3 as trading generally slowed on exchanges around the world following a very strong first half of the year, as the CME particular strength in treasuries, equities and emerging market, FX curves and several commodity products. This offset a bit of a slowdown in global energy trading based on market conditions and fundamentals. More importantly, we gained traction in new offers, including our sulfur and interest rate contracts. We saw rising volume in interest as well as our record volume in our S&P Select Sector Futures in September. We set new daily records in our new monthly FX Futures and CME FX Link offerings. This totaled approximately 50,000 contracts on a single day in September. Within our commodities complex we announced in Q4, launched a WTI Houston crude oil contracts. This helps to reinforce the strength of our global benchmark WTI Cushing contract. In metals, we also saw continued growth in the copper options. We had record Q3 average daily volume and also record in our live stock options complex. We continue to make investments in our global sales effort. In September, we launched a new interactive CME liquidity tool to help market participant analyze liquidity, including current and historical bid spreads and cost to trade statistics across the CME asset classes. Customers can analyze activity during U.S., London and Singapore trading hours, helping to create new trading opportunities. CME's new liquidity tool has attracted the large amount of interest to clients across the globe. This is available on CME's website if you take a quick look at it. We're also pleased to announce the extension of the exclusive NASDAQ future lesson through 2029, ensuring market participants worldwide will continue to have seamless access to our suite of NASDAQ products and benefit from the capital efficiencies by trading alongside our industry-leading equity index complex. Finally, with respect to our next transaction, we're pleased to announce that the Department of Justice approved the approval of the transaction, we continue to expect the deal to close before year end. We've been working diligently over the last few months in the high-level integration planning with the next team. Our trading volume has picked up nicely so far in October. We are up 41% quarter-to-date versus last year. I mentioned product diversity earlier and it's nice to see interest rates equities that are up significantly in Q4 so far with the other 4 product areas growing just as well.

In addition to that, I might mention in terms of open interest holders, Q3 obviously was a very quiet quarter, if I could say that. October, if I say a very, very strongly across all of the asset classes in financial in particular. One thing I'd like to mention, I think, and I say continuously is we look to grow our complex in any volatility environments. I think we are very's pleased with the fact that we reached a record number of large open interest holders in each and every one of the financials asset classes during the month of September. Remember, again Q3 was relatively quiet. We have a record in FX, we have a record in rates, we have all-time record in equities. So bringing new participants in, we're getting deeper penetration with our existing participants and we're growing much stronger -- base to grow from."

We've offered commodities spreads against Eurodollar features, for example, in our Fed funds features, that means that it is the single most efficient place from an execution standpoint, so minimizing our execution cost trade bases between and LIBOR or Fed funds. In addition to that, we have obviously with the interest in Fed funds and Eurodollar in addition to, that most efficient from capital margin and total cost perspective relative the clearing up to 85% margin offsets against lot of the feature contracts.

We have proprietary products that we invest tremendous amount of revenue and tremendous amount of manpower into develop in these contracts. You just heard Sean probably talk about the selling the SOFR, some of the other, the BTIC products that we have come up with him and his team did to add value. So we don't go down the path of having to get approval from the CFTC on pricing of these, and that includes also our market data. So that different from the SEC model. On the equivalence issue you saw, Chairman of the commodity commission, a week or so ago, get very aggressive with the Europeans, letting know quite well that the U.S. will not be a my words, not his. And his game between U.K. and the EU, as it relates to central clearing, being able to do business in certain jurisdictions. So as the commodity exchange modernization act was written in 2000, our sole regulator is the CFTC, and we cannot actually comply with what is being proposed out of a mere 2.0 by to be in that Tier 2 section because we'll be against U.S. law. I think what's going on now is starting to prevail and we'll start to get the different that the Chairman has been calling for here in the U.S. And that's why I see that outside of regulatory standpoint, I think, as we said earlier, we're thrilled about Department of Justice and their approvals on our transaction and we're just going forward. But outside of that and from a regulatory side, I think, CME and I said this for a long time, the headwinds of CME are behind us on regulatory issues. We dealt with this between 2009 and, say, 2013, '14 before all the rules are finalized. But the rules of the here in the U.S. are very clear, and I think there's been a great benefit to, not only changes like ours, but the banking system in United States as well."

In line with that, we are seeing some pullback in open interest. We hit a peak open interest level of about $2.6 million contract in mid May. We've seen that track down just about $2.2 million, pretty much in line with Brent as well. We're not seeing anything other than what, I think, there's been a quiet period trading. Generally, when you look at sort of the conditions of trading in the energy markets through Brent WTI, a market where you got high-priced, low volatility, and where you see that TI Brent spread move out, generally that's a set of combination factors that really kind of tends to provide some pullback for some market participants. We're not necessarily surprised. We are seeing an industry slowdown a little bit, but we're very pleased about as we're seeing the continued participation and strength of the commercial participants. If you go back probably 2012 to '13, '14, we were probably under-penetrated with the commercial client base and the work we've done over the last 4 years, driving a lot of the growth that you just referenced that our TI contract has been predicated on getting into and been relevant and having the participation of those commercial participants. They're the contributing factor to record and TI up above 2.6 million contracts. We had a good start to Q4. I think up about 10%. We're seeing continued participation from the commercial participants. And you also saw us announced that we have a November 5 launch date for our Houston physical crude contract. We're excited about what that brings to the overall completion of the physical kind of value chain from Cushing into the Gulf export market participants, and we've been working very closely with the commercial participants to get to that launch.

And it's really a function of the need even in those periods of time for people to hedge. So one of the things that Sean has mentioned in his comments is really developing the markets -- developing the market with regard to volatility environment. So what we've done is we've been able to grow, even on a the slowest days, our volume. So if you look at our slowest 10 days, you see that increasing over the last several years. So really we're becoming embedded in our customers day-to-day operations. In terms of our financial profile, I would say, you would see us strong look at our expenses with our several line items, which we can take a look at with regards to slow down. The variable portion is, you see in terms of bonus, you also seen terms of our license fees, those are 2 line items that we decline in a situation where we have declining volumes. Also, in terms of our interest income line, that's really a function of where our customers want to invest their money if there is a crisis and they want to invest their money in cash. We certainly would earn as they move the cash from fixed income. Also in terms of other factors that we would take into consideration, it would be really around wide recession is coming.

Record number of large open interest holders in each and everyone of asset classes. During the Q3, when volatility was lower, is a good example. Another good example is, during policy in United States, we continue to launch a lot of new product and continue to grow the rates complex. If you look today actually at treasury futures complex, over the last 52 weeks, running at over 111% of the average daily volumes of the cash bond market. That number, if you recall, was in the mid-50s just 5 or 6 years ago. So huge growth there. In addition to that, in terms of new products, we talked about SONIA and SOFR. We also launched new Eurodollar options this year. Those are the new contracts quarterly as well as some mid-curves at 3, 6 and a 9-month contract and traded over $0.5 million contracts. I didn't mention actually earlier on the FX complex, but we're having very good success with our new monthly futures. On a new monthly futures, recently had a day of 33,000 contracts. We also traded spread to the quarterly, 12,000 those new monthly contracts added 45,000 contracts to our FX complex. obviously if you think about our FX complex when it does about 1 million contracts a day. That's a very, very significant impact on the overall growth. We've also launched FX Link. FX Link recently doing about 9,000 contracts a day. This allows participants in the OTC FX swap market to move their positions into standard listed lower total cost alternatives. So we're very excited about that. In terms of the financial crisis, I think, the overall system is in completely different place today. Bank balance sheets are strong, economic growth is strong. And in a very strong environment, where you see large price volatility, we see a lot more volume. You can see that in October, where our interest rate complex year-over-year in the month is up 43%, equities complex is up 116% and the FX complex is up as well. So it is a very healthy volatility."

And as far as skin in the game goes, I'm always a big believer, that you don't want to create a model risk or model hazard by letting the exchanges who are agnostic to the price going up and down, having someone have their capital put at risk first. We're big believers in peoples that introduce risk to the system should be putting the monies into the system, and that is to protect, in my opinion, the smaller FCMs that are part of the default pool. If you look here in United States, some of our smaller FCMs are clearing some of the most important business around, which is how produce food and other products, and the banks don't clear those particular clients. So if, in fact, a large bank or somebody else was to have a major default and takedown some of these smaller FCMs, we think, that would obviously be more catastrophic than what happened in Europe.

So we're tracking according to our plan with respect to derived. In the context of overall market data and how we're faring there, we're actually quite pleased in the context of that. As you know, the fee increase took affect April 1. Our customers have now had a good 7 months to absorb and adjust to that pricing change. As we look at the attrition, our attrition levels are much lower than what we had contemplated or projected. We're quite pleased with how the market has reacted to that, and I think it underscores the validity of the product, the services, the market data platform that we introduce for them to be able to consume this data efficiently. So from that perspective, we feel good about where things stand and the trajectory that In the context of the audits, the audits are performing what we had hoped, which is compliance with our program. So you will see from time-to-time, a chunky increase in the context of findings. As I tried to make clear in past reports, audit findings will be sporadic. There may not be every quarter. It's based upon when the findings are completed and resolution of those cases with the firms. What's more important is the context of correcting behavior. As you look at the attrition levels and those levels have actually decreased if you compare it to the past. I think that undergoes that we're in the firms, we're helping people correct behavior and we're seeing people increasing in terms of complying with their subscriber requirements."

I hope you've had a chance to read through the third quarter earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. We have made good progress with several initiatives during the quarter, so let me share a few of those highlights.
The diversity of our deep liquid product offerings was important during Q3 as trading generally slowed on exchanges around the world following a very strong first half of the year. At CME, we saw particular strength in treasuries, equities, emerging market, FX curves and several commodity products. This offset a bit of a slowdown in global energy trading based on market conditions and fundamentals.  More importantly, we gained traction in new offerings, including our SOFR and SONIA interest rate futures contracts. We saw rising volume in open interest as well as our record volume in our S&P Select Sector Futures in September. We set new daily records in our new monthly FX Futures and CME FX Link offerings. This totaled approximately 50,000 contracts on a single day in September.
Within our commodities complex, we announced a Q4 launch date for physically-delivered WTI Houston crude oil futures contracts. This helps to reinforce the strength of our global benchmark WTI Cushing contract.
In metals, we also saw continued growth in the copper options. We had record Q3 average daily volume in our red winter wheat options and also records in our livestock options complex. We continue to make investments in our global sales effort.
In September, we launched a new interactive CME Liquidity Tool to help market participants analyze liquidity, including current and historical bid-ask spreads, book depth and cost to trade statistics across the CME asset classes. Customers can analyze activity during U.S., London and Singapore trading hours, helping to create new trading opportunities.
CME's new liquidity tool has attracted a large amount of interest from clients across the globe. This is available on CME's website, and I encourage all of you to take a quick look at it. We're also pleased to announce the extension of the exclusive NASDAQ futures license through 2029, ensuring market participants worldwide will continue to have seamless access to our suite of NASDAQ products and benefit from the capital efficiencies by trading alongside our industry-leading equity index complex.
Finally, with respect to our NEX transaction, we're pleased to announce that the Department of Justice approved -- that with the approval of the transaction, we continue to expect the deal to close before the -- before year-end. We've been working diligently over the last few months in a high-level integration planning with the NEX team.
Our trading volume has picked up nicely so far in October. We are up 41% quarter-to-date versus last year. I mentioned product diversity earlier and it's nice to see interest rates equities that are up significantly in Q4 so far with the other 4 product areas growing just as well.
With that short summary, I'd like to open up your call for your questions."

We recently had an all-time record day in the NASDAQ contract, and we're seeing huge growth year-over-year in those volumes over 50%. So we're extremely excited about that, extremely excited about the success there. Another thing that we've been doing that, we've talked a lot about, as you know, delivering margin capital and total cost efficiencies to the marketplace. One of the areas that we've done that, in particular, with the advent of the uncleared margin rules in OTC space is we've offered total return futures on our S&P complex. We currently only offer those products out to 18 months, so relatively short. Nonetheless, we got huge traction. We now have over 200,000 contracts open interest in our S&P 500 total return features. The total return market -- total return swap market, I should say, trades out to 10 years very actively. So we are looking to extend that product beyond the S&P 500 to add additional indices.

October, we're growing, if I could say very, very strongly across all of the asset classes in the financial center in particular. One thing I'd like to mention, one thing that Derek and I say continuously is, we look to grow our complex in any volatility environment. So I think we're very pleased with the fact that we reached a record number of large open interest holders in each and every one of the financials asset classes during the month of September. Remember, again Q3 was relatively quiet. So -- but we had a record in FX, we had a record in rates, we had a record -- new all-time record in equities.

CME Group with our huge open interest in Eurodollar futures, Fed fund futures as well as the Treasury futures is the place that trade the basis between the new index and so the SOFR index, like I said, right, relative to those other indices. We've offered intercommodity spreads against our Eurodollar futures, for example, and our Fed funds futures that means that it is the single most efficient place from an execution standpoint, so minimizing your execution cost to trade the basis between SOFR and LIBOR or SOFR and OIS or SOFR and Fed funds. In addition to that, we have obviously the -- with the large open interest in Fed funds and Eurodollars in addition to that, the most efficient from a capital margin and total cost perspective relative to the clearing with up to 85% margin offsets against lot of the futures contracts. So in addition to that, in regard to SOFR, we now have over 80 participants trading the SOFR contracts. We got over 40,000 contracts of an interest, that is the equivalent over $155 billion in notional terms and we're trading about 8,000 contracts to date this month. So we are excited about that. In terms of SONIA, we have an ADV this month of 3,400 contracts. So we're also getting very, very good traction there. One another unique value proposition that CME Group has that no other firm has, no other clearing house has in the world is, we're both clearing the SOFR industry swaps and we're clearing the SOFR futures. So we did announce -- we did start clearing SOFR interest rate swaps. We've cleared interest rate swaps for 5 different institutions. There was a great time, if you've seen our press release, some of the top, great institutions in the planet have already started clearing the SOFR interest rate swaps with us.

We have proprietary products that we invest a tremendous amount of revenue and tremendous amount of manpower into developing these contracts. You just heard Sean Tully talk about the selling of the SOFR, some of the other, the BTIC products that we have come up and him and his team did to add value. So we don't go down the path of having to get approval from the CFTC on pricing of these, and that includes also our market data. So that's different from the SEC model. On the equivalence issue you saw, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a week or so ago, get very aggressive with the Europeans, letting them know quite well that the U.S. will not be a political football forward is my words, not his. And this game between the U.K. and the EU, as it relates to central clearing houses being able to do business in certain jurisdictions. So as the commodity exchange modernization act was written in 2000, our sole regulator is the CFTC, and we cannot actually comply with what is being proposed out of EMIR 2.0 by ESMA to be in that Tier 2 section because we'll be technically against U.S. law. So I think what's going on now as cooler heads are starting to prevail and we'll start to get the difference that the Chairman has been calling for here in the U.S. And that's why I see that outside of that from a regulatory standpoint, I think, as we said earlier, we're thrilled about the Department of Justice and their approvals on our transaction and we're just going forward. But outside of that and from a regulatory side, I think, CME and I've said this for a long time, the headwinds of CME are now behind us on regulatory issues. We dealt with this between 2009 and, say, 2013, '14 before all the rules are finalized. But the rules that are wrote here in the U.S. are very clear, and I think that's been a great benefit to not only exchanges like ours but the banking system in United States as well."

If you actually get the year-to-date market shares between sort of the growth of ours, the WTI contract, year-to-date, we're down 2%. We're seeing ICE's Brent contract down about 4%. In line with that, we are seeing some pullback in open interest. We hit a peak open interest level of about 2.6 million contracts in mid-May. We've seen that track lower down just about 2.2 million, pretty much in line with our Brent OIS as well. So we're not seeing anything other than, I think, what there's been a quiet period trading. Generally, when you look at sort of the conditions of trading in the energy market through a Brent, through WTI, a market where you got high price, low volatility, and where you see that TI Brent spread move out. Generally, that's a set of combinational factors that really kind of tends to provide some pullback for some market participants. So we're not necessarily surprised. We are seeing an industry slowdown a little bit. What we're very pleased about as we're seeing the continued participation and strength of the commercial participants. If you go back to probably 2012, '13, '14, we were probably under-penetrated with the commercial client base and the work we've done over the last 4 years, driving a lot of the growth that you just referenced that our TI contract has been predicated on getting into and being relevant and also having the participation of those commercial participants. They're the contributing factor to record OI and TI up above 2.6 million contracts. So we've had a good start to Q4. I think our energy volume is up about 10%. We're seeing continued participation from the commercial participants. And you also saw us announce that we have a November 5 launch date for our Houston physical crude contract. So we're excited about what that brings to the overall completion of the physical kind of value chain from Cushing into the Gulf for the export market participants, and we've been working very closely with the commercial participants to get to that launch. So certainly slowdown in Q3. We're seeing that pick up again along our nat gas volumes year-to-date and going into Q4 as well."

But generally speaking, as you know, we've got a very resilient model. So even during the toughest times during the crisis, we still were very cash generative. We still had very good margins. And it's really a function of the need even in these -- in those periods of time for people to hedge. So one of the things that Sean had mentioned in his comments is really developing the markets -- developing the markets with regard to the volatility environment. So what we've done is we've been able to grow, even on the slowest days, our volume. So if you look at our slowest 10 days, you see that increasing over the last several years. So really we're becoming embedded in our customers' day-to-day operations. In terms of our financial profile, I would say, you would see us taking a strong look at our expenses with our several line items, which we can take a look at with regard to slow down. The variable portion is, you see in our -- in terms of our bonus, you also see in terms of our license fees, those are 2 items -- 2 line items that will decline in a situation where we have declining volumes. Also in terms of our interest income line, that's really a function of where our customers want to invest their money if there is a crisis and they want to invest their money in cash, we certainly would earn as they move to cash from fixed income. Also in terms of other factors that we would take into consideration, it would be really around why the recession is coming. So generally speaking, if it's a highly volatile situation, we'd see a uptick in volumes followed by obviously a slowdown should there be a recession. Sean?"

So we continuously look, as John said, right, and I mentioned it earlier, in every environment to grow our complex, right. For the record number of large open interest holders in each and every one of the financial asset classes. During the Q3, when volatility was lower, is I think a good example. Another good example is, during Zero Interest Rate Policy in the United States, we continue to launch a lot of new product and continue to grow the rates complex. If you look today actually at our treasury futures complex, over the last 52 weeks, we're now running at over 111% of the average daily volumes of the cash treasury bond market. That number, if you recall, was in the mid-50s just 5 or 6 years ago. So huge growth there. In addition to that, in terms of new products, we talked about SONIA and SOFR. We also launched some new Eurodollar mid-curve options this year. Those are traded the new contracts a fifth quarterly as well as some term mid-curves at 3, 6 and a 9-month contract and that's traded over 0.5 million contracts. I didn't mention actually earlier anything on the FX complex, but we're having very good success with our new monthly futures. Our new monthly futures, recently, had a day of 33,000 contracts. We also traded at a spread to the quarterly, the 12,000 from that data as new monthly contracts added 45,000 contracts to our FX complex. The fact obviously if you think about our FX complex when it does about 1 million contracts a day, so that's a very significant impact on the overall growth. We've also launched FX Link. FX Link recently doing about 9,000 contracts a day. This allows participants in the OTC FX swap market to move their positions into standardized listed lower total cost alternatives. So we're very excited about that. In terms of the financial crisis, I think, the overall system is in completely different place today. Bank balance sheets are strong, economic growth is strong. And in a very strong environment, where you see large price volatility, we see a lot more volume. And you can see that in October, where our interest rate complex year-over-year in the month is up 43%, equities complex is up 116% and the FX complex is up as well. So it is a very healthy volatility."

One of the things that we do not have here at CME, as you know, we don't have anybody who does not come to an FCM. So there's an extra layer of protection that comes into our clearing house. And as far as skin in the game goes, I'm always a big believer that you don't want to create a model risk or model hazard by letting the exchanges who are agnostic to the price going up and down, having then -- have someone have their capital put at risk first. We're big believers in people that introduce risk to the system should be putting the moneys into the system and that is to protect, in my opinion, the smaller FCMs that are part of the default pool. If you look here in the United States, some of our smaller FCMs are clearing some of the most important business around, which is how we all eat in this country produce food and other products, and the banks don't clear those particular clients. So if, in fact, a large bank or somebody else was to have a major default and takedown some of these smaller FCMs, we think, that would obviously be more catastrophic than what happened in Europe. So as far as skin in the game goes, we do believe that people who bring the risk, introduce the risk should be putting up the money to protect the entire system and that for me is the fairest way to look at it.

I hope you've had a chance to read through the third quarter earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. We have made good progress with several initiatives during the quarter, so let me share a few of those highlights.
The diversity of our deep liquid product offerings was important during Q3, as trading generally slowed on exchanges around the world following a very strong first half of the year. At CME, we saw particular strength in treasuries, equities, emerging market FX curves and several commodity products. This offset a bit of a slowdown in global energy trading based on market conditions and fundamentals. More importantly, we gained traction in new offerings, including our SOFR and SONIA interest rate futures contracts. We saw rising volume in open interest as well as our record volume in our S&P Select Sector Futures in September. We set new daily records in our new monthly FX Futures and CME FX Link offerings. This totaled approximately 50,000 contracts on a single day in September.
Within our commodities complex, we announced a Q4 launch date for physically-delivered WTI Houston crude oil futures contracts. This helps to reinforce the strength of our global benchmark WTI Cushing contract.
In metals, we also saw continued growth in the copper options. We had record Q3 average daily volume in our red winter wheat options and also records in our livestock options complex. We continue to make investments in our global sales effort.
In September, we launched a new interactive CME Liquidity Tool to help market participants analyze liquidity, including current and historical bid-ask spreads, book depth and cost-to-trade statistics across the CME asset classes. Customers can analyze activity during U.S., London and Singapore trading hours, helping to create new trading opportunities.
CME's new liquidity tool has attracted a large amount of interest from clients across the globe. This is available on CME's website, and I encourage all of you to take a quick look at it. We're also pleased to announce the extension of the exclusive NASDAQ futures license through 2029, ensuring market participants worldwide will continue to have seamless access to our suite of NASDAQ products and benefit from the capital efficiencies by trading alongside our industry-leading equity index complex.
Finally, with respect to our NEX transaction, we're pleased to announce that the Department of Justice approved -- that with the approval of the transaction, we continue to expect the deal to close before the -- before year-end. We've been working diligently over the last few months on a high-level integration planning with the NEX team.
Our trading volume has picked up nicely so far in October. We are up 41% quarter-to-date versus last year. I mentioned product diversity earlier, and it's nice to see interest rates equities that are up significantly in Q4 so far, with the other 4 product areas growing just as well.
With that short summary, I'd like to open up your call for your questions."

We recently had an all-time record day in the NASDAQ contract, and we're seeing huge growth year-over-year in those volumes of over 50%. So we're extremely excited about that, extremely excited about the success there. Another thing that we've been doing that we've talked a lot about, as you know, delivering margin capital and total cost efficiencies to the marketplace. One of the areas that we've done that, in particular, with the advent of the uncleared margin rules in OTC space is we've offered total return futures on our S&P complex. We currently only offer those products out to 18 months, so relatively short. Nonetheless, we got huge traction. We now have over 200,000 contracts open interest in our S&P 500 total return futures. The total return market -- total return swap market, I should say, trades out to 10 years very actively. So we are looking to extend that product beyond the S&P 500 to add additional indices. We're also looking to extend and add additional futures contracts that will extend the product out in terms of the maturities.

In addition to that, I might mention in terms of large open interest holders, Q3 obviously was a very quiet quarter, if I could say that. October, we're growing, if I could say very, very strongly across all of the asset classes, in the financials unit in particular. One thing I'd like to mention, one of the things that Derek and I say continuously is, we look to grow our complex in any volatility environment. So I think we're very pleased with the fact that we reached a record number of large open interest holders in each and every one of the financials asset classes during the month of September. Remember again, Q2 was relatively quiet. So -- but we had a record in FX, we had a record in rates, we had a record -- new all-time record in equities.

So right, we see the opportunity with the new interest rate benchmarks to keep basis trading, in particular, between that benchmark and the existing benchmarks, right. CME Group, with our huge open interest in Eurodollar futures, Fed funds futures as well as the Treasury futures, is the place to trade the basis between the new index and so the SOFR index, if I can say it, right, relative to those other indices. We've offered intercommodity spreads against our Eurodollar futures, for example, and our Fed funds futures. That means that it is the single most efficient place from an execution standpoint, so minimizing your execution cost to trade the basis between SOFR and LIBOR, or SOFR and OIS, or SOFR and Fed funds. In addition to that, we have obviously the -- with the large open interest in Fed funds and Eurodollars in addition to that, the most efficient from a capital margin and total cost perspective relative to the clearing with up to 85% margin offsets against our other futures contracts. So in addition to that, in regard to SOFR, we now have over 80 participants trading the SOFR contracts. We've got over 40,000 contracts open interest. That is the equivalent of over $155 billion in notional terms and we're trading about 8,000 contracts to date this month. So we are excited about that. In terms of SONIA, we have an ADV this month of 3,400 contracts. So we're also getting very, very good traction there. One -- another unique value proposition that CME Group has that no other firm has, no other clearing house has in the world is, we're both clearing the SOFR industry swaps and we're clearing the SOFR futures. So we did announce -- we did start clearing SOFR interest rate swaps. We've cleared interest rate swaps for 5 different institutions. There was a great, if you've seen our press release, some of the top rates institutions in the planet have already started clearing the SOFR interest rate swaps with us. So we also have that unique value proposition of having both the futures and the swaps, and we have that both for SONIA and SOFR."

So we don't go down the path of having to get approval from the CFTC on pricing of these, and that includes also our market data. So that's different from the SEC model.

So as the commodity exchange modernization act was written in 2000, our sole regulator is the CFTC, and we cannot actually comply with what is being proposed out of EMIR 2.0 by ESMA to be in that Tier 2 section because it would be technically against U.S. law. So I think what's going on now is cooler heads are starting to prevail, and we'll start to get the deference that the Chairman has been calling for here in the U.S. And that's where I see that. Outside of that from a regulatory standpoint, I think, as we said earlier, we're thrilled about the Department of Justice and their approvals on our transaction and we're just going forward. But outside of that and from a regulatory side, I think, CME and I've said this for a long time, the headwinds of CME are now behind us on regulatory issues. We dealt with this between 2009 and, say, 2013, '14 before all the rules were finalized. But the rules of the road here in the U.S. are very clear, and I think that's been a great benefit to not only exchanges like ours but the banking system in United States as well."

The TI contract has been a huge growth driver for, yes, over the last 4 years for us and continues to do so. We saw an industry-wide slowdown in Q3 this year. If you actually get the year-to-date market shares between sort of the growth of ours WTI contract, year-to-date, we're down 2%. We're seeing ICE's Brent contract down about 4%. In line with that, we are seeing some pullback in open interest. We hit a peak open interest level of about 2.6 million contracts in mid-May. We've seen that track lower. We're down just about 2.2 million, pretty much in line with where our Brent OI is as well. So we're not seeing anything other than, I think, what has been a quiet period trading. Generally, when you look at sort of the conditions of trading in the energy market through a Brent, through a WTI, a market where you got high price, low volatility and where you see that TI Brent spread move out, generally, that's a set of combination of factors that really kind of tends to provide some pullback for some market participants. So we're not necessarily surprised. We are seeing an industry slowdown a little bit. What we're very pleased about is we're seeing the continued participation and strength of the commercial participants. If you go back to probably 2012, '13, '14, we were probably under-penetrated with the commercial client base. And the work we've done over the last 4 years, driving a lot of the growth that you just referenced in our TI contract has been predicated on getting into and being relevant and also having the participation of those commercial participants. They're the contributing factor to record OI and TI up above 2.6 million contracts. So we've had a good start to Q4. I think our energy volume is up about 10%. We're seeing continued participation from the commercial participants. And you also saw us announce that we have a November 5 launch date for our Houston physical crude contract. So we're excited about what that brings to the overall completion of the physical kind of value chain from Cushing into the Gulf for the export market participants, and we've been working very closely with the commercial participants to get to that launch. So certainly a slowdown in Q3. We're seeing that pick up again along our nat gas volumes year-to-date and going into Q4 as well."

But generally speaking, as you know, we've got a very resilient model. So even during the toughest times during the crisis, we still were very cash generative. We still had very good margins. And it's really a function of the need even in these -- in those periods of time for people to hedge. So one of the things that Sean had mentioned in his comments is really developing the markets -- developing the markets with regard to the volatility environment. So what we've done is we've been able to grow, even on the slowest days, our volume. So if you look at our slowest 10 days, you see that increasing over the last several years. So really, we're becoming embedded in our customers' day-to-day operations. In terms of our financial profile, I would say, you would see us taking a strong look at our expenses with our several line items, which we can take a look at with regard to a slowdown. The variable portion is, you see in our -- in terms of our bonus, you also see in terms of our license fees. Those are 2 items -- 2 line items that would decline in a situation where we have declining volumes. Also, in terms of our interest income line, that's really a function of where our customers want to invest their money. If there is a crisis and they want to invest their money in cash, we certainly would earn as they move to cash from fixed income. Also, in terms of other factors that we would take into consideration, it would be really around why the recession is coming. So generally speaking, if it's a highly volatile situation, we'd see an uptick in volumes followed by obviously a slowdown should there be a recession. Sean?"

So we continuously look, as John said, right, and I mentioned it earlier, in every environment to grow our complex, right, for the record number of large open interest holders in each and every one of the financials asset classes. During the Q3, when volatility was lower, is I think a good example. Another good example is, during Zero Interest Rate Policy in the United States, we continue to launch a lot of new product and continue to grow the rates complex. If you look today actually at our treasury futures complex, over the last 52 weeks, we're now running at over 111% of the average daily volumes of the cash treasury bond market. That number, if you recall, was in the mid-50s just 5 or 6 years ago. So huge growth there. In addition to that, in terms of new products, we talked about SONIA and SOFR. We also launched some new Eurodollar mid-curve options this year. Those are traded, the new contracts, a fifth quarterly as well as some term mid-curves at 3, 6 and a 9-month contract, and that's traded over 0.5 million contracts. I didn't mention actually earlier anything on the FX complex, but we're having very good success with our new monthly futures. Our new monthly futures recently had a day of 33,000 contracts. We also traded at a spread to the quarterlies another 12,000, so on that day, those new monthly contracts added 45,000 contracts to our FX complex. The Fed obviously -- if you think about our FX complex, it only does about 1 million contracts a day, so that's a very significant impact on the overall growth. We've also launched FX Link. FX Link recently doing about 9,000 contracts a day. This allows participants in the OTC FX swap market to move their positions into standardized listed lower total cost alternatives. So we're very excited about that. In terms of the financial crisis, I think the overall system is in a completely different place today. Bank balance sheets are strong. Economic growth is strong. And in a very strong environment where you see large price volatility, we see a lot more volume. And you can see that in October, where our interest rate complex year-over-year in the month is up 43%, equities complex is up 116% and the FX complex is up as well. So it is a very healthy volatility."

One of the things that we do not have here at CME, as you know, we don't have anybody who does not come through an FCM. So there's an extra layer of protection that comes into our clearing house. And as far as skin in the game goes, I'm always a big believer that you don't want to create a mortal risk or a mortal hazard by letting the exchanges who are agnostic to the price going up and down, having then -- have someone have their capital put at risk first. We're big believers in people that introduce risk to the system should be putting the moneys into the system, and that is to protect, in my opinion, the smaller FCMs that are part of the default pool. If you look here in the United States, some of our smallest FCMs are clearing some of the most important business around, which is how we all eat in this country, produce food and other products, and the banks don't clear those particular clients. So if, in fact, a large bank or somebody else was to have a major default and take down some of these smaller FCMs, we think that would obviously be more catastrophic than what happened in Europe. So as far as skin in the game goes, we do believe that people who bring the risk, introduce the risk should be putting up the money to protect the entire system, and that for me is the fairest way to look at it.

I hope you've had a chance to read through the third quarter earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. We have made good progress with several initiatives during the quarter, so let me share a few of those highlights.
The diversity of our deep liquid product offerings was important during Q3, as trading generally slowed on exchanges around the world following a very strong first half of the year. At CME, we saw particular strength in treasuries, equities, emerging market FX curves and several commodity products. This offset a bit of a slowdown in global energy trading based on market conditions and fundamentals. More importantly, we gained traction in new offerings, including our SOFR and SONIA interest rate futures contracts. We saw rising volume in open interest as well as our record volume in our S&P Select Sector Futures in September. We set new daily records in our new monthly FX Futures and CME FX Link offerings. This totaled approximately 50,000 contracts on a single day in September.
Within our commodities complex, we announced a Q4 launch date for physically-delivered WTI Houston crude oil futures contracts. This helps to reinforce the strength of our global benchmark WTI Cushing contract.
In metals, we also saw continued growth in the copper options. We had record Q3 average daily volume in our red winter wheat options and also records in our livestock options complex. We continue to make investments in our global sales effort.
In September, we launched a new interactive CME Liquidity Tool to help market participants analyze liquidity, including current and historical bid-ask spreads, book depth and cost-to-trade statistics across the CME asset classes. Customers can analyze activity during U.S., London and Singapore trading hours, helping to create new trading opportunities.
CME's new liquidity tool has attracted a large amount of interest from clients across the globe. This is available on CME's website, and I encourage all of you to take a quick look at it. We're also pleased to announce the extension of the exclusive NASDAQ futures license through 2029, ensuring market participants worldwide will continue to have seamless access to our suite of NASDAQ products and benefit from the capital efficiencies by trading alongside our industry-leading equity index complex.
Finally, with respect to our NEX transaction, we're pleased to announce that the Department of Justice approved -- that with the approval of the transaction, we continue to expect the deal to close before the -- before year-end. We've been working diligently over the last few months on a high-level integration planning with the NEX team.
Our trading volume has picked up nicely so far in October. We are up 41% quarter-to-date versus last year. I mentioned product diversity earlier, and it's nice to see interest rates equities that are up significantly in Q4 so far, with the other 4 product areas growing just as well.
With that short summary, I'd like to open up your call for your questions."

So we're very excited about the developments there. Other developments, we've announced that we had extended the NASDAQ contract. We're excited about that. We recently had an all-time record day in the NASDAQ contract, and we're seeing huge growth year-over-year in those volumes of over 50%. So we're extremely excited about that, extremely excited about the success there. Another thing that we've been doing that we've talked a lot about, as you know, delivering margin capital and total cost efficiencies to the marketplace. One of the areas that we've done that, in particular, with the advent of the uncleared margin rules in OTC space is we've offered total return futures on our S&P complex. We currently only offer those products out to 18 months, so relatively short. Nonetheless, we got huge traction. We now have over 200,000 contracts open interest in our S&P 500 total return futures. The total return market -- total return swap market, I should say, trades out to 10 years very actively. So we are looking to extend that product beyond the S&P 500 to add additional indices. We're also looking to extend and add additional futures contracts that will extend the product out in terms of the maturities.

If you again look at October, October has been a phenomenal month, with our equities complex up well over 100% on a year-over-year basis in the month. In addition to that, I might mention in terms of large open interest holders, Q3 obviously was a very quiet quarter, if I could say that. October, we're growing, if I could say very, very strongly across all of the asset classes, in the financials unit in particular. One thing I'd like to mention, one of the things that Derek and I say continuously is, we look to grow our complex in any volatility environment. So I think we're very pleased with the fact that we reached a record number of large open interest holders in each and every one of the financials asset classes during the month of September. Remember again, Q2 was relatively quiet. So -- but we had a record in FX, we had a record in rates, we had a record -- new all-time record in equities.

So right, we see the opportunity with the new interest rate benchmarks to keep basis trading, in particular, between that benchmark and the existing benchmarks, right. CME Group, with our huge open interest in Eurodollar futures, Fed funds futures as well as the Treasury futures, is the place to trade the basis between the new index and so the SOFR index, if I can say it, right, relative to those other indices. We've offered intercommodity spreads against our Eurodollar futures, for example, and our Fed funds futures. That means that it is the single most efficient place from an execution standpoint, so minimizing your execution cost to trade the basis between SOFR and LIBOR, or SOFR and OIS, or SOFR and Fed funds. In addition to that, we have obviously the -- with the large open interest in Fed funds and Eurodollars in addition to that, the most efficient from a capital margin and total cost perspective relative to the clearing with up to 85% margin offsets against our other futures contracts. So in addition to that, in regard to SOFR, we now have over 80 participants trading the SOFR contracts. We've got over 40,000 contracts open interest. That is the equivalent of over $155 billion in notional terms and we're trading about 8,000 contracts to date this month. So we are excited about that. In terms of SONIA, we have an ADV this month of 3,400 contracts. So we're also getting very, very good traction there. One -- another unique value proposition that CME Group has that no other firm has, no other clearing house has in the world is, we're both clearing the SOFR industry swaps and we're clearing the SOFR futures. So we did announce -- we did start clearing SOFR interest rate swaps. We've cleared interest rate swaps for 5 different institutions. There was a great, if you've seen our press release, some of the top rates institutions in the planet have already started clearing the SOFR interest rate swaps with us. So we also have that unique value proposition of having both the futures and the swaps, and we have that both for SONIA and SOFR."

We have proprietary products that we invest a tremendous amount of revenue and tremendous amount of manpower into developing these contracts. You just heard Sean Tully talk about the selling of the SOFR, some of the other, the BTIC products that we have come up with and him and his team did to add value. So we don't go down the path of having to get approval from the CFTC on pricing of these, and that includes also our market data. So that's different from the SEC model. On the equivalence issue you saw, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a week or so ago, get very aggressive with the Europeans, letting them know quite well that the U.S. will not be a political football for it, using my words, not his, in this game between the U.K. and the EU, as it relates to central clearing houses being able to do business in certain jurisdictions. So as the commodity exchange modernization act was written in 2000, our sole regulator is the CFTC, and we cannot actually comply with what is being proposed out of EMIR 2.0 by ESMA to be in that Tier 2 section because it would be technically against U.S. law. So I think what's going on now is cooler heads are starting to prevail, and we'll start to get the deference that the Chairman has been calling for here in the U.S. And that's where I see that. Outside of that from a regulatory standpoint, I think, as we said earlier, we're thrilled about the Department of Justice and their approvals on our transaction and we're just going forward. But outside of that and from a regulatory side, I think, CME and I've said this for a long time, the headwinds of CME are now behind us on regulatory issues. We dealt with this between 2009 and, say, 2013, '14 before all the rules were finalized. But the rules of the road here in the U.S. are very clear, and I think that's been a great benefit to not only exchanges like ours but the banking system in United States as well."

The TI contract has been a huge growth driver for, yes, over the last 4 years for us and continues to do so. We saw an industry-wide slowdown in Q3 this year. If you actually get the year-to-date market shares between sort of the growth of ours WTI contract, year-to-date, we're down 2%. We're seeing ICE's Brent contract down about 4%. In line with that, we are seeing some pullback in open interest. We hit a peak open interest level of about 2.6 million contracts in mid-May. We've seen that track lower. We're down just about 2.2 million, pretty much in line with where our Brent OI is as well. So we're not seeing anything other than, I think, what has been a quiet period trading. Generally, when you look at sort of the conditions of trading in the energy market through a Brent, through a WTI, a market where you got high price, low volatility and where you see that TI Brent spread move out, generally, that's a set of combination of factors that really kind of tends to provide some pullback for some market participants. So we're not necessarily surprised. We are seeing an industry slowdown a little bit. What we're very pleased about is we're seeing the continued participation and strength of the commercial participants. If you go back to probably 2012, '13, '14, we were probably under-penetrated with the commercial client base. And the work we've done over the last 4 years, driving a lot of the growth that you just referenced in our TI contract has been predicated on getting into and being relevant and also having the participation of those commercial participants. They're the contributing factor to record OI and TI up above 2.6 million contracts. So we've had a good start to Q4. I think our energy volume is up about 10%. We're seeing continued participation from the commercial participants. And you also saw us announce that we have a November 5 launch date for our Houston physical crude contract. So we're excited about what that brings to the overall completion of the physical kind of value chain from Cushing into the Gulf for the export market participants, and we've been working very closely with the commercial participants to get to that launch. So certainly a slowdown in Q3. We're seeing that pick up again along our nat gas volumes year-to-date and going into Q4 as well."

But generally speaking, as you know, we've got a very resilient model. So even during the toughest times during the crisis, we still were very cash generative. We still had very good margins. And it's really a function of the need even in these -- in those periods of time for people to hedge. So one of the things that Sean had mentioned in his comments is really developing the markets -- developing the markets with regard to the volatility environment. So what we've done is we've been able to grow, even on the slowest days, our volume. So if you look at our slowest 10 days, you see that increasing over the last several years. So really, we're becoming embedded in our customers' day-to-day operations. In terms of our financial profile, I would say, you would see us taking a strong look at our expenses with our several line items, which we can take a look at with regard to a slowdown. The variable portion is, you see in our -- in terms of our bonus, you also see in terms of our license fees. Those are 2 items -- 2 line items that would decline in a situation where we have declining volumes. Also, in terms of our interest income line, that's really a function of where our customers want to invest their money. If there is a crisis and they want to invest their money in cash, we certainly would earn as they move to cash from fixed income. Also, in terms of other factors that we would take into consideration, it would be really around why the recession is coming. So generally speaking, if it's a highly volatile situation, we'd see an uptick in volumes followed by obviously a slowdown should there be a recession. Sean?"

During the Q3, when",400,"Yes. So we continuously look, as John said, right, and I mentioned it earlier, in every environment to grow our complex, right, for the record number of large open interest holders in each and every one of the financials asset classes. During the Q3, when volatility was lower, is I think a good example. Another good example is, during Zero Interest Rate Policy in the United States, we continue to launch a lot of new product and continue to grow the rates complex. If you look today actually at our treasury futures complex, over the last 52 weeks, we're now running at over 111% of the average daily volumes of the cash treasury bond market. That number, if you recall, was in the mid-50s just 5 or 6 years ago. So huge growth there. In addition to that, in terms of new products, we talked about SONIA and SOFR. We also launched some new Eurodollar mid-curve options this year. Those are traded, the new contracts, a fifth quarterly as well as some term mid-curves at 3, 6 and a 9-month contract, and that's traded over 0.5 million contracts. I didn't mention actually earlier anything on the FX complex, but we're having very good success with our new monthly futures. Our new monthly futures recently had a day of 33,000 contracts. We also traded at a spread to the quarterlies another 12,000, so on that day, those new monthly contracts added 45,000 contracts to our FX complex. The Fed obviously -- if you think about our FX complex, it only does about 1 million contracts a day, so that's a very significant impact on the overall growth. We've also launched FX Link. FX Link recently doing about 9,000 contracts a day. This allows participants in the OTC FX swap market to move their positions into standardized listed lower total cost alternatives. So we're very excited about that. In terms of the financial crisis, I think the overall system is in a completely different place today. Bank balance sheets are strong. Economic growth is strong. And in a very strong environment where you see large price volatility, we see a lot more volume. And you can see that in October, where our interest rate complex year-over-year in the month is up 43%, equities complex is up 116% and the FX complex is up as well. So it is a very healthy volatility."

One of the things that we do not have here at CME, as you know, we don't have anybody who does not come through an FCM. So there's an extra layer of protection that comes into our clearing house. And as far as skin in the game goes, I'm always a big believer that you don't want to create a mortal risk or a mortal hazard by letting the exchanges who are agnostic to the price going up and down, having then -- have someone have their capital put at risk first. We're big believers in people that introduce risk to the system should be putting the moneys into the system, and that is to protect, in my opinion, the smaller FCMs that are part of the default pool. If you look here in the United States, some of our smallest FCMs are clearing some of the most important business around, which is how we all eat in this country, produce food and other products, and the banks don't clear those particular clients. So if, in fact, a large bank or somebody else was to have a major default and take down some of these smaller FCMs, we think that would obviously be more catastrophic than what happened in Europe. So as far as skin in the game goes, we do believe that people who bring the risk, introduce the risk should be putting up the money to protect the entire system, and that for me is the fairest way to look at it.
