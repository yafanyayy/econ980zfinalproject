For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level trends we're seeing in the business. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter. Beginning with our operational results for the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and a net income of $159 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.55, including a onetime provision for income taxes of $208 million related to tax reform. 
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.4%, net income of $431 million, up 5% year-over-year; and diluted earnings per share of $1.48, up 7% year-over-year. HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were a record 87.5 exabytes, up 28% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 2.2 terabytes per drive, up 29% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was $68, up 3% year-over-year. 
GAAP operating expenses were $444 million, down 15% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating expenses were $390 million, also down 15% year-over-year. 
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $850 million, up 30% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $773 million, up 38% year-over-year. 
Achieving revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the December quarter reflects Seagate's strong execution and the competitiveness of our storage portfolio, particularly in cloud-based environments as average capacity per drive continues to grow rapidly. 
I'm very pleased at the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise, edge and consumer markets. 
In addition to the solid December quarter results, in January, we announced that Seagate has entered into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory. This agreement will provide continuity of NAND supply for our expanding product portfolio. We have matured our entire technology portfolio over the last several years, and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. Diversifying and expanding our competitive HDD mass storage portfolio with SSD and enterprise storage solutions will enable meaningful future revenue growth and profits over the next several years, while providing significant value for our storage customers. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."
3738520,548806701,1375322,"Seagate Technology plc, Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2018",2018-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave. For the December quarter, we achieved year-over-year revenue and profitability growth with record exabyte shipments of 87.5 exabytes and record average capacity per drive of 2.2 terabytes. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped a record 3",1359,"Thanks, Dave. For the December quarter, we achieved year-over-year revenue and profitability growth with record exabyte shipments of 87.5 exabytes and record average capacity per drive of 2.2 terabytes. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped a record 37.4 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 4.3 terabytes per drive. 
In the nearline market, we shipped 35.1 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached 5.9 terabytes per drive, up 31% over last year's strong demand and up 75% from the December quarter 2 years ago. Overall, HDD revenue was up 2% year-over-year in the December quarter. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
Our 10 TB nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the December quarter. In addition, we achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12 TB nearline product as we continue to ramp for material revenue contribution in the March quarter. As nearline capacity demand continues to grow, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4 terabytes for certain applications, and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. 
At Seagate, we believe we're well poised to help our cloud customers with our stringent and diverse requirements. Looking ahead, cloud-based enterprise market demand continues to be strong, and supply remains a bit constrained. 
In the enterprise market, the long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies continues to have significant velocity. Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. 
Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions, and we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR technology, which will open up a rich space for high capacity and great value. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in 2019, and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditures long-term model.
In the edge and consumer verticals, we had a strong year-over-year exabyte growth in almost all end markets, including PC computer, consumer, surveillance, gaming and markets. Our 1 terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform, continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2 terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing a 2-, 4- and 8-terabyte capacity points. 
In addition to positioning ourselves for growth in the silicon business, we continue to minimize our alignment with the 500 gig client consumer and mission-critical 15k hard drive markets as we believe these workloads will, over time, move to mobile silicon cloud storage. 
In the December quarter, these products represented less than 8% of our total consolidated revenue. December quarter non-HDD revenue, primarily from the cloud systems and silicon group, was $213 million, down 12% year-over-year, mostly due to the divesting of our high-performance computing assets and OEM legacy system demand. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions of our silicon product portfolio and SaaS, and the PCIe and VME and consumer and gaming markets. This value creation is above and beyond the base economics previously disclosed with our equity commitment letter for Seagate to invest up to $1.25 billion, with the consortium acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. We believe that our strategic approach to the participation in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for revenue growth opportunities in our business model without overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $444 million on a GAAP basis and $390 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 15% year-over-year. We remain on track to exit the fiscal year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $375 million per quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $77 million for the December quarter, for supporting the continued ramp of our new highest capacity HDD products and maintenance capital. For the March quarter, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million, primarily for our maintenance capital and some incremental capital to address the strong cloud market demand.
We anticipate capital expenditures to remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18.
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $850 million, and free cash flow was $773 million. These results include approximately $34 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. For the first half of the fiscal year, we have generated nearly $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations, including $80 million in cash payments against restructuring charges and nearly $900 million in free cash flow. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 285 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, which will be payable on April 4 of 2018. 
Interest expense for the December quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and levels of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the December quarter, we deployed $130 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is 1.1x as of the December quarter.
As Dave Mosley mentioned, in the December quarter, we made a onetime provision for income tax adjustment of $208 million related to the tax cuts and jobs act. Specifically, the company recorded a onetime reduction of $208 million to earnings due to the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets at the lower enacted 21% corporate tax rate, which has no cash impact. 
The deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and profits to be taxed at 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for nonliquid assets is not impactful for Seagate because our U.S. corporation has no unrepatriated earnings. The interest expense impact will be minor since Seagate does not have significant long-term debt held in the U.S. We believe that the impact that the international provision, including the global and tangible low taxed income prevention and the foreign-derived intangible income in the base erosion anti-avoidance tax will be minimal to Seagate. 
In summary, Seagate has evaluated the impact of the most significant provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act. We do not expect the tax act to materially impact Seagate's effective tax rate going forward. 
As we consider future use cases for storage growth, we invest in companies that align to our long-term thesis of exponential data growth in new verticals, some of which are outlined in the data age 2025 report with IDC. 
A few years ago, we made an investment in a company driving technology innovation for distributed ledger and block changed use cases. We believe the proliferation of these companies will create tremendous amount of data, require higher levels of data integrity and will alleviate friction and global financial operations and other important use cases that require the transfer of value with improved agility and transparency. While recent attention is on the valuation of the Exar peak crypto assets, we believe has a real and robust technology platform and defined and validated use cases for Exar P and the leading management team. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the December quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

The Seagate team is focused, for the past 2 years, on reducing our operational footprint and reshaping our cost structure to address the current demand environment. Our supply chain, from suppliers to factories to sales and fulfillment, are now entirely focused on agility and flexibility for our customers. I'm proud of the team for completing our significant restructuring plans. And while we will always have cost reduction efforts, we are well positioned to shift our focus as a company to capturing new market opportunities and achieving sustainable revenue growth and profitability. 
Turning to our market outlook. We remain conservatively optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment, as well as spending trends for cloud-based environments. On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed over the last year or so, we're continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. 
From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. 
For the March quarter, we anticipate year-over-year exabyte growth with continued strong demand in cloud storage as supply remains tight in our highest capacity solutions. For the other markets we serve, we anticipate normal sequential seasonal demand declines. As a result of the strong cloud demand and seasonality in our other markets, we expect total revenues to be down 5% to 7% sequentially from the December quarter. This represents lower sequential revenue declines than the last few years and year-over-year revenue growth for Seagate. 
We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the December quarter's gross margins and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 2% to 3%, with further cost-containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

There's a lot of capacity in the market as well, so people come move from solution to solution very quickly. I think that's going to be in our I do think that longer term, it's important that Seagate is able to add value above and beyond the drive at the system level,  if you will. And part of the reason for that is we have to do it anyway when we integrate into customers chassis and so on. I think as you see less -- as you see some of those markets stabilize a little bit, less complexity, there will be -- it will be more obvious as to what we should do and which customers ultimately we're building for. And so we've -- it's been a trend for us, I think it's going on in other places in the industry as well. Relative to how far are we through that, I can't really tell. But I do think it started 5 or more years ago, and it's not over yet. So we're going to do the smart thing we believe that long term, it's important that Seagate maintains its kind of ability to understand and add value above the drive. On the second part, I think your question was tightness in the market for enterprise drives, and it's really back to the question I think we're all asked, which is long-term visibility, does that give you better visibility? I think it does. Most of the scale players, as they sense these kind of problems, are actually talking to us quite a bit about longer-term visibility and making sure that our supply chain is properly architected to address their needs. So hopefully, that helps the demand picture, as I answer [indiscernible] to. 
With that, thanks, everyone. I really like to thank our customers, employees and suppliers and business partners for their help this last quarter, and we'll talk to you next quarter."

Beginning with our operational results for the December quarter. Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.1%; and a net income of $159 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.55, including a onetime provision for income taxes of $208 million related to tax reform. 
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.4%; net income of $431 million, up 5% year-over-year; and diluted earnings per share of $1.48, up 7% year-over-year. 
HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were a record 87.5 exabytes, up 28% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 2.2 terabytes per drive, up 29% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was $68, up 3% year-over-year. 
GAAP operating expenses were $444 million, down 15% year-over-year, and non-GAAP 
operating expenses were $390 million, also down 15% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $850 million, up 30% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $773 million, up 38% year-over-year. 
Achieving revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the December quarter reflects Seagate's strong execution and the competitiveness of our storage portfolio, particularly in cloud-based environments as average capacity per drive continues to grow rapidly. I'm very pleased at the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise, edge and consumer markets. 
In addition to the solid December quarter results, in January, we announced that Seagate has entered into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory. This agreement will provide continuity of NAND supply for our expanding product portfolio. We have matured our entire technology portfolio over the last several years. And today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. Diversifying and expanding our competitive HDD mass storage portfolio with SSD and enterprise storage solutions will enable meaningful future revenue growth and profits over the next several years while providing significant value for our storage customers. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the December quarter, we achieved year-over-year revenue and profitability growth, with record exabyte shipments of 87.5 exabytes and record average capacity per drive of 2.2 terabytes. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped a record 37.4 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 4.3 terabytes per drive. In the nearline market, we shipped 35.1 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached 5.9 terabytes per drive, up 31% over last year's strong demand and up 75% from the December quarter 2 years ago. Overall, HDD revenue was up 2% year-over-year in the December quarter. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
Our 10 TB nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the December quarter. In addition, we achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12 TB nearline product as we continue to ramp for material revenue contribution in the March quarter. As nearline capacity demand continues to grow, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4 terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. 
At Seagate, we believe we're well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and diverse requirements. Looking ahead, cloud-based enterprise market demand continues to be strong, and supply remains bit constrained. 
In the enterprise market, the long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies continues to have significant velocity. Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. 
Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions. And we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording or HAMR technology, which will open up a rich space for high capacity and great value. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in 2019, and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditures long-term model.
In the edge and consumer verticals, we had a strong year-over-year exabyte growth in almost all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming and NAS markets. Our 1 terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform, continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2 terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing a 2-, 4- and 8-terabyte capacity points. 
In addition to positioning ourselves for growth in the silicon business, we continue to minimize our alignment with the 500 GB client consumer and mission-critical 15K hard drive markets as we believe these workloads will, over time, move to mobile silicon cloud storage. In the December quarter, these products represented less than 8% of our total consolidated revenue. 
December quarter non-HDD revenue, primarily from the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, was $213 million, down 12% year-over-year, mostly due to the divesting of our high-performance computing assets and OEM legacy system demand. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions of our silicon product portfolio in the SaaS, SSD and the PCIe, NVMe and consumer and gaming markets. This value creation is above and beyond the base economics previously disclosed with our equity commitment letter for Seagate to invest up to $1.25 billion with the Bain-led consortium acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. We believe that our strategic approach to the participation in the silicon market allows us to address customers' storage portfolio needs and provide for revenue growth opportunities in our business model without overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $444 million on a GAAP basis and $390 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 15% year-over-year. We remain on track to exit the fiscal year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $375 million per quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $77 million for the December quarter, for supporting the continued ramp of our new highest-capacity HDD products and maintenance capital. For the March quarter, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million, primarily for maintenance capital and some incremental capital to address the strong cloud market demand. We anticipate capital expenditures to remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18. 
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $850 million, and free cash flow was $773 million. These results include approximately $34 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. For the first half of the fiscal year, we have generated nearly $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations, including $80 million in cash payments against restructuring charges and nearly $900 million in free cash flow. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 285 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, which will be payable on April 4, 2018. 
Interest expense for the December quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and levels of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the December quarter, we deployed $130 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is 1.1x as of the December quarter.
As Dave Mosley mentioned, in the December quarter, we made a onetime provision for income tax adjustment of $208 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Specifically, the company recorded a onetime reduction of $208 million to earnings due to the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets at the lower enacted 21% corporate tax rate, which has no cash impact. 
The deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and profits to be taxed at 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for nonliquid assets is not impactful for Seagate because our U.S. corporation has no unrepatriated earnings. The interest expense disallowance impact will be minor since Seagate does not have significant long-term debt held in the U.S. We believe that the impact that the international provisions, including the global intangible low-taxed income provision and the foreign-derived intangible income and the base erosion anti-avoidance tax, will be minimal to Seagate. 
In summary, Seagate has evaluated the impact of the most significant provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We do not expect the tax act to materially impact Seagate's effective tax rate going forward. 
As we consider future use cases for storage growth, we invest in companies that align to our long-term thesis of exponential data growth in new verticals, some of which are outlined in the Data Age 2025 report with IDC. 
A few years ago, we made an investment in Ripple, a company driving technology innovation for distributed ledger and blockchain use cases. We believe the proliferation of these companies will create tremendous amounts of data, require high levels of data integrity and will alleviate friction in global financial operations and other important use cases that require the transfer value with improved agility and transparency. While recent attention is on the valuation of the XRP crypto assets, we believe Ripple has a real and robust blockchain technology platform, a defined and validated use case for XRP and a leading management team. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the December quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

The Seagate team is focused for the past 2 years on reducing our operational footprint and reshaping our cost structure to address the current demand environment. Our supply chain, from suppliers to factories to sales and fulfillment, are now entirely focused on agility and flexibility for our customers. I'm proud of the team for completing our significant restructuring plans. And while we will always have cost reduction efforts, we are well positioned to shift our focus as a company to capturing new market opportunities and achieving sustainable revenue growth and profitability. 
Turning to our market outlook. We remain conservatively optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as spending trends for cloud-based environments. On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed over the last year or so, we're continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are in general lower than last year. 
For the March quarter, we anticipate year-over-year exabyte growth with continued strong demand in cloud storage as supply remains tight in our highest-capacity solutions. For the other markets we serve, we anticipate normal sequential seasonal demand declines. As a result of the strong cloud demand and seasonality in our other markets, we expect total revenues to be down 5% to 7% sequentially from the December quarter. This represents lower sequential revenue declines than the last few years and year-over-year revenue growth for Seagate. 
We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the December quarter's gross margins and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 2% to 3%, with further cost containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results.

On the first point, gosh, if we start by looking at all the different customers we serve, there are some markets where we were competing with people who didn't necessarily control the core componentry like we do, but they build really cheap. And there's a lot of disruption going on in the market. I don't need to tell you guys that. There's a lot of complexity in the market as well, so people can move from solution to solution very quickly. I don't think that's going to be in our bailiwick. I do think that longer term, it's important that Seagate is able to add value above and beyond the drive at the system level, if you will. And part of the reason for that is we have to do it anyway when we integrate into customers' chassis and so on. I think as you see less -- or as you see some of those markets stabilize a little bit, less complexity, there'll be -- it'll be more obvious as to what we should do and which customers ultimately we're building for. And so we've -- it's been a churn for us. I think it's going on in other places in the industry as well. Relative to how far are we through that, I can't really tell. But I do think it started 5 or more years ago, and it's not over yet. So we're going to do the smart thing. We believe that long term, it's important that Seagate maintains this kind of ability to understand and add value above the drive. On the second part, I think your question was tightness in the market for enterprise drives. And it's really back to the question I think Rob asked, which was long-term visibility, does that give you better visibility? I think it does. Most of the scale players, as they sense these kind of problems, are actually talking to us quite a bit about longer-term visibility and making sure that our supply chain is properly architected to address their needs. So hopefully, that helps the demand picture as I answered Rob, too. 
With that, thanks, everyone. I'd really like to thank our customers, employees and suppliers and business partners for their help this last quarter. And we'll talk to you next quarter."

Beginning with our operational results for the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.1%; and a net income of $159 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.55, including a onetime provision for income taxes of $208 million related to tax reform. 
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.4%; net income of $431 million, up 5% year-over-year; and diluted earnings per share of $1.48, up 7% year-over-year. 
HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were a record 87.5 exabytes, up 28% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 2.2 terabytes per drive, up 29% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was $68, up 3% year-over-year. 
GAAP operating expenses were $444 million, down 15% year-over-year, and non-GAAP 
operating expenses were $390 million, also down 15% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $850 million, up 30% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $773 million, up 38% year-over-year. 
Achieving revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the December quarter reflects Seagate's strong execution and the competitiveness of our storage portfolio, particularly in cloud-based environments as average capacity per drive continues to grow rapidly. I'm very pleased at the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise, edge and consumer markets. 
In addition to the solid December quarter results, in January, we announced that Seagate has entered into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory. This agreement will provide continuity of NAND supply for our expanding product portfolio. We have matured our entire technology portfolio over the last several years and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. Diversifying and expanding our competitive HDD mass storage portfolio with SSD and enterprise storage solutions will enable meaningful future revenue growth and profits over the next several years while providing significant value for our storage customers. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the December quarter, we achieved year-over-year revenue and profitability growth, with record exabyte shipments of 87.5 exabytes and record average capacity per drive of 2.2 terabytes. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped a record 37.4 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 4.3 terabytes per drive. In the nearline market, we shipped 35.1 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached 5.9 terabytes per drive, up 31% over last year's strong demand and up 75% from the December quarter 2 years ago. Overall, HDD revenue was up 2% year-over-year in the December quarter. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
Our 10 TB nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the December quarter. In addition, we achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12 TB nearline product as we continue to ramp for material revenue contribution in the March quarter. As nearline capacity demand continues to grow, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4 terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. 
At Seagate, we believe we're well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and diverse requirements. Looking ahead, cloud-based enterprise market demand continues to be strong, and supply remains bit constrained. 
In the enterprise market, the long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies continues to have significant velocity. Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. 
Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions. And we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording or HAMR technology, which will open up a rich space for high capacity and great value. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in 2019, and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditures long-term model.
In the edge and consumer verticals, we had a strong year-over-year exabyte growth in almost all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming and NAS markets. Our 1 terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform, continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2 terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing a 2-, 4- and 8-terabyte capacity points. 
In addition to positioning ourselves for growth in the silicon business, we continue to minimize our alignment with the 500 GB client consumer and mission-critical 15K hard drive markets as we believe these workloads will, over time, move to mobile silicon cloud storage. In the December quarter, these products represented less than 8% of our total consolidated revenue. 
December quarter non-HDD revenue, primarily from the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, was $213 million, down 12% year-over-year, mostly due to the divesting of our high-performance computing assets and OEM legacy system demand. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions of our silicon product portfolio in the SaaS, SSD and the PCIe, NVMe and consumer and gaming markets. This value creation is above and beyond the base economics previously disclosed with our equity commitment letter for Seagate to invest up to $1.25 billion with the Bain-led consortium acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. We believe that our strategic approach to the participation in the silicon market allows us to address customers' storage portfolio needs and provide for revenue growth opportunities in our business model without overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $444 million on a GAAP basis and $390 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 15% year-over-year. We remain on track to exit the fiscal year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $375 million per quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $77 million for the December quarter, for supporting the continued ramp of our new highest-capacity HDD products and maintenance capital. For the March quarter, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million, primarily for maintenance capital and some incremental capital to address the strong cloud market demand. We anticipate capital expenditures to remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18. 
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $850 million, and free cash flow was $773 million. These results include approximately $34 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. For the first half of the fiscal year, we have generated nearly $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations, including $80 million in cash payments against restructuring charges and nearly $900 million in free cash flow. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 285 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, which will be payable on April 4, 2018. 
Interest expense for the December quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and levels of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the December quarter, we deployed $130 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is 1.1x as of the December quarter.
As Dave Mosley mentioned, in the December quarter, we made a onetime provision for income tax adjustment of $208 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Specifically, the company recorded a onetime reduction of $208 million to earnings due to the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets at the lower enacted 21% corporate tax rate, which has no cash impact. 
The deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and profits to be taxed at 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for nonliquid assets is not impactful for Seagate because our U.S. corporation has no unrepatriated earnings. The interest expense disallowance impact will be minor since Seagate does not have significant long-term debt held in the U.S. We believe that the impact that the international provisions, including the global intangible low-taxed income provision and the foreign-derived intangible income and the base erosion anti-avoidance tax, will be minimal to Seagate. 
In summary, Seagate has evaluated the impact of the most significant provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We do not expect the tax act to materially impact Seagate's effective tax rate going forward. 
As we consider future use cases for storage growth, we invest in companies that align to our long-term thesis of exponential data growth in new verticals, some of which are outlined in the Data Age 2025 report with IDC. 
A few years ago, we made an investment in Ripple, a company driving technology innovation for distributed ledger and blockchain use cases. We believe the proliferation of these companies will create tremendous amounts of data, require high levels of data integrity and will alleviate friction in global financial operations and other important use cases that require the transfer of value with improved agility and transparency. While recent attention is on the valuation of the XRP crypto assets, we believe Ripple has a real and robust blockchain technology platform, a defined and validated use case for XRP and a leading management team. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the December quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

The Seagate team is focused for the past 2 years on reducing our operational footprint and reshaping our cost structure to address the current demand environment. Our supply chain, from suppliers to factories to sales and fulfillment, are now entirely focused on agility and flexibility for our customers. I'm proud of the team for completing our significant restructuring plans. And while we will always have cost reduction efforts, we are well positioned to shift our focus as a company to capturing new market opportunities and achieving sustainable revenue growth and profitability. 
Turning to our market outlook. We remain conservatively optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as spending trends for cloud-based environments. On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed over the last year or so, we're continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. 
For the March quarter, we anticipate year-over-year exabyte growth with continued strong demand in cloud storage as supply remains tight in our highest-capacity solutions. For the other markets we serve, we anticipate normal sequential seasonal demand declines. As a result of the strong cloud demand and seasonality in our other markets, we expect total revenues to be down 5% to 7% sequentially from the December quarter. This represents lower sequential revenue declines than the last few years and year-over-year revenue growth for Seagate. 
We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the December quarter's gross margins and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 2% to 3%, with further cost containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

And so we've -- it's been a churn for us. I think it's going on in other places in the industry as well. Relative to how far are we through that, I can't really tell. But I do think it started 5 or more years ago, and it's not over yet. So we're going to do the smart thing. We believe that long term, it's important that Seagate maintains this kind of ability to understand and add value above the drive. On the second part, I think your question was tightness in the market for enterprise drives. And it's really back to the question I think Rob asked, which was long-term visibility, does that give you better visibility? I think it does. Most of the scale players, as they sense these kind of problems, are actually talking to us quite a bit about longer-term visibility and making sure that our supply chain is properly architected to address their needs. So hopefully, that helps the demand picture as I answered Rob, too. 
With that, thanks, everyone. I'd really like to thank our customers, employees and suppliers and business partners for their help this last quarter. And we'll talk to you next quarter."

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level trends we're seeing in the business. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the March quarter. 
Beginning with our operational results for the December quarter, Seagate achieved revenues of $2.9 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.1%; and a net income of $159 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.55, including a onetime provision for income taxes of $208 million related to tax reform. 
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.4%; net income of $431 million, up 5% year-over-year; and diluted earnings per share of $1.48, up 7% year-over-year. 
HDD exabyte shipments for the December quarter were a record 87.5 exabytes, up 28% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was also a record 2.2 terabytes per drive, up 29% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was $68, up 3% year-over-year. 
GAAP operating expenses were $444 million, down 15% year-over-year, and non-GAAP 
operating expenses were $390 million, also down 15% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $850 million, up 30% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $773 million, up 38% year-over-year. 
Achieving revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the December quarter reflects Seagate's strong execution and the competitiveness of our storage portfolio, particularly in cloud-based environments as average capacity per drive continues to grow rapidly. I'm very pleased at the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise, edge and consumer markets. 
In addition to the solid December quarter results, in January, we announced that Seagate has entered into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory. This agreement will provide continuity of NAND supply for our expanding product portfolio. We have matured our entire technology portfolio over the last several years and today, we have a broad offering of flash-based products that are ready to scale and grow across multiple markets. Diversifying and expanding our competitive HDD mass storage portfolio with SSD and enterprise storage solutions will enable meaningful future revenue growth and profits over the next several years while providing significant value for our storage customers. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the future. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the December quarter, we achieved year-over-year revenue and profitability growth, with record exabyte shipments of 87.5 exabytes and record average capacity per drive of 2.2 terabytes. For the enterprise HDD market, we shipped a record 37.4 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 4.3 terabytes per drive. In the nearline market, we shipped 35.1 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached 5.9 terabytes per drive, up 31% over last year's strong demand and up 75% from the December quarter 2 years ago. Overall, HDD revenue was up 2% year-over-year in the December quarter. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline HDD portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
Our 10 TB nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the December quarter. In addition, we achieved sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12 TB nearline product as we continue to ramp for material revenue contribution in the March quarter. As nearline capacity demand continues to grow, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Use cases will cause capacity points to span from 2 to 4 terabytes for certain applications and up to 16 terabytes for other customer needs. 
At Seagate, we believe we're well poised to help our cloud customers with their stringent and diverse requirements. Looking ahead, cloud-based enterprise market demand continues to be strong, and supply remains bit constrained. 
In the enterprise market, the long-term trajectory of growth and infrastructure spending in the large cloud service providers and hyperscale companies continues to have significant velocity. Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. 
Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products. Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our SMR and TDMR areal density solutions. And we continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording or HAMR technology, which will open up a rich space for high capacity and great value. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in 2019, and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditures long-term model.
In the edge and consumer verticals, we had a strong year-over-year exabyte growth in almost all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming and NAS markets. Our 1 terabyte per platter, 2.5-inch platform, continues to perform well. Using our areal density advantage, our 2 terabyte per platter, 3.5-inch platform continues to ramp for desktop markets, providing a great value for customers needing a 2-, 4- and 8-terabyte capacity points. 
In addition to positioning ourselves for growth in the silicon business, we continue to minimize our alignment with the 500 GB client consumer and mission-critical 15K hard drive markets as we believe these workloads will, over time, move to mobile silicon cloud storage. In the December quarter, these products represented less than 8% of our total consolidated revenue. 
December quarter non-HDD revenue, primarily from the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, was $213 million, down 12% year-over-year, mostly due to the divesting of our high-performance computing assets and OEM legacy system demand. 
Looking ahead, we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions of our silicon product portfolio in the SaaS, SSD and the PCIe, NVMe and consumer and gaming markets. This value creation is above and beyond the base economics previously disclosed with our equity commitment letter for Seagate to invest up to $1.25 billion with the Bain-led consortium acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. We believe that our strategic approach to the participation in the silicon market allows us to address customers' storage portfolio needs and provide for revenue growth opportunities in our business model without overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.
Operating expenses for the December quarter were $444 million on a GAAP basis and $390 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 15% year-over-year. We remain on track to exit the fiscal year with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $375 million per quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $77 million for the December quarter, for supporting the continued ramp of our new highest-capacity HDD products and maintenance capital. For the March quarter, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million, primarily for maintenance capital and some incremental capital to address the strong cloud market demand. We anticipate capital expenditures to remain less than 5% of our total consolidated revenue for FY '18. 
Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was $850 million, and free cash flow was $773 million. These results include approximately $34 million in cash payments related to previously announced restructuring charges. For the first half of the fiscal year, we have generated nearly $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations, including $80 million in cash payments against restructuring charges and nearly $900 million in free cash flow. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the December quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 285 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the December quarter, which will be payable on April 4, 2018. 
Interest expense for the December quarter was $61 million. Our debt structure and levels of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. In the December quarter, we deployed $130 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is 1.1x as of the December quarter.
As Dave Mosley mentioned, in the December quarter, we made a onetime provision for income tax adjustment of $208 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Specifically, the company recorded a onetime reduction of $208 million to earnings due to the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets at the lower enacted 21% corporate tax rate, which has no cash impact. 
The deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and profits to be taxed at 15.5% for liquid assets and 8% for nonliquid assets is not impactful for Seagate because our U.S. corporation has no unrepatriated earnings. The interest expense disallowance impact will be minor since Seagate does not have significant long-term debt held in the U.S. We believe that the impact that the international provisions, including the global intangible low-taxed income provision and the foreign-derived intangible income and the base erosion anti-avoidance tax, will be minimal to Seagate. 
In summary, Seagate has evaluated the impact of the most significant provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We do not expect the tax act to materially impact Seagate's effective tax rate going forward. 
As we consider future use cases for storage growth, we invest in companies that align to our long-term thesis of exponential data growth in new verticals, some of which are outlined in the Data Age 2025 report with IDC. 
A few years ago, we made an investment in Ripple, a company driving technology innovation for distributed ledger and blockchain use cases. We believe the proliferation of these companies will create tremendous amounts of data, require high levels of data integrity and will alleviate friction in global financial operations and other important use cases that require the transfer of value with improved agility and transparency. While recent attention is on the valuation of the XRP crypto assets, we believe Ripple has a real and robust blockchain technology platform, a defined and validated use case for XRP and a leading management team. 
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the December quarter reflects execution of our business model and profitability improvement objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our business and focus on aligning our go-to-market and product portfolio advancements towards the future growth opportunity markets. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

The Seagate team is focused for the past 2 years on reducing our operational footprint and reshaping our cost structure to address the current demand environment. Our supply chain, from suppliers to factories to sales and fulfillment, are now entirely focused on agility and flexibility for our customers. I'm proud of the team for completing our significant restructuring plans. And while we will always have cost reduction efforts, we are well positioned to shift our focus as a company to capturing new market opportunities and achieving sustainable revenue growth and profitability. 
Turning to our market outlook. We remain conservatively optimistic about the current macroeconomic environment as well as spending trends for cloud-based environments. On the heels of the various IT component supply constraints we witnessed over the last year or so, we're continuing to monitor outgoing inventory closely. From Seagate's vantage point, our channel inventory positions and inventory for our customers that are visible to us are, in general, lower than last year. 
For the March quarter, we anticipate year-over-year exabyte growth with continued strong demand in cloud storage as supply remains tight in our highest-capacity solutions. For the other markets we serve, we anticipate normal sequential seasonal demand declines. As a result of the strong cloud demand and seasonality in our other markets, we expect total revenues to be down 5% to 7% sequentially from the December quarter. This represents lower sequential revenue declines than the last few years and year-over-year revenue growth for Seagate. 
We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the December quarter's gross margins and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 2% to 3%, with further cost containment measures as we continue to manage our operating expenses tightly, targeting approximately $375 million per quarter by the end of fiscal '18. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners for their contributions to our quarter's results. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

On the first point, gosh, if we start by looking at all the different customers we serve, there are some markets where we were competing with people who didn't necessarily control the core componentry like we do, but they build really cheap. And there's a lot of disruption going on in the market. I don't need to tell you guys that. There's a lot of complexity in the market as well, so people can move from solution to solution very quickly. I don't think that's going to be in our bailiwick. I do think that longer term, it's important that Seagate is able to add value above and beyond the drive at the system level, if you will. And part of the reason for that is we have to do it anyway when we integrate into customers' chassis and so on. I think as you see less -- or as you see some of those markets stabilize a little bit, less complexity, there'll be -- it'll be more obvious as to what we should do and which customers ultimately we're building for. And so we've -- it's been a churn for us. I think it's going on in other places in the industry as well. Relative to how far are we through that, I can't really tell. But I do think it started 5 or more years ago, and it's not over yet. So we're going to do the smart thing. We believe that long term, it's important that Seagate maintains this kind of ability to understand and add value above the drive. On the second part, I think your question was tightness in the market for enterprise drives. And it's really back to the question I think Rob asked, which was long-term visibility, does that give you better visibility? I think it does. Most of the scale players, as they sense these kind of problems, are actually talking to us quite a bit about longer-term visibility and making sure that our supply chain is properly architected to address their needs. So hopefully, that helps the demand picture as I answered Rob, too. 
With that, thanks, everyone. I'd really like to thank our customers, employees and suppliers and business partners for their help this last quarter. And we'll talk to you next quarter."

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the March quarter. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the June quarter.
I'm pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the March quarter reflect the year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.2%; and a net income of $381 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.31. 
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.8%; net income of $424 million, up 29% year-over-year; and the diluted earnings per share of $1.46, up 33% year-over-year.
HDD exabyte shipments for the March quarter were 87.4 exabytes, up 34% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.4 terabytes per drive, up 32% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was $70.50, up 6% year-over-year.
GAAP operating expenses were $406 million, down 26% year-over-year; and non-GAAP operating expenses were $385 million, down 13% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $558 million, up 31% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $489 million, up 48% year-over-year.
Fiscal year-to-date, we have achieved cash flow from operations of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. Achieving year-over-year revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the March quarter reflects Seagate's strong business model execution. I am pleased with the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise and edge markets and with the competitiveness of our entire HDD portfolio that aligns with trending data growth opportunities. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the March quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments.

For the March quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand and exceeded our expectations.
In the March quarter, total revenues were up 5% year-over-year and hard disk drive revenues were up 7% year-over-year. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 43.8 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 4.8 terabytes per drive. In the nearline market, we shipped 41.3 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached 6.5 terabytes per drive, up 41% over last year and up 64% from the March quarter 2 years ago.
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent, and supply remains bit constrained. Our 10-terabyte nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the March quarter. In addition, we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product as we ramp for material revenue contribution. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the March quarter for nearly all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, gaming and network-attached storage.
The March quarter non-hard disk drive revenues, primarily from the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, were $217 million, up 2% sequentially. Year-over-year, the non-hard disk drive revenues were down 13%, primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud systems, products and the divestiture of high-performance computing assets.
Silicon revenues were up a few percentage points year-over-year, and we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with the Toshiba Memory Corporation as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in the SaaS, SSD, PCIe and VME, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions.
We believe that our strategic approach to participate in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth opportunities in our business model without the overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage where we have -- or are developing portfolio offerings. In the March quarter, these products represented less than 8% of consolidated revenue.
Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership with generations of storage technologies and products.
Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our perpendicular, shingled and two-dimensional magnetic recording areal density solutions. These recording technologies continue to provide measurable total cost of ownership advantages for the mass storage market over other memory-based technologies, particularly for cloud-based environments. 
We continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording technology. This next-generation recording platform will open up a rich design space for high-capacity nearline drives that will push capacity points up 24 terabytes per drive and beyond and offer great economic value for our customers. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in volume in 2019, and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model. 
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $406 million, on a GAAP basis, and $385 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 13% year-over-year. Capital expenditures were approximately $69 million in the March quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest highest capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures to remain below 5% of total consolidated revenue.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $558 million, and free cash flow was $489 million. Year-to-date, we have generated over $1.6 billion in cash flow from operations and nearly $1.4 billion in free cash flow.
Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was 5 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment, coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. Over the last 2 years, we have made many changes to optimize our operational footprint and supply chain management. Product complexity is a significant challenge in the storage marketplace right now, and we believe our agility and manufacturing responsiveness within the component supply chain provides a significant competitive advantage for Seagate. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5, 2018.
Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
In the March quarter, we deployed $57 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt-to-last 12 months EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is under 1x as of the March quarter.
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. We work with technology customers, vendors and suppliers throughout the world. In the area of tax and trade, the U.S. and China have recently announced potential trade actions that could increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S. Given the fluid nature of the issue, it is too speculative to determine any impact or changes for Seagate's operations. However, we continue to monitor the situation.
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the March quarter reflects solid earnings power and financial leverage within our business model. Looking ahead, we will continue to align our go-to-market operations and product portfolio advancements for growth in the existing mass storage markets. 
Over the long term, we believe there will be additional growth opportunities with new markets and customers that will leverage our cost efficient and reliable storage technologies. I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

We remain optimistic about Seagate's earnings power as current macroeconomic conditions and global investments in cloud-based environments persist. Specific to the nearline products, we share the perspective that we are in the early stages of a broad-based global cloud storage transformation. 
For the June quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth with continued strong enterprise demand and tight supply for our highest capacity solutions. 
Within the other markets we serve, we anticipate sequential seasonal unit demand declines, as we would typically see in the June quarter. It is important to note, however, that exabyte demand is growing year-over-year in nearly all markets.
As a result of these exabyte demand trends, we expect total revenues to be approximately flat sequentially from the March quarter, reflecting quarterly year-over-year revenue growth of roughly 17%, and total revenue growth of approximately 4% for fiscal 2018.
We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the March quarter and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Cash flow from operations for the June quarter should be at least $500 million, and we are on track to achieve over $2 billion in cash flow from operations for fiscal 2018.
Based upon our trajectory for our overachievement of our fiscal year 2018 plan, we anticipate an increase in variable compensation for employees for annual performance in the June quarter. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly, and we anticipate overall non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 1% to 2%.
Looking further ahead, feedback from our largest enterprise customers in all regions indicate strong capacity demand will continue throughout the calendar year. In addition, we anticipate seasonal strength in our other markets, with particularly strong exabyte growth in edge markets in the second half. 
Diverse markets that are exhibiting strong data storage requirements translate to continued favorable growth and profitability opportunities for Seagate. We believe that these long-term trends will continue with existing customers and that new customers and business vertical opportunities are also on the horizon.
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to the March quarter's results.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions-and-answers."

So if you remember the history of the nearline markets in the last 5 years, there's been periods where we have misinterpreted it as seasonality, but there were periods of feast and famine, if you will. The market, generally, the exabytes were increasing at about a 35% CAGR. But there were some markets where -- sometimes where the market was much faster than that, and other times they were slow down. We're starting to see that abate and the demand be a lot more predictable, longer lead time visibility, and some of that is because of the build out of major cloud installations pulling really hard on high-capacity drives is not as feast or famine anymore. I think behind that, and this is something that is still developing a little bit, are the more legacy technologies for on prem or smaller data centers where the capacity points aren't necessarily the highest capacity points, but, so to say, 8 terabytes and below, but the demand is quite strong and quite diverse geographically. So from my perspective, that strength is actually picked up middle of last year and feels strong through the back half of this calendar year as well. Looking out into calendar year '19, I think maybe a little bit premature. We'll see the size of the back half of this year first. But it's certainly feeling like the install patterns that most of the cloud service providers and some of these big on prem companies are in the middle of -- are still very healthy. And so I wouldn't be surprised at all if it does extend for another year."

We were down total volume build-wise, and this is probably the only time I'll talk of absolute units, but build wise, total volumes were down about 4% to 5%. And so you think about absorption loss from that, that added some headwinds. If you got from a year-over-year basis, though, however, absolute gross margin dollars were up approximately $50 million, and so that's where you're really starting to see the expansion due to the changes from your client/server, more so to the cloud and with the build out of these workloads in these streams. I'll also remind you that our 12 TB is still ramping aggressively into material contribution serves as a ransom started off the segment as well. So all in all, great quarter by the team, specifically in operations.

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the March quarter. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the June quarter.
I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the March quarter reflect year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.2%; and a net income of $381 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.31. 
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.8%; net income of $424 million, up 29% year-over-year; and the diluted earnings per share of $1.46, up 33% year-over-year.
HDD exabyte shipments for the March quarter were 87.4 exabytes, up 34% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.4 terabytes per drive, up 32% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was $70.50, up 6% year-over-year.
GAAP operating expenses were $406 million, down 26% year-over-year; and non-GAAP operating expenses were $385 million, down 13% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $558 million, up 31% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $489 million, up 48% year-over-year.
Fiscal year-to-date, we have achieved cash flow from operations of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. Achieving year-over-year revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the March quarter reflects Seagate's strong business model execution. I am pleased with the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise and edge markets and with the competitiveness of our entire HDD portfolio that aligns with trending data growth opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the March quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments.

For the March quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand and exceeded our expectations.
In the March quarter, total revenues were up 5% year-over-year and hard disk drive revenues were up 7% year-over-year. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 43.8 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 4.8 terabytes per drive. In the nearline market, we shipped 41.3 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached 6.5 terabytes per drive, up 41% over last year and up 64% from the March quarter 2 years ago.
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent, and supply remains a bit constrained. Our 10-terabyte nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the March quarter. In addition, we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product as we ramp for material revenue contribution. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads.
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the March quarter for nearly all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, gaming and network-attached storage.
The March quarter non-hard disk drive revenues, primarily from the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, were $217 million, up 2% sequentially. 
Year-over-year, the non-hard disk drive revenues were down 13%, primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud systems, products and the divestiture of high-performance computing assets.
Silicon revenues were up a few percentage points year-over-year, and we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with the Toshiba Memory Corporation as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in the SaaS, SSD, PCIe, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions.
We believe that our strategic approach to participate in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth opportunities in our business model without the overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. In the March quarter, these products represented less than 8% of consolidated revenue.
Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership, with generations of storage technologies and products.
Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our perpendicular, shingled and 2-dimensional magnetic recording areal density solutions. These recording technologies continue to provide measurable total cost of ownership advantages for the mass storage market over other memory-based technologies, particularly for cloud-based environments.
We continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording technology. This next-generation recording platform will open up a rich design space for high-capacity nearline drives that will push capacity points up 24 terabytes per drive and beyond and offer great economic value for our customers. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in volume in 2019, and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model. 
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $406 million on a GAAP basis, and $385 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 13% year-over-year. Capital expenditures were approximately $69 million in the March quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest highest capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures to remain below 5% of total consolidated revenue.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $558 million, and free cash flow was $489 million. Year-to-date, we have generated over $1.6 billion in cash flow from operations and nearly $1.4 billion in free cash flow.
Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was 5 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment, coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. Over the last 2 years, we have made many changes to optimize our operational footprint and supply chain management. Product complexity is a significant challenge in the storage marketplace right now, and we believe our agility and manufacturing responsiveness within the component supply chain provides a significant competitive advantage for Seagate. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5, 2018.
Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
In the March quarter, we deployed $57 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt-to-last 12 months EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is under 1x as of the March quarter.
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. We work with technology customers, vendors and suppliers throughout the world. In the area of tax and trade, the U.S. and China have recently announced potential trade actions that could increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S. Given the fluid nature of the issue, it is too speculative to determine any impact or changes for Seagate's operations. However, we continue to monitor the situation.
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the March quarter reflects solid earnings power and financial leverage within our business model. Looking ahead, we will continue to align our go-to-market operations and product portfolio advancements for growth in the existing mass storage markets. 
Over the long term, we believe there will be additional growth opportunities, with new markets and customers that will leverage our cost-efficient and reliable storage technologies. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

We remain optimistic about Seagate's earnings power as current macroeconomic conditions and global investments in cloud-based environments persist. Specific to the nearline products, we share the perspective that we are in the early stages of a broad-based global cloud storage transformation. 
For the June quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth, with continued strong enterprise demand and tight supply for our highest capacity solutions.  Within the other markets we serve, we anticipate sequential seasonal unit demand declines as we would typically see in the June quarter. It is important to note, however, that exabyte demand is growing year-over-year in nearly all markets.
As a result of these exabyte demand trends, we expect total revenues to be approximately flat sequentially from the March quarter, reflecting quarterly year-over-year revenue growth of roughly 17%, and total revenue growth of approximately 4% for fiscal 2018.
We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the March quarter and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Cash flow from operations for the June quarter should be at least $500 million, and we are on track to achieve over $2 billion in cash flow from operations for fiscal 2018.
Based upon our trajectory for our overachievement of our fiscal year 2018 plan, we anticipate an increase in variable compensation for employees for annual performance in the June quarter. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly, and we anticipate overall non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 1% to 2%.
Looking further ahead, feedback from our largest enterprise customers in all regions indicate strong capacity demand will continue throughout the calendar year. In addition, we anticipate seasonal strength in our other markets, with particularly strong exabyte growth in edge markets in the second half. 
Diverse markets that are exhibiting strong data storage requirements translate to continued favorable growth and profitability opportunities for Seagate. We believe these long-term trends will continue with existing customers and that new customers and business vertical opportunities are also on the horizon.
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to the March quarter's results.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

So if you remember the history of the nearline markets in the last 5 years, there's been periods where we had misinterpreted it as seasonality, but there were periods of feast and famine, if you will. The market, generally, the exabytes were increasing at about a 35% CAGR. But there were some markets where -- sometimes, where the market was much faster than that, and other times they it slowed down. We're starting to see that abate and the demand be a lot more predictable, longer lead time visibility, and some of that is because of the build out of major cloud installations pulling really hard on high-capacity drives is not as feast or famine anymore. I think behind that, and this is something that is still developing a little bit, are the more legacy technologies for on-prem or smaller data centers where the capacity points aren't necessarily the highest capacity points, but, so to say, 8 terabytes and below, but the demand is quite strong and quite diverse geographically. So from my perspective, that strength is -- actually picked up middle of last year and feels strong through the back half of this calendar year as well. Looking out into calendar year '19, I think it may be a little bit premature. We'll see the size of the back half of this year first. But it's certainly feeling like the install patterns that most of the cloud service providers and some of these big on-prem companies are in the middle of are still very healthy, And so I wouldn't be surprised at all if it does extend for another year."

We were down total volume build-wise, and this is probably the only time I'll talk absolute units, but build-wise, total volumes were down about 4% to 5%. And so if you think about absorption loss from that, that added some headwinds. If you look at it from a year-over-year basis, though, however, absolute gross margin dollars were up approximately $50 million, and so that's where you're really starting to see the expansion due to the changes from your client/server, more so to the mobility cloud and with the buildout of these workloads in these streams. I'll also remind you that our 12 TB is still ramping aggressively into material volume contributions, and so we have some startup costs associated with that as well. So all in all, great quarter by the team, specifically in operations. In regards to some of our non-hard disk drive contributors to our top line revenue, we did see some small incremental margin accretion there. However, we still have some further optimization to go. We spoke about the Toshiba Memory Corporation alignment coming on line that will provide us some margin opportunities in the back half of this year.

During today's call, we will review the highlights for the March quarter, provide the company's outlook for the June quarter and then open the call for questions. We're planning for the call today to go approximately 0.5 hour, and we will do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits. 
For the June quarter, we would like to note that our quiet period will begin on June 25. 
On our call today, we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures on our supplemental information available on the Investors section of our website. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. 
As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance; customer market demand in the current macroeconomic condition; industry growth and trends; our technology and product development advancements and our ability to achieve volume shipment for new product development in 2019; demand for our products; continuity of access to long-term NAND supply; consummation of the Bain Capital Private Equity transaction; our ability to execute our road map and address supply constraints while maintaining an agile manufacturing footprint; potential impact of trade barriers, such as import/export duties and restrictions, tariffs and quotas; and general market conditions. 
These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investors section of the company website.

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the March quarter. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the June quarter.
I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the March quarter reflect year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.2%; and a net income of $381 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.31. 
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.8%; net income of $424 million, up 29% year-over-year; and a diluted earnings per share of $1.46, up 33% year-over-year.
HDD exabyte shipments for the March quarter were 87.4 exabytes, up 34% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.4 terabytes per drive, up 32% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was $70.50, up 6% year-over-year.
GAAP operating expenses were $406 million, down 26% year-over-year; and non-GAAP operating expenses were $385 million, down 13% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $558 million, up 31% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $489 million, up 48% year-over-year.
Fiscal year-to-date, we have achieved cash flow from operations of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. Achieving year-over-year revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the March quarter reflects Seagate's strong business model execution. I am pleased with the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise and edge markets and with the competitiveness of our entire HDD portfolio that aligns with trending data growth opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the March quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand and exceeded our expectations.In the March quarter, t",1090,"Thanks, Dave. For the March quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand and exceeded our expectations.
In the March quarter, total revenues were up 5% year-over-year and hard disk drive revenues were up 7% year-over-year. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 43.8 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 4.8 terabytes per drive. In the nearline market, we shipped 41.3 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached 6.5 terabytes per drive, up 41% over last year and up 64% from the March quarter 2 years ago.
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent, and supply remains a bit constrained. Our 10-terabyte nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the March quarter. In addition, we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product as we ramp for material revenue contribution. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads.
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the March quarter for nearly all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, gaming and network-attached storage.
The March quarter non-hard disk drive revenues, primarily from the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, were $217 million, up 2% sequentially. 
Year-over-year, the non-hard disk drive revenues were down 13%, primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud systems, products and the divestiture of high-performance computing assets.
Silicon revenues were up a few percentage points year-over-year, and we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with the Toshiba Memory Corporation as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in the SaaS, SSD, PCIe, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions.
We believe that our strategic approach to participate in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth opportunities in our business model without the overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. In the March quarter, these products represented less than 8% of consolidated revenue.
Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership, with generations of storage technologies and products.
Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our perpendicular, shingled and 2-dimensional magnetic recording areal density solutions. These recording technologies continue to provide measurable total cost of ownership advantages for the mass storage market over other memory-based technologies, particularly for cloud-based environments.
We continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording technology. This next-generation recording platform will open up a rich design space for high-capacity nearline drives that will push capacity points up 24 terabytes per drive and beyond and offer great economic value for our customers. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in volume in 2019, and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model. 
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $406 million on a GAAP basis, and $385 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 13% year-over-year. Capital expenditures were approximately $69 million in the March quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest highest capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures to remain below 5% of total consolidated revenue.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $558 million, and free cash flow was $489 million. Year-to-date, we have generated over $1.6 billion in cash flow from operations and nearly $1.4 billion in free cash flow.
Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was 5 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment, coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. Over the last 2 years, we have made many changes to optimize our operational footprint and supply chain management. Product complexity is a significant challenge in the storage marketplace right now, and we believe our agility and manufacturing responsiveness within the component supply chain provides a significant competitive advantage for Seagate. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5, 2018.
Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
In the March quarter, we deployed $57 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt-to-last 12 months EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is under 1x as of the March quarter.
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. We work with technology customers, vendors and suppliers throughout the world. In the area of tax and trade, the U.S. and China have recently announced potential trade actions that could increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S. Given the fluid nature of the issue, it is too speculative to determine any impact or changes for Seagate's operations. However, we continue to monitor the situation.
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the March quarter reflects solid earnings power and financial leverage within our business model. Looking ahead, we will continue to align our go-to-market operations and product portfolio advancements for growth in the existing mass storage markets. 
Over the long term, we believe there will be additional growth opportunities, with new markets and customers that will leverage our cost-efficient and reliable storage technologies. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

We remain optimistic about Seagate's earnings power as current macroeconomic conditions and global investments in cloud-based environments persist. Specific to the nearline products, we share the perspective that we are in the early stages of a broad-based global cloud storage transformation. 
For the June quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth, with continued strong enterprise demand and tight supply for our highest capacity solutions.  Within the other markets we serve, we anticipate sequential seasonal unit demand declines as we would typically see in the June quarter. It is important to note, however, that exabyte demand is growing year-over-year in nearly all markets.
As a result of these exabyte demand trends, we expect total revenues to be approximately flat sequentially from the March quarter, reflecting quarterly year-over-year revenue growth of roughly 17%, and total revenue growth of approximately 4% for fiscal 2018.
We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the March quarter and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Cash flow from operations for the June quarter should be at least $500 million, and we are on track to achieve over $2 billion in cash flow from operations for fiscal 2018.
Based upon our trajectory for our overachievement of our fiscal year 2018 plan, we anticipate an increase in variable compensation for employees for annual performance in the June quarter. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly, and we anticipate overall non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 1% to 2%.
Looking further ahead, feedback from our largest enterprise customers in all regions indicates strong capacity demand will continue throughout the calendar year. In addition, we anticipate seasonal strength in our other markets, with particularly strong exabyte growth in edge markets in the second half. 
Diverse markets that are exhibiting strong data storage requirements translate to continued favorable growth and profitability opportunities for Seagate. We believe these long-term trends will continue with existing customers and that new customers and business vertical opportunities are also on the horizon.
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to the March quarter's results.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

So if you remember the history of the nearline markets in the last 5 years, there's been periods where we had misinterpreted it as seasonality, but there were periods of feast and famine, if you will. The market, generally, the exabytes were increasing at about a 35% CAGR. But there were some markets where -- some times where the market was much faster than that and other times where it slowed down. We're starting to see that abate and the demand be a lot more predictable, longer lead time visibility, and some of that is because the build-out of major cloud installations pulling really hard on high-capacity drives is not as feast or famine anymore. I think behind that, and this is something that is still developing a little bit, are the more legacy technologies for on-prem or smaller data centers where the capacity points aren't necessarily the highest capacity points, but -- so we'll say, 8 terabytes and below, but the demand is quite strong and quite diverse geographically. So from my perspective, that strength is -- actually picked up middle of last year and feels strong through the back half of this calendar year as well. Looking out into calendar year '19, I think it may be a little bit premature. We'll see the size of the back half of this year first. But it's certainly feeling like the install patterns that most of the cloud service providers and some of these big on-prem companies are in the middle of are still very healthy, And so I wouldn't be surprised at all if it does extend for another year."

We are down total volume build-wise, and this is probably the only time I'll talk absolute units, but build-wise, total volumes were down about 4% to 5%. And so if you think about absorption loss from that, that added some headwinds. If you look at it from a year-over-year basis, though, however, absolute gross margin dollars were up approximately $50 million, and so that's where you're really starting to see the expansion due to the changes from your client/server, more so to the mobility cloud and with the build-out of these workloads and these streams. I'll also remind you that our 12TB is still ramping aggressively into material volume contributions, and so we had some startup costs associated with that as well. So all in all, great quarter by the team, specifically in operations.

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the March quarter. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the June quarter.
I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the March quarter reflect year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.2%; and a net income of $381 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.31. 
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 30.8%; net income of $424 million, up 29% year-over-year; and a diluted earnings per share of $1.46, up 33% year-over-year.
HDD exabyte shipments for the March quarter were 87.4 exabytes, up 34% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.4 terabytes per drive, up 32% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was $70.50, up 6% year-over-year.
GAAP operating expenses were $406 million, down 26% year-over-year; and non-GAAP operating expenses were $385 million, down 13% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $558 million, up 31% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $489 million, up 48% year-over-year.
Fiscal year-to-date, we have achieved cash flow from operations of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. Achieving year-over-year revenue and profitability growth and significant cash flow generation in the March quarter reflects Seagate's strong business model execution. I am pleased with the traction we have gained with our mass storage solutions across the enterprise and edge markets and with the competitiveness of our entire HDD portfolio that aligns with trending data growth opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activities."

For the March quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand and exceeded our expectations.In the March quarter, t",1090,"Thanks, Dave. For the March quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand and exceeded our expectations.
In the March quarter, total revenues were up 5% year-over-year and hard disk drive revenues were up 7% year-over-year. The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 43.8 exabytes, with a record average capacity of 4.8 terabytes per drive. In the nearline market, we shipped 41.3 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached 6.5 terabytes per drive, up 41% over last year and up 64% from the March quarter 2 years ago.
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent, and supply remains a bit constrained. Our 10-terabyte nearline product was the leading enterprise revenue SKU in the March quarter. In addition, we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product as we ramp for material revenue contribution. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads.
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the March quarter for nearly all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, gaming and network-attached storage.
The March quarter non-hard disk drive revenues, primarily from the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group, were $217 million, up 2% sequentially. 
Year-over-year, the non-hard disk drive revenues were down 13%, primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud systems, products and the divestiture of high-performance computing assets.
Silicon revenues were up a few percentage points year-over-year, and we continue to be bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with the Toshiba Memory Corporation as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in the SaaS, SSD, PCIe, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions.
We believe that our strategic approach to participate in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth opportunities in our business model without the overhang from additional capital requirements and cyclical market exposure.
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. In the March quarter, these products represented less than 8% of consolidated revenue.
Critical to supporting the massive growth in data is our ability to continue to provide mass storage solutions that optimize areal density and have the greatest reliability, quality and total cost of ownership benefits. Seagate has demonstrated technology leadership, with generations of storage technologies and products.
Over the last 5 years, we've been the leader in areal density with our perpendicular, shingled and 2-dimensional magnetic recording areal density solutions. These recording technologies continue to provide measurable total cost of ownership advantages for the mass storage market over other memory-based technologies, particularly for cloud-based environments.
We continue to make progress towards the introduction of our heat-assisted magnetic recording technology. This next-generation recording platform will open up a rich design space for high-capacity nearline drives that will push capacity points up 24 terabytes per drive and beyond and offer great economic value for our customers. We anticipate launching our HAMR portfolio in volume in 2019, and the future investment costs are already contemplated in our existing operating expense and capital expenditure long-term model. 
Operating expenses for the March quarter were $406 million on a GAAP basis, and $385 million on a non-GAAP basis, down 13% year-over-year. Capital expenditures were approximately $69 million in the March quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest highest capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures to remain below 5% of total consolidated revenue.
Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $558 million, and free cash flow was $489 million. Year-to-date, we have generated over $1.6 billion in cash flow from operations and nearly $1.4 billion in free cash flow.
Our cash conversion cycle for the March quarter was 5 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment, coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. Over the last 2 years, we have made many changes to optimize our operational footprint and supply chain management. Product complexity is a significant challenge in the storage marketplace right now, and we believe our agility and manufacturing responsiveness within the component supply chain provides a significant competitive advantage for Seagate. 
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the March quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the March quarter, which will be payable on July 5, 2018.
Interest expense for the March quarter was $60 million. Our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
In the March quarter, we deployed $57 million towards redeeming our November 2018 senior notes. Our net debt-to-last 12 months EBITDA ratio continues to trend down and is under 1x as of the March quarter.
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. We work with technology customers, vendors and suppliers throughout the world. In the area of tax and trade, the U.S. and China have recently announced potential trade actions that could increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S. Given the fluid nature of the issue, it is too speculative to determine any impact or changes for Seagate's operations. However, we continue to monitor the situation.
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the March quarter reflects solid earnings power and financial leverage within our business model. Looking ahead, we will continue to align our go-to-market operations and product portfolio advancements for growth in the existing mass storage markets. 
Over the long term, we believe there will be additional growth opportunities, with new markets and customers that will leverage our cost-efficient and reliable storage technologies. 
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

We remain optimistic about Seagate's earnings power as current macroeconomic conditions and global investments in cloud-based environments persist. Specific to the nearline products, we share the perspective that we are in the early stages of a broad-based global cloud storage transformation. 
For the June quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth, with continued strong enterprise demand and tight supply for our highest capacity solutions. Within the other markets we serve, we anticipate sequential seasonal unit demand declines as we would typically see in the June quarter. It is important to note, however, that exabyte demand is growing year-over-year in nearly all markets.
As a result of these exabyte demand trends, we expect total revenues to be approximately flat sequentially from the March quarter, reflecting quarterly year-over-year revenue growth of roughly 17%, and total revenue growth of approximately 4% for fiscal 2018.
We expect gross margins to be sequentially in line with the March quarter and continue to be within our 29% to 33% long-term range. Cash flow from operations for the June quarter should be at least $500 million, and we are on track to achieve over $2 billion in cash flow from operations for fiscal 2018.
Based upon our trajectory for our overachievement of our fiscal year 2018 plan, we anticipate an increase in variable compensation for employees for annual performance in the June quarter. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly, and we anticipate overall non-GAAP operating expenses will be down sequentially 1% to 2%.
Looking further ahead, feedback from our largest enterprise customers in all regions indicates strong capacity demand will continue throughout the calendar year. In addition, we anticipate seasonal strength in our other markets, with particularly strong exabyte growth in edge markets in the second half. 
Diverse markets that are exhibiting strong data storage requirements translate to continued favorable growth and profitability opportunities for Seagate. We believe these long-term trends will continue with existing customers and that new customers and business vertical opportunities are also on the horizon.
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to the March quarter's results.
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

So if you remember the history of the nearline markets in the last 5 years, there's been periods where we had misinterpreted it as seasonality, but there were periods of feast and famine, if you will. The market, generally, the exabytes were increasing at about a 35% CAGR. But there were some markets where -- some times where the market was much faster than that and other times where it slowed down. We're starting to see that abate and the demand be a lot more predictable, longer lead time visibility, and some of that is because the build-out of major cloud installations pulling really hard on high-capacity drives is not as feast or famine anymore. I think behind that, and this is something that is still developing a little bit, are the more legacy technologies for on-prem or smaller data centers where the capacity points aren't necessarily the highest capacity points, but -- so we'll say, 8 terabytes and below, but the demand is quite strong and quite diverse geographically. So from my perspective, that strength is -- actually picked up middle of last year and feels strong through the back half of this calendar year as well. Looking out into calendar year '19, I think it may be a little bit premature. We'll see the size of the back half of this year first. But it's certainly feeling like the install patterns that most of the cloud service providers and some of these big on-prem companies are in the middle of are still very healthy, and so I wouldn't be surprised at all if it does extend for another year."

And so if you think about absorption loss from that, that added some headwinds. If you look at it from a year-over-year basis, though, however, absolute gross margin dollars were up approximately $50 million, and so that's where you're really starting to see the expansion due to the changes from your client/server, more so to the mobility cloud and with the build-out of these workloads and these streams. I'll also remind you that our 12TB is still ramping aggressively into material volume contributions, and so we had some startup costs associated with that as well.

The big question for us, the big question for everyone, I think, that everyone's asking is how long is it going to last and how big is the peak. And I think right now, we just see strong demand through the back half of this calendar year."

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the June quarter and fiscal 2018. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter.
I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the June quarter reflect very strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 31.9%; and net income of $461 million. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.57.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32.4%; net income of $475 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.62.
HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 92.9 exabytes, up 49% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.5 terabytes per drive, up 40% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was approximately $72, up 12% year-over-year.
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were $399 million, with non-GAAP down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. Turning to our full fiscal year 2018 results, our solid business model execution drove year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and cash flow generation. 
Strong year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments reflects the competitiveness of our mass storage solutions and alignment, with the growing demand for data products globally.
For the full fiscal year 2018, Seagate achieved revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations up 10% year-over-year, and $1.7 million of free cash flow, up 18% year-over-year. 
GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income growth of approximately 53% and 31% respectively. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.05, up 57% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51, up 34% year-over-year.
GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and non-GAAP gross margins of 30.7%. And total exabyte growth of 29% year-over-year.
I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activity shortly. 
Before I do so, I'd like to address the announcement we made today, in addition to our earnings results regarding our CFO transition. 
Dave Morton, who has been our CFO for close to 3 years, and with the company for over 23 years has decided to leave Seagate for a senior finance executive role at another company. 
We will be conducting a search for the Chief Financial Officer role, and the board has appointed Kate Scolnick, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Kate is a Senior Vice President and the company Treasurer. And over the last 6 years has been integral part of Seagate's senior leadership team. 
On behalf of the management team and the board, we thank Dave Morton for his leadership of the finance organization and his many contributions to our business. 
And I'd also like to thank Kate for taking on increased responsibilities. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."
3738520,573279992,1513206,"Seagate Technology plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth for revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year",1075,"Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth for revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. 
In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-over-year, and hard disk drive revenues were up 19% year-over-year. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate. And we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
For the enterprise, hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 47.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of approximately 5.3 terabytes per drive, up 54% year-over-year. 
In the nearline market, we shipped 44.5 exabytes and our average capacity per drive reached approximately 7 terabytes per drive, up 43% over the last year, and up 54% from the June quarter 2 years ago. 
In addition, we saw some intra-quarter upside demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 18% year-over-year exabyte growth with the average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte.
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent and supply remains bit constrained. Our 10TB nearline product was the leading enterprise SKU in the June quarter. And we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12TB nearline product. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for a mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the June quarter for nearly all end markets including PC compute, surveillance, DVR, gaming and network attached storage. 
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1 terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets. As we believe these application workloads will move overtime to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. 
In the June quarter, these products represented approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue. Non-Hard disk drive revenues in the June quarter were $183 million, relatively flat year-over-year. 
Within this, silicon revenues were up 53% year-over-year, and we are bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in this SaaS, NVMe consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions. 
We believe that our strategic approach to prospecting in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth in our business model without the overhang from capital requirements and cyclical market exposure. Cloud systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the planned shaping of our business to optimize the margin structures and business mix. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year. And free cash flow of $1.7 million was up 18% year-over-year. 
Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 6 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. 
Gross margins in the June quarter were 31.9% on a GAAP basis and 32.4% on a non-GAAP basis. And within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. 
The sequential upside in gross margins include better mix from our enterprise portfolio, linearity and some product cost benefits. 
Year-over-year, our margins have benefited from the enterprise mix shift in our business, higher capacity points mix shift across the rest of our mass storage solutions portfolio, and high utilization of our vertical integrated factories. 
On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the June quarter were $399 million, down 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and down 5% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Expenses were slightly higher than planned as we had higher variable compensation as a result of better annual performance, and some accelerated material spend needed for our future product portfolio.
Capital expenditures on a cash basis were approximately $96 million in the June quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest, highest capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital.
For the fiscal 2018, capital expenditures were below 4% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 3, 2018. 
Interest expense for the June quarter was $54 million. During the fiscal year 2018, the company repurchased $214 million of outstanding debt, and our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Our net debt during the last 12 months EBITDA ratio is 1.2x as of June quarter.
In the June quarter, as part of the consortium led by the bank primary equity, we finalize our investment of approximately $1.3 billion in acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. This investment is expected to have a 5% per annum financial return that is intended to be held of maturity over a 6-year life. 
For fiscal 2018, we return 51% of cash flow from operations to shareholders, slightly above the high end of our long-term model range of 30% to 50%. 
And as we did last quarter, I wanted to provide an updated perspective on the recently enacted and proposed trade actions to increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S., including some of Seagate's storage products. 
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. In response of the tariff changes that took place this month, we are actively working with our affected customers and suppliers to identify and implement minimally disruptive mitigation plans. 
In reference to any additional new duty tax changes that may take effect will be evaluating additional minimally disruptive mitigation plans for the affected customers and suppliers. 
Going forward, we'll update you if there are any conditions that change in our business.
Overall, our operational financial performance in the June quarter and full fiscal 2018 reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Mosley."

Strong global macroeconomic conditions and global investments in IT infrastructure persist, leading to higher cloud data center and edge demand.

Strong global macroeconomic conditions and global investments in IT infrastructure persist, leading to higher cloud data center and edge demand. For Seagate, secular market growth trends in nearline, surveillance and SSD are more than offsetting material market trends such as in the compute and mission-critical markets.
Given the current macroeconomic environment and forecast for data growth and related storage spending, we believe we are on pace to demonstrate another year of revenue and profitability growth and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2019. 
To meet the needs of the growing broad base of customers and verticals requiring NAS storage solutions, particularly in the cloud environments, we are bringing out a number of new technology enhancements, including multi-actuator designs, security features and application workload advancements specific to cloud customers. 
An important aspect of Seagate's storage portfolio that will accelerate through fiscal 2019 is growing our SSD revenue in the SaaS, NVMe consumer and gaming markets, as we integrate our TMC NAND supply and qualify our products with customers.
These qualifications are going well, and our expectations are to achieve double-digit sequential quarterly revenue growth through the fiscal year. With favorable conditions and continued execution, we now have NAND supply to sustain this rate of growth over the next few years. 
For the September quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue exabyte and profitability growth with continued strong enterprise demand and sequential seasonal demand in the compute and gaming markets. We remain a bit constrained and we are working to serve our customers across their portfolio needs as we actively worked to optimize our media and heads for our entire NAS storage solution product set. 
We expect total revenues in the September quarter to be up approximately 5% sequentially and demonstrating year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. This rate of sequential growth should continue through the December quarter as well.
Cash from operations for the September quarter are forecasted to be approximately $500 million, up significantly year-over-year. 
We expect gross margins for the September quarter to be at the midpoint of our 29% to 33% long-term range, as we competitively participate in the seasonal demand for HDD gaming, consumer and compute products continued to ramp -- to yield our highest capacity products within our HDD enterprise portfolio and ramp our SSD business revenue. 
Our vertically integrated factory utilization remains very high. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly and work to align our organization with future opportunities. 
Toward these efforts, we are executing a voluntary retirement plan in the September quarter that is outside of our restructuring activities. This plan will increase our overall operating expenses by approximately 5% sequentially. 
Beyond September, overall operating expenses will then declined to approximately $385 million a quarter, providing further leverage to our fiscal year '19 financial model, and at the low end of our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%.
To address the high-capacity NAS storage, HDD demand signals and the product transitions we have planned for FY '19 and beyond, we are increasing our capital expenditures in the September and December. Quarters to approximately 6% of revenue. 
For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong fiscal year 2018 results. These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY 2019 and beyond. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

On the cloud front, there are a number of different things going on, and I would say the demand continues very strong. Strong globally and there's also a mix up over the last couple of years, many customers who once upon a time were buying 2 and 4 terabytes are now up and 10 and 12 terabytes. So you see as people continue to do these build outs, you see a demand for more and more exabytes, which is where we have to chase with our heads and media investment as well. So I don't see that abating in the next 6 months. To some extent, the industry will answer that as much as we can, but I think for the foreseeable future, that's very strong.

So the transition as we get more NAND supply online, and the transition and some of those existing customers just took to just more market share. And maybe a little bit of horizontal prefoliation of new customers as well as possible in SaaS. NVMe, as we all know, it's fairly now and changing very quickly. So there's a lot of demand for new feature sets. We feel fairly linked with customers there and we feel we have a pretty good product portfolio. So as the market switches to NVMe, especially with enterprise features associated with that, with our customers and we see we should do pretty well. There are also other consumer and gaming markets that will try to deploy the new assets against but it really stays -- we really stay focused on enterprise."

It's not just hyper -- a few hyperscale people that are doing massive installs, it's globally happening. The other thing is that these capacity points are driving north. So I think as people are doing the installs, they're not just answering the call of yesterday's data, they're actually the data growth is very large so they want our highest capacity drives. Just over the last few years, we've seen almost 40% CAGR. But just the last period that we're in ticking up. So we're watching carefully I think.

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the June quarter and fiscal 2018. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter.
I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the June quarter reflect very strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 31.9%; and net income of $461 million. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.57.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32.4%; net income of $475 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.62.
HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 92.9 exabytes, up 49% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.5 terabytes per drive, up 40% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was approximately $72, up 12% year-over-year. 
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were $399 million, with non-GAAP down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. Turning to our full fiscal year 2018 results, our solid business model execution drove year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and cash flow generation. 
Strong year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments reflects the competitiveness of our mass storage solutions and alignment, with the growing demand for data products globally.
For the full fiscal year 2018, Seagate achieved revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations up 10% year-over-year, and $1.7 billion of free cash flow, up 18% year-over-year. 
GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income growth of approximately 53% and 31%, respectively. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.05, up 57% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51, up 34% year-over-year.
GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and non-GAAP gross margins of 30.7% and total exabyte growth of 29% year-over-year.
I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activity shortly. 
Before I do so, I'd like to address the announcement we made today, in addition to our earnings results regarding our CFO transition. 
Dave Morton, who has been our CFO for close to 3 years and with the company for over 23 years, has decided to leave Seagate for a Senior Finance Executive role at another company. 
We will be conducting a search for the Chief Financial Officer role, and the board has appointed Kate Scolnick, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Kate is a Senior Vice President and the company Treasurer and over the last 6 years has been an integral part of Seagate's senior leadership team. 
On behalf of the management team and the board, we thank Dave Morton for his leadership of the finance organization and his many contributions to our business. 
And I'd also like to thank Kate for taking on increased responsibilities. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."
3738520,573279992,1513292,"Seagate Technology plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-",1076,"Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. 
In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-over-year, and hard disk drive revenues were up 19% year-over-year. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
For the enterprise, hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 47.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of approximately 5.3 terabytes per drive, up 54% year-over-year. 
In the nearline market, we shipped 44.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached approximately 7 terabytes per drive, up 43% over the last year, and up 54% from the June quarter 2 years ago. 
In addition, we saw some intra-quarter upside demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in a 18% year-over-year exabyte growth with the average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. 
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent, and supply remains bit constrained. Our 10TB nearline product was the leading enterprise SKU in the June quarter. And we achieved significant, sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12TB nearline product. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for a mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the June quarter for nearly all end markets including PC compute, surveillance, DVR, gaming and network-attached storage. 
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1 terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move overtime to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. 
In the June quarter, these products represented approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue. Nonhard disk drive revenues in the June quarter were $183 million, relatively flat year-over-year. 
Within this, silicon revenues were up 53% year-over-year, and we are bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation, as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in this SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions. 
We believe that our strategic approach to prospecting in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth in our business model without the overhang from capital requirements and cyclical market exposure. Cloud systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the planned shaping of our business to optimize the margin structure and business mix. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion was up 18% year-over-year. 
Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 6 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. 
Gross margins in the June quarter were 31.9% on a GAAP basis and 32.4% on a non-GAAP basis and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. 
The sequential upside in gross margins included better mix from our enterprise portfolio, linearity and some product cost benefits. 
Year-over-year, our margins have benefited from the enterprise mix shift in our business, higher capacity points mix shift across the rest of our mass storage solutions portfolio, and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories. 
On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the June quarter were $399 million, down 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and down 5% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Expenses were slightly higher than planned as we had higher variable compensation as a result of better annual performance and some accelerated material spend needed for our future product portfolio.
Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $96 million in the June quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest, highest capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital.
For the fiscal 2018, capital expenditures were below 4% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 3, 2018. 
Interest expense for the June quarter was $54 million. During the fiscal year 2018, the company repurchased $214 million of outstanding debt, and our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Our net debt to the last 12 months EBITDA ratio is 1.2x as of June quarter.
In the June quarter, as part of the consortium led by the Bain Private Equity, we finalized our investment of approximately $1.3 billion in the acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. This investment is expected to have a 5% per annum financial return that is intended to be held at maturity over its 6-year life. 
For fiscal 2018, we returned 51% of cash flow from operations to shareholders, slightly above the high-end of our long-term model range of 30% to 50%. 
And as we did last quarter, I wanted to provide an updated perspective on the recently enacted and proposed trade actions to increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S., including some of Seagate's storage products. 
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex, global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. In response to the tariff changes that took place this month, we are actively working with our affected customers and suppliers to identify and implement minimally disruptive mitigation plans. 
In reference to any additional new duty tax changes that may take effect will be evaluating additional, minimally disruptive mitigation plans for the affected customers and suppliers. 
Going forward, we will update you if there are any conditions that change in our business.
Overall, our operational financial performance in the June quarter and full fiscal 2018 reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Mosley."

For Seagate, secular market growth trends in nearline, surveillance and SSD are more than offse",604,"Thanks, Dave. Strong, global macroeconomic conditions and global investments in IT infrastructure persist, leading to higher cloud data center and edge demand. For Seagate, secular market growth trends in nearline, surveillance and SSD are more than offsetting material market trends as in -- such as in the compute and mission-critical markets.
Given the current macroeconomic environment and forecast for data growth and related storage spending, we believe we are on pace to demonstrate another year of revenue and profitability growth and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2019. 
To meet the needs of the growing broad base of customers and verticals requiring mass storage solutions, particularly in the cloud environments, we are bringing out a number of new technology enhancements, including multi-actuator designs, security features and application workload advancements specific to cloud customers. 
An important aspect of Seagate's storage portfolio that will accelerate through fiscal 2019 is growing our SSD revenue in the SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets, as we integrate our TMC NAND supply and qualify our products with customers.
These qualifications are going well, and our expectations are to achieve double-digit, sequential, quarterly revenue growth through the fiscal year. With favorable conditions and continued execution, we now have NAND supply to sustain this rate of growth over the next few years. 
For the September quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth with continued, strong enterprise demand and sequential seasonal demand in the compute and gaming markets. We remain a bit constrained, and we are working to serve our customers across their portfolio needs, as we actively work to optimize our media and heads for our entire mass storage solution product set. 
We expect total revenues in the September quarter to be up approximately 5% sequentially demonstrating year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. This rate of sequential growth should continue through the December quarter as well.
Cash flow from operations for the September quarter are forecasted to be approximately $500 million, up significantly year-over-year. 
We expect gross margins for the September quarter to be at the midpoint of our 29% to 33% long-term range, as we competitively participate in the seasonal demand for HDD gaming, consumer and compute products continue to ramp -- to yield our highest capacity products within our HDD enterprise portfolio and ramp our SSD business revenue. 
Our vertically integrated factory utilization remains very high. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly and work to align our organization with future opportunities. 
Toward these efforts, we are executing a voluntary retirement plan in the September quarter that is outside of our restructuring activities. This plan will increase our overall operating expenses by approximately 5% sequentially. 
Beyond September, overall operating expenses will then decline to approximately $385 million a quarter, providing further leverage to our fiscal year '19 financial model and at the low end of our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%.
To address the high-capacity mass storage, HDD demand signals and the product transitions we have planned for FY '19 and beyond, we are increasing our capital expenditures in the September and December quarters to approximately 6% of revenue. 
For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong fiscal year 2018 results. These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY 2019 and beyond. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

And then just as a follow-on to that, 3 months ago, you talked about better seasonal volumes as well as the ramp of high cap and SSD new products helping margins in the back half, but it doesn't sound like you expect sequential improvement as you go into the September quarter, so just wondering if anything has changed on that front."

Last quarter was a little bit higher than last couple of quarters, so we're watching it carefully to see if we do need to ratchet that up. But I would consider that market very stable. On the cloud front, there -- a number of different things going on, and I would say the demand continues very strong. Strong globally and there's also a mix up over the last couple of years, many customers who once upon a time were buying 2 and 4 terabytes are now up and 10 and 12 terabytes. So you see, as people continue to do these build outs, you see the demand for more and more exabytes, which is where we have to chase with our heads in media investment as well. So I don't see that abating in the next 6 months. To some extent, the industry will answer that as much as we can, but I think for the foreseeable future, that's very strong.

So the transition, as we get more NAND supply online, the transition in some of those existing customers already to just more market share. And maybe a little bit of horizontal proliferation to new customers as well as possible in SaaS. NVMe, as we all know, it's fairly new and changing very quickly. So there are a lot of demands for new feature sets. We feel fairly linked in with customers there, and we feel like we have a pretty good product portfolio. So as the market switches to NVMe, especially with enterprise features associated with that, with our customer intimacy, we should do pretty well. There are also other consumer and gaming markets that will try to deploy the new assets against but it really stays -- we really stay focused on enterprise."

It's not just hyper -- a few hyperscale people that are doing massive installs, it's globally happening. The other thing is that these capacity points are driving north. So I think as people are doing the installs, they're not just answering the call of yesterday's data, they're actually -- the data growth is very large, so they want our highest capacity drives. Just over the last few years, we've seen almost a 40% CAGR. But just -- in this last period that we're in is ticking up. So we're watching carefully.

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the June quarter and fiscal 2018. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter.
I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the June quarter reflect very strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 31.9%; and net income of $461 million. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.57.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32.4%; net income of $475 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.62.
HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 92.9 exabytes, up 49% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.5 terabytes per drive, up 40% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was approximately $72, up 12% year-over-year. 
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were $399 million, with non-GAAP down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. Turning to our full fiscal year 2018 results, our solid business model execution drove year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and cash flow generation. 
Strong year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments reflects the competitiveness of our mass storage solutions and alignment, with the growing demand for data products globally.
For the full fiscal year 2018, Seagate achieved revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations up 10% year-over-year, and $1.7 billion of free cash flow, up 18% year-over-year. 
GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income growth of approximately 53% and 31%, respectively. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.05, up 57% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51, up 34% year-over-year.
GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and non-GAAP gross margins of 30.7% and total exabyte growth of 29% year-over-year.
I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activity shortly. 
Before I do so, I'd like to address the announcement we made today, in addition to our earnings results regarding our CFO transition. 
Dave Morton, who has been our CFO for close to 3 years and with the company for over 23 years, has decided to leave Seagate for a Senior Finance Executive role at another company. 
We will be conducting a search for the Chief Financial Officer role, and the board has appointed Kate Scolnick, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Kate is a Senior Vice President and the company Treasurer and over the last 6 years has been an integral part of Seagate's senior leadership team. 
On behalf of the management team and the board, we thank Dave Morton for his leadership of the finance organization and his many contributions to our business. 
And I'd also like to thank Kate for taking on increased responsibilities. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."
3738520,573279992,1517713,"Seagate Technology plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-",1076,"Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. 
In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-over-year, and hard disk drive revenues were up 19% year-over-year. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
For the enterprise, hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 47.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of approximately 5.3 terabytes per drive, up 54% year-over-year. 
In the nearline market, we shipped 44.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached approximately 7 terabytes per drive, up 43% over the last year, and up 54% from the June quarter 2 years ago. 
In addition, we saw some intra-quarter upside demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in a 18% year-over-year exabyte growth with the average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. 
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent, and supply remains bit constrained. Our 10TB nearline product was the leading enterprise SKU in the June quarter. And we achieved significant, sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12TB nearline product. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for a mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the June quarter for nearly all end markets including PC compute, surveillance, DVR, gaming and network-attached storage. 
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1 terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move overtime to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. 
In the June quarter, these products represented approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue. Nonhard disk drive revenues in the June quarter were $183 million, relatively flat year-over-year. 
Within this, silicon revenues were up 53% year-over-year, and we are bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation, as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in this SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions. 
We believe that our strategic approach to participating in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth in our business model without the overhang from capital requirements and cyclical market exposure. Cloud systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the planned shaping of our business to optimize the margin structure and business mix. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion was up 18% year-over-year. 
Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 6 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. 
Gross margins in the June quarter were 31.9% on a GAAP basis and 32.4% on a non-GAAP basis and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. 
The sequential upside in gross margins included better mix from our enterprise portfolio, linearity and some product cost benefits. 
Year-over-year, our margins have benefited from the enterprise mix shift in our business, higher capacity points mix shift across the rest of our mass storage solutions portfolio, and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories. 
On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the June quarter were $399 million, down 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and down 5% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Expenses were slightly higher than planned as we had higher variable compensation as a result of better annual performance and some accelerated material spend needed for our future product portfolio.
Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $96 million in the June quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest, highest capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital.
For the fiscal 2018, capital expenditures were below 4% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 3, 2018. 
Interest expense for the June quarter was $54 million. During the fiscal year 2018, the company repurchased $214 million of outstanding debt, and our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Our net debt to the last 12 months EBITDA ratio is 1.2x as of June quarter.
In the June quarter, as part of the consortium led by the Bain Private Equity, we finalized our investment of approximately $1.3 billion in the acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. This investment is expected to have a 5% per annum financial return that is intended to be held at maturity over its 6-year life. 
For fiscal 2018, we returned 51% of cash flow from operations to shareholders, slightly above the high-end of our long-term model range of 30% to 50%. 
And as we did last quarter, I wanted to provide an updated perspective on the recently enacted and proposed trade actions to increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S., including some of Seagate's storage products. 
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex, global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. In response to the tariff changes that took place this month, we are actively working with our affected customers and suppliers to identify and implement minimally disruptive mitigation plans. 
In reference to any additional new duty tax changes that may take effect will be evaluating additional, minimally disruptive mitigation plans for the affected customers and suppliers. 
Going forward, we will update you if there are any conditions that change in our business.
Overall, our operational financial performance in the June quarter and full fiscal 2018 reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Mosley."

Strong, global macroeconomic conditions and global investments in IT infrastructure persist, leading to higher cloud data center and edge demand. For Seagate, secular market growth trends in nearline, surveillance and SSD are more than offsetting material market trends as in -- such as in the compute and mission-critical markets.
Given the current macroeconomic environment and forecast for data growth and related storage spending, we believe we are on pace to demonstrate another year of revenue and profitability growth and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2019. 
To meet the needs of the growing broad base of customers and verticals requiring mass storage solutions, particularly in the cloud environments, we are bringing out a number of new technology enhancements, including multi-actuator designs, security features and application workload advancements specific to cloud customers. 
An important aspect of Seagate's storage portfolio that will accelerate through fiscal 2019 is growing our SSD revenue in the SaaS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets, as we integrate our TMC NAND supply and qualify our products with customers.
These qualifications are going well, and our expectations are to achieve double-digit, sequential, quarterly revenue growth through the fiscal year. With favorable conditions and continued execution, we now have NAND supply to sustain this rate of growth over the next few years. 
For the September quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth with continued, strong enterprise demand and sequential seasonal demand in the compute and gaming markets. We remain a bit constrained, and we are working to serve our customers across their portfolio needs, as we actively work to optimize our media and heads for our entire mass storage solution product set. 
We expect total revenues in the September quarter to be up approximately 5% sequentially demonstrating year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. This rate of sequential growth should continue through the December quarter as well.
Cash flow from operations for the September quarter are forecasted to be approximately $500 million, up significantly year-over-year. 
We expect gross margins for the September quarter to be at the midpoint of our 29% to 33% long-term range, as we competitively participate in the seasonal demand for HDD gaming, consumer and compute products continue to ramp -- to yield our highest capacity products within our HDD enterprise portfolio and ramp our SSD business revenue. 
Our vertically integrated factory utilization remains very high. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly and work to align our organization with future opportunities. 
Toward these efforts, we are executing a voluntary retirement plan in the September quarter that is outside of our restructuring activities. This plan will increase our overall operating expenses by approximately 5% sequentially. 
Beyond September, overall operating expenses will then decline to approximately $385 million a quarter, providing further leverage to our fiscal year '19 financial model and at the low end of our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%.
To address the high-capacity mass storage, HDD demand signals and the product transitions we have planned for FY '19 and beyond, we are increasing our capital expenditures in the September and December quarters to approximately 6% of revenue. 
For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong fiscal year 2018 results. These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY 2019 and beyond. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

So just wonder whether you can comment on what you see over the next 6 months from both the mission-critical business where you saw upside as well as whether you're seeing any softening in cloud demand. And then just as a follow-on to that, 3 months ago, you talked about better seasonal volumes as well as the ramp of high cap and SSD new products helping margins in the back half, but it doesn't sound like you expect sequential improvement as you go into the September quarter, so just wondering if anything has changed on that front."

On the cloud front, there -- a number of different things going on, and I would say the demand continues very strong. Strong globally and there's also a mix up over the last couple of years, many customers who once upon a time were buying 2 and 4 terabytes are now up and 10 and 12 terabytes. So you see, as people continue to do these build outs, you see the demand for more and more exabytes, which is where we have to chase with our heads in media investment as well. So I don't see that abating in the next 6 months. To some extent, the industry will answer that as much as we can, but I think for the foreseeable future, that's very strong.

You see customers who want their specific applications optimized and they're -- they can pick from a plethora of different features that we've developed, arguably over the years for key OEMs or some of the early movers in the cloud. Now you're starting to see optimization scenarios for some of the growing Tier 2 people and so on. I think what that does is it creates a great business relationship between the companies. It's not necessarily something that drives a lot of increased revenue or anything other than the fact that it speeds up their transition and makes their data centers more effective so they can get done what they need to get done. Out beyond 6 months from now, it's really hard to tell, I mean, we've all been through these cloud cycles before. And so, I'm -- maybe a little -- there's a little bit of trepidation always that there is another digestion phase coming. But again, given how broad based it is this time, I think it'll probably be more muted and will stay at or above the traditional growth rates, I think."

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the June quarter and fiscal 2018. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter.
I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the June quarter reflect very strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 31.9%; and net income of $461 million. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.57.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32.4%, net income of $475 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.62.
HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 92.9 exabytes, up 49% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.5 terabytes per drive, up 40% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was approximately $72, up 12% year-over-year. 
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were $399 million, with non-GAAP down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. Turning to our full fiscal year 2018 results. Our solid business model execution drove year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and cash flow generation. 
Strong year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments reflects the competitiveness of our mass storage solutions and alignment with the growing demand for data products globally.
For the full fiscal year 2018, Seagate achieved revenue growth of 4% year-over-year; $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations, up 10% year-over-year; and $1.7 billion of free cash flow, up 18% year-over-year; GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income growth of approximately 53% and 31%, respectively; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.05, up 57% year-over-year; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51, up 34% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and non-GAAP gross margins of 30.7%; and total exabyte growth of 29% year-over-year.
I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activity shortly. 
Before I do so, I'd like to address the announcement we made today, in addition to our earnings results, regarding our CFO transition. 
Dave Morton, who has been our CFO for close to 3 years and with the company for over 23 years, has decided to leave Seagate for a senior finance executive role at another company. 
We will be conducting a search for the Chief Financial Officer role, and the board has appointed Kate Scolnick Interim Chief Financial Officer. Kate is a Senior Vice President and the company Treasurer and over the last 6 years has been an integral part of Seagate's senior leadership team. 
On behalf of the management team and the board, we thank Dave Morton for his leadership of the finance organization and his many contributions to our business. 
And I'd also like to thank Kate for taking on increased responsibilities. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."
3738520,573279992,1518636,"Seagate Technology plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-",1075,"Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. 
In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-over-year, and hard disk drive revenues were up 19% year-over-year. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 47.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of approximately 5.3 terabytes per drive, up 54% year-over-year. 
In the nearline market, we shipped 44.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached approximately 7 terabytes per drive, up 43% over last year and up 54% from the June quarter 2 years ago. 
In addition, we saw some intra-quarter upside demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 18% year-over-year exabyte growth with the average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. 
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent and supply remains bit constrained. Our 10TB nearline product was the leading enterprise SKU in the June quarter, and we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12TB nearline product. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the June quarter for nearly all end markets, including PC compute, surveillance, DVR, gaming and network-attached storage. 
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1 terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. 
In the June quarter, these products represented approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue. Non-hard disk drive revenues in the June quarter were $183 million, relatively flat year-over-year. 
Within this, silicon revenues were up 53% year-over-year, and we are bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions. 
We believe that our strategic approach to participating in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth in our business model without the overhang from capital requirements and cyclical market exposure. Cloud systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the planned shaping of our business to optimize the margin structure and business mix. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion was up 18% year-over-year. 
Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 6 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. 
Gross margins in the June quarter were 31.9% on a GAAP basis and 32.4% on a non-GAAP basis and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. 
The sequential upside in gross margins included better mix from our enterprise portfolio, linearity and some product cost benefits. 
Year-over-year, our margins have benefited from the enterprise mix shift in our business, higher capacity points mix shift across the rest of our mass storage solutions portfolio, and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories. 
On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the June quarter were $399 million, down 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and down 5% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Expenses were slightly higher than planned as we had higher variable compensation as a result of better annual performance and some accelerated material spend needed for our future product portfolio.
Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $96 million in the June quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest, highest-capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital.
For the fiscal 2018, capital expenditures were below 4% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and 287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 3, 2018. 
Interest expense for the June quarter was $54 million. During the fiscal year 2018, the company repurchased $214 million of outstanding debt, and our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Our net debt to the last 12 months EBITDA ratio is 1.2x as of June quarter.
In the June quarter, as part of the consortium led by the Bain Private Equity, we finalized our investment of approximately $1.3 billion in the acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. This investment is expected to have a 5% per annum financial return that is intended to be held at maturity over its 6-year life. 
For fiscal 2018, we returned 51% of cash flow from operations to shareholders, slightly above the high end of our long-term model range of 30% to 50%. 
And as we did last quarter, I wanted to provide an updated perspective on the recently enacted and proposed trade actions to increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S., including some of Seagate's storage products. 
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. In response to the tariff changes that took place this month, we are actively working with our affected customers and suppliers to identify and implement minimally disruptive mitigation plans. 
In reference to any additional new duty tax changes that may take effect, we'll be evaluating additional, minimally disruptive mitigation plans for the affected customers and suppliers. 
Going forward, we will update you if there are any conditions that change in our business.
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the June quarter and full fiscal 2018 reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

Strong, global macroeconomic conditions and global investments in IT infrastructure persist, leading to higher cloud data center and edge demand. For Seagate, secular market growth trends in nearline, surveillance and SSD are more than offsetting mature market trends as in -- such as in the compute and mission-critical markets.
Given the current macroeconomic environment and forecast for data growth and related storage spending, we believe we are on pace to demonstrate another year of revenue and profitability growth and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2019. 
To meet the needs of the growing broad base of customers and verticals requiring mass storage solutions, particularly in the cloud environments, we are bringing out a number of new technology enhancements, including multi-actuator designs, security features and application workload advancements specific to cloud customers. 
An important aspect of Seagate's storage portfolio that will accelerate through fiscal 2019 is growing our SSD revenue in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets as we integrate our TMC NAND supply and qualify our products with customers.
These qualifications are going well, and our expectations are to achieve double-digit sequential quarterly revenue growth through the fiscal year. With favorable conditions and continued execution, we now have NAND supply to sustain this rate of growth over the next few years. 
For the September quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth with continued strong enterprise demand and sequential seasonal demand in the compute and gaming markets. We remain bit constrained, and we are working to serve our customers across their portfolio needs as we actively work to optimize our media and heads for our entire mass storage solution product set. 
We expect total revenues in the September quarter to be up approximately 5% sequentially, demonstrating year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. This rate of sequential growth should continue through the December quarter as well.
Cash flow from operations for the September quarter are forecasted to be approximately $500 million, up significantly year-over-year. 
We expect gross margins for the September quarter to be at the midpoint of our 29% to 33% long-term range as we competitively participate in the seasonal demand for HDD gaming, consumer and compute products; continue the ramp to yield our highest-capacity products within our HDD enterprise portfolio; and ramp our SSD business revenue. 
Our vertically integrated factory utilization remains very high. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly and work to align our organization with future opportunities. 
Toward these efforts, we are executing a voluntary retirement plan in the September quarter that is outside of our restructuring activities. This plan will increase our overall operating expenses by approximately 5% sequentially. 
Beyond September, overall operating expenses will then decline to approximately $385 million a quarter, providing further leverage to our fiscal year '19 financial model and at the low end of our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%.
To address the high-capacity mass storage HDD demand signals and the product transitions we have planned for FY '19 and beyond, we are increasing our capital expenditures in the September and December quarters to approximately 6% of revenue. 
For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong fiscal year 2018 results. These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY 2019 and beyond. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

Last quarter was a little bit higher than last couple of quarters, so we're watching it carefully to see if we do need to ratchet that up. But I would consider that market very stable. On the cloud front, there -- a number of different things going on, and I would say the demand continues very strong, strong globally and there's also a mix up over the last couple of years. Many customers who once upon a time were buying 2 and 4 terabytes are now up to 10 and 12 terabytes. So you see, as people continue to do these build-outs, you see the demand for more and more exabytes, which is where we have to chase with our heads and media investment as well. So I don't see that abating in the next 6 months. To some extent, the industry will answer that as much as we can, but I think for the foreseeable future, that's very strong.

So the transition -- as we get more NAND supply online, the transition in some of those existing customers already to just more market share, and maybe a little bit of horizontal proliferation to new customers as well is possible in SAS. NVMe, as we all know, it's fairly new and changing very quickly. So there are a lot of demands for new feature sets. We feel fairly linked in with customers there, and we feel like we have a pretty good product portfolio. So as the market switches to NVMe, especially with enterprise features associated with that, with our customer intimacy, we should do pretty well. There are also other consumer and gaming markets that we'll try to deploy the new assets against, but it really stays -- we really stay focused on enterprise."

It's not just hyper -- a few hyperscale people that are doing massive installs, it's globally happening. The other thing is that these capacity points are driving north. So I think as people are doing the installs, they're not just answering the call of yesterday's data, they're actually -- the data growth is very large, so they want our highest-capacity drives. Just over the last few years, we've seen almost a 40% CAGR. But just -- in this last period that we're in is ticking up.

You see customers who want their specific applications optimized and they're -- they can pick from a plethora of different features that we've developed, arguably, over the years for key OEMs or some of the early movers in the cloud. Now you're starting to see optimization scenarios for some of the growing Tier 2 people and so on. I think what that does is it creates a great business relationship between the companies. It's not necessarily something that drives a lot of increased revenue or anything, other than the fact that it speeds up their transition and makes their data centers more effective so they can get done what they need to get done. Out beyond 6 months from now, it's really hard to tell. I mean, we've all been through these cloud cycles before. And so, I'm maybe a little -- there's a little bit of trepidation always that there is another digestion phase coming.

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the June quarter and fiscal 2018. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter.
I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the June quarter reflect very strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 31.9%; and net income of $461 million. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.57.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32.4%, net income of $475 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.62.
HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 92.9 exabytes, up 49% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.5 terabytes per drive, up 40% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was approximately $72, up 12% year-over-year. 
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were $399 million, with non-GAAP down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. Turning to our full fiscal year 2018 results. Our solid business model execution drove year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and cash flow generation. 
Strong year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments reflects the competitiveness of our mass storage solutions and alignment with the growing demand for data products globally.
For the full fiscal year 2018, Seagate achieved revenue growth of 4% year-over-year; $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations, up 10% year-over-year; and $1.7 billion of free cash flow, up 18% year-over-year; GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income growth of approximately 53% and 31%, respectively; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.05, up 57% year-over-year; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51, up 34% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and non-GAAP gross margins of 30.7%; and total exabyte growth of 29% year-over-year.
I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activity shortly. 
Before I do so, I'd like to address the announcement we made today, in addition to our earnings results, regarding our CFO transition. 
Dave Morton, who has been our CFO for close to 3 years and with the company for over 23 years, has decided to leave Seagate for a senior finance executive role at another company. 
We will be conducting a search for the Chief Financial Officer role, and the board has appointed Kate Scolnick Interim Chief Financial Officer. Kate is a Senior Vice President and the company Treasurer and over the last 6 years has been an integral part of Seagate's senior leadership team. 
On behalf of the management team and the board, we thank Dave Morton for his leadership of the finance organization and his many contributions to our business. 
And I'd also like to thank Kate for taking on increased responsibilities. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."
3738520,573279992,1518846,"Seagate Technology plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-",1075,"Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. 
In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-over-year, and hard disk drive revenues were up 19% year-over-year. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 47.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of approximately 5.3 terabytes per drive, up 54% year-over-year. 
In the nearline market, we shipped 44.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached approximately 7 terabytes per drive, up 43% over last year and up 54% from the June quarter 2 years ago. 
In addition, we saw some intra-quarter upside demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 18% year-over-year exabyte growth with the average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. 
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent and supply remains bit constrained. Our 10TB nearline product was the leading enterprise SKU in the June quarter, and we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12TB nearline product. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the June quarter for nearly all end markets, including PC compute, surveillance, DVR, gaming and network-attached storage. 
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1 terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. 
In the June quarter, these products represented approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue. Non-hard disk drive revenues in the June quarter were $183 million, relatively flat year-over-year. 
Within this, silicon revenues were up 53% year-over-year, and we are bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions. 
We believe that our strategic approach to participating in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth in our business model without the overhang from capital requirements and cyclical market exposure. Cloud systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the planned shaping of our business to optimize the margin structure and business mix. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion was up 18% year-over-year. 
Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 6 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. 
Gross margins in the June quarter were 31.9% on a GAAP basis and 32.4% on a non-GAAP basis and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. 
The sequential upside in gross margins included better mix from our enterprise portfolio, linearity and some product cost benefits. 
Year-over-year, our margins have benefited from the enterprise mix shift in our business, higher capacity points mix shift across the rest of our mass storage solutions portfolio, and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories. 
On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the June quarter were $399 million, down 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and down 5% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Expenses were slightly higher than planned as we had higher variable compensation as a result of better annual performance and some accelerated material spend needed for our future product portfolio.
Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $96 million in the June quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest, highest-capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital.
For the fiscal 2018, capital expenditures were below 4% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and 287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 3, 2018. 
Interest expense for the June quarter was $54 million. During the fiscal year 2018, the company repurchased $214 million of outstanding debt, and our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Our net debt to the last 12 months EBITDA ratio is 1.2x as of June quarter.
In the June quarter, as part of the consortium led by the Bain Private Equity, we finalized our investment of approximately $1.3 billion in the acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. This investment is expected to have a 5% per annum financial return that is intended to be held at maturity over its 6-year life. 
For fiscal 2018, we returned 51% of cash flow from operations to shareholders, slightly above the high end of our long-term model range of 30% to 50%. 
And as we did last quarter, I wanted to provide an updated perspective on the recently enacted and proposed trade actions to increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S., including some of Seagate's storage products. 
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. In response to the tariff changes that took place this month, we are actively working with our affected customers and suppliers to identify and implement minimally disruptive mitigation plans. 
In reference to any additional new duty tax changes that may take effect, we'll be evaluating additional, minimally disruptive mitigation plans for the affected customers and suppliers. 
Going forward, we will update you if there are any conditions that change in our business.
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the June quarter and full fiscal 2018 reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

Strong, global macroeconomic conditions and global investments in IT infrastructure persist, leading to higher cloud data center and edge demand. For Seagate, secular market growth trends in nearline, surveillance and SSD are more than offsetting mature market trends as in -- such as in the compute and mission-critical markets.
Given the current macroeconomic environment and forecast for data growth and related storage spending, we believe we are on pace to demonstrate another year of revenue and profitability growth and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2019. 
To meet the needs of the growing broad base of customers and verticals requiring mass storage solutions, particularly in the cloud environments, we are bringing out a number of new technology enhancements, including multi-actuator designs, security features and application workload advancements specific to cloud customers. 
An important aspect of Seagate's storage portfolio that will accelerate through fiscal 2019 is growing our SSD revenue in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets as we integrate our TMC NAND supply and qualify our products with customers.
These qualifications are going well, and our expectations are to achieve double-digit sequential quarterly revenue growth through the fiscal year. With favorable conditions and continued execution, we now have NAND supply to sustain this rate of growth over the next few years. 
For the September quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth with continued strong enterprise demand and sequential seasonal demand in the compute and gaming markets. We remain bit constrained, and we are working to serve our customers across their portfolio needs as we actively work to optimize our media and heads for our entire mass storage solution product set. 
We expect total revenues in the September quarter to be up approximately 5% sequentially, demonstrating year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. This rate of sequential growth should continue through the December quarter as well.
Cash flow from operations for the September quarter are forecasted to be approximately $500 million, up significantly year-over-year. 
We expect gross margins for the September quarter to be at the midpoint of our 29% to 33% long-term range as we competitively participate in the seasonal demand for HDD gaming, consumer and compute products; continue the ramp to yield our highest-capacity products within our HDD enterprise portfolio; and ramp our SSD business revenue. 
Our vertically integrated factory utilization remains very high. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly and work to align our organization with future opportunities. 
Toward these efforts, we are executing a voluntary retirement plan in the September quarter that is outside of our restructuring activities. This plan will increase our overall operating expenses by approximately 5% sequentially. 
Beyond September, overall operating expenses will then decline to approximately $385 million a quarter, providing further leverage to our fiscal year '19 financial model and at the low end of our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%.
To address the high-capacity mass storage HDD demand signals and the product transitions we have planned for FY '19 and beyond, we are increasing our capital expenditures in the September and December quarters to approximately 6% of revenue. 
For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong fiscal year 2018 results. These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY 2019 and beyond. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

Last quarter was a little bit higher than last couple of quarters, so we're watching it carefully to see if we do need to ratchet that up. But I would consider that market very stable. On the cloud front, there -- a number of different things going on, and I would say the demand continues very strong, strong globally and there's also a mix up over the last couple of years. Many customers who once upon a time were buying 2 and 4 terabytes are now up to 10 and 12 terabytes. So you see, as people continue to do these build-outs, you see the demand for more and more exabytes, which is where we have to chase with our heads and media investment as well. So I don't see that abating in the next 6 months. To some extent, the industry will answer that as much as we can, but I think for the foreseeable future, that's very strong.

So the transition -- as we get more NAND supply online, the transition in some of those existing customers already to just more market share, and maybe a little bit of horizontal proliferation to new customers as well is possible in SAS. NVMe, as we all know, it's fairly new and changing very quickly. So there are a lot of demands for new feature sets. We feel fairly linked in with customers there, and we feel like we have a pretty good product portfolio. So as the market switches to NVMe, especially with enterprise features associated with that, with our customer intimacy, we should do pretty well. There are also other consumer and gaming markets that we'll try to deploy the new assets against, but it really stays -- we really stay focused on enterprise."

For today's earnings call, I will cover the high-level results from the June quarter and fiscal 2018. Our CFO, Dave Morton, will then discuss certain financial highlights, and I will close the call with our outlook for the September quarter.
I am pleased to report Seagate's financial results for the June quarter reflect very strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. We achieved revenues of $2.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 31.9%; and net income of $461 million. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.57.
On a non-GAAP basis, Seagate achieved gross margins of 32.4%, net income of $475 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.62.
HDD exabyte shipments for the June quarter were 92.9 exabytes, up 49% year-over-year. The average capacity per drive across the HDD portfolio was a record 2.5 terabytes per drive, up 40% year-over-year. And the average selling price per unit was approximately $72, up 12% year-over-year. 
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were $399 million, with non-GAAP down 5% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. Turning to our full fiscal year 2018 results. Our solid business model execution drove year-over-year growth in revenue, profitability and cash flow generation. 
Strong year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments reflects the competitiveness of our mass storage solutions and alignment with the growing demand for data products globally.
For the full fiscal year 2018, Seagate achieved revenue growth of 4% year-over-year; $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations, up 10% year-over-year; and $1.7 billion of free cash flow, up 18% year-over-year; GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income growth of approximately 53% and 31%, respectively; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.05, up 57% year-over-year; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.51, up 34% year-over-year; GAAP gross margins of 30.1% and non-GAAP gross margins of 30.7%; and total exabyte growth of 29% year-over-year.
I'll turn the call over to Dave Morton to go into more depth on our operational activity shortly. 
Before I do so, I'd like to address the announcement we made today, in addition to our earnings results, regarding our CFO transition. 
Dave Morton, who has been our CFO for close to 3 years and with the company for over 23 years, has decided to leave Seagate for a senior finance executive role at another company. 
We will be conducting a search for the Chief Financial Officer role, and the board has appointed Kate Scolnick Interim Chief Financial Officer. Kate is a Senior Vice President and the company Treasurer and over the last 6 years has been an integral part of Seagate's senior leadership team. 
On behalf of the management team and the board, we thank Dave Morton for his leadership of the finance organization and his many contributions to our business. 
And I'd also like to thank Kate for taking on increased responsibilities. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."
3738520,573279992,1519842,"Seagate Technology plc, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2018",2018-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Seagate Technology Holdings plc","Executives","Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-",1075,"Thanks, Dave. For the June quarter, our operational results reflect year-over-year growth in revenues, profitability and exabyte shipments. We executed well this quarter against strong market demand. 
In the June quarter, total revenues were up 18% year-over-year, and hard disk drive revenues were up 19% year-over-year. 
The growth in hyperscale and cloud storage deployments continues to represent an important opportunity for Seagate, and we are confident in our nearline hard disk drive portfolio designed to serve these environments. 
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped a record 47.2 exabytes with a record average capacity of approximately 5.3 terabytes per drive, up 54% year-over-year. 
In the nearline market, we shipped 44.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive reached approximately 7 terabytes per drive, up 43% over last year and up 54% from the June quarter 2 years ago. 
In addition, we saw some intra-quarter upside demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 18% year-over-year exabyte growth with the average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. 
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand continues to be extremely persistent and supply remains bit constrained. Our 10TB nearline product was the leading enterprise SKU in the June quarter, and we achieved significant sequential volume and revenue growth in our 12TB nearline product. 
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in the June quarter for nearly all end markets, including PC compute, surveillance, DVR, gaming and network-attached storage. 
At the same time, we are actively minimizing our exposure to the sub-1 terabyte client consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. 
In the June quarter, these products represented approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue. Non-hard disk drive revenues in the June quarter were $183 million, relatively flat year-over-year. 
Within this, silicon revenues were up 53% year-over-year, and we are bullish about our opportunities to leverage our supply agreement with Toshiba Memory Corporation as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon product portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets for significant revenue growth and expanding margin contributions. 
We believe that our strategic approach to participating in the silicon market allows us to address customer storage portfolio needs and provide for profitable revenue growth in our business model without the overhang from capital requirements and cyclical market exposure. Cloud systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year, primarily due to the planned shaping of our business to optimize the margin structure and business mix. 
Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $468 million, and free cash flow was $372 million. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion was up 18% year-over-year. 
Our cash conversion cycle for the June quarter was 6 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. 
Gross margins in the June quarter were 31.9% on a GAAP basis and 32.4% on a non-GAAP basis and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. 
The sequential upside in gross margins included better mix from our enterprise portfolio, linearity and some product cost benefits. 
Year-over-year, our margins have benefited from the enterprise mix shift in our business, higher capacity points mix shift across the rest of our mass storage solutions portfolio, and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories. 
On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, operating expenses for the June quarter were $399 million, down 15% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and down 5% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. 
Expenses were slightly higher than planned as we had higher variable compensation as a result of better annual performance and some accelerated material spend needed for our future product portfolio.
Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $96 million in the June quarter, which support the continued ramping of our newest, highest-capacity hard disk drive products and maintenance capital.
For the fiscal 2018, capital expenditures were below 4% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the June quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and 287 million ordinary shares outstanding. Our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the June quarter, which will be payable on October 3, 2018. 
Interest expense for the June quarter was $54 million. During the fiscal year 2018, the company repurchased $214 million of outstanding debt, and our debt structure and level of interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Our net debt to the last 12 months EBITDA ratio is 1.2x as of June quarter.
In the June quarter, as part of the consortium led by the Bain Private Equity, we finalized our investment of approximately $1.3 billion in the acquisition of the Toshiba Memory Corporation. This investment is expected to have a 5% per annum financial return that is intended to be held at maturity over its 6-year life. 
For fiscal 2018, we returned 51% of cash flow from operations to shareholders, slightly above the high end of our long-term model range of 30% to 50%. 
And as we did last quarter, I wanted to provide an updated perspective on the recently enacted and proposed trade actions to increase tariffs on some products imported into the U.S., including some of Seagate's storage products. 
As a global technology company, Seagate has decades of experience in managing complex global supply chains and technology manufacturing operations in nearly every region. In response to the tariff changes that took place this month, we are actively working with our affected customers and suppliers to identify and implement minimally disruptive mitigation plans. 
In reference to any additional new duty tax changes that may take effect, we'll be evaluating additional, minimally disruptive mitigation plans for the affected customers and suppliers. 
Going forward, we will update you if there are any conditions that change in our business.
Overall, our operational and financial performance in the June quarter and full fiscal 2018 reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I would now like to turn the call back to Dave Mosley."

Strong, global macroeconomic conditions and global investments in IT infrastructure persist, leading to higher cloud data center and edge demand. For Seagate, secular market growth trends in nearline, surveillance and SSD are more than offsetting mature market trends as in -- such as in the compute and mission-critical markets.
Given the current macroeconomic environment and forecast for data growth and related storage spending, we believe we are on pace to demonstrate another year of revenue and profitability growth and strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2019. 
To meet the needs of the growing broad base of customers and verticals requiring mass storage solutions, particularly in the cloud environments, we are bringing out a number of new technology enhancements, including multi-actuator designs, security features and application workload advancements specific to cloud customers. 
An important aspect of Seagate's storage portfolio that will accelerate through fiscal 2019 is growing our SSD revenue in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets as we integrate our TMC NAND supply and qualify our products with customers.
These qualifications are going well, and our expectations are to achieve double-digit sequential quarterly revenue growth through the fiscal year. With favorable conditions and continued execution, we now have NAND supply to sustain this rate of growth over the next few years. 
For the September quarter, we anticipate year-over-year revenue, exabyte and profitability growth with continued strong enterprise demand and sequential seasonal demand in the compute and gaming markets. We remain bit constrained, and we are working to serve our customers across their portfolio needs as we actively work to optimize our media and heads for our entire mass storage solution product set. 
We expect total revenues in the September quarter to be up approximately 5% sequentially, demonstrating year-over-year revenue growth of over 10%. This rate of sequential growth should continue through the December quarter as well.
Cash flow from operations for the September quarter are forecasted to be approximately $500 million, up significantly year-over-year. 
We expect gross margins for the September quarter to be at the midpoint of our 29% to 33% long-term range as we competitively participate in the seasonal demand for HDD gaming, consumer and compute products; continue the ramp to yield our highest-capacity products within our HDD enterprise portfolio; and ramp our SSD business revenue. 
Our vertically integrated factory utilization remains very high. We continue to manage our day-to-day operating expenses tightly and work to align our organization with future opportunities. 
Toward these efforts, we are executing a voluntary retirement plan in the September quarter that is outside of our restructuring activities. This plan will increase our overall operating expenses by approximately 5% sequentially. 
Beyond September, overall operating expenses will then decline to approximately $385 million a quarter, providing further leverage to our fiscal year '19 financial model and at the low end of our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%.
To address the high-capacity mass storage HDD demand signals and the product transitions we have planned for FY '19 and beyond, we are increasing our capital expenditures in the September and December quarters to approximately 6% of revenue. 
For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong fiscal year 2018 results. These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY 2019 and beyond. 
Thank you for joining us on the call today, and we'll now open up the call for questions and answers."

So just wonder whether you can comment on what you see over the next 6 months from both the mission-critical business, where you saw upside, as well as whether you're seeing any softening in cloud demand. And then just as a follow-on to that, 3 months ago, you talked about better seasonal volumes as well as the ramp of high-cap and SSD new products helping margins in the back half, but it doesn't sound like you expect sequential improvement as you go into the September quarter, so just wondering if anything has changed on that front."

On the cloud front, there -- a number of different things going on, and I would say the demand continues very strong, strong globally and there's also a mix up over the last couple of years. Many customers who once upon a time were buying 2 and 4 terabytes are now up to 10 and 12 terabytes. So you see, as people continue to do these build-outs, you see the demand for more and more exabytes, which is where we have to chase with our heads and media investment as well. So I don't see that abating in the next 6 months. To some extent, the industry will answer that as much as we can, but I think for the foreseeable future, that's very strong.

NVMe, as we all know, it's fairly new and changing very quickly. So there are a lot of demands for new feature sets. We feel fairly linked in with customers there, and we feel like we have a pretty good product portfolio.

You see customers who want their specific applications optimized and they're -- they can pick from a plethora of different features that we've developed, arguably, over the years for key OEMs or some of the early movers in the cloud. Now you're starting to see optimization scenarios for some of the growing Tier 2 people and so on. I think what that does is it creates a great business relationship between the companies. It's not necessarily something that drives a lot of increased revenue or anything, other than the fact that it speeds up their transition and makes their data centers more effective so they can get done what they need to get done. Out beyond 6 months from now, it's really hard to tell. I mean, we've all been through these cloud cycles before. And so, I'm maybe a little -- there's a little bit of trepidation always that there is another digestion phase coming.

Kate Scolnick, our Interim Chief Financial Officer will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the December quarter. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. For the September quarter, Seagate delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth; 78% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP net income and 148% year-over-year growth in cash flow from operations. These strong results were driven by a 41% year-over-year growth in exabytes shipments, reflecting persistent, global data growth trends and demand for Seagate's mass storage solutions. As data-centric applications continue to proliferate inside the global digital economy, strong exabyte growth will continue and mobile market for the next decade. Seagate is a critical supplier to the company's institutions and entrepreneurs that are driving value from the mass of our opportunity in Big Data analytics, AI, smart cities, machine learning and other cloud-based architectures. Additionally, our edge product portfolio is delivering tremendous value to a growing consumer landscape in video content creation and analytics, best represented in the gaming and entertainment arenas. Developing our product portfolio to intercept these trends as it resulted in an exact wide growth over the past several years and we expect these trends to continue. We are leveraging of our 40-year history of innovation in the storage industry to introduce new precision engineered technology advancements, including multi-actuator designs, security, video, and cloud-specific feature sets, all to meet economical next-generation capacity and performance requirements for our customers. In September, we launched the industry's broadest portfolio of 14 terabytes hard drives for [indiscernible], desktop, surveillance and hyperscale data center applications. This purchase-built portfolio empowers customers to consume, manage and utilize digital data more effectively and efficiently while establishing new benchmarks in speed and capacity. Consistent with this Drive to innovate, we're scheduled to deliver 16 terabyte capacity solutions for the nearline market in the first half of calendar 2019. These products will use conventional magnetic recording and have product variance that overtime can reach marginally higher capacity points, using forms of shingles magnetic recordings. As always, we are focused on specific customer requirements and feature sets to give optimal application response in the varying cloud workloads. At the same time, in leveraging the same platform, we have produced 16 terabyte drives using our heater system or HAMR technology. The HAMR system is capable of much higher density points, having now shown development progress towards 2.25 terabit per square inch at the component level, twice the density of what is shipping today. We expect to ship samples of the HAMR units to critical customers for evaluation in early calendar 2019 and then grow beyond 20 terabytes per drive in calendar 2020. Before we turn to the September financials, I'd like to comment on the near-term cloud demand in NAND market environments. Relative to cloud demand, recall that in FY '18, the HDD industry experienced strong growth in enterprise mass storage product demand with nearly HDD exabyte growth of over 60% year-over-year, well above the 5% average compound annual growth rate of 35% to 40%. This growth was primarily led by the global public cloud service providers. We also experienced good demand from the traditional storage OEMs that are deploying hybrid and private cloud solutions. Over the course of the last fiscal year, we effectively monetized the growth opportunities and introduced new products to our portfolio. As demonstrated over the last 5 years, the exabyte growth from public fire service providers continues to accelerate. We also see, however, in our [indiscernible] period of digestion is very strong buying patterns from large-scale customers will dampen in order to build through existing inventory before proceeding. One of these digestion cycles began in earnest in late Q1, FY '19. And our best estimate is that it may last for up to 3 quarters. In addition, we are seeing some enterprise spending caution in the China market. For Seagate specifically these demand disruptions fall in the middle of numerous product transitions with customers for our 12 terabyte and 14 terabyte nearline products where we have not executed as crisply as we'd wanted. We will be taking the opportunity to improve our processes in this lower demand environment so that we are positioned for stronger execution when the demand returns. While indications of CSP digestion phase along with other supply-chain disruptions have decreased the market outlook for nearline HDD addressable market in fiscal 2019. We are confident that as in the past, demand will resume at a higher growth rate beyond this digestion phase, driven by unabated data -- rate of data creation and growth in cloud applications. We believe we are on the front end of long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing cloud computing workloads will remain within the top priorities for CIOs. Now turning to the NAND market. As pricing headwinds and oversupply dynamics process, we remain committed to our strategic approach to grow our participation in the silicon market and address our customer's storage needs without the overhang from capital requirements in significant cyclical market exposure. In the September quarter, we delivered strong sequential revenue growth and began qualifying in shipping selective products with TMC NAND. Along with the rest of the market, we have increased caution over the near-term pricing environment and we are taking some defensive measures, but believe in our opportunities to grow this area of our business overtime. Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution for Seagate. And we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for profitable revenue growth opportunities in all of the markets we serve, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. Now I'll turn the call over to Kate to go into more depth on our financial performance."

We achieved revenue of $3 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially, consistent with our expectations. Hard disk drive revenues were 17% year-over-year and we are confident that our portfolio is well positioned to monetize cost-effective storage demand. For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped 45.5 exabytes of 67% year-over-year. In the nearline market, we shipped 42.5 exabytes in our average capacity per drive exceeded 7 terabytes per drive, up 30% over last year and up 52% from the September quarter 2 years ago. In addition, we saw stronger-than-expected demand for our the mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 42% year-over-year exabyte growth with average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. Cloud-based enterprise storage demand in the September quarter demonstrated strong year-over-year growth but was slightly lower than we anticipated, sequentially. As the nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Our 10 terabyte nearline product continues to be the leading enterprise revenues SKU for Seagate, and we achieved significant sequential volume in revenue growth in our 12 terabyte nearline product. Our highest capacity 14 terabyte product also started shipping this quarter. In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth in increase average capacity per drive for nearly all end markets in the September quarter, including desktops, surveillance, DDR, gaming, network-attached storage and consumer. In our mature markets, we remain active in minimizing our exposure to the sub-1 terabyte client, consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage where we have or are developing portfolio offerings. In the September quarter, these products represented less than 6% of consolidated revenue. Non-hard disk drive revenues in the September quarter were $190 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cost system products and some intra-quarter supply chain challenges where we could not we demand for some products. Silicon revenues were up 38% year-over-year and 26%, sequentially. We are bullish about our long-term opportunities to grow revenue and market recognition as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets. We are mindful of the new pricing dynamics. And we are managing our business with incremental caution to continue to grow revenue in a competitive manner. In the September quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, consistent with our expectations and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. The sequential change reflected better-than-anticipated product and customer mix, benign pricing and offset by reserve associated with the rapid decline in NAND market prices. Year-over-year non-GAAP margin improved approximately 200 basis points, benefiting from the mix shift to higher margin mass storage products and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $382 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4%, sequentially. Expenses were lower, sequentially, primarily due to overall operating efficiency and lower share-based in variable compensation. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.70, up 77% year-over-year and was reflecting a better demand environment for our mass storage solution and higher factory utilization. Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $587 million and free cash flow was $410 million compared with $113 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures come on a cash basis were approximately $177 million in the September quarter or 6% of total revenue. Our balance sheet remains healthy. And we ended the September quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $286 million ordinary shares outstanding. In the September quarter, we redeemed 3 million shares to offset stock or dilution and our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 2, 2019. The company's debt balance as of the September quarter is $4.8 billion, interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. Seagate's net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the September quarter. In the December quarter, we expect to retire the remaining November 2018 debt of approximately $499 million. The cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 8 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand. And one final housekeeping item. Effective June 30, 2018, we adopted a new revenue recognition policy in accordance with accounting standard codification, 606, revenue from contracts of customers using the modified retrospective mattered. The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the company's condensed consolidated financial statements for the September 2018 quarter was not material. Overall, our financial performance in September quarter reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for our outlook."

As many other IT companies have noted in their recent earnings reports, we are exercising caution in our immediate forecast due to political, regulatory and foreign exchange uncertainty around certain areas of the world. As in the past, we believe these [indiscernible] to be temporary. And we will still see fairly healthy exabyte demand in most markets in the December quarter. As I outlined earlier, we anticipate nearline HDD demand will decline sequentially from Q1 due to a immediate drops in demand with most of the cloud service providers and given some uncertainty in the China enterprise marketplace. Previously, we were not forecasting these dynamics to occur in Q2 and we are adjusting our billed plans accordingly. We anticipate as market demand to be mostly consistent with the higher seasonal demand for consumer products and lower seasonal volumes for gaming consoles. Our non-HDD revenues are forecast to be relatively flat to quarter-to-quarter for systems. And our SSD revenues will be up double digits, sequentially. We expect total revenues in the December quarter to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion. As always, we will consider intra-quarter upside opportunities that makes sense for our long-term portfolio profitability. We expect gross margins for the December quarter to be at the low end of our 29% to 33% long-term range, primarily reflecting the lower demand for nearline HDDs. Operating expenses will be relatively flat, sequentially, and we are actively implementing incremental expense controls. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15% even in this challenging environment. Capital expenditures will remain at approximately 6% of revenue to support product transitions that we have planned for later in FY '19 and beyond. For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain slightly below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue. In closing, it's been a while since we specifically addressed our capital allocation strategy with investors. And I wanted to highlight a few of the key elements of our framework. Seagate has demonstrated a commitment to deliver long-term value for shareholders, and we remain committed to a capital allocation framework that maximizes returns. We are confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years. And as we leverage our mass storage portfolio for existing and new market opportunities, as announced today, we in addition to approving the quarterly dividend, Seagate's Board of Directors has approved a new share redemption authorization that will enable us to redeem up to $3 billion of ordinary shares. The increase in authorization reflects the confidence of the board and the executive team in Seagate's ability to generate cash, while still investing in innovation and growth opportunities. Seagate has consistently returned over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend and share redemption set, and we remain committed to doing so over the long term. I strongly believe, our creep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will continue to drive long-term success for the company to deliver value for our shareholders. I'd like to thank of our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong first quarter cash fiscal first quarter results. These efforts at Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY '2019 and beyond. The September quarter has put it on a stable trajectory for FY '19, and we will maximize our efforts to operate efficiently through the fiscal year.

There are long lead times of internal components, of course, and some of the external components we have to procure. So those are 2 interlocks with the customers. I think those generally go pretty well. This recent demand fallout happened fairly systemically, many, many different accounts we talk about. And basically -- quickly. it was -- wasn't something that we'd ever seen as with you before. So in this typical digestion phases, I think this one was fairly pronounced. I think long-term, the growth in the cloud is still there -- still very strong. And qualification cycles will come back really strong at the next capacity points as those higher and higher capacity points offer better TCO propositions for them. But the ability to forecast the tactical reductions and things like that. It's still not where we wanted to be. Are there other things that we can be doing longer term? I think so. Our portfolio is fairly complex. And I talked about that a little bit in my comments. And so I think simply find the portfolio a little bit will allow us a little bit more flexibility. We just got in the middle of this product transitions and that was in option this time. But I think will make progress on that next time."

I think some of those techniques that they're using have diminishing returns. I do think that the buying patterns was so strong that there is a probably a little bit of overbuying. And so that you'll have to wait at certain accounts will go through that inventory. The root of the problem -- I talked about the last problem that we had in the -- that last digestion phase, if you will, that largely came because there were a lot of changes in component pricing quickly. And the changes in component pricing really puts under the builders upside down. I think this was a little bit different. But it does have to do with supply chain's being a little broken right now for many components. And I think we're going to get through it fairly quickly as well. I don't think it so much about those efficiency gains right now, Joe. That's my read from today. And I do think that there's some elements of hard drive availability at 12 terabytes. They know 16 terabytes are coming, they see the TCO proposition of those new capacity points and things like that, that may actually delay through these periods as well. So we factor all these things in. To your point of exactly on how big is this one relative to the last one. So our baseline that we believe we're hitting as an industry is higher than the last digestion phase. And that one was higher than the previous digestion phase. So -- but then the run-up that we have to prepare for is barely profound. And you've seen that in our financial as we come out of those digestion phase and go back into growth phases. So as far as predictability, I wish we could be better at it. But I think there's a lot of economic factors and other things that are playing in. We're just going to do the smart things through this digestion phase and get onto the -- and be prepared for the growth when it comes."

But you can see it in the revenue projections right now and how impactful it is to us. I would say that as far as visibility, I think this is the question that Karl or Joe asked earlier as well. My sense is that there is not a whole lot of visibility to this early. So some people have claimed that they saw this coming 3 months ago or 4 months ago. I don't see it as much and talking to the customers. I don't believe that they did as well. They saw signals and then they backed of some of their plans. We stay tied with them. And they our -- we trust those conversations are pretty good over the long haul that ultimately this amount going to come back and like I said before, the -- there'll be back probably looking for the higher capacity drives because those are better value propositions in their data centers figure think about it. If you're going to make an investment and data centers, you want to use highest capacity as you can and put those -- plug those drives in for 5 years. That's the best TCO proposition you can find. So they have to manage those transitions as well. And I think as we all take a little pause here that we're going to look to align that way and get ready for the next plug."

During today's call, we will review the highlights for the September quarter, provide the company's outlook for December quarter and then open the call for questions.
We are planning for the call today to go approximately 30 minutes, and we'll do our best to accommodate your questions following our prepared remarks as time permits.
For December quarter, we will like to note that our quiet period will begin on December 17. On our call today, we will refer to GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP figures are reconciled to GAAP figures in our earnings release for our September 2018 quarter, which is posted on our website and has been furnished on our Form 8-K that was filed with the SEC. We have not reconciled our non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted.
Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. As a reminder, this conference call contains forward-looking statements about the company's anticipated future operating and financial performance; customer market demand in the current macroeconomic environment; industry growth and trends; our technology and product shipments, development advancements; and our ability to achieve volume shipments for new products in 2019; demand for our products; continuity of access to long-term NAND supply; the expected return on our investments; ability to execute our road map and address supply constraints for maintaining an agile manufacturing footprint; potential impact of trade barriers, such as import/export duties and restrictions, tariffs and quotas; and the general market conditions.
These forward-looking statements are based on management's current views and assumptions and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning our risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results to differ from these forward-looking statements are contained in the company's SEC filings and supplemental information posted on the Investors section of the company website.

Kate Scolnick, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the December quarter.
Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
For the September quarter, Seagate delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth, 78% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP net income and 148% year-over-year growth in cash flow from operations. These strong results were driven by a 41% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments, reflecting persistent, global data growth trends and demand for Seagate's mass storage solutions.
As data-centric applications continue to proliferate inside the global digital economy, strong exabyte growth trends will continue in multiple markets for the next decade. Seagate is a critical supplier to the company's institutions and entrepreneurs that are driving value from the mass of opportunity in Big Data analytics, AI, smart cities, machine learning and other cloud-based architectures.
Additionally, our edge product portfolio is delivering tremendous value to a growing consumer landscape in video content creation and analytics, best represented in the gaming and entertainment arenas. Developing our product portfolio to intercept these trends has resulted in strong exabyte growth over the past several years, and we expect these trends to continue.
We are leveraging of our 40-year history of innovation in the storage industry to introduce new, precision-engineered technology advancements, including multi-actuator designs, security, video, and cloud-specific feature sets, all to meet economical next-generation capacity and performance requirements for our customers.
In September, we launched the industry's broadest portfolio of 14-terabyte hard drives for NAS, desktop surveillance and hyperscale data center applications. This purpose-built portfolio empowers customers to consume, manage and utilize digital data more effectively and efficiently while establishing new benchmarks in speed and capacity. Consistent with this drive to innovate, we are scheduled to deliver 16-terabyte capacity solutions for the nearline market in the first half of calendar 2019. These products will use conventional magnetic recording and have product variance that over time can reach marginally higher capacity points, using forms of shingled magnetic recordings.
As always, we are focused on specific customer requirements and feature sets to give optimal application response in the varying cloud workloads. At the same time, in leveraging the same platform, we have produced 16-terabyte drives using our heat-assisted, or HAMR technology. The HAMR system is capable of much higher density points, having now shown development progress towards 2.25 terabit per square inch at the component level, twice the density of what is shipping today. We expect to ship samples of the HAMR units to critical customers for evaluation in early calendar 2019 and then grow beyond 20 terabytes per drive in calendar 2020.
Before we turn to the September financials, I'd like to comment on the near-term cloud demand and NAND market environments. Relative to cloud demand, recall that in FY '18, the HDD industry experienced strong growth in enterprise mass storage product demand with nearly HDD exabyte growth of over 60% year-over-year, well above the 5% average compound annual growth rate of 35% to 40%. This growth was primarily led by the global public cloud service providers. We also experienced good demand from the traditional storage OEMs that are deploying hybrid and private cloud solutions.
Over the course of the last fiscal year, we effectively monetized the growth opportunities and introduced new products to our portfolio. As demonstrated over the last 5 years, the exabyte growth from public file service providers continues to accelerate. We also see, however, intermittent periods of digestion where strong buying patterns from large-scale customers will dampen in order to build through existing inventory before proceeding. One of these digestion cycles began in earnest in late Q1, FY '19. And our best estimate is that it may last for up to 3 quarters.
In addition, we are seeing some enterprise spending caution in the China market. For Seagate specifically, these demand disruptions fall in the middle of numerous product transitions with customers for our 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte nearline products, where we have not executed as crisply as we'd wanted. We will be taking the opportunity to improve our processes in this lower demand environment so that we are positioned for stronger execution when the demand returns. While indications of CSP digestion phase along with other supply-chain disruptions have decreased the market outlook for nearline HDD addressable market in fiscal 2019, we are confident that, as in the past, demand will resume at a higher growth rate beyond this digestion phase, driven by unabated data -- rate of data creation and growth in cloud applications.
We believe we are on the front end of a long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing cloud computing workloads will remain within the top priorities for CIOs.
Now turning to the NAND market. As pricing headwinds and oversupply dynamics persist, we remain committed to our strategic approach to grow our participation in the silicon market and address our customers' storage needs without the overhang from capital requirements and significant cyclical market exposure.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong sequential revenue growth and began qualifying and shipping selective products with TMC NAND. Along with the rest of the market, we have increased caution over the near-term pricing environment, and we are taking some defensive measures but believe in our opportunities to grow this area of our business over time.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution for Seagate. And we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for profitable revenue growth opportunities in all of the markets we serve, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kate to go into more depth on our financial performance."

Hard disk drive revenues were 17% year-over-y",827,"Thank you, Dave. Seagate executed well in the September quarter against strong market demands. We achieved revenue of $3 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, consistent with our expectations. Hard disk drive revenues were 17% year-over-year, and we are confident that our portfolio is well positioned to monetize cost-effective storage demand.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped 45.5 exabytes, up 67% year-over-year. In the nearline market, we shipped 42.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 7 terabytes per drive, up 30% over last year and up 52% from the September quarter 2 years ago.
In addition, we saw stronger-than-expected demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 42% year-over-year exabyte growth with average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. Cloud-based enterprise storage demand in the September quarter demonstrated strong year-over-year growth but was slightly lower than we anticipated sequentially.
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Our 10-terabyte nearline product continues to be the leading enterprise revenue SKU for Seagate, and we achieved significant sequential volume in revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product. Our highest-capacity, 14-terabyte product also started shipping this quarter.
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for nearly all end markets in the September quarter, including desktops, surveillance, DDR, gaming, network-attached storage and consumer.
In our mature markets, we remain active in minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte client, consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings.
In the September quarter, these products represented less than 6% of consolidated revenue.
Non-hard disk drive revenues in the September quarter were $190 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products and some intra-quarter supply chain challenges where we could not meet demand for some products.
Silicon revenues were up 38% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. We are bullish about our long-term opportunities to grow revenue and market recognition as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets. We are mindful of the NAND pricing dynamics. And we are managing our business with incremental caution to continue to grow revenue in a competitive manner.
In the September quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, consistent with our expectations and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. The sequential change reflected better-than-anticipated product and customer mix, benign pricing and offset by reserve associated with the rapid decline in NAND market prices. Year-over-year non-GAAP margin improved approximately 200 basis points, benefiting from the mix shift to higher-margin mass storage products and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $382 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower sequentially, primarily due to overall operating efficiency and lower share-based and variable compensation. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.70, up 77% year-over-year and reflecting a better demand environment for our mass storage solutions and higher factory utilization. Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $587 million, and free cash flow was $410 million compared with $113 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $177 million in the September quarter or 6% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. And we ended the September quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 286 million ordinary shares outstanding. In the September quarter, we redeemed 3 million shares to offset stock or dilution, and our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 2, 2019.
The company's debt balance as of the September quarter is $4.8 billion. Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Seagate's net debt-to-last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the September quarter. In the December quarter, we expect to retire the remaining November 2018 debt of approximately $499 million. The cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 8 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand.
And one final housekeeping item. Effective June 30, 2018, we adopted a new revenue recognition policy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 revenue from contracts of customers using the modified retrospective method. The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the company's condensed, consolidated financial statements for the September 2018 quarter was not material.
Overall, our financial performance in the September quarter reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I'll now turn the call back to Dave for our outlook."

As many other IT companies have noted in their recent earnings reports, we are exercising caution in our immediate forecast due to political, regulatory and foreign exchange uncertainty around certain areas of the world. As in the past, we believe these perturbations to be temporary. And we will still see fairly healthy exabyte demand in most markets in the December quarter.
As I outlined earlier, we anticipate nearline HDD demand will decline sequentially from Q1 due to immediate drops in demand with most of the cloud service providers and given some uncertainty in the China enterprise marketplace. Previously, we were not forecasting these dynamics to occur in Q2. And we are adjusting our build plans accordingly.
We anticipate edge market demand to be mostly consistent with higher seasonal demand for consumer products and lower seasonal volume for gaming consoles. Our non-HDD revenues are forecast to be relatively flat to quarter-to-quarter for systems. And our SSD revenues will be up double digits sequentially. We expect total revenues in the December quarter to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion.
As always, we will consider intra-quarter upside opportunities that make sense for our long-term portfolio profitability. We expect gross margins for the December quarter to be at the low end of our 29% to 33% long-term range, primarily reflecting the lower demand for nearline HDDs.
Operating expenses will be relatively flat sequentially. And we are actively implementing incremental expense controls. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%, even in this challenging environment. Capital expenditures will remain at approximately 6% of revenues to support product transitions that we have planned for later in FY '19 and beyond. For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain slightly below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
In closing, it's been a while since we specifically addressed our capital allocation strategy with investors. And I wanted to highlight a few of the key elements of our framework. Seagate has demonstrated a commitment to deliver long-term value for shareholders, and we remain committed to a capital allocation framework that maximizes returns. We are confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years. And as we leverage our mass storage portfolio for existing and new market opportunities, as announced today, we -- in addition to approving the quarterly dividend, Seagate's Board of Directors has approved a new share redemption authorization that will enable us to redeem up to $3 billion of ordinary shares. The increase in authorization reflects the confidence of the Board and the executive team in Seagate's ability to generate cash while still investing in innovation and growth opportunities. Seagate has consistently returned over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend and share redemptions, and we remain committed to doing so over the long term. I strongly believe our deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will continue to drive long-term success for the company to deliver value for our shareholders. I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong first quarter -- fiscal first quarter results.
These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY '2019 and beyond. The September quarter has put us on a stable trajectory for FY '19, and we will maximize our efforts to operate efficiently through the fiscal year.
Liz, now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

There are long lead times of internal components, of course, and even some of the external components we have to procure. So relative to interlocks with the customers, I think those generally go pretty well. This recent demand fallout happened fairly systemically, many, many different accounts we talk about. And basically -- quickly, it was -- wasn't something that we'd ever seen as quickly before. So in these typical digestion phases, I think this one was fairly pronounced. I think long term, the growth in the cloud is still there -- still very strong. And qualification cycles will come back really strong at the next capacity points as those higher and higher capacity points offer better TCO propositions for them. But the ability to forecast the tactical reductions, and things like that, is still not where we wanted to be. Are there other things that we can be doing longer term? I think so. Our portfolio is fairly complex. And I talked about that a little bit in my comments. And so I think simplifying the portfolio a little bit will allow us a little bit more flexibility. We just got caught in the middle of these product transitions, and that wasn't an option this time. But I think we'll make progress on that next time."

I do think that the buying pattern was so strong that there was a probably a little bit of overbuying. And so that -- we'll have to wait at certain accounts for them to blow through that inventory. The root of the problem -- if I talk about the last problem that we had in the -- the last digestion phase, if you will, that largely came because there were a lot of changes in component pricing quickly. And the changes in component pricing really put some of the builders upside down. I think this one's a little bit different. But it does have to do with supply chains being a little broken right now for many components. And I think we're going to get through it fairly quickly as well. I don't think it's so much about those efficiency gains right now, Joe. That's my read from today. And I do think that there's some elements of hard drive availability at 12 terabytes. They know 16 terabytes are coming. They see the TCO proposition of those new capacity points and things like that, that may actually delay through these periods as well. So we factor all these things in. To your point exactly on how big is this one relative to the last one. So our baseline that we believe we're hitting as an industry is higher than the last digestion phase. And that one was higher than the previous digestion phase. So -- but then the run-up that we have to prepare for is barely profound. And you've seen that in our financials as we come out of those digestion phase and go back into growth phases. So as far as predictability, I wish we could be better at it. But I think there's a lot of economic factors and other things that are playing in. We're just going to do the smart things through this digestion phase and get onto the -- and be prepared for the growth when it comes."

I would say that as far as visibility, I think this is the question that Karl or Joe asked earlier as well. My sense is that there is not a whole lot of visibility to this early. So some people have claimed that they saw this coming 3 months ago or 4 months ago. I don't see it as much, and talking to the customers, I don't believe that they did as well. They saw signals, and then they've backed off with some of their plans. We stay tied with them. And they're -- we trust that those conversations are pretty good over the long haul, that ultimately this demand is going to come back. And like I said before, the -- they'll be back probably looking for the higher-capacity drives because those are a better value proposition in their data centers. You think about it. If you're going to make an investment in data centers, you want to use the highest capacity as you can and put those -- plug those drives in for 5 years. That's the best TCO proposition you can find.

And then on top of that what does the margin structure of that business say? How should we think about that?"

We don't have a take or pay right now. That's not a good way to think about it. So especially because we see a lot of -- we see too much inventory in certain channels, remember, we're exposed largely to enterprise SSDs, not consumer grade and things like that. But we'd still see too much inventory in some channels. We won't bring on as much NAND in order to build our products to compound that problem. We'll be patient through that period of time. So that affects our revenue projections a little bit. But the customer qualifications, the customers who like our products, they'll continue to pull. And I think we'll get back on our horse. We have access to ample NAND to grow to the levels that we had talked about before, which is kind of doubling revenue every quarter -- sorry, every year for the foreseeable future. So I'm not worried about supply from that perspective. But I'm more worried about the industry dynamics."

I will cover the high-level results from the September quarter and offer some market commentary. Kate Scolnick, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the December quarter.
Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
For the September quarter, Seagate delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth, 78% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP net income and 148% year-over-year growth in cash flow from operations. These strong results were driven by a 41% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments, reflecting persistent, global data growth trends and demand for Seagate's mass storage solutions.
As data-centric applications continue to proliferate inside the global digital economy, strong exabyte growth trends will continue in multiple markets for the next decade. Seagate is a critical supplier to the company's institutions and entrepreneurs that are driving value from the mass of opportunity in Big Data analytics, AI, smart cities, machine learning and other cloud-based architectures.
Additionally, our edge product portfolio is delivering tremendous value to a growing consumer landscape in video content creation and analytics, best represented in the gaming and entertainment arenas. Developing our product portfolio to intercept these trends has resulted in strong exabyte growth over the past several years, and we expect these trends to continue.
We are leveraging of our 40-year history of innovation in the storage industry to introduce new, precision-engineered technology advancements, including multi-actuator designs, security, video, and cloud-specific feature sets, all to meet economical next-generation capacity and performance requirements for our customers.
In September, we launched the industry's broadest portfolio of 14-terabyte hard drives for NAS, desktop surveillance and hyperscale data center applications. This purpose-built portfolio empowers customers to consume, manage and utilize digital data more effectively and efficiently while establishing new benchmarks in speed and capacity. Consistent with this drive to innovate, we are scheduled to deliver 16-terabyte capacity solutions for the nearline market in the first half of calendar 2019. These products will use conventional magnetic recording and have product variance that over time can reach marginally higher capacity points, using forms of shingled magnetic recordings.
As always, we are focused on specific customer requirements and feature sets to give optimal application response in the varying cloud workloads. At the same time, in leveraging the same platform, we have produced 16-terabyte drives using our heat-assisted, or HAMR technology. The HAMR system is capable of much higher density points, having now shown development progress towards 2.25 terabit per square inch at the component level, twice the density of what is shipping today. We expect to ship samples of the HAMR units to critical customers for evaluation in early calendar 2019 and then grow beyond 20 terabytes per drive in calendar 2020.
Before we turn to the September financials, I'd like to comment on the near-term cloud demand and NAND market environments. Relative to cloud demand, recall that in FY '18, the HDD industry experienced strong growth in enterprise mass storage product demand with nearly HDD exabyte growth of over 60% year-over-year, well above the 5% average compound annual growth rate of 35% to 40%. This growth was primarily led by the global public cloud service providers. We also experienced good demand from the traditional storage OEMs that are deploying hybrid and private cloud solutions.
Over the course of the last fiscal year, we effectively monetized the growth opportunities and introduced new products to our portfolio. As demonstrated over the last 5 years, the exabyte growth from public file service providers continues to accelerate. We also see, however, intermittent periods of digestion where strong buying patterns from large-scale customers will dampen in order to build through existing inventory before proceeding. One of these digestion cycles began in earnest in late Q1, FY '19. And our best estimate is that it may last for up to 3 quarters.
In addition, we are seeing some enterprise spending caution in the China market. For Seagate specifically, these demand disruptions fall in the middle of numerous product transitions with customers for our 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte nearline products, where we have not executed as crisply as we'd wanted. We will be taking the opportunity to improve our processes in this lower demand environment so that we are positioned for stronger execution when the demand returns. While indications of CSP digestion phase along with other supply-chain disruptions have decreased the market outlook for nearline HDD addressable market in fiscal 2019, we are confident that, as in the past, demand will resume at a higher growth rate beyond this digestion phase, driven by unabated data -- rate of data creation and growth in cloud applications.
We believe we are on the front end of a long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing cloud computing workloads will remain within the top priorities for CIOs.
Now turning to the NAND market. As pricing headwinds and oversupply dynamics persist, we remain committed to our strategic approach to grow our participation in the silicon market and address our customers' storage needs without the overhang from capital requirements and significant cyclical market exposure.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong sequential revenue growth and began qualifying and shipping selective products with TMC NAND. Along with the rest of the market, we have increased caution over the near-term pricing environment, and we are taking some defensive measures but believe in our opportunities to grow this area of our business over time.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution for Seagate. And we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for profitable revenue growth opportunities in all of the markets we serve, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kate to go into more depth on our financial performance."

Hard disk drive revenues were 17% year-over-y",827,"Thank you, Dave. Seagate executed well in the September quarter against strong market demands. We achieved revenue of $3 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, consistent with our expectations. Hard disk drive revenues were 17% year-over-year, and we are confident that our portfolio is well positioned to monetize cost-effective storage demand.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped 45.5 exabytes, up 67% year-over-year. In the nearline market, we shipped 42.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 7 terabytes per drive, up 30% over last year and up 52% from the September quarter 2 years ago.
In addition, we saw stronger-than-expected demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 42% year-over-year exabyte growth with average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. Cloud-based enterprise storage demand in the September quarter demonstrated strong year-over-year growth but was slightly lower than we anticipated sequentially.
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. Our 10-terabyte nearline product continues to be the leading enterprise revenue SKU for Seagate, and we achieved significant sequential volume in revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product. Our highest-capacity, 14-terabyte product also started shipping this quarter.
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for nearly all end markets in the September quarter, including desktops, surveillance, DDR, gaming, network-attached storage and consumer.
In our mature markets, we remain active in minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte client, consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings.
In the September quarter, these products represented less than 6% of consolidated revenue.
Non-hard disk drive revenues in the September quarter were $190 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products and some intra-quarter supply chain challenges where we could not meet demand for some products.
Silicon revenues were up 38% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. We are bullish about our long-term opportunities to grow revenue and market recognition as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets. We are mindful of the NAND pricing dynamics. And we are managing our business with incremental caution to continue to grow revenue in a competitive manner.
In the September quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, consistent with our expectations and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. The sequential change reflected better-than-anticipated product and customer mix, benign pricing and offset by reserve associated with the rapid decline in NAND market prices. Year-over-year non-GAAP margin improved approximately 200 basis points, benefiting from the mix shift to higher-margin mass storage products and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $382 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower sequentially, primarily due to overall operating efficiency and lower share-based and variable compensation. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.70, up 77% year-over-year and reflecting a better demand environment for our mass storage solutions and higher factory utilization. Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $587 million, and free cash flow was $410 million compared with $113 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $177 million in the September quarter or 6% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. And we ended the September quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 286 million ordinary shares outstanding. In the September quarter, we redeemed 3 million shares to offset stock or dilution, and our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 2, 2019.
The company's debt balance as of the September quarter is $4.8 billion. Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Seagate's net debt-to-last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the September quarter. In the December quarter, we expect to retire the remaining November 2018 debt of approximately $499 million. The cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 8 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand.
And one final housekeeping item. Effective June 30, 2018, we adopted a new revenue recognition policy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 revenue from contracts of customers using the modified retrospective method. The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the company's condensed, consolidated financial statements for the September 2018 quarter was not material.
Overall, our financial performance in the September quarter reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I'll now turn the call back to Dave for our outlook."

As many other IT companies have noted in their recent earnings reports, we are exercising caution in our immediate forecast due to political, regulatory and foreign exchange uncertainty around certain areas of the world. As in the past, we believe these perturbations to be temporary. And we will still see fairly healthy exabyte demand in most markets in the December quarter.
As I outlined earlier, we anticipate nearline HDD demand will decline sequentially from Q1 due to immediate drops in demand with most of the cloud service providers and given some uncertainty in the China enterprise marketplace. Previously, we were not forecasting these dynamics to occur in Q2. And we are adjusting our build plans accordingly.
We anticipate edge market demand to be mostly consistent with higher seasonal demand for consumer products and lower seasonal volume for gaming consoles. Our non-HDD revenues are forecast to be relatively flat to quarter-to-quarter for systems. And our SSD revenues will be up double digits sequentially. We expect total revenues in the December quarter to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion.
As always, we will consider intra-quarter upside opportunities that make sense for our long-term portfolio profitability. We expect gross margins for the December quarter to be at the low end of our 29% to 33% long-term range, primarily reflecting the lower demand for nearline HDDs.
Operating expenses will be relatively flat sequentially. And we are actively implementing incremental expense controls. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%, even in this challenging environment. Capital expenditures will remain at approximately 6% of revenues to support product transitions that we have planned for later in FY '19 and beyond. For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain slightly below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
In closing, it's been a while since we specifically addressed our capital allocation strategy with investors. And I wanted to highlight a few of the key elements of our framework. Seagate has demonstrated a commitment to deliver long-term value for shareholders, and we remain committed to a capital allocation framework that maximizes returns. We are confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years. And as we leverage our mass storage portfolio for existing and new market opportunities, as announced today, we -- in addition to approving the quarterly dividend, Seagate's Board of Directors has approved a new share redemption authorization that will enable us to redeem up to $3 billion of ordinary shares. The increase in authorization reflects the confidence of the Board and the executive team in Seagate's ability to generate cash while still investing in innovation and growth opportunities. Seagate has consistently returned over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend and share redemptions, and we remain committed to doing so over the long term. I strongly believe our deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will continue to drive long-term success for the company to deliver value for our shareholders. I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong first quarter -- fiscal first quarter results.
These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY '2019 and beyond. The September quarter has put us on a stable trajectory for FY '19, and we will maximize our efforts to operate efficiently through the fiscal year.

There are long lead times of internal components, of course, and even some of the external components we have to procure. So relative to interlocks with the customers, I think those generally go pretty well. This recent demand fallout happened fairly systemically, many, many different accounts we talk about. And basically -- quickly, it was -- wasn't something that we'd ever seen as quickly before. So in these typical digestion phases, I think this one was fairly pronounced. I think long term, the growth in the cloud is still there -- still very strong. And qualification cycles will come back really strong at the next capacity points as those higher and higher capacity points offer better TCO propositions for them. But the ability to forecast the tactical reductions, and things like that, is still not where we wanted to be. Are there other things that we can be doing longer term? I think so. Our portfolio is fairly complex. And I talked about that a little bit in my comments. And so I think simplifying the portfolio a little bit will allow us a little bit more flexibility. We just got caught in the middle of these product transitions, and that wasn't an option this time. But I think we'll make progress on that next time."

I do think that the buying pattern was so strong that there was a probably a little bit of overbuying. And so that -- we'll have to wait at certain accounts for them to blow through that inventory. The root of the problem -- if I talk about the last problem that we had in the -- the last digestion phase, if you will, that largely came because there were a lot of changes in component pricing quickly. And the changes in component pricing really put some of the builders upside down. I think this one's a little bit different. But it does have to do with supply chains being a little broken right now for many components. And I think we're going to get through it fairly quickly as well. I don't think it's so much about those efficiency gains right now, Joe. That's my read from today. And I do think that there's some elements of hard drive availability at 12 terabytes. They know 16 terabytes are coming. They see the TCO proposition of those new capacity points and things like that, that may actually delay through these periods as well. So we factor all these things in. To your point exactly on how big is this one relative to the last one. So our baseline that we believe we're hitting as an industry is higher than the last digestion phase. And that one was higher than the previous digestion phase. So -- but then the run-up that we have to prepare for is barely profound. And you've seen that in our financials as we come out of those digestion phase and go back into growth phases. So as far as predictability, I wish we could be better at it. But I think there's a lot of economic factors and other things that are playing in. We're just going to do the smart things through this digestion phase and get onto the -- and be prepared for the growth when it comes."

So I -- like I told Katy, I don't think we'll necessarily be done with that by Q3. Now other segments are growing. So the edge segments continue to move up from 4 terabytes to 6 terabytes to 8 terabytes. We see good impact there. So I think net-net is some of the cloud demand impacts will be offset in exabyte growth by other segments.

I think that the general demand reductions have come across a diverse set of customers. It's not just at one account or 2 accounts. And it's -- that's global as well. I don't really want to quantify it at this point. But you can see it in the revenue projections right now and how impactful it is to us. I would say that as far as visibility, I think this is the question that Karl or Joe asked earlier as well. My sense is that there is not a whole lot of visibility to this early. So some people have claimed that they saw this coming 3 months ago or 4 months ago. I don't see it as much, and talking to the customers, I don't believe that they did as well. They saw signals, and then they've backed off with some of their plans. We stay tied with them. And they're -- we trust that those conversations are pretty good over the long haul, that ultimately this demand is going to come back. And like I said before, the -- they'll be back probably looking for the higher-capacity drives because those are a better value proposition in their data centers. You think about it. If you're going to make an investment in data centers, you want to use the highest capacity as you can and put those -- plug those drives in for 5 years. That's the best TCO proposition you can find. So they have to manage those transitions as well. And I think as we all take a little pause here, then we're going to look to align that way and get ready for the next plug."

Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
For the September quarter, Seagate delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth, 78% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP net income and 148% year-over-year growth in cash flow from operations. These strong results were driven by 41% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments, reflecting persistent, global data growth trends and demand for Seagate's mass storage solutions.
As data-centric applications continue to proliferate inside the global digital economy, strong exabyte growth trends will continue in multiple markets for the next decade. Seagate is a critical supplier to the companies, institutions and entrepreneurs that are driving value from the mass of opportunity in Big Data analytics, AI, smart cities, machine learning and other cloud-based architectures.
Additionally, our edge product portfolio is delivering tremendous value to a growing consumer landscape in video content creation and analytics, best represented in the gaming and entertainment arenas. Developing our product portfolio to intercept these trends has resulted in strong exabyte growth over the past several years, and we expect these trends to continue.
We are leveraging of our 40-year history of innovation in the storage industry to introduce new, precision-engineered technology advancements, including multi-actuator designs, security, video, and cloud-specific feature sets, all to meet economical next-generation capacity and performance requirements for our customers.
In September, we launched the industry's broadest portfolio of 14-terabyte hard drives for NAS, desktop surveillance and hyperscale data center applications. This purpose-built portfolio empowers customers to consume, manage and utilize digital data more effectively and efficiently, while establishing new benchmarks in speed and capacity. 
Consistent with this drive to innovate, we are scheduled to deliver 16-terabyte capacity solutions for the nearline market in the first half of calendar 2019. These products will use conventional magnetic recording and have product variance that over time can reach marginally higher capacity points, using forms of shingled magnetic recordings.
As always, we are focused on specific customer requirements and feature sets to give optimal application response in the varying cloud workloads. At the same time, in leveraging the same platform, we have produced 16-terabyte drives using our heat-assisted, or HAMR technology. The HAMR system is capable of much higher density points, having now shown development progress towards 2.25 terabit per square inch at the component level, twice the density of what is shipping today. We expect to ship samples of the HAMR units to critical customers for evaluation in early calendar 2019 and then grow beyond 20 terabytes per drive in calendar 2020.
Before we turn to the September financials, I'd like to comment on the near-term cloud demand and NAND market environments. Relative to cloud demand, recall that in FY '18, the HDD industry experienced strong growth in enterprise mass storage product demand, with nearly HDD exabyte growth of over 60% year-over-year, well above the 5% average compound annual growth rate of 35% to 40%. This growth was primarily led by the global public cloud service providers. We also experienced good demand from the traditional storage OEMs that are deploying hybrid and private cloud solutions.
Over the course of the last fiscal year, we effectively monetized the growth opportunities and introduced new products to our portfolio. As demonstrated over the last 5 years, the exabyte growth from public file service providers continues to accelerate. We also see, however, intermittent periods of digestion where strong buying patterns from large-scale customers will dampen in order to build through existing inventory before proceeding. One of these digestion cycles began in earnest in late Q1 FY '19. And our best estimate is that it may last for up to 3 quarters.
In addition, we are seeing some enterprise spending caution in the China market. For Seagate specifically, these demand disruptions fall in the middle of numerous product transitions with customers for our 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte nearline products, where we have not executed as crisply as we'd wanted. We will be taking the opportunity to improve our processes in this lower demand environment, so that we are positioned for stronger execution when the demand returns. 
While indications of CSP digestion phase, along with other supply-chain disruptions have decreased the market outlook for nearline HDD addressable market in fiscal 2019, we are confident that, as in the past, demand will resume at a higher growth rate beyond this digestion phase, driven by unabated data -- rate of data creation and growth in cloud applications.
We believe we are on the front end of long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing cloud computing workloads will remain within the top priorities for CIOs.
Now turning to the NAND market. As pricing headwinds and oversupply dynamics persist, we remain committed to our strategic approach to grow our participation in the silicon market and address our customers' storage needs without the overhang from capital requirements and significant cyclical market exposure.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong sequential revenue growth and began qualifying and shipping selective products with TMC NAND. Along with the rest of the market, we have increased caution over the near-term pricing environment, and we are taking some defensive measures, but believe in our opportunities to grow this area of our business over time.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution for Seagate. And we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for profitable revenue growth opportunities in all of the markets we serve, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kate to go into more depth on our financial performance."

We achieved revenues of $3 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, consistent with our expectations. 
Hard disk drive revenues were up 17% year-over-year, and we are confident that our portfolio is well positioned to monetize cost-effective storage demand.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped 45.5 exabytes, up 67% year-over-year. In the nearline market, we shipped 42.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 7 terabytes per drive, up 30% over last year and up 52% from the September quarter 2 years ago.
In addition, we saw stronger-than-expected demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 42% year-over-year exabyte growth, with average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. 
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand in the September quarter demonstrated strong year-over-year growth, but was slightly lower than we anticipated sequentially.
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
Our 10-terabyte nearline product continues to be the leading enterprise revenue SKU for Seagate, and we achieved significant sequential volume in revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product. Our highest-capacity 14-terabyte product also started shipping this quarter.
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for nearly all end markets in the September quarter, including desktops, surveillance, DDR, gaming, network-attached storage and consumer.
In our mature markets, we remain active in minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte clients, consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings.
In the September quarter, these products represented less than 6% of consolidated revenue.
Non-hard disk drive revenues in the September quarter were $190 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products and some intra-quarter supply chain challenges, where we could not meet demand for some products.
Silicon revenues were up 38% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. We are bullish about our long-term opportunities to grow revenue and market recognition as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets. We are mindful of the NAND pricing dynamics. And we are managing our business with incremental caution to continue to grow revenue in a competitive manner.
In the September quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, consistent with our expectations and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. The sequential change reflected better-than-anticipated product and customer mix, benign pricing and offset by reserve associated with the rapid decline in NAND market prices. 
Year-over-year non-GAAP margin improved approximately 200 basis points, benefiting from the mixed shift to higher-margin mass storage products and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $382 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower sequentially, primarily due to overall operating efficiency and lower share-based and variable compensation. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.70, up 77% year-over-year and reflecting a better demand environment for our mass storage solutions and higher factory utilization. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $587 million, and free cash flow was $410 million compared with $113 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $177 million in the September quarter or 6% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. And we ended the September quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 286 million ordinary shares outstanding. In the September quarter, we redeemed 3 million shares to offset stock or dilution, and our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 2, 2019.
The company's debt balance as of the September quarter is $4.8 billion. Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Seagate's net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the September quarter. 
In the December quarter, we expect to retire the remaining November 2018 debt of approximately $499 million. The cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 8 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment, coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand.
And one final housekeeping item. Effective June 30, 2018, we adopted a new revenue recognition policy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 revenue from contracts of customers using the modified retrospective method. The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the company's condensed, consolidated financial statements for the September 2018 quarter was not material.
Overall, our financial performance in the September quarter reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I'll now turn the call back to Dave for our outlook."

As many other IT companies have noted in their recent earnings reports, we are exercising caution in our immediate forecast due to political, regulatory and foreign exchange uncertainty around certain areas of the world. As in the past, we believe these perturbations to be temporary. And we will still see fairly healthy exabyte demand in most markets in the December quarter.
As I outlined earlier, we anticipate nearline HDD demand will decline sequentially from Q1 due to immediate drops in demand with most of the cloud service providers and given some uncertainty in the China enterprise marketplace. Previously, we were not forecasting these dynamics to occur in Q2, and we are adjusting our build plans accordingly.
We anticipate edge market demand to be mostly consistent with higher seasonal demand for consumer products and lower seasonal volume for gaming consoles. Our non-HDD revenues are forecast to be relatively flat to quarter-to-quarter for systems, and our SSD revenues will be up double digits sequentially. We expect total revenues in the December quarter to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion.
As always, we will consider intra-quarter upside opportunities that make sense for our long-term portfolio profitability. We expect gross margins for the December quarter to be at the low end of our 29% to 33% long-term range, primarily reflecting the lower demand for nearline HDDs.
Operating expenses will be relatively flat sequentially. And we're actively implementing incremental expense controls. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%, even in this challenging environment. 
Capital expenditures will remain at approximately 6% of revenues to support product transitions that we have planned for later in FY '19 and beyond. For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain slightly below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
In closing, it's been a while since we specifically addressed our capital allocation strategy with investors. And I wanted to highlight a few of the key elements of our framework. Seagate has demonstrated a commitment to deliver long-term value for shareholders, and we remain committed to a capital allocation framework that maximizes returns. 
We are confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years. And as we leverage our mass storage portfolio for existing and new market opportunities, as announced today, we -- in addition to approving the quarterly dividend, Seagate's Board of Directors has approved a new share redemption authorization that will enable us to redeem up to $3 billion of ordinary shares.  The increase in authorization reflects the confidence of the board and the executive team in Seagate's ability to generate cash while still investing in innovation and growth opportunities. 
Seagate has consistently returned over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend and share redemptions, and we remain committed to doing so over the long term. I strongly believe our deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will continue to drive long-term success for the company and deliver value for our shareholders. 
I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong first quarter -- fiscal first quarter results.
These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY '2019 and beyond. The September quarter has put us on a stable trajectory for FY '19, and we will maximize our efforts to operate efficiently through the fiscal year.
Liz, now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

There are long lead times of internal components, of course, and even some of the external components we have to procure. So relative to interlocks with the customers, I think those generally go pretty well. This recent demand fallout happened fairly systemically, many, many different accounts we talk about. And basically quickly it wasn't something that we'd ever seen as quickly before. So in these typical digestion phases, I think this one was fairly pronounced. I think long term, the growth in the cloud is still there -- still very strong. And qualification cycles will come back really strong at the next capacity points as those higher and higher capacity points offer better TCO propositions for them. But the ability to forecast the tactical reductions, and things like that, is still not where we wanted to be. Are there other things that we can be doing longer term? I think so. Our portfolio is fairly complex. And I talked about that a little bit in my comments. And so I think simplifying the portfolio a little bit will allow us a little bit more flexibility. We just got caught in the middle of these product transitions, and that wasn't an option this time. But I think we'll make progress on that next time."

I do think that the buying pattern was so strong that there was a probably a little bit of overbuying. And so that -- we'll have to wait at certain accounts for them to blow through that inventory. The root of the problem -- if I talk about the last problem that we had in the -- the last digestion phase, if you will, that largely came because there were a lot of changes in component pricing quickly. And the changes in component pricing really put some of the builders upside down. I think this one's a little bit different. But it does have to do with supply chains being a little broken right now for many components. And I think we're going to get through it fairly quickly as well. I don't think it's so much about those efficiency gains right now, Joe. That's my read from today. And I do think that there's some elements of hard drive availability at 12 terabytes. They know 16 terabytes are coming. They see the TCO proposition of those new capacity points and things like that, that may actually delay through these periods as well. So we factor all these things in. To your point exactly on how big is this one relative to the last one. So our baseline that we believe we're hitting as an industry is higher than the last digestion phase. And that one was higher than the previous digestion phase. So -- but then the run-up that we have to prepare for is barely profound. And you've seen that in our financials as we come out of those digestion phase and go back into growth phases. So as far as predictability, I wish we could be better at it. But I think there's a lot of economic factors and other things that are playing in. We're just going to do the smart things through this digestion phase and get onto the -- and be prepared for the growth when it comes."

So I -- like I told Katy, I don't think we'll necessarily be done with that by Q3. Now other segments are growing. So the edge segments continue to move up from 4 terabytes to 6 terabytes to 8 terabytes. We see good impact there.

So I think I had expressed some confidence in -- when things were strong a couple of quarters ago, Aaron, that the reason it was strong for us is because we were diversified. I think that the general demand reductions have come across a diverse set of customers. It's not just at 1 account or 2 accounts. And it's -- that's global as well. I don't really want to quantify it at this point. But you can see it in the revenue projections right now and how impactful it is to us. I would say that as far as visibility, I think this is the question that Karl or Joe asked earlier as well. My sense is that there is not a whole lot of visibility to this early. So some people have claimed that they saw this coming 3 months ago or 4 months ago. I don't see it as much, and talking to the customers, I don't believe that they did as well. They saw signals, and then they've backed off of some of their plans. We stay tight with them. And they're -- we trust that those conversations are pretty good over the long haul, that ultimately, this demand is going to come back. And like I said before, the -- they'll be back probably looking for the higher-capacity drives because those are a better value proposition in their data centers. You think about it. If you're going to make an investment in data centers, you want to use the highest capacity as you can and put those -- plug those drives in for 5 years. That's the best TCO proposition you can find. So they have to manage those transitions as well. And I think as we all take a little pause here, then we're going to look to align that way and get ready for the next plug."

I will cover the high-level results from the September quarter and offer some market commentary. Kate Scolnick, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the December quarter.  Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
For the September quarter, Seagate delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth, 78% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP net income and 148% year-over-year growth in cash flow from operations. These strong results were driven by 41% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments, reflecting persistent, global data growth trends and demand for Seagate's mass storage solutions.
As data-centric applications continue to proliferate inside the global digital economy, strong exabyte growth trends will continue in multiple markets for the next decade. Seagate is a critical supplier to the companies, institutions and entrepreneurs that are driving value from the mass of opportunity in Big Data analytics, AI, smart cities, machine learning and other cloud-based architectures.
Additionally, our edge product portfolio is delivering tremendous value to a growing consumer landscape in video content creation and analytics, best represented in the gaming and entertainment arenas. Developing our product portfolio to intercept these trends has resulted in strong exabyte growth over the past several years, and we expect these trends to continue.
We are leveraging of our 40-year history of innovation in the storage industry to introduce new, precision-engineered technology advancements, including multi-actuator designs, security, video, and cloud-specific feature sets, all to meet economical next-generation capacity and performance requirements for our customers.
In September, we launched the industry's broadest portfolio of 14-terabyte hard drives for NAS, desktop surveillance and hyperscale data center applications. This purpose-built portfolio empowers customers to consume, manage and utilize digital data more effectively and efficiently, while establishing new benchmarks in speed and capacity. 
Consistent with this drive to innovate, we are scheduled to deliver 16-terabyte capacity solutions for the nearline market in the first half of calendar 2019. These products will use conventional magnetic recording and have product variance that over time can reach marginally higher capacity points, using forms of shingled magnetic recordings.
As always, we are focused on specific customer requirements and feature sets to give optimal application response in the varying cloud workloads. At the same time, in leveraging the same platform, we have produced 16-terabyte drives using our heat-assisted, or HAMR technology. The HAMR system is capable of much higher density points, having now shown development progress towards 2.25 terabit per square inch at the component level, twice the density of what is shipping today. We expect to ship samples of the HAMR units to critical customers for evaluation in early calendar 2019 and then grow beyond 20 terabytes per drive in calendar 2020.
Before we turn to the September financials, I'd like to comment on the near-term cloud demand and NAND market environments. Relative to cloud demand, recall that in FY '18, the HDD industry experienced strong growth in enterprise mass storage product demand, with nearly HDD exabyte growth of over 60% year-over-year, well above the 5% average compound annual growth rate of 35% to 40%. This growth was primarily led by the global public cloud service providers. We also experienced good demand from the traditional storage OEMs that are deploying hybrid and private cloud solutions.
Over the course of the last fiscal year, we effectively monetized the growth opportunities and introduced new products to our portfolio. As demonstrated over the last 5 years, the exabyte growth from public file service providers continues to accelerate. We also see, however, intermittent periods of digestion where strong buying patterns from large-scale customers will dampen in order to build through existing inventory before proceeding. One of these digestion cycles began in earnest in late Q1 FY '19. And our best estimate is that it may last for up to 3 quarters.
In addition, we are seeing some enterprise spending caution in the China market. For Seagate specifically, these demand disruptions fall in the middle of numerous product transitions with customers for our 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte nearline products, where we have not executed as crisply as we'd wanted. We will be taking the opportunity to improve our processes in this lower demand environment, so that we are positioned for stronger execution when the demand returns. 
While indications of CSP digestion phase, along with other supply-chain disruptions have decreased the market outlook for nearline HDD addressable market in fiscal 2019, we are confident that, as in the past, demand will resume at a higher growth rate beyond this digestion phase, driven by unabated data -- rate of data creation and growth in cloud applications.
We believe we are on the front end of long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing cloud computing workloads will remain within the top priorities for CIOs.
Now turning to the NAND market. As pricing headwinds and oversupply dynamics persist, we remain committed to our strategic approach to grow our participation in the silicon market and address our customers' storage needs without the overhang from capital requirements and significant cyclical market exposure.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong sequential revenue growth and began qualifying and shipping selective products with TMC NAND. Along with the rest of the market, we have increased caution over the near-term pricing environment, and we are taking some defensive measures, but believe in our opportunities to grow this area of our business over time.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution for Seagate. And we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for profitable revenue growth opportunities in all of the markets we serve, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kate to go into more depth on our financial performance."

We achieved revenues of $3 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, consistent with our expectations. 
Hard disk drive revenues were up 17% year-over-year, and we are confident that our portfolio is well positioned to monetize cost-effective storage demand.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped 45.5 exabytes, up 67% year-over-year. In the nearline market, we shipped 42.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 7 terabytes per drive, up 30% over last year and up 52% from the September quarter 2 years ago.
In addition, we saw stronger-than-expected demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 42% year-over-year exabyte growth, with average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. 
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand in the September quarter demonstrated strong year-over-year growth, but was slightly lower than we anticipated sequentially.
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
Our 10-terabyte nearline product continues to be the leading enterprise revenue SKU for Seagate, and we achieved significant sequential volume in revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product. Our highest-capacity 14-terabyte product also started shipping this quarter.
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for nearly all end markets in the September quarter, including desktops, surveillance, DDR, gaming, network-attached storage and consumer.
In our mature markets, we remain active in minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte clients, consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings.
In the September quarter, these products represented less than 6% of consolidated revenue.
Non-hard disk drive revenues in the September quarter were $190 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products and some intra-quarter supply chain challenges, where we could not meet demand for some products.
Silicon revenues were up 38% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. We are bullish about our long-term opportunities to grow revenue and market recognition as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets. We are mindful of the NAND pricing dynamics. And we are managing our business with incremental caution to continue to grow revenue in a competitive manner.
In the September quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, consistent with our expectations and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. The sequential change reflected better-than-anticipated product and customer mix, benign pricing and offset by reserve associated with the rapid decline in NAND market prices. 
Year-over-year non-GAAP margin improved approximately 200 basis points, benefiting from the mixed shift to higher-margin mass storage products and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $382 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower sequentially, primarily due to overall operating efficiency and lower share-based and variable compensation. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.70, up 77% year-over-year and reflecting a better demand environment for our mass storage solutions and higher factory utilization. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $587 million, and free cash flow was $410 million compared with $113 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $177 million in the September quarter or 6% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. And we ended the September quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 286 million ordinary shares outstanding. In the September quarter, we redeemed 3 million shares to offset stock or dilution, and our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 2, 2019.
The company's debt balance as of the September quarter is $4.8 billion. Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Seagate's net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the September quarter. 
In the December quarter, we expect to retire the remaining November 2018 debt of approximately $499 million. The cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 8 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment, coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand.
And one final housekeeping item. Effective June 30, 2018, we adopted a new revenue recognition policy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 revenue from contracts of customers using the modified retrospective method. The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the company's condensed, consolidated financial statements for the September 2018 quarter was not material.
Overall, our financial performance in the September quarter reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I'll now turn the call back to Dave for our outlook."

As many other IT companies have noted in their recent earnings reports, we are exercising caution in our immediate forecast due to political, regulatory and foreign exchange uncertainty around certain areas of the world. As in the past, we believe these perturbations to be temporary. And we will still see fairly healthy exabyte demand in most markets in the December quarter.
As I outlined earlier, we anticipate nearline HDD demand will decline sequentially from Q1 due to immediate drops in demand with most of the cloud service providers and given some uncertainty in the China enterprise marketplace. Previously, we were not forecasting these dynamics to occur in Q2, and we are adjusting our build plans accordingly.
We anticipate edge market demand to be mostly consistent with higher seasonal demand for consumer products and lower seasonal volume for gaming consoles. Our non-HDD revenues are forecast to be relatively flat to quarter-to-quarter for systems, and our SSD revenues will be up double digits sequentially. We expect total revenues in the December quarter to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion.
As always, we will consider intra-quarter upside opportunities that make sense for our long-term portfolio profitability. We expect gross margins for the December quarter to be at the low end of our 29% to 33% long-term range, primarily reflecting the lower demand for nearline HDDs.
Operating expenses will be relatively flat sequentially. And we're actively implementing incremental expense controls. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%, even in this challenging environment. 
Capital expenditures will remain at approximately 6% of revenues to support product transitions that we have planned for later in FY '19 and beyond. For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain slightly below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
In closing, it's been a while since we specifically addressed our capital allocation strategy with investors. And I wanted to highlight a few of the key elements of our framework. Seagate has demonstrated a commitment to deliver long-term value for shareholders, and we remain committed to a capital allocation framework that maximizes returns. 
We are confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years. And as we leverage our mass storage portfolio for existing and new market opportunities, as announced today, we -- in addition to approving the quarterly dividend, Seagate's Board of Directors has approved a new share redemption authorization that will enable us to redeem up to $3 billion of ordinary shares.  The increase in authorization reflects the confidence of the board and the executive team in Seagate's ability to generate cash while still investing in innovation and growth opportunities. 
Seagate has consistently returned over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend and share redemptions, and we remain committed to doing so over the long term. I strongly believe our deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will continue to drive long-term success for the company and deliver value for our shareholders. 
I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong first quarter -- fiscal first quarter results.
These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY '2019 and beyond. The September quarter has put us on a stable trajectory for FY '19, and we will maximize our efforts to operate efficiently through the fiscal year.

There are long lead times of internal components, of course, and even some of the external components we have to procure. So relative to interlocks with the customers, I think those generally go pretty well. This recent demand fallout happened fairly systemically, many, many different accounts we talk about. And basically quickly it wasn't something that we'd ever seen as quickly before. So in these typical digestion phases, I think this one was fairly pronounced. I think long term, the growth in the cloud is still there -- still very strong. And qualification cycles will come back really strong at the next capacity points as those higher and higher capacity points offer better TCO propositions for them. But the ability to forecast the tactical reductions, and things like that, is still not where we wanted to be. Are there other things that we can be doing longer term? I think so. Our portfolio is fairly complex. And I talked about that a little bit in my comments. And so I think simplifying the portfolio a little bit will allow us a little bit more flexibility. We just got caught in the middle of these product transitions, and that wasn't an option this time. But I think we'll make progress on that next time."

I do think that the buying pattern was so strong that there was a probably a little bit of overbuying. And so that -- we'll have to wait at certain accounts for them to blow through that inventory. The root of the problem -- if I talk about the last problem that we had in the -- the last digestion phase, if you will, that largely came because there were a lot of changes in component pricing quickly. And the changes in component pricing really put some of the builders upside down. I think this one's a little bit different. But it does have to do with supply chains being a little broken right now for many components. And I think we're going to get through it fairly quickly as well. I don't think it's so much about those efficiency gains right now, Joe. That's my read from today. And I do think that there's some elements of hard drive availability at 12 terabytes. They know 16 terabytes are coming. They see the TCO proposition of those new capacity points and things like that, that may actually delay through these periods as well. So we factor all these things in. To your point exactly on how big is this one relative to the last one. So our baseline that we believe we're hitting as an industry is higher than the last digestion phase. And that one was higher than the previous digestion phase. So -- but then the run-up that we have to prepare for is barely profound. And you've seen that in our financials as we come out of those digestion phase and go back into growth phases. So as far as predictability, I wish we could be better at it. But I think there's a lot of economic factors and other things that are playing in. We're just going to do the smart things through this digestion phase and get onto the -- and be prepared for the growth when it comes."

We want to use the highest process content that we can. So from a heads perspective, we anticipate full factories. And we're really happy with the way we've managed our footprint. Media, I think we have a lot more flexibility. And then final drive inventory, we'll watch it very carefully because we're watching cash through the period as well."

So I think I had expressed some confidence in -- when things were strong a couple of quarters ago, Aaron, that the reason it was strong for us is because we were diversified. I think that the general demand reductions have come across a diverse set of customers. It's not just at 1 account or 2 accounts. And it's -- that's global as well. I don't really want to quantify it at this point. But you can see it in the revenue projections right now and how impactful it is to us. I would say that as far as visibility, I think this is the question that Karl or Joe asked earlier as well. My sense is that there is not a whole lot of visibility to this early. So some people have claimed that they saw this coming 3 months ago or 4 months ago. I don't see it as much, and talking to the customers, I don't believe that they did as well. They saw signals, and then they've backed off of some of their plans. We stay tight with them. And they're -- we trust that those conversations are pretty good over the long haul, that ultimately, this demand is going to come back. And like I said before, the -- they'll be back probably looking for the higher-capacity drives because those are a better value proposition in their data centers. You think about it. If you're going to make an investment in data centers, you want to use the highest capacity as you can and put those -- plug those drives in for 5 years. That's the best TCO proposition you can find. So they have to manage those transitions as well. And I think as we all take a little pause here, then we're going to look to align that way and get ready for the next plug."

We won't bring on as much NAND in order to build our products to compound that problem. We'll be patient through that period of time. So that affects our revenue projections a little bit. But the customer qualifications, the customers who like our products, they'll continue to pull. And I think we'll get back on our horse.

Kate Scolnick, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the December quarter.  Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
For the September quarter, Seagate delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth, 78% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP net income and 148% year-over-year growth in cash flow from operations. These strong results were driven by 41% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments, reflecting persistent, global data growth trends and demand for Seagate's mass storage solutions.
As data-centric applications continue to proliferate inside the global digital economy, strong exabyte growth trends will continue in multiple markets for the next decade. Seagate is a critical supplier to the companies, institutions and entrepreneurs that are driving value from the mass of opportunity in Big Data analytics, AI, smart cities, machine learning and other cloud-based architectures.
Additionally, our edge product portfolio is delivering tremendous value to a growing consumer landscape in video content creation and analytics, best represented in the gaming and entertainment arenas. Developing our product portfolio to intercept these trends has resulted in strong exabyte growth over the past several years, and we expect these trends to continue.
We are leveraging of our 40-year history of innovation in the storage industry to introduce new, precision-engineered technology advancements, including multi-actuator designs, security, video, and cloud-specific feature sets, all to meet economical next-generation capacity and performance requirements for our customers.
In September, we launched the industry's broadest portfolio of 14-terabyte hard drives for NAS, desktop surveillance and hyperscale data center applications. This purpose-built portfolio empowers customers to consume, manage and utilize digital data more effectively and efficiently, while establishing new benchmarks in speed and capacity. 
Consistent with this drive to innovate, we are scheduled to deliver 16-terabyte capacity solutions for the nearline market in the first half of calendar 2019. These products will use conventional magnetic recording and have product variance that over time can reach marginally higher capacity points, using forms of shingled magnetic recordings.
As always, we are focused on specific customer requirements and feature sets to give optimal application response in the varying cloud workloads. At the same time, in leveraging the same platform, we have produced 16-terabyte drives using our heat-assisted, or HAMR technology. The HAMR system is capable of much higher density points, having now shown development progress towards 2.25 terabit per square inch at the component level, twice the density of what is shipping today. We expect to ship samples of the HAMR units to critical customers for evaluation in early calendar 2019 and then grow beyond 20 terabytes per drive in calendar 2020.
Before we turn to the September financials, I'd like to comment on the near-term cloud demand and NAND market environments. Relative to cloud demand, recall that in FY '18, the HDD industry experienced strong growth in enterprise mass storage product demand, with nearly HDD exabyte growth of over 60% year-over-year, well above the 5% average compound annual growth rate of 35% to 40%. This growth was primarily led by the global public cloud service providers. We also experienced good demand from the traditional storage OEMs that are deploying hybrid and private cloud solutions.
Over the course of the last fiscal year, we effectively monetized the growth opportunities and introduced new products to our portfolio. As demonstrated over the last 5 years, the exabyte growth from public file service providers continues to accelerate. We also see, however, intermittent periods of digestion where strong buying patterns from large-scale customers will dampen in order to build through existing inventory before proceeding. One of these digestion cycles began in earnest in late Q1 FY '19. And our best estimate is that it may last for up to 3 quarters.
In addition, we are seeing some enterprise spending caution in the China market. For Seagate specifically, these demand disruptions fall in the middle of numerous product transitions with customers for our 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte nearline products, where we have not executed as crisply as we'd wanted. We will be taking the opportunity to improve our processes in this lower demand environment, so that we are positioned for stronger execution when the demand returns. 
While indications of CSP digestion phase, along with other supply-chain disruptions have decreased the market outlook for nearline HDD addressable market in fiscal 2019, we are confident that, as in the past, demand will resume at a higher growth rate beyond this digestion phase, driven by unabated data -- rate of data creation and growth in cloud applications.
We believe we are on the front end of long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing cloud computing workloads will remain within the top priorities for CIOs.
Now turning to the NAND market. As pricing headwinds and oversupply dynamics persist, we remain committed to our strategic approach to grow our participation in the silicon market and address our customers' storage needs without the overhang from capital requirements and significant cyclical market exposure.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong sequential revenue growth and began qualifying and shipping selective products with TMC NAND. Along with the rest of the market, we have increased caution over the near-term pricing environment, and we are taking some defensive measures, but believe in our opportunities to grow this area of our business over time.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution for Seagate. And we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for profitable revenue growth opportunities in all of the markets we serve, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kate to go into more depth on our financial performance."

We achieved revenues of $3 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, consistent with our expectations. 
Hard disk drive revenues were up 17% year-over-year, and we are confident that our portfolio is well positioned to monetize cost-effective storage demand.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped 45.5 exabytes, up 67% year-over-year. In the nearline market, we shipped 42.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 7 terabytes per drive, up 30% over last year and up 52% from the September quarter 2 years ago.
In addition, we saw stronger-than-expected demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 42% year-over-year exabyte growth, with average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. 
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand in the September quarter demonstrated strong year-over-year growth, but was slightly lower than we anticipated sequentially.
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
Our 10-terabyte nearline product continues to be the leading enterprise revenue SKU for Seagate, and we achieved significant sequential volume in revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product. Our highest-capacity 14-terabyte product also started shipping this quarter.
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for nearly all end markets in the September quarter, including desktops, surveillance, DDR, gaming, network-attached storage and consumer.
In our mature markets, we remain active in minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte clients, consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings.
In the September quarter, these products represented less than 6% of consolidated revenue.
Non-hard disk drive revenues in the September quarter were $190 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products and some intra-quarter supply chain challenges, where we could not meet demand for some products.
Silicon revenues were up 38% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. We are bullish about our long-term opportunities to grow revenue and market recognition as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets. We are mindful of the NAND pricing dynamics. And we are managing our business with incremental caution to continue to grow revenue in a competitive manner.
In the September quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, consistent with our expectations and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. The sequential change reflected better-than-anticipated product and customer mix, benign pricing and offset by reserve associated with the rapid decline in NAND market prices. 
Year-over-year non-GAAP margin improved approximately 200 basis points, benefiting from the mixed shift to higher-margin mass storage products and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $382 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower sequentially, primarily due to overall operating efficiency and lower share-based and variable compensation. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.70, up 77% year-over-year and reflecting a better demand environment for our mass storage solutions and higher factory utilization. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $587 million, and free cash flow was $410 million compared with $113 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $177 million in the September quarter or 6% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. And we ended the September quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 286 million ordinary shares outstanding. In the September quarter, we redeemed 3 million shares to offset stock or dilution, and our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 2, 2019.
The company's debt balance as of the September quarter is $4.8 billion. Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Seagate's net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the September quarter. 
In the December quarter, we expect to retire the remaining November 2018 debt of approximately $499 million. The cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 8 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment, coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand.
And one final housekeeping item. Effective June 30, 2018, we adopted a new revenue recognition policy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 revenue from contracts of customers using the modified retrospective method. The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the company's condensed, consolidated financial statements for the September 2018 quarter was not material.
Overall, our financial performance in the September quarter reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I'll now turn the call back to Dave for our outlook."

As many other IT companies have noted in their recent earnings reports, we are exercising caution in our immediate forecast due to political, regulatory and foreign exchange uncertainty around certain areas of the world. As in the past, we believe these perturbations to be temporary. And we will still see fairly healthy exabyte demand in most markets in the December quarter.
As I outlined earlier, we anticipate nearline HDD demand will decline sequentially from Q1 due to immediate drops in demand with most of the cloud service providers and given some uncertainty in the China enterprise marketplace. Previously, we were not forecasting these dynamics to occur in Q2, and we are adjusting our build plans accordingly.
We anticipate edge market demand to be mostly consistent with higher seasonal demand for consumer products and lower seasonal volume for gaming consoles. Our non-HDD revenues are forecast to be relatively flat to quarter-to-quarter for systems, and our SSD revenues will be up double digits sequentially. We expect total revenues in the December quarter to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion.
As always, we will consider intra-quarter upside opportunities that make sense for our long-term portfolio profitability. We expect gross margins for the December quarter to be at the low end of our 29% to 33% long-term range, primarily reflecting the lower demand for nearline HDDs.
Operating expenses will be relatively flat sequentially. And we're actively implementing incremental expense controls. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%, even in this challenging environment. 
Capital expenditures will remain at approximately 6% of revenues to support product transitions that we have planned for later in FY '19 and beyond. For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain slightly below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
In closing, it's been a while since we specifically addressed our capital allocation strategy with investors. And I wanted to highlight a few of the key elements of our framework. Seagate has demonstrated a commitment to deliver long-term value for shareholders, and we remain committed to a capital allocation framework that maximizes returns. 
We are confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years. And as we leverage our mass storage portfolio for existing and new market opportunities, as announced today, we -- in addition to approving the quarterly dividend, Seagate's Board of Directors has approved a new share redemption authorization that will enable us to redeem up to $3 billion of ordinary shares.  The increase in authorization reflects the confidence of the board and the executive team in Seagate's ability to generate cash while still investing in innovation and growth opportunities. 
Seagate has consistently returned over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend and share redemptions, and we remain committed to doing so over the long term. I strongly believe our deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will continue to drive long-term success for the company and deliver value for our shareholders. 
I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong first quarter -- fiscal first quarter results.
These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY '2019 and beyond. The September quarter has put us on a stable trajectory for FY '19, and we will maximize our efforts to operate efficiently through the fiscal year.

So relative to interlocks with the customers, I think those generally go pretty well. This recent demand fallout happened fairly systemically, many, many different accounts we talk about. And basically quickly it wasn't something that we'd ever seen as quickly before. So in these typical digestion phases, I think this one was fairly pronounced. I think long term, the growth in the cloud is still there -- still very strong. And qualification cycles will come back really strong at the next capacity points as those higher and higher capacity points offer better TCO propositions for them. But the ability to forecast the tactical reductions, and things like that, is still not where we wanted to be. Are there other things that we can be doing longer term? I think so. Our portfolio is fairly complex. And I talked about that a little bit in my comments. And so I think simplifying the portfolio a little bit will allow us a little bit more flexibility. We just got caught in the middle of these product transitions, and that wasn't an option this time. But I think we'll make progress on that next time."

The root of the problem -- if I talk about the last problem that we had in the -- the last digestion phase, if you will, that largely came because there were a lot of changes in component pricing quickly. And the changes in component pricing really put some of the builders upside down. I think this one's a little bit different. But it does have to do with supply chains being a little broken right now for many components. And I think we're going to get through it fairly quickly as well. I don't think it's so much about those efficiency gains right now, Joe. That's my read from today. And I do think that there's some elements of hard drive availability at 12 terabytes. They know 16 terabytes are coming. They see the TCO proposition of those new capacity points and things like that, that may actually delay through these periods as well. So we factor all these things in. To your point exactly on how big is this one relative to the last one. So our baseline that we believe we're hitting as an industry is higher than the last digestion phase. And that one was higher than the previous digestion phase. So -- but then the run-up that we have to prepare for is barely profound. And you've seen that in our financials as we come out of those digestion phase and go back into growth phases. So as far as predictability, I wish we could be better at it. But I think there's a lot of economic factors and other things that are playing in. We're just going to do the smart things through this digestion phase and get onto the -- and be prepared for the growth when it comes."

I don't really want to quantify it at this point. But you can see it in the revenue projections right now and how impactful it is to us. I would say that as far as visibility, I think this is the question that Karl or Joe asked earlier as well. My sense is that there is not a whole lot of visibility to this early. So some people have claimed that they saw this coming 3 months ago or 4 months ago. I don't see it as much, and talking to the customers, I don't believe that they did as well. They saw signals, and then they've backed off of some of their plans. We stay tight with them. And they're -- we trust that those conversations are pretty good over the long haul, that ultimately, this demand is going to come back. And like I said before, the -- they'll be back probably looking for the higher-capacity drives because those are a better value proposition in their data centers. You think about it. If you're going to make an investment in data centers, you want to use the highest capacity as you can and put those -- plug those drives in for 5 years. That's the best TCO proposition you can find. So they have to manage those transitions as well. And I think as we all take a little pause here, then we're going to look to align that way and get ready for the next plug."

Kate Scolnick, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, will then discuss certain financial highlights from the quarter. And then I will wrap up with our outlook for the December quarter.  Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.
For the September quarter, Seagate delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth, 78% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP net income and 148% year-over-year growth in cash flow from operations. These strong results were driven by 41% year-over-year growth in exabyte shipments, reflecting persistent, global data growth trends and demand for Seagate's mass storage solutions.
As data-centric applications continue to proliferate inside the global digital economy, strong exabyte growth trends will continue in multiple markets for the next decade. Seagate is a critical supplier to the companies, institutions and entrepreneurs that are driving value from the mass of opportunity in Big Data analytics, AI, smart cities, machine learning and other cloud-based architectures.
Additionally, our edge product portfolio is delivering tremendous value to a growing consumer landscape in video content creation and analytics, best represented in the gaming and entertainment arenas. Developing our product portfolio to intercept these trends has resulted in strong exabyte growth over the past several years, and we expect these trends to continue.
We are leveraging of our 40-year history of innovation in the storage industry to introduce new, precision-engineered technology advancements, including multi-actuator designs, security, video, and cloud-specific feature sets, all to meet economical next-generation capacity and performance requirements for our customers.
In September, we launched the industry's broadest portfolio of 14-terabyte hard drives for NAS, desktop surveillance and hyperscale data center applications. This purpose-built portfolio empowers customers to consume, manage and utilize digital data more effectively and efficiently, while establishing new benchmarks in speed and capacity. 
Consistent with this drive to innovate, we are scheduled to deliver 16-terabyte capacity solutions for the nearline market in the first half of calendar 2019. These products will use conventional magnetic recording and have product variance that over time can reach marginally higher capacity points, using forms of shingled magnetic recordings.
As always, we are focused on specific customer requirements and feature sets to give optimal application response in the varying cloud workloads. At the same time, in leveraging the same platform, we have produced 16-terabyte drives using our heat-assisted, or HAMR technology. The HAMR system is capable of much higher density points, having now shown development progress towards 2.25 terabit per square inch at the component level, twice the density of what is shipping today. We expect to ship samples of the HAMR units to critical customers for evaluation in early calendar 2019 and then grow beyond 20 terabytes per drive in calendar 2020.
Before we turn to the September financials, I'd like to comment on the near-term cloud demand and NAND market environments. Relative to cloud demand, recall that in FY '18, the HDD industry experienced strong growth in enterprise mass storage product demand, with nearly HDD exabyte growth of over 60% year-over-year, well above the 5% average compound annual growth rate of 35% to 40%. This growth was primarily led by the global public cloud service providers. We also experienced good demand from the traditional storage OEMs that are deploying hybrid and private cloud solutions.
Over the course of the last fiscal year, we effectively monetized the growth opportunities and introduced new products to our portfolio. As demonstrated over the last 5 years, the exabyte growth from public file service providers continues to accelerate. We also see, however, intermittent periods of digestion where strong buying patterns from large-scale customers will dampen in order to build through existing inventory before proceeding. One of these digestion cycles began in earnest in late Q1 FY '19. And our best estimate is that it may last for up to 3 quarters.
In addition, we are seeing some enterprise spending caution in the China market. For Seagate specifically, these demand disruptions fall in the middle of numerous product transitions with customers for our 12-terabyte and 14-terabyte nearline products, where we have not executed as crisply as we'd wanted. We will be taking the opportunity to improve our processes in this lower demand environment, so that we are positioned for stronger execution when the demand returns. 
While indications of CSP digestion phase, along with other supply-chain disruptions have decreased the market outlook for nearline HDD addressable market in fiscal 2019, we are confident that, as in the past, demand will resume at a higher growth rate beyond this digestion phase, driven by unabated data -- rate of data creation and growth in cloud applications.
We believe we are on the front end of long-term secular data productivity era that will evolve over the next decade, and managing cloud computing workloads will remain within the top priorities for CIOs.
Now turning to the NAND market. As pricing headwinds and oversupply dynamics persist, we remain committed to our strategic approach to grow our participation in the silicon market and address our customers' storage needs without the overhang from capital requirements and significant cyclical market exposure.
In the September quarter, we delivered strong sequential revenue growth and began qualifying and shipping selective products with TMC NAND. Along with the rest of the market, we have increased caution over the near-term pricing environment, and we are taking some defensive measures, but believe in our opportunities to grow this area of our business over time.
Fiscal 2019 continues to be a year of focused execution for Seagate. And we are taking action to demonstrate sustained operational performance through the fluctuations in the marketplace. We will continue to strive for profitable revenue growth opportunities in all of the markets we serve, control expenses and optimize cash flow generation. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Kate to go into more depth on our financial performance."

We achieved revenues of $3 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, consistent with our expectations. 
Hard disk drive revenues were up 17% year-over-year, and we are confident that our portfolio is well positioned to monetize cost-effective storage demand.
For the enterprise hard disk drive market, we shipped 45.5 exabytes, up 67% year-over-year. In the nearline market, we shipped 42.5 exabytes, and our average capacity per drive exceeded 7 terabytes per drive, up 30% over last year and up 52% from the September quarter 2 years ago.
In addition, we saw stronger-than-expected demand for our mission-critical portfolio that resulted in 42% year-over-year exabyte growth, with average capacity per drive over 1 terabyte. 
Cloud-based enterprise storage demand in the September quarter demonstrated strong year-over-year growth, but was slightly lower than we anticipated sequentially.
As nearline storage capacity demand grows over the next several years, we expect continued opportunity for our mass storage portfolio that delivers multiple capacity points for different application workloads. 
Our 10-terabyte nearline product continues to be the leading enterprise revenue SKU for Seagate, and we achieved significant sequential volume in revenue growth in our 12-terabyte nearline product. Our highest-capacity 14-terabyte product also started shipping this quarter.
In the edge verticals, we've had year-over-year exabyte growth and increased average capacity per drive for nearly all end markets in the September quarter, including desktops, surveillance, DDR, gaming, network-attached storage and consumer.
In our mature markets, we remain active in minimizing our exposure to the sub-1-terabyte clients, consumer and mission-critical 15K markets, as we believe these application workloads will move over time to either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where we have or are developing portfolio offerings.
In the September quarter, these products represented less than 6% of consolidated revenue.
Non-hard disk drive revenues in the September quarter were $190 million, down 21% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to the planned end-of-life of some legacy OEM cloud system products and some intra-quarter supply chain challenges, where we could not meet demand for some products.
Silicon revenues were up 38% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. We are bullish about our long-term opportunities to grow revenue and market recognition as we invest in developing a broad-based silicon portfolio in the SAS, NVMe, consumer and gaming markets. We are mindful of the NAND pricing dynamics. And we are managing our business with incremental caution to continue to grow revenue in a competitive manner.
In the September quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, consistent with our expectations and within our long-term margin range target of 29% to 33%. The sequential change reflected better-than-anticipated product and customer mix, benign pricing and offset by reserve associated with the rapid decline in NAND market prices. 
Year-over-year non-GAAP margin improved approximately 200 basis points, benefiting from the mixed shift to higher-margin mass storage products and high utilization of our vertically integrated factories.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $382 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Expenses were lower sequentially, primarily due to overall operating efficiency and lower share-based and variable compensation. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.70, up 77% year-over-year and reflecting a better demand environment for our mass storage solutions and higher factory utilization. 
Cash flow from operations in the September quarter was $587 million, and free cash flow was $410 million compared with $113 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures, on a cash basis, were approximately $177 million in the September quarter or 6% of total revenue.
Our balance sheet remains healthy. And we ended the September quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 286 million ordinary shares outstanding. In the September quarter, we redeemed 3 million shares to offset stock or dilution, and our board has approved our quarterly dividend payment of $0.63 for the September quarter, which will be payable on January 2, 2019.
The company's debt balance as of the September quarter is $4.8 billion. Interest expense continues to be well within our financial capabilities, given our staggered maturities and low interest rates. 
Seagate's net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1x as of the September quarter. 
In the December quarter, we expect to retire the remaining November 2018 debt of approximately $499 million. The cash conversion cycle for the September quarter was 8 days, reflecting a persistent market demand environment, coupled with well-managed inventory levels that are in line with customer demand.
And one final housekeeping item. Effective June 30, 2018, we adopted a new revenue recognition policy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 revenue from contracts of customers using the modified retrospective method. The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the company's condensed, consolidated financial statements for the September 2018 quarter was not material.
Overall, our financial performance in the September quarter reflects solid execution as well as the earnings power and financial leverage within our business model.
I'll now turn the call back to Dave for our outlook."

As many other IT companies have noted in their recent earnings reports, we are exercising caution in our immediate forecast due to political, regulatory and foreign exchange uncertainty around certain areas of the world. As in the past, we b",598,"Thanks, Kate. As many other IT companies have noted in their recent earnings reports, we are exercising caution in our immediate forecast due to political, regulatory and foreign exchange uncertainty around certain areas of the world. As in the past, we believe these perturbations to be temporary. And we will still see fairly healthy exabyte demand in most markets in the December quarter.
As I outlined earlier, we anticipate nearline HDD demand will decline sequentially from Q1 due to immediate drops in demand with most of the cloud service providers and given some uncertainty in the China enterprise marketplace. Previously, we were not forecasting these dynamics to occur in Q2, and we are adjusting our build plans accordingly.
We anticipate edge market demand to be mostly consistent with higher seasonal demand for consumer products and lower seasonal volume for gaming consoles. Our non-HDD revenues are forecast to be relatively flat to quarter-to-quarter for systems, and our SSD revenues will be up double digits sequentially. We expect total revenues in the December quarter to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion.
As always, we will consider intra-quarter upside opportunities that make sense for our long-term portfolio profitability. We expect gross margins for the December quarter to be at the low end of our 29% to 33% long-term range, primarily reflecting the lower demand for nearline HDDs.
Operating expenses will be relatively flat sequentially. And we're actively implementing incremental expense controls. We are committed to controlling operating expenses within our long-term financial model range of 13% to 15%, even in this challenging environment. 
Capital expenditures will remain at approximately 6% of revenues to support product transitions that we have planned for later in FY '19 and beyond. For the fiscal year, we are forecasting capital expenditures to remain slightly below our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.
In closing, it's been a while since we specifically addressed our capital allocation strategy with investors. And I wanted to highlight a few of the key elements of our framework. Seagate has demonstrated a commitment to deliver long-term value for shareholders, and we remain committed to a capital allocation framework that maximizes returns. 
We are confident in our ability to generate significant cash flow over the next several years. And as we leverage our mass storage portfolio for existing and new market opportunities, as announced today, we -- in addition to approving the quarterly dividend, Seagate's Board of Directors has approved a new share redemption authorization that will enable us to redeem up to $3 billion of ordinary shares.  The increase in authorization reflects the confidence of the board and the executive team in Seagate's ability to generate cash while still investing in innovation and growth opportunities. 
Seagate has consistently returned over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend and share redemptions, and we remain committed to doing so over the long term. I strongly believe our deep storage industry expertise, leading technology portfolio and focused execution will continue to drive long-term success for the company and deliver value for our shareholders. 
I'd like to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees for their alignment and contributions to our strong first quarter -- fiscal first quarter results.
These efforts have Seagate well positioned for future success and value creation in FY '2019 and beyond. The September quarter has put us on a stable trajectory for FY '19, and we will maximize our efforts to operate efficiently through the fiscal year.
Liz, now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

There are long lead times of internal components, of course, and even some of the external components we have to procure. So relative to interlocks with the customers, I think those generally go pretty well. This recent demand fallout happened fairly systemically, many, many different accounts we talk about. And basically quickly it wasn't something that we'd ever seen as quickly before. So in these typical digestion phases, I think this one was fairly pronounced. I think long term, the growth in the cloud is still there -- still very strong. And qualification cycles will come back really strong at the next capacity points as those higher and higher capacity points offer better TCO propositions for them. But the ability to forecast the tactical reductions, and things like that, is still not where we wanted to be. Are there other things that we can be doing longer term? I think so. Our portfolio is fairly complex. And I talked about that a little bit in my comments. And so I think simplifying the portfolio a little bit will allow us a little bit more flexibility. We just got caught in the middle of these product transitions, and that wasn't an option this time. But I think we'll make progress on that next time."

I do think that the buying pattern was so strong that there was a probably a little bit of overbuying. And so that -- we'll have to wait at certain accounts for them to blow through that inventory. The root of the problem -- if I talk about the last problem that we had in the -- the last digestion phase, if you will, that largely came because there were a lot of changes in component pricing quickly. And the changes in component pricing really put some of the builders upside down. I think this one's a little bit different. But it does have to do with supply chains being a little broken right now for many components. And I think we're going to get through it fairly quickly as well. I don't think it's so much about those efficiency gains right now, Joe. That's my read from today. And I do think that there's some elements of hard drive availability at 12 terabytes. They know 16 terabytes are coming. They see the TCO proposition of those new capacity points and things like that, that may actually delay through these periods as well. So we factor all these things in. To your point exactly on how big is this one relative to the last one. So our baseline that we believe we're hitting as an industry is higher than the last digestion phase. And that one was higher than the previous digestion phase. So -- but then the run-up that we have to prepare for is barely profound. And you've seen that in our financials as we come out of those digestion phase and go back into growth phases. So as far as predictability, I wish we could be better at it. But I think there's a lot of economic factors and other things that are playing in. We're just going to do the smart things through this digestion phase and get onto the -- and be prepared for the growth when it comes."

I don't really want to quantify it at this point. But you can see it in the revenue projections right now and how impactful it is to us. I would say that as far as visibility, I think this is the question that Karl or Joe asked earlier as well. My sense is that there is not a whole lot of visibility to this early. So some people have claimed that they saw this coming 3 months ago or 4 months ago. I don't see it as much, and talking to the customers, I don't believe that they did as well. They saw signals, and then they've backed off of some of their plans. We stay tight with them. And they're -- we trust that those conversations are pretty good over the long haul, that ultimately, this demand is going to come back. And like I said before, the -- they'll be back probably looking for the higher-capacity drives because those are a better value proposition in their data centers. You think about it. If you're going to make an investment in data centers, you want to use the highest capacity as you can and put those -- plug those drives in for 5 years. That's the best TCO proposition you can find. So they have to manage those transitions as well. And I think as we all take a little pause here, then we're going to look to align that way and get ready for the next plug."

We won't bring on as much NAND in order to build our products to compound that problem. We'll be patient through that period of time. So that affects our revenue projections a little bit. But the customer qualifications, the customers who like our products, they'll continue to pull. And I think we'll get back on our horse.
