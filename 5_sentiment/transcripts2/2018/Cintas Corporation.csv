With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Senior Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
In a moment, we're going to share with you our third quarter results, which represent another strong quarter of execution and performance. There's a lot of noise in our results, so we'll do our best to help you decipher the performance of the business. 
Before diving into the numbers though, we thought it fitting to recognize that yesterday was the anniversary of the closing of G&K Services deal. The past year has been quite transformative for Cintas. Our employees, whom we call partners, including our partners who came to us from G&K, have done some great foundational work over the last years to position us for success going forward. We remain as excited as ever about our future. 
In early February, we were thrilled to be able to share with our partners a onetime cash payment. The timing couldn't have been better for us given the work done during the past year since March 21 of 2017. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, indicated in today's press release, the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation is good for Cintas, our shareholders and our customers. And again, our success wouldn't have been possible without our motivated and engaged partners, and we are excited to share it with them. 
Moving on to our third quarter results. Our revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1,589,000,000, an increase of 26.6% over last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.5%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10%. 
Reported operating income for the third quarter [ up ] $200 million compared to $192 million in last year's third quarter. However, there are some items worth noting that impacted the comparability of results year-over-year. First, our operating income was reduced $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18 and $9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. 
Second, operating income in the first quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced by the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners that I just mentioned, which amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million. Excluding these 2 items, our third quarter operating income was approximately [ $250 million ] or 15.7% of revenue. This measurement is consistent with the way in which we reported our first 2 quarters of this fiscal year. Keep in mind that operating income includes $12 million of intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and $5 million of incremental depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP. These 2 items total 1.2% of revenue. 
Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of $296 million increased 152.9% from last year's third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were $2.66 compared to $1.06 in last year's third quarter. Again, there were a handful of items that impacted the comparability of net income and EPS results to prior year. First, fiscal '18 and fiscal '17 third quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.06 from G&K transaction and integration expenses. Second, fiscal '18 third quarter EPS also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners. 
Lastly, more than offsetting these negative impacts was a significant benefit to EPS of $1.59 from the benefits of the new Tax Act. Excluding these items to provide better visibility to financial performance, net income dollars increased 24.1% and net income margin was 9.6% compared to 9.8% last year. And EPS increased 22.3%. Note again that net income includes intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and incremental depreciation and implementation cost of SAP. These 2 items net of tax totaled 0.8% of revenue or $0.12. 
In addition to strong execution on the fundamentals, our third quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important long-term investments: G&K and SAP. The integration of G&K remains on track. We have now closed 60 duplicate operations, which is 95% of the total planned closures. Also, 59% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This is an increase from 47% at the end of the second quarter. The system conversions are very important as they are necessary for us to achieve numerous operational synergies. These activities helped us in the third quarter to realize about $15 million in synergies, which is in line with our expectations. 
Regarding SAP, significant advancement continued in our implementation, which remains on schedule. In our third quarter, 24 operations were converted. A total of 79 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 25% of the total planned. 
As I have previously detailed, we have several third quarter items, including the benefit of tax reform that make the comparability of our full fiscal year results to prior year complex. Rather than provide full fiscal year guidance, we believe it's more beneficial for the sake of simplicity to provide specific guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,625,000,000 to $1,645,000,000. I want to reiterate a point we have made in the past. In our upcoming fourth quarter, we will lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's growth will be organic as opposed to inorganic. In the fourth quarter, we will report our organic growth rate, that is the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized acquired G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas and that will have declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. 
With the investment in selling resources having already been made to grow the G&K business, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to accelerate as we move through fiscal 2019. 
For our fiscal 2018 quarter, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. Guidance assumes a fourth quarter tax rate of 24%. We anticipate healthy fourth quarter operating margins in excess of last year's fourth quarter. Note that while the EPS guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the fourth quarter as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $10 million to $15 million. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in the quarter",1119,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in the quarter adds an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter will contain 66 days, the same number of days as the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,284,000,000, an increase of 30.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.5%. Our uniform rental of facility services segment gross margin was 44.1% for the third quarter compared to 45.1% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margin is attributable to the inclusion in this year's third quarter of the lower margin G&K business. The margin of the G&K business has continued to decline as the top line has lowered. In addition, we continue to incur the typical conversion cost, which impact margins in the short term. While the assimilation of the G&K business continues at a great pace, Mike mentioned 95% of duplicate operations have been closed. More work remains. The G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. We are on track. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $137 million, which was 10.5% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 10.0%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the third quarter compared to 44.8% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 210 basis points. The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for this business. Strong new business wins and expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses of all types place on having Cintas manage their first aid and training programs to help keep their employees health -- healthy, safety and Ready for the Workday. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. 
All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 17.0% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 14.9%. All Other gross margin was 41.7% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% for last year's third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the higher-margin fire business. 
While Uniform Direct Sale business growth was strong in the third quarter, note that the business will face some difficult sales growth comparisons in the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from a significant rollout of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large roll outs such as these do not repeat each year as business typically  rebrand only every 3 to 5 years or so. The benefit from Southwest last year will be a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the third quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's third quarter. Please note that the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in SG&A. Excluding this onetime payment, this year's third quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.6% last year. SG&A benefited from improved receivables collections and favorable Worker's Compensation claims experience. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A, excluding the onetime payment, is up 50 basis points over last year. However, note that current year SG&A is negatively impacted about 100 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense, resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition and incremental SAP depreciation and implementation cost. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed cost and making good progress on reducing general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. 
As Mike stated earlier, our third quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate on continuing operations benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The benefit of the Tax Act to the third quarter EPS was $1.59. Our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes an effective tax rate of 24.0%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation expense realized each period. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $152 million, and we had $33 million in marketable securities as of quarter end. Free cash flow in the first 9 months of fiscal 2018 was $464 million, an increase of $200 million or 75% from the prior year period. 
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of the fiscal year were $196 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 9-month period was as follows:$163 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $21 million in First Aid and Safety and $12 million in All Other. We expect fourth quarter 2018 CapEx to be approximately [ $65 million. ] 
As of February 28th, total debt was $2,722,000,000, consisting of [ $187 million ] in short-term debts and $2,535,000,000 of long-term debt. At February 28, our leverage was 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA. Overall, our cash flow remain strong, and we expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

But those were the estimated third quarter numbers. From a revenue synergy standpoint, we think opportunities are going to be there. We are moving somewhat slowly on that because we want to make sure that through the large disruption of closing and system conversions that we maintain a very good customer relationship and introducing new things to them in addition to that kind of disruption, gets to be overwhelming some time. So we're moving fairly slowly on that. I would expect it will start to see some benefit in the back half of fiscal '19 and certainly in fiscal '20.

Generally speaking, if we hit the top of that guidance range in the fourth quarter, I would expect that the legacy Cintas business may see a little bit of an uptick in organic growth in that fourth quarter.

About half is G&A and the other half would be in the gross margin. So from a G&A perspective, you probably saw our third quarter that we're making some nice progress in terms of leveraging and getting that SG&A down from post acquisition levels. So we're making some nice progress and we have more to do. So for example, we still have an IT presence from the legacy G&K team as we continue to roll off of that system. And so there will be some additional things to come, but we've made some really nice progress. The other bucket that we talked about are our production bucket. That is the cost of running our facilities. And as you can imagine, we're in the midst of closing a number of facilities and converting. And so while we have set up a lot of those synergies, there is some inefficiency that's going on right now in our third quarter, a little bit in our second quarter, certainly a little bit more in our fourth quarter as we do the things necessary to achieve those. So for example, we're doing a pretty good job of getting those locations closed and eliminating some duplicate labor and other costs. And we'll get more efficient as we move away from the integration market by market. But the production has come along very well, and we still expect the same kind of results that we put out a year ago. From a service perspective, I haven't done much of that heavy lifting yet. That -- as we've talked about in the past, we need to get on the same systems and markets before we can really start to get into route optimization. We've started some of that in some markets. We'll continue to do that at our fourth quarter, but likely, even more heavy lifting in the first half of fiscal '19. But indications are we still feel good about capturing those synergies that we talked about. And the last bucket was the sourcing bucket, and we are making progress on that area as well. As you probably know, it takes longer to recognize that because we may be able to get new sourcing and new pricing, but it takes a little while to purchase it, saw it out, get it into our distribution center and get it into in-service inventory and then it starts to amortizing, right? So we are making the -- some really nice progress there, it just takes more time to realize it. So all in all, Judah, feel good about all 4 of those markets."

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
In a moment, we're going to share with you our third quarter results, which represent another strong quarter of execution and performance. There's a lot of noise in our results. So we'll do our best to help you decipher the performance of the business. Before diving into the numbers though, we thought it fitting to recognize that yesterday was the anniversary of the closing of G&K Services deal. The past year has been quite transformative for Cintas. Our employees, whom we call partners, including our partners who came to us from G&K, have done some great foundational work over the last year to position us for success going forward. We remain as excited as ever about our future. 
In early February, we were thrilled to be able to share with our partners a onetime cash payment. The timing couldn't have been better for us given the work done during the past year since March 21 of 2017. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, indicated in today's press release, the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation is good for Cintas, our shareholders and our customers. And again, our success wouldn't have been possible without our motivated and engaged partners, and we were excited to share it with them. 
Moving on to our third quarter results. Our revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1,589,000,000, an increase of 26.6% over last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.5%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10%. 
Reported operating income for the third quarter of $200 million compare to $192 million in last year's third quarter. However, there are some items worth noting that impacted the comparability of results year-over-year. First, our operating income was reduced $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18 and $9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Second, operating income in the third quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced by the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners that I just mentioned, which amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million. Excluding these 2 items, our third quarter operating income was approximately $250 million or 15.7% of revenue. This measurement is consistent with the way in which we reported our first 2 quarters of this fiscal year. Keep in mind that operating income includes $12 million of intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and $5 million of incremental depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP. These 2 items total 1.2% of revenue. 
Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of $296 million increased 152.9% from last year's third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the third quarter were $2.66 compared to $1.06 in last year's third quarter. Again, there were a handful of items that impacted the comparability of net income and EPS results to prior year: First, fiscal '18 and fiscal '17 third quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.06 from G&K transaction and integration expenses. Second, fiscal '18 third quarter EPS also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners. Lastly, more than offsetting these negative impacts was a significant benefit to EPS of $1.59 from the benefits of the new Tax Act. Excluding these items, to provide better visibility to financial performance, net income dollars increased 24.1% and net income margin was 9.6% compared to 9.8% last year, and EPS increased 22.3%. Note again that net income includes intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and incremental depreciation and implementation cost of SAP. These 2 items, net of tax, total 0.8% of revenue or $0.12. 
In addition to strong execution on the fundamentals, our third quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important long-term investments: G&K and SAP. The integration of G&K remains on track. We have now closed 60 duplicate operations, which is 95% of the total planned closures. Also, 59% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This is an increase from 47% at the end of the second quarter. The system conversions are very important as they are necessary for us to achieve numerous operational synergies. These activities helped us in the third quarter to realize about $15 million in synergies, which is in line with our expectations. Regarding SAP, significant advancement continued in our implementation, which remains on schedule. In our third quarter, 24 operations were converted. A total of 79 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 25% of the total planned. 
As I have previously detailed, we have several third quarter items, including the benefit of tax reform, that make the comparability of our full fiscal year results to prior year complex. Rather than provide full fiscal year guidance, we believe it's more beneficial, for the sake of simplicity, to provide specific guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,625,000,000 to $1,645,000,000. I want to reiterate a point we have made in the past: In our upcoming fourth quarter, we will lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's growth will be organic as opposed to inorganic. In the fourth quarter, we will report an organic growth rate that is the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized acquired G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas and that will have declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With the investment in selling resources having already been made to grow the G&K business, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to accelerate as we move through fiscal 2019. 
For our fiscal 2018 quarter, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. Guidance assumes a fourth quarter tax rate of 24%. We anticipate healthy fourth quarter operating margins in excess of last year's fourth quarter. Note that while the EPS guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the fourth quarter as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $10 million to $15 million. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter ad",1114,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter adds an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter will contain 66 days, the same number of days as the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,284,000,000, an increase of 30.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.1% for the third quarter compared to 45.1% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margin is attributable to the inclusion in this year's third quarter of the lower margin G&K business. The margin of the G&K business has continued to decline as the top line has lowered. In addition, we continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. While the assimilation of the G&K business continues at a great pace -- Mike mentioned 95% of duplicate operations have been closed, more work remains. The G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. We are on track. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $137 million, which was 10.5% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.0%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the third quarter compared to 44.8% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 210 basis points. The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for this business. Strong new business wins and expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses of all types place on having Cintas manage their first aid and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and ready for the workday. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 17.0% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 14.9%. All Other gross margin was 41.7% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% for last year's third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the higher-margin fire business. 
While Uniform Direct Sale business growth was strong in the third quarter, note that the business will face some difficult sales growth comparisons in the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from a significant roll-out of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large roll-outs such as these do not repeat each year as business typically rebrand only every 3 to 5 years or so. The benefit from Southwest last year will be a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the third quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's third quarter. Please note that the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in SG&A. Excluding this onetime payment, this year's third quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.6% last year. SG&A benefited from improved receivables collections and favorable workers' compensation claims experience. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A, excluding the onetime payment, is up 50 basis points over last year. However, note that current year SG&A is negatively impacted about 100 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition and incremental SAP depreciation and implementation costs. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs and making good progress on reducing general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. 
As Mike stated earlier, our third quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate on continuing operations benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The benefit of the Tax Act to the third quarter EPS was $1.59. Our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes an effective tax rate of 24.0%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve build and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation expense realized each period. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $152 million, and we had $33 million in marketable securities as of quarter end. Free cash flow in the first 9 months of fiscal 2018 was $464 million, an increase of $200 million or 75% from the prior year period. 
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of the fiscal year were $196 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 9-month period was as follows: $163 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $21 million in First Aid and Safety and $12 million in All Other. We expect fourth quarter 2018 CapEx to be approximately $65 million.
As of February 28, total debt was $2,722,000,000, consisting of $187 million in short-term debts and $2,535,000,000 of long-term debt. At February 28, our leverage was 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA. Overall, our cash flow remains strong, and we expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

But those were the estimated third quarter numbers. From a revenue synergy standpoint, we think opportunities are going to be there. We are moving somewhat slowly on that because we want to make sure that through the large disruption of closing and system conversions that we maintain a very good customer relationship, and introducing new things to them in addition to that kind of disruption gets to be overwhelming sometimes. So we're moving fairly slowly on that. I would expect it will start to see some benefit in the back half of fiscal '19 and certainly in fiscal '20.

So for example, we're doing a pretty good job of getting those locations closed and eliminating some duplicate labor and other costs. And we'll get more efficient as we move away from the integration market by market. But the production has come along very well, and we still expect the same kind of results that we put out a year ago. From a service perspective, I haven't done much of that heavy lifting yet. That -- as we've talked about in the past, we need to get on the same systems in markets before we can really start to get into route optimization. We've started some of that in some markets. We'll continue to do that in our fourth quarter but likely, even more heavy lifting in the first half of fiscal '19. But indications are we still feel good about capturing those synergies that we talked about. And the last bucket was the sourcing bucket, and we are making progress on that area as well. As you probably know, it takes longer to recognize that because we may be able to get new sourcing and new pricing but it takes a little while to purchase it, [ sew ] it out, get it into our distribution center and get it into in-service inventory and then it starts amortizing, right. So we are making the -- some really nice progress there. It just takes more time to realize it. So all in all, Judah, I feel good about all 4 of those buckets."

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
In a moment, we're going to share with you our third quarter results, which represent another strong quarter of execution and performance. There's a lot of noise in our results. So we'll do our best to help you decipher the performance of the business. Before diving into the numbers though, we thought it fitting to recognize that yesterday was the anniversary of the closing of G&K Services deal. The past year has been quite transformative for Cintas. Our employees, whom we call partners, including our partners who came to us from G&K, have done some great foundational work over the last year to position us for success going forward. We remain as excited as ever about our future. 
In early February, we were thrilled to be able to share with our partners a onetime cash payment. The timing couldn't have been better for us given the work done during the past year since March 21 of 2017. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, indicated in today's press release, the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation is good for Cintas, our shareholders and our customers. And again, our success wouldn't have been possible without our motivated and engaged partners, and we were excited to share it with them. 
Moving on to our third quarter results. Our revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1,589,000,000, an increase of 26.6% over last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.5%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10%. 
Reported operating income for the third quarter of $200 million compare to $192 million in last year's third quarter. However, there are some items worth noting that impacted the comparability of results year-over-year. First, our operating income was reduced $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18 and $9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Second, operating income in the third quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced by the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners that I just mentioned, which amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million. Excluding these 2 items, our third quarter operating income was approximately $250 million or 15.7% of revenue. This measurement is consistent with the way in which we reported our first 2 quarters of this fiscal year. Keep in mind that operating income includes $12 million of intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and $5 million of incremental depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP. These 2 items total 1.2% of revenue. 
Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of $296 million increased 152.9% from last year's third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the third quarter were $2.66 compared to $1.06 in last year's third quarter. Again, there were a handful of items that impacted the comparability of net income and EPS results to prior year: First, fiscal '18 and fiscal '17 third quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.06 from G&K transaction and integration expenses. Second, fiscal '18 third quarter EPS also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners. Lastly, more than offsetting these negative impacts was a significant benefit to EPS of $1.59 from the benefits of the new Tax Act. Excluding these items, to provide better visibility to financial performance, net income dollars increased 24.1% and net income margin was 9.6% compared to 9.8% last year, and EPS increased 22.3%. Note again that net income includes intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and incremental depreciation and implementation cost of SAP. These 2 items, net of tax, total 0.8% of revenue or $0.12. 
In addition to strong execution on the fundamentals, our third quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important long-term investments: G&K and SAP. The integration of G&K remains on track. We have now closed 60 duplicate operations, which is 95% of the total planned closures. Also, 59% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This is an increase from 47% at the end of the second quarter. The system conversions are very important as they are necessary for us to achieve numerous operational synergies. These activities helped us in the third quarter to realize about $15 million in synergies, which is in line with our expectations. Regarding SAP, significant advancement continues in our implementation, which remains on schedule. In our third quarter, 24 operations were converted. A total of 79 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 25% of the total planned. 
As I have previously detailed, we have several third quarter items, including the benefit of tax reform, that make the comparability of our full fiscal year results to prior year complex. Rather than provide full fiscal year guidance, we believe it's more beneficial, for the sake of simplicity, to provide specific guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,625,000,000 to $1,645,000,000. I want to reiterate a point we have made in the past: In our upcoming fourth quarter, we will lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's growth will be organic as opposed to inorganic. In the fourth quarter, we will report an organic growth rate that is the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized acquired G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas and that will have declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With the investment in selling resources having already been made to grow the G&K business, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to accelerate as we move through fiscal 2019. 
For our fiscal 2018 quarter, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. Guidance assumes a fourth quarter tax rate of 24%. We anticipate healthy fourth quarter operating margins in excess of last year's fourth quarter. Note that while the EPS guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the fourth quarter as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $10 million to $15 million. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."
260725,556193067,1423746,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2018",2018-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter ad",1114,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter adds an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter will contain 66 days, the same number of days as the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,284,000,000, an increase of 30.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.1% for the third quarter compared to 45.1% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margin is attributable to the inclusion in this year's third quarter of the lower margin G&K business. The margin of the G&K business has continued to decline as the top line has lowered. In addition, we continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. While the assimilation of the G&K business continues at a great pace -- Mike mentioned 95% of duplicate operations have been closed, more work remains. The G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. We are on track. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $137 million, which was 10.5% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.0%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the third quarter compared to 44.8% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 210 basis points. The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for this business. Strong new business wins and expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses of all types place on having Cintas manage their first aid and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and ready for the workday. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 17.0% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 14.9%. All Other gross margin was 41.7% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% for last year's third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the higher-margin fire business. 
While Uniform Direct Sale business growth was strong in the third quarter, note that the business will face some difficult sales growth comparisons in the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from a significant roll-out of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large roll-outs such as these do not repeat each year as business typically rebrand only every 3 to 5 years or so. The benefit from Southwest last year will be a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the third quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's third quarter. Please note that the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in SG&A. Excluding this onetime payment, this year's third quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.6% last year. SG&A benefited from improved receivables collections and favorable workers' compensation claims experience. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A, excluding the onetime payment, is up 50 basis points over last year. However, note that current year SG&A is negatively impacted about 100 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition and incremental SAP depreciation and implementation costs. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs and making good progress on reducing general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. 
As Mike stated earlier, our third quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate on continuing operations benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The benefit of the Tax Act to the third quarter EPS was $1.59. Our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes an effective tax rate of 24.0%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation expense realized each period. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $152 million, and we had $33 million in marketable securities as of quarter end. Free cash flow in the first 9 months of fiscal 2018 was $464 million, an increase of $200 million or 75% from the prior year period. 
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of the fiscal year were $196 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 9-month period was as follows: $163 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $21 million in First Aid and Safety and $12 million in All Other. We expect fourth quarter 2018 CapEx to be approximately $65 million.
As of February 28, total debt was $2,722,000,000, consisting of $187 million in short-term debts and $2,535,000,000 of long-term debt. At February 28, our leverage was 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA. Overall, our cash flow remains strong, and we expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

I would tell you, Greg, that being able to specifically identify that G&K revenue gets harder and harder as we have, as you heard us say, closed 60 locations and now that revenue is really starting to mix in with the Cintas locations, so getting a little harder and harder to identify. But those were the estimated third quarter numbers. From a revenue synergy standpoint, we think opportunities are going to be there. We are moving somewhat slowly on that because we want to make sure that through the large disruption of closing and system conversions that we maintain a very good customer relationship, and introducing new things to them in addition to that kind of disruption gets to be overwhelming sometimes. So we're moving fairly slowly on that. I would expect it will start to see some benefit in the back half of fiscal '19 and certainly in fiscal '20.

About half is G&A, and the other half would be in the gross margin. So from a G&A perspective, you probably saw in our third quarter that we're making some nice progress in terms of leveraging and getting that SG&A down from post-acquisition levels. So we're making some nice progress, and we have more to do. So for example, we still have an IT presence from the legacy G&K team as we continue to roll off of that system. And so there will be some additional things to come, but we've made some really nice progress. The other bucket that we talked about are our production bucket. That is the cost of running our facilities. And as you can imagine, we're in the midst of closing a number of facilities and converting. And so while we have set up a lot of those synergies, there is some inefficiency that's going on right now in our third quarter, a little bit in our second quarter, certainly a little bit more in our fourth quarter as we do the things necessary to achieve those. So for example, we're doing a pretty good job of getting those locations closed and eliminating some duplicate labor and other costs. And we'll get more efficient as we move away from the integration market by market. But the production has come along very well, and we still expect the same kind of results that we put out a year ago. From a service perspective, I haven't done much of that heavy lifting yet. That -- as we've talked about in the past, we need to get on the same systems in markets before we can really start to get into route optimization. We've started some of that in some markets. We'll continue to do that in our fourth quarter but likely, even more heavy lifting in the first half of fiscal '19. But indications are we still feel good about capturing those synergies that we talked about. And the last bucket was the sourcing bucket, and we are making progress on that area as well. As you probably know, it takes longer to recognize that because we may be able to get new sourcing and new pricing but it takes a little while to purchase it, [ sew ] it out, get it into our distribution center and get it into in-service inventory and then it starts amortizing, right. So we are making the -- some really nice progress there. It just takes more time to realize it. So all in all, Judah, I feel good about all 4 of those buckets."

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
In a moment, we're going to share with you our third quarter results, which represent another strong quarter of execution and performance. There's a lot of noise in our results. So we'll do our best to help you decipher the performance of the business. Before diving into the numbers though, we thought it fitting to recognize that yesterday was the anniversary of the closing of G&K Services deal. The past year has been quite transformative for Cintas. Our employees, whom we call partners, including our partners who came to us from G&K, have done some great foundational work over the last year to position us for success going forward. We remain as excited as ever about our future. 
In early February, we were thrilled to be able to share with our partners a onetime cash payment. The timing couldn't have been better for us given the work done during the past year since March 21 of 2017. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, indicated in today's press release, the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation is good for Cintas, our shareholders and our customers. And again, our success wouldn't have been possible without our motivated and engaged partners, and we were excited to share it with them. 
Moving on to our third quarter results. Our revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1,589,000,000, an increase of 26.6% over last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.5%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10%. 
Reported operating income for the third quarter of $200 million compare to $192 million in last year's third quarter. However, there are some items worth noting that impacted the comparability of results year-over-year. First, our operating income was reduced $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18 and $9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Second, operating income in the third quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced by the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners that I just mentioned, which amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million. Excluding these 2 items, our third quarter operating income was approximately $250 million or 15.7% of revenue. This measurement is consistent with the way in which we reported our first 2 quarters of this fiscal year. Keep in mind that operating income includes $12 million of intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and $5 million of incremental depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP. These 2 items total 1.2% of revenue. 
Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of $296 million increased 152.9% from last year's third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the third quarter were $2.66 compared to $1.06 in last year's third quarter. Again, there were a handful of items that impacted the comparability of net income and EPS results to prior year: First, fiscal '18 and fiscal '17 third quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.06 from G&K transaction and integration expenses. Second, fiscal '18 third quarter EPS also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners. Lastly, more than offsetting these negative impacts was a significant benefit to EPS of $1.59 from the benefits of the new Tax Act. Excluding these items, to provide better visibility to financial performance, net income dollars increased 24.1% and net income margin was 9.6% compared to 9.8% last year, and EPS increased 22.3%. Note again that net income includes intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and incremental depreciation and implementation cost of SAP. These 2 items, net of tax, total 0.8% of revenue or $0.12. 
In addition to strong execution on the fundamentals, our third quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important long-term investments: G&K and SAP. The integration of G&K remains on track. We have now closed 60 duplicate operations, which is 95% of the total planned closures. Also, 59% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This is an increase from 47% at the end of the second quarter. The system conversions are very important as they are necessary for us to achieve numerous operational synergies. These activities helped us in the third quarter to realize about $15 million in synergies, which is in line with our expectations. Regarding SAP, significant advancement continues in our implementation, which remains on schedule. In our third quarter, 24 operations were converted. A total of 79 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 25% of the total planned. 
As I have previously detailed, we have several third quarter items, including the benefit of tax reform, that make the comparability of our full fiscal year results to prior year complex. Rather than provide full fiscal year guidance, we believe it's more beneficial, for the sake of simplicity, to provide specific guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,625,000,000 to $1,645,000,000. I want to reiterate a point we have made in the past: In our upcoming fourth quarter, we will lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's growth will be organic as opposed to inorganic. In the fourth quarter, we will report an organic growth rate that is the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized acquired G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas and that will have declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With the investment in selling resources having already been made to grow the G&K business, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to accelerate as we move through fiscal 2019. 
For our fiscal 2018 quarter, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. Guidance assumes a fourth quarter tax rate of 24%. We anticipate healthy fourth quarter operating margins in excess of last year's fourth quarter. Note that while the EPS guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the fourth quarter as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $10 million to $15 million. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."
260725,556193067,1424078,"Cintas Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2018",2018-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter ad",1114,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter adds an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter will contain 66 days, the same number of days as the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,284,000,000, an increase of 30.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.1% for the third quarter compared to 45.1% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margin is attributable to the inclusion in this year's third quarter of the lower margin G&K business. The margin of the G&K business has continued to decline as the top line has lowered. In addition, we continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. While the assimilation of the G&K business continues at a great pace -- Mike mentioned 95% of duplicate operations have been closed, more work remains. The G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. We are on track. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $137 million, which was 10.5% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.0%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the third quarter compared to 44.8% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 210 basis points. The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for this business. Strong new business wins and expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses of all types place on having Cintas manage their first aid and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and ready for the workday. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 17.0% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 14.9%. All Other gross margin was 41.7% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% for last year's third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the higher-margin fire business. 
While Uniform Direct Sale business growth was strong in the third quarter, note that the business will face some difficult sales growth comparisons in the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from a significant roll-out of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large roll-outs such as these do not repeat each year as business typically rebrand only every 3 to 5 years or so. The benefit from Southwest last year will be a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the third quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's third quarter. Please note that the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in SG&A. Excluding this onetime payment, this year's third quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.6% last year. SG&A benefited from improved receivables collections and favorable workers' compensation claims experience. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A, excluding the onetime payment, is up 50 basis points over last year. However, note that current year SG&A is negatively impacted about 100 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition and incremental SAP depreciation and implementation costs. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs and making good progress on reducing general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. 
As Mike stated earlier, our third quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate on continuing operations benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The benefit of the Tax Act to the third quarter EPS was $1.59. Our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes an effective tax rate of 24.0%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation expense realized each period. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $152 million, and we had $33 million in marketable securities as of quarter end. Free cash flow in the first 9 months of fiscal 2018 was $464 million, an increase of $200 million or 75% from the prior year period. 
Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of the fiscal year were $196 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 9-month period was as follows: $163 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $21 million in First Aid and Safety and $12 million in All Other. We expect fourth quarter 2018 CapEx to be approximately $65 million.
As of February 28, total debt was $2,722,000,000, consisting of $187 million in short-term debts and $2,535,000,000 of long-term debt. At February 28, our leverage was 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA. Overall, our cash flow remains strong, and we expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

But those were the estimated third quarter numbers. From a revenue synergy standpoint, we think opportunities are going to be there. We are moving somewhat slowly on that because we want to make sure that through the large disruption of closing and system conversions that we maintain a very good customer relationship, and introducing new things to them in addition to that kind of disruption gets to be overwhelming sometimes.

About half is G&A, and the other half would be in the gross margin. So from a G&A perspective, you probably saw in our third quarter that we're making some nice progress in terms of leveraging and getting that SG&A down from post-acquisition levels. So we're making some nice progress, and we have more to do. So for example, we still have an IT presence from the legacy G&K team as we continue to roll off of that system. And so there will be some additional things to come, but we've made some really nice progress. The other bucket that we talked about are our production bucket. That is the cost of running our facilities. And as you can imagine, we're in the midst of closing a number of facilities and converting. And so while we have set up a lot of those synergies, there is some inefficiency that's going on right now in our third quarter, a little bit in our second quarter, certainly a little bit more in our fourth quarter as we do the things necessary to achieve those. So for example, we're doing a pretty good job of getting those locations closed and eliminating some duplicate labor and other costs. And we'll get more efficient as we move away from the integration market by market. But the production has come along very well, and we still expect the same kind of results that we put out a year ago. From a service perspective, I haven't done much of that heavy lifting yet. That -- as we've talked about in the past, we need to get on the same systems in markets before we can really start to get into route optimization. We've started some of that in some markets. We'll continue to do that in our fourth quarter but likely, even more heavy lifting in the first half of fiscal '19. But indications are we still feel good about capturing those synergies that we talked about. And the last bucket was the sourcing bucket, and we are making progress on that area as well. As you probably know, it takes longer to recognize that because we may be able to get new sourcing and new pricing but it takes a little while to purchase it, [ sew ] it out, get it into our distribution center and get it into in-service inventory and then it starts amortizing, right. So we are making the -- some really nice progress there. It just takes more time to realize it. So all in all, Judah, I feel good about all 4 of those buckets."

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. 
Our revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,670,000,000, an increase of 9.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.1%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 5.3%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.4%. Note that the lower rate of organic revenue growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility services segment was expected, and as we have previously communicated, was due to the inclusion for the first time of the acquired G&K Services business and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue. 
Reported operating income for the fourth quarter was $265 million compared to $177 million in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was reduced [ $15 million ] in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and [ $63 million ] in the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our fourth quarter operating income grew 16.4%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.8% compared to 15.8% last year. 
In March, we gave fourth quarter EPS guidance in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. That excluded G&K integration expenses and it assumes an effective tax rate of 24%. Against this guidance, fourth quarter EPS was $1.77. Our tax rate was slightly better than the guided 24%, and this resulted in a benefit of $0.04. The remaining beat of guidance was primarily due to higher revenue than expected. 
We're pleased with these fourth quarter results and our full year performance. Our fiscal '18 results extended our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 47 of the past 49 years with the only exception being the 2 years of the Great Recession. For the eighth consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high single-digit range, and we continue to grow revenue by multiples greater than both gross domestic product and employment. 
Strong execution on the fundamentals is a hallmark of Cintas, but fiscal '18's achievement was especially noteworthy given that it occurred in a period of extreme change management. While delivering solid returns to shareholders in 2018, we also made significant progress on 2 important investments: G&K and SAP. The first year of the integration of the largest acquisition in Cintas' history required expertise of every part of the organization, including sales, production, service, global supply chain, IT, engineering, HR and finance. Very important tasks included winning the hearts and minds of acquired employees whom we call partners and earning the trust of acquired customers through our outstanding service. Our partners ran our acquisition playbook and effectively adjusted where necessary. We have now closed nearly all operations necessary to eliminate redundancies, which is 63 operations to date. All G&K locations, 148 in total, have been converted to Cintas operating systems. About 1,500 G&K trucks have been painted and rebranded as Cintas. Important integration work still remains for fiscal 2019, but after our first year of integration efforts, we are still on track to the achievement of our synergy commitments. 
When we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio rose to about 3.1x. Our commitment was to return our leverage to a target of about 2x in 3 years. We are now there and are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. 
Fiscal 2018 was also a year of tremendous technological change. In addition to moving G&K locations to Cintas systems, we continue to convert our operating system from a homegrown system to that of SAP. And information system conversion is like an acquisition integration in that it requires involvement of experts from all departments of the company, including operations, sales and corporate support. The conversion of each operation to SAP is an 8-month process. Our employees are coached on change management. Data standardization activities are performed, garments are scanned and inventory and employees are trained and certified. Customers are notified of changes to invoice appearance and introduced to improvements in doing business with us because of the technology enhancements. Training and care continue for 2 months following the go live date of the new system. A total of 108 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 34% of the total planned. 
Looking ahead to -- looking ahead, fiscal 2019 will share some similarities with fiscal '18. We will continue to integrate G&K and realize more of the $130 million to $140 million in anticipated annual synergies. We expect to realize $90 million to $95 million in synergies in fiscal 2019 or $32 million to $37 million in incremental synergies. In addition, efforts will continue to convert more operations to the new SAP ERP system. 
Like fiscal '18, inefficiencies will exist as our partners make further progress on acquisition integration and the system implementations while executing on the day today for our customers. However, we expect to extend our streak of profitable growth to 48 out of the past 50 years. We will accomplish that via the solid execution that our shareholders have come to expect. 
One important area in which fiscal '19 will differ from fiscal '18 is in capital allocation. With $600 million of acquisition debt repaid and our leverage target achieved, we return to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We are honored to have been recently included in the Fortune 500 as #500. As our CEO, Scott Farmer, has stated, this accomplishment is built on our strong sense of culture, principles and values and reflects our strong financial growth, expanding line of products and services and innovative technologies. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employee partners. We're not satisfied with being #500, though, and our continued progression higher into that ranking starts in fiscal '19. Our expectations for fiscal '19 are for annual revenue to be in the range of $6,750,000,000 to $6,820,000,000. 
I stated earlier that in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we'll lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's revenue was organic as opposed to inorganic. This resulted in a lower organic growth rate due to the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With continued investment in selling resources, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter and then strengthen as we move through fiscal '19. 
We expect fiscal '19 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7 to $7.15. Let me make a few comments about this EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 114 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million in fiscal '19. The guidance does include the impact of a changed our Cintas partner retirement policy in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. This change results in a shorter time period over which future stock-based compensation grants will be amortized. It is a noncash impact, and it is expected to increase stock-based compensation expense by roughly $20 million in fiscal '19. And lastly, the guidance also includes the impact of adoption of the accounting standard update 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers. With the adoption, we expect the following: fiscal '19 revenue will be negatively affected by roughly $8 million along with the loss of the incremental operating margins associated with that revenue. SG&A, however, will benefit from the capitalization of sales recognition payments and the subsequent amortization of those commissions over the expected service period of our contracts. This is also a noncash impact, and we expect the net benefit to be roughly $16 million to $19 million. Overall, these last 2 noncash items included in guidance will both be recorded in SG&A and generally will offset each other to have only a minor negative impact. 
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to Philip Haloman, who is retiring from Cintas this month. Philip has been with Cintas for 22 years and has been our President and Chief Operating Officer for the past 10 years. In our press release last month in which Scott Farmer thanked Philip for his many contributions, Scott said, those of us who have had the privilege of working with Philip know that Cintas is a better company because of him and he will be missed. Thanks again, Philip. 
Philip's retirement has led to several other leadership changes at Cintas. Scott Farmer announced the promotion of Todd Schneider to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer with the responsibility of leading all of our business divisions. Todd has been with Cintas for 29 years and has been a rental division President and Chief Operating Officer for the last 5 years, leading our largest business through a very successful period and most notably, leading us through the integration of G&K. Scott also announced the promotion of Mike Thompson to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Administration Officer. Mike has been with Cintas for 24 years and has been Cintas's Chief Information Officer for the last 5 years, most notably leading us through our SAP conversion. Mike will continue to lead our IT efforts and will also be responsible for our global supply chain and our safety and engineering groups. These changes are part of our normal succession planning process. And as we move into our fiscal '19-year, we remain as excited as ever about the future of Cintas. 
I'll now turn the call over to Paul."

We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,342,000,000, an increase of 10.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.3%. As Mike stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the inclusion of G&K and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue for the first time. We expect the organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and strengthen as we move through the fiscal year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. While we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and ERP system implementation, we are realizing the expected cost synergies, which are benefiting our margins. The synergies plus better-than-expected revenue also enabled us to overcome an almost 20 basis point increase in energy expenses. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $147 million, which was 9.9% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 9.4%. This segment's gross margin was 47.0% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.5% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 250 basis points. The significant amount of margin expansion was fueled in large part due to the realization of synergies from the ZEE Medical acquisition. With the synergies now realized in full, we expect margin expansion to continue in fiscal '19 but at a normalized rate. 
The fourth quarter was another outstanding quarter for the segment. Organic growth continue to be strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account wins. The solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses place on having Cintas manage their first aid safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy and safe. The future of the first aid business segment remains bright. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. 
All Other revenue was $179 million, an increase of 1.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 0.2%. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was double digits. However, the strong performance was offset by a difficult revenue comparison for the Uniform Direct Sales business. In last year's fourth quarter, uniform Direct Sale revenue included the rollout of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large rollouts such as these do not repeat each year as businesses typically rebrand every 3 to 5 years. The benefit from Southwest last year was a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue. All Other gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to [ 42.8% ] for last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the fire business. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A benefited from favorable workers compensation claims experience. In addition, we are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The effective tax rate, excluding G&K integration expenses, was 22.1%. Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period. 
Our cash and equivalents balance as on May 31 was $138 million. Free cash flow in fiscal '18 was $692 million, an increase of $201 million or 41% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 were $271 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the year was as follows: $225 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $28 million in First Aid and Safety and $18 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million. 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we repatriated about $110 million of international cash. We used the fund to pay down debts and to buyback stock. In the quarter, we purchased about $90 million in Cintas stock and $410 million remain on the share buyback authorization approved by the Board of Directors. As of May 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000. At May 31, our leverage was 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA. 
As Mike stated earlier, when we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, we committed to return our leverage to a target of about 2x in 3 years. We are pleased to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. We are excited to have returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We face legacy like competition as well as other catalog type competitors, and so that's not going away. So I don't think that's going to have much of an impact on the pricing environment. From the standpoint of the revenue synergies, we're moving cautiously as we have as we've talked about in the past. But we have begun to introduce some of the products where we can, where we have converted systems or where we have integrated routes into Cintas locations. And while it's early and we haven't seen any notable impact, it's anecdotally positive so far. So I would say as we continue to move through this year, we've got a lot of integration activity left, and we're going to continue to introduce Cintas products and services to those customers.

And George, as we move into this year, it's hard to think about that business as being separate at all. It's -- so many of the locations have been absorbed into legacy Cintas locations or traded volume. So it's really hard to look at it separately. However, as we were working through the integration of last year, one of the biggest pieces was coming out of the closing of that deal. We had a sales team at G&K that had been -- it had a tough environment, and we wanted to pull them out of their positions so that we can train them, get them to understand our systems, our products and services. There certainly were open positions that we had to fill, and that has gone very well. But as we talked about in the last several quarters in our business, when you lose that new business momentum for a number of quarters, it takes a little bit of time to reverse that trend. We have done a very good job of training our new salespeople. We have seen the productivity tick up slightly each quarter throughout fiscal '18. And so the thing that will get us back to the Cintas like levels of growth will be a combination of those sales partners being more and more productive and our ability to penetrate the G&K customers like we do with all of our other Cintas customers. So as we mentioned, we expect our first quarter organic growth to be somewhat similar, maybe slightly lower than what we reported here in this fourth quarter for our rental business. But we expect to see some improvement as we then go through the year to the point where fiscal '20, I would expect, we'd be back to our historical like levels, barring any change in the macro environment."

And while we have only just begun that, that's going to be the largest activity that we have going on in fiscal '19. So we'll start to see some of those routing benefits. And when I talk about routing benefits, what I really mean is improved fuel utilization. We are not looking to eliminate routes. What we're really looking to do is make all of our routes more efficient and give them -- give our SSRs more time with our customers. But that's going to be a big project, and there will be -- we will start to see some of that benefit. We have already gotten a lot of G&A benefits and we still have some more to go. But that will be a lesser component in year 2 than the production impact. And then we'll start to see some sourcing synergies, but I would expect more of those to be in that year 3 and 4.

And as we -- as I was mentioning a little bit earlier, the indirect pieces of those we're keeping our eyes on, but again, it's a wildcard about how that will impact us. From an energy perspective and fuel perspective, we have modeled that we will see about 20 basis point increase in fuel in fiscal '19. And we're seeing that already in June in our prices at the pump. And from a labor perspective, we certainly are starting to see the tightening of labor. It's not affecting us widespread, but it certainly is an impact. And we're keeping our eyes on how do we manage the best we can and be as efficient as we can. And one way to do that is to really work on our partner retention.

But when we see these spikes, in order for it to impact our P&L, it's got to be a long time of that spike. In other words, it has to last through the production of our garments, the shipping of those into our distribution center, sitting on our DC for return, then getting out into our rental locations where it begins to amortize generally over 18 months. So in that first months of shipping into the rental location, we see [ 1 18th ] of the impact.

Now we are certainly cautious because the -- our goal through this process is to minimize the disruption to the customer. And so we always have to keep that in mind, but we will make those routes more efficient. And sometimes, that means moving the processing of certain customers from one location to the other. And when we do that, that means we have to pull garments out of one location and transport them to the other location. That receiving location then has to rebarcode all of those garments, enter them into the system. And they have to do a little bit of that production integration all over again. That's an important part of what we're doing. And we're going to be cautious about it because again, we're not -- we want to make sure that we don't disrupt the customer or minimize that.

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,670,000,000, an increase of 9.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.1%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 5.3%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.4%. Note that the lower rate of organic revenue growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the inclusion for the first time of the acquired G&K Services business and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue.
Reported operating income for the fourth quarter was $265 million compared to $177 million in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was reduced $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and $63 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our fourth quarter operating income grew 16.4%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.8% compared to 15.8% last year.
In March, we gave fourth quarter EPS guidance in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. That excluded G&K integration expenses, and it assumed an effective tax rate of 24%. Against this guidance, fourth quarter EPS was $1.77. Our tax rate was slightly better than the guided 24%, and this resulted in a benefit of $0.04. The remaining beat of guidance was primarily due to higher revenue than expected.
We're pleased with these fourth quarter results and our full year performance. Our fiscal '18 results extended our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 47 of the past 49 years with the only exception being the 2 years of the Great Recession. For the eighth consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high single-digit range, and we continue to grow revenue by multiples greater than both gross domestic product and employment.
Strong execution on the fundamentals is a hallmark of Cintas, but fiscal '18's achievement was especially noteworthy given that it occurred in a period of extreme change management. While delivering solid returns to shareholders in 2018, we also made significant progress on 2 important investments: G&K and SAP. The first year of the integration of the largest acquisition in Cintas history required the expertise of every part of the organization, including sales, production, service, global supply chain, IT, engineering, HR and finance. Very important tasks included winning the hearts and minds of acquired employees whom we call partners and earning the trust of acquired customers through our outstanding service. Our partners ran our acquisition playbook and effectively adjusted where necessary. We have now closed nearly all operations necessary to eliminate redundancies, which is 63 operations to date. All G&K locations, 148 in total, have been converted to Cintas operating systems. About 1,500 G&K trucks have been painted and rebranded as Cintas. Important integration work still remains for fiscal 2019, but after our first year of integration efforts, we are still on track for the achievement of our synergy commitments.
When we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio rose to about 3.1x. Our commitment was to return our leverage to a target of about 2x in 3 years. We are now there and are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations.
Fiscal '18 was also a year of tremendous technological change. In addition to moving G&K locations to Cintas systems, we continue to convert our operating system from a homegrown system to that of SAP. And information system conversion is like an acquisition integration in that it requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company, including operations, sales and corporate support. The conversion of each operation to SAP is an 8-month process. Our employees are coached on change management. Data standardization activities are performed. Garments are scanned and inventoried, and employees are trained and certified. Customers are notified of changes to invoice appearance and introduced to improvements in doing business with us because of the technology enhancements. Training and care continue for 2 months following the go-live date of the new system. A total of 108 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 34% of the total planned.
Looking ahead to -- looking ahead, fiscal 2019 will share some similarities with fiscal '18. We will continue to integrate G&K and realize more of the $130 million to $140 million in anticipated annual synergies. We expect to realize $90 million to $95 million in synergies in fiscal 2019 or $32 million to $37 million in incremental synergies. In addition, efforts will continue to convert more operations to the new SAP ERP system.
Like fiscal '18, inefficiencies will exist as our partners make further progress on acquisition integration and system implementations while executing on the day-to-day for our customers. However, we expect to extend our streak of profitable growth to 48 out of the past 50 years. We will accomplish that via the solid execution of our -- our shareholders have come to expect.
One important area in which fiscal '19 will differ from fiscal '18 is in capital allocation. With $600 million of acquisition debt repaid and our leverage target achieved, we returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.
We are honored to have been recently included in the Fortune 500 as #500. As our CEO, Scott Farmer, has stated, this accomplishment is built on our strong sense of culture, principles and values and reflects our strong financial growth, expanding line of products and services and innovative technologies. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employee partners. We're not satisfied with being #500, though, and our continued progression higher into that ranking starts in fiscal '19. Our expectations for fiscal '19 are for annual revenue to be in the range of $6,750,000,000 to $6,820,000,000.
I stated earlier that in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's revenue was organic as opposed to inorganic. This resulted in a lower organic growth rate due to the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With continued investment in selling resources, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter and then strengthen as we move through fiscal '19.
We expect fiscal '19 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7 to $7.15. Let me make a few comments about this EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 114 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million in fiscal '19. The guidance does include the impact of a change to our Cintas partner retirement policy in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. This change results in a shorter time period over which future stock-based compensation grants will be amortized. It is a non-cash impact, and it is expected to increase stock-based compensation expense by roughly $20 million in fiscal '19.
And lastly, the guidance also includes the impact of adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. With the adoption, we expect the following. Fiscal '19 revenue will be negatively affected by roughly $8 million along with the loss of the incremental operating margin associated with that revenue. SG&A, however, will benefit from the capitalization of sales rep commission payments and the subsequent amortization of those commissions over the expected service period of our contracts. This is also a non-cash impact, and we expect the net benefit to be roughly $16 million to $19 million. Overall, these last 2 non-cash items included in guidance will both be recorded in SG&A and generally will offset each other to have only a minor negative impact.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to Phillip Holloman, who is retiring from Cintas this month. Phillip has been with Cintas for 22 years and has been our President and Chief Operating Officer for the past 10 years. In our press release last month in which Scott Farmer thanked Phillip for his many contributions, Scott said, ""Those of us who have had the privilege of working with Phillip know that Cintas is a better company because of him, and he will be missed."" Thanks again, Phillip.
Phillip's retirement has led to several other leadership changes at Cintas. Scott Farmer announced the promotion of Todd Schneider to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer with the responsibility of leading all of our business divisions. Todd has been with Cintas for 29 years and has been our Rental division President and Chief Operating Officer for the last 5 years, leading our largest business through a very successful period and most notably, leading us through the integration of G&K.
Scott also announced the promotion of Mike Thompson to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Administration Officer. Mike has been with Cintas for 24 years and has been Cintas' Chief Information Officer for the last 5 years, most notably leading us through our SAP conversion. Mike will continue to lead our IT efforts and will also be responsible for our global supply chain and our safety and engineering groups. These changes are part of our normal succession planning process, and as we move into our fiscal '19 year, we remain as excited as ever about the future of Cintas.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul."
260725,573788953,1504025,"Cintas Corporation, Q4 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2018",2018-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead, there will be no workday differences next year as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number",1073,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead, there will be no workday differences next year as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18.
We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,342,000,000, an increase of 10.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.3%. As Mike stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the inclusion of G&K and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue for the first time. We expect the organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and strengthen as we move through the fiscal year.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. While we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation, we are realizing the expected cost synergies, which are benefiting our margins. These synergies plus better-than-expected revenue also enabled us to overcome an almost 20 basis point increase in energy expenses.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $147 million, which was 9.9% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.4%.
This segment's gross margin was 47.0% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.5% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 250 basis points. The significant amount of margin expansion was fueled in large part due to the realization of synergies from the ZEE Medical acquisition. With the synergies now realized in full, we expect margin expansion to continue in fiscal '19 but at a normalized rate.
The fourth quarter was another outstanding quarter for this segment. Organic growth continued to be strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account wins. The solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses place on having Cintas manage their first aid safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy and safe. The future of the first aid business segment remains bright.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace.
All Other revenue was $179 million, an increase of 1.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 0.2%. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was double digits. However, the strong performance was offset by a difficult revenue comparison for the Uniform Direct Sale business. In last year's fourth quarter, Uniform Direct Sale revenue included the rollouts of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large rollouts such as these do not repeat each year as businesses typically rebrand every 3 to 5 years. The benefit from Southwest last year was a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue.
All Other gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.8% for last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the fire business.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A benefited from favorable workers' compensation claims experience. In addition, we are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The effective tax rate, excluding G&K integration expenses, was 22.1%. Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $138 million. Free cash flow in fiscal '18 was $692 million, an increase of $201 million or 41% from the prior year period.
Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 were $271 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the year was as follows: $225 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $28 million in First Aid and Safety, and $18 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we repatriated about $110 million of international cash. We used the funds to pay down debts and to buy back stock. In the quarter, we purchased about $90 million in Cintas stock, and $410 million remain on the share buyback authorization approved by the Board of Directors. As of May 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000. At May 31, our leverage was 2.1x debt to EBITDA.
As Mike stated earlier, when we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, we committed to return our leverage to a target of about 2x in 3 years. We are pleased to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. We are excited to have returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So from the standpoint of pricing, the pricing environment, I would say, hasn't changed much in the last 90 days since we spoke last. And quite honestly, I don't expect that the consolidation that has happened will have much of an impact on the pricing environment. It's still a very competitive environment. We face legacy like competition as well as other catalog type competitors, and so that's not going away. So I don't think that's going to have much of an impact on the pricing environment. From the standpoint of the revenue synergies, we're moving cautiously as we have as we've talked about in the past. But we have begun to introduce some of the products where we can, where we have converted systems or where we have integrated routes into Cintas locations. And while it's early, and we haven't seen any notable impact, it's anecdotally positive so far. So I would say, as we continue to move through this year, we've got a lot of integration activity left, and we're going to continue to introduce Cintas products and services to those customers. But I would not expect much of an impact at this point in time."

But more than anything from that system, we like the information and the power of that information. And we're not necessarily looking for a significant cost reduction. What we are looking for is more opportunity to make our selling team more productive. So how can we create warmer leads with better information? How can we use that information to be more directive in the way we approach our customers with our various products and services? So we're not looking necessarily for a significant SG&A reduction. We really want to help our selling partners become more efficient."

It's -- so many of the locations have been absorbed into legacy Cintas locations or have traded volume. So it's really hard to look at it separately. However, as we were working through the integration of last year, one of the biggest pieces was coming out of the closing of that deal. We had a sales team at G&K that had been -- had a tough environment, and we wanted to pull them out of their positions so that we can train them, get them to understand our systems, our products and services. There certainly were open positions that we had to fill, and that has gone very well. But as we've talked about in the last several quarters in our business, when you lose that new business momentum for a number of quarters, it takes a little bit of time to reverse that trend. We have done a very good job of training our new salespeople. We have seen the productivity tick up slightly each quarter throughout fiscal '18. And so the thing that will get us back to the Cintas like levels of growth will be a combination of those sales partners being more and more productive and our ability to penetrate the G&K customers like we do with all of our other Cintas customers. So as we mentioned, we expect our first quarter organic growth to be somewhat similar, maybe slightly lower than what we reported here in this fourth quarter for our rental business, but we expect to see some improvement as we then go through the year to the point where fiscal '20, I would expect, we'd be back to our historical like levels, barring any change in the macro environment."

What we're really looking to do is make all of our routes more efficient and give them -- give our SSRs more time with our customers. But that's going to be a big project, and there will be -- we will start to see some of that benefit. We have already gotten a lot of G&A benefits, and we still have some more to go.

From an energy perspective and fuel perspective, we have modeled that we will see about a 20 basis point increase in fuel in fiscal '19, and we're seeing that already in June in our prices at the pump. And from a labor perspective, we certainly are starting to see the tightening of labor. It's not affecting us widespread, but it certainly is an impact. And we're keeping our eyes on how do we manage the best we can and be as efficient as we can. And one way to do that is to really work on our partner retention.

I don't think we've seen the spikes that we saw last time quite yet, but in any event, cotton is something that just takes a long time to get into our P&L. When you think about the standard garment that we have, certainly, the fabric is a component of that. A bigger component is the labor. And you also have things like trim and freight into our distribution centers. But certainly, the fabric is a component of that, and cotton is a component of that fabric. So when you break it all down, it's not a significant amount of the cost, but there is an impact. But when we see these spikes, in order for it to impact our P&L, it's got to be a long time of that spike. In other words, it has to last through the production of our garments, the shipping of those into our distribution center, sitting in our DC for return, then getting out into our rental locations where it begins to amortize generally over 18 months. So in that first month of shipping into the rental location, we see 1/18 of the impact. So as you can imagine, that cotton has to spike and stay elevated for quite a while before it has a real meaningful impact, and we haven't seen any of it yet."

So when you -- I mentioned earlier that we're -- one of the heavy projects is the route optimization. So I'll give you an example of a market route optimization.

Now we are certainly cautious because the -- our goal through this process is to minimize the disruption to the customer. And so we always have to keep that in mind, but we will make those routes more efficient. And sometimes, that means moving the processing of certain customers from one location to the other. And when we do that, that means we have to pull garments out of one location and transport them to the other location. That receiving location then has to rebarcode all of those garments, enter them into the system, and they have to do a little bit of that production integration all over again. That's an important part of what we're doing. And we're going to be cautious about it because, again, we're not -- we want to make sure that we don't disrupt the customer or minimize that.

After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.The Private Securities L",1824,"Good evening. Thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,670,000,000, an increase of 9.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.1%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 5.3%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.4%. Note that the lower rate of organic revenue growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the inclusion for the first time of the acquired G&K Services business and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue.
Reported operating income for the fourth quarter was $265 million compared to $177 million in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was reduced $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and $63 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our fourth quarter operating income grew 16.4%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.8% compared to 15.8% last year.
In March, we gave fourth quarter EPS guidance in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. That excluded G&K integration expenses, and it assumed an effective tax rate of 24%. Against this guidance, fourth quarter EPS was $1.77. Our tax rate was slightly better than the guided 24%, and this resulted in a benefit of $0.04. The remaining beat of guidance was primarily due to higher revenue than expected.
We're pleased with these fourth quarter results and our full year performance. Our fiscal '18 results extended our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 47 of the past 49 years with the only exception being the 2 years of the Great Recession. For the eighth consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high single-digit range, and we continue to grow revenue by multiples greater than both gross domestic product and employment.
Strong execution on the fundamentals is a hallmark of Cintas, but fiscal '18's achievement was especially noteworthy given that it occurred in a period of extreme change management. While delivering solid returns to shareholders in 2018, we also made significant progress on 2 important investments: G&K and SAP. The first year of the integration of the largest acquisition in Cintas history required the expertise of every part of the organization, including sales, production, service, global supply chain, IT, engineering, HR and finance. Very important tasks included winning the hearts and minds of acquired employees whom we call partners and earning the trust of acquired customers through our outstanding service. Our partners ran our acquisition playbook and effectively adjusted where necessary. We have now closed nearly all operations necessary to eliminate redundancies, which is 63 operations to date. All G&K locations, 148 in total, have been converted to Cintas operating systems. About 1,500 G&K trucks have been painted and rebranded as Cintas. Important integration work still remains for fiscal 2019, but after our first year of integration efforts, we are still on track for the achievement of our synergy commitments.
When we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio rose to about 3.1x. Our commitment was to return our leverage to a target of about 2x in 3 years. We are now there and are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations.
Fiscal '18 was also a year of tremendous technological change. In addition to moving G&K locations to Cintas systems, we continue to convert our operating system from a homegrown system to that of SAP. An information system conversion is like an acquisition integration in that it requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company, including operations, sales and corporate support. The conversion of each operation to SAP is an 8-month process. Our employees are coached on change management. Data standardization activities are performed. Garments are scanned and inventoried, and employees are trained and certified. Customers are notified of changes to invoice appearance and introduced to improvements in doing business with us because of the technology enhancements. Training and care continue for 2 months following the go-live date of the new system. A total of 108 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 34% of the total planned.
Looking ahead to -- looking ahead, fiscal 2019 will share some similarities with fiscal '18. We will continue to integrate G&K and realize more of the $130 million to $140 million in anticipated annual synergies. We expect to realize $90 million to $95 million in synergies in fiscal 2019 or $32 million to $37 million in incremental synergies. In addition, efforts will continue to convert more operations to the new SAP ERP system.
Like fiscal '18, inefficiencies will exist as our partners make further progress on acquisition integration and system implementations while executing on the day-to-day for our customers. However, we expect to extend our streak of profitable growth to 48 out of the past 50 years. We will accomplish that via the solid execution of our -- our shareholders have come to expect.
One important area in which fiscal '19 will differ from fiscal '18 is in capital allocation. With $600 million of acquisition debt repaid and our leverage target achieved, we returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.
We are honored to have been recently included in the Fortune 500 as #500. As our CEO, Scott Farmer, has stated, this accomplishment is built on our strong sense of culture, principles and values and reflects our strong financial growth, expanding line of products and services and innovative technologies. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employee partners. We're not satisfied with being #500, though, and our continued progression higher into that ranking starts in fiscal '19. Our expectations for fiscal '19 are for annual revenue to be in the range of $6,750,000,000 to $6,820,000,000.
I stated earlier that in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's revenue was organic as opposed to inorganic. This resulted in a lower organic growth rate due to the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With continued investment in selling resources, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter and then strengthen as we move through fiscal '19.
We expect fiscal '19 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7 to $7.15. Let me make a few comments about this EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 114 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million in fiscal '19. The guidance does include the impact of a change to our Cintas partner retirement policy in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. This change results in a shorter time period over which future stock-based compensation grants will be amortized. It is a non-cash impact, and it is expected to increase stock-based compensation expense by roughly $20 million in fiscal '19.
And lastly, the guidance also includes the impact of adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. With the adoption, we expect the following. Fiscal '19 revenue will be negatively affected by roughly $8 million along with the loss of the incremental operating margin associated with that revenue. SG&A, however, will benefit from the capitalization of sales rep commission payments and the subsequent amortization of those commissions over the expected service period of our contracts. This is also a non-cash impact, and we expect the net benefit to be roughly $16 million to $19 million. Overall, these last 2 non-cash items included in guidance will both be recorded in SG&A and generally will offset each other to have only a minor negative impact.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to Phillip Holloman, who is retiring from Cintas this month. Phillip has been with Cintas for 22 years and has been our President and Chief Operating Officer for the past 10 years. In our press release last month in which Scott Farmer thanked Phillip for his many contributions, Scott said, ""Those of us who have had the privilege of working with Phillip know that Cintas is a better company because of him, and he will be missed."" Thanks again, Phillip.
Phillip's retirement has led to several other leadership changes at Cintas. Scott Farmer announced the promotion of Todd Schneider to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer with the responsibility of leading all of our business divisions. Todd has been with Cintas for 29 years and has been our Rental division President and Chief Operating Officer for the last 5 years, leading our largest business through a very successful period and most notably, leading us through the integration of G&K.
Scott also announced the promotion of Mike Thompson to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Administration Officer. Mike has been with Cintas for 24 years and has been Cintas' Chief Information Officer for the last 5 years, most notably leading us through our SAP conversion. Mike will continue to lead our IT efforts and will also be responsible for our global supply chain and our safety and engineering groups. These changes are part of our normal succession planning process, and as we move into our fiscal '19 year, we remain as excited as ever about the future of Cintas.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul."

First, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year fourth quarter.

First, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead, there will be no workday differences next year as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18.
We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,342,000,000, an increase of 10.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.3%. As Mike stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the inclusion of G&K in organic as opposed to inorganic revenue for the first time. We expect the organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and strengthen as we move through the fiscal year.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. While we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation, we are realizing the expected cost synergies, which are benefiting our margins. These synergies plus better-than-expected revenue also enabled us to overcome an almost 20 basis point increase in energy expenses.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $147 million, which was 9.9% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 9.4%.
This segment's gross margin was 47.0% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.5% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 250 basis points. The significant amount of margin expansion was fueled in large part due to the realization of synergies from the ZEE Medical acquisition. With the synergies now realized in full, we expect margin expansion to continue in fiscal '19 but at a normalized rate.
The fourth quarter was another outstanding quarter for this segment. Organic growth continued to be strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account wins. The solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses place on having Cintas manage their first aid safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy and safe. The future of the first aid business segment remains bright.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace.
All Other revenue was $179 million, an increase of 1.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 0.2%. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was double digits. However, this strong performance was offset by a difficult revenue comparison for the Uniform Direct Sale business. In last year's fourth quarter, Uniform Direct Sale revenue included the rollouts of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large rollouts such as these do not repeat each year as businesses typically rebrand every 3 to 5 years. The benefit from Southwest last year was a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue.
All Other gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.8% for last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the fire business.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A benefited from favorable workers' compensation claims experience. In addition, we are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The effective tax rate, excluding G&K integration expenses, was 22.1%. Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $138 million. Free cash flow in fiscal '18 was $692 million, an increase of $201 million or 41% from the prior year period.
Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 were $271 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the year was as follows: $225 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $28 million in First Aid and Safety, and $18 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we repatriated about $110 million of international cash. We used the funds to pay down debts and to buy back stock. In the quarter, we purchased about $90 million in Cintas stock, and $410 million remain on the share buyback authorization approved by the Board of Directors. As of May 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000. At May 31, our leverage was 2.1x debt to EBITDA.
As Mike stated earlier, when we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, we committed to return our leverage to a target of about 2x in 3 years. We are pleased to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. We are excited to have returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We face legacy like competition as well as other catalog type competitors, and so that's not going away. So I don't think that's going to have much of an impact on the pricing environment. From the standpoint of the revenue synergies, we're moving cautiously as we have -- as we've talked about in the past. But we have begun to introduce some of the products where we can, where we have converted systems or where we have integrated routes into Cintas locations. And while it's early, and we haven't seen any notable impact, it's anecdotally positive so far. So I would say, as we continue to move through this year, we've got a lot of integration activity left, and we're going to continue to introduce Cintas products and services to those customers.

But more than anything from that system, we like the information and the power of that information. And we're not necessarily looking for a significant cost reduction. What we are looking for is more opportunity to make our selling team more productive. So how can we create warmer leads with better information? How can we use that information to be more directive in the way we approach our customers with our various products and services? So we're not looking necessarily for a significant SG&A reduction.

And George, as we move in to this year, you -- it's hard to think about that business as being separate at all. It's -- so many of the locations have been absorbed into legacy Cintas locations or have traded volume. So it's really hard to look at it separately. However, as we were working through the integration of last year, one of the biggest pieces was coming out of the closing of that deal. We had a sales team at G&K that had been -- had a tough environment, and we wanted to pull them out of their positions so that we could train them, get them to understand our systems, our products and services. There certainly were open positions that we had to fill, and that has gone very well. But as we've talked about in the last several quarters in our business, when you lose that new business momentum for a number of quarters, it takes a little bit of time to reverse that trend. We have done a very good job of training our new salespeople. We have seen the productivity tick up slightly each quarter throughout fiscal '18. And so the thing that will get us back to the Cintas-like levels of growth will be a combination of those sales partners being more and more productive and our ability to penetrate the G&K customers like we do with all of our other Cintas customers. So as we mentioned, we expect our first quarter organic growth to be somewhat similar, maybe slightly lower than what we reported here in this fourth quarter for our rental business, but we expect to see some improvement as we then go through the year to the point where fiscal '20, I would expect, we'd be back to our historical like levels, barring any change in the macro environment."

And I would expect that production is a big component. We will do a lot of route optimization. And while we have only just begun that, that's going to be the largest activity that we have going on in fiscal '19. So we'll start to see some of those routing benefits. And when I talk about routing benefits, what I really mean is improved fuel utilization. We are not looking to eliminate routes. What we're really looking to do is make all of our routes more efficient and give them -- give our SSRs more time with our customers. But that's going to be a big project, and there will be -- we will start to see some of that benefit. We have already gotten a lot of G&A benefits, and we still have some more to go. But that will be a lesser component in year 2 than the production impact. And then we'll start to see some sourcing synergies, but I would expect more of those to be in that year 3 and 4.

Certainly, the tariff uncertainty is a wildcard, and as we -- as I was mentioning a little bit earlier, the indirect pieces of those, we're keeping our eyes on, but again, it's a wildcard about how that'll impact us. From an energy perspective and fuel perspective, we have modeled that we will see about a 20 basis point increase in fuel in fiscal '19, and we're seeing that already in June in our prices at the pump. And from a labor perspective, we certainly are starting to see the tightening of labor. It's not affecting us widespread, but it certainly is an impact. And we're keeping our eyes on how do we manage the best we can and be as efficient as we can. And one way to do that is to really work on our partner retention. That is very important for us, and it certainly makes this tighter labor market easier to deal with if we can retain our current partners. That's very important to us.

So when you break it all down, it's not a significant amount of the cost, but there is an impact. But when we see these spikes, in order for it to impact our P&L, it's got to be a long time of that spike. In other words, it has to last through the production of our garments, the shipping of those into our distribution center, sitting in our DC for return, then getting out into our rental locations where it begins to amortize generally over 18 months. So in that first month of shipping into the rental location, we see 1/18 of the impact. So as you can imagine, that cotton has to spike and stay elevated for quite a while before it has a real meaningful impact, and we haven't seen any of it yet."

Now we are certainly cautious because the -- our goal through this process is to minimize the disruption to the customer. And so we always have to keep that in mind, but we will make those routes more efficient. And sometimes, that means moving the processing of certain customers from one location to the other. And when we do that, that means we have to pull garments out of one location and transport them to the other location.

And can our current customers take advantage of that new offering? A lot of things that we would have to take into account and the value would have to be at the right place. Having said that, if those things do happen, we'll absolutely be aggressive in looking at it if we feel like it is the right opportunity."

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,670,000,000, an increase of 9.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.1%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 5.3%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.4%. Note that the lower rate of organic revenue growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the inclusion for the first time of the acquired G&K Services business and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue.
Reported operating income for the fourth quarter was $265 million compared to $177 million in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was reduced $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and $63 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our fourth quarter operating income grew 16.4%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.8% compared to 15.8% last year.
In March, we gave fourth quarter EPS guidance in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. That excluded G&K integration expenses, and it assumed an effective tax rate of 24%. Against this guidance, fourth quarter EPS was $1.77. Our tax rate was slightly better than the guided 24%, and this resulted in a benefit of $0.04. The remaining beat of guidance was primarily due to higher revenue than expected.
We're pleased with these fourth quarter results and our full year performance. Our fiscal '18 results extended our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 47 of the past 49 years with the only exception being the 2 years of the Great Recession. For the eighth consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high single-digit range, and we continue to grow revenue by multiples greater than both gross domestic product and employment.
Strong execution on the fundamentals is a hallmark of Cintas, but fiscal '18's achievement was especially noteworthy given that it occurred in a period of extreme change management. While delivering solid returns to shareholders in 2018, we also made significant progress on 2 important investments: G&K and SAP. The first year of the integration of the largest acquisition in Cintas history required the expertise of every part of the organization, including sales, production, service, global supply chain, IT, engineering, HR and finance. Very important tasks included winning the hearts and minds of acquired employees whom we call partners and earning the trust of acquired customers through our outstanding service. Our partners ran our acquisition playbook and effectively adjusted where necessary. We have now closed nearly all operations necessary to eliminate redundancies, which is 63 operations to date. All G&K locations, 148 in total, have been converted to Cintas operating systems. About 1,500 G&K trucks have been painted and rebranded as Cintas. Important integration work still remains for fiscal 2019, but after our first year of integration efforts, we are still on track for the achievement of our synergy commitments.
When we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio rose to about 3.1x. Our commitment was to return our leverage to a target of about 2x in 3 years. We are now there and are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations.
Fiscal '18 was also a year of tremendous technological change. In addition to moving G&K locations to Cintas systems, we continue to convert our operating system from a homegrown system to that of SAP. An information system conversion is like an acquisition integration in that it requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company, including operations, sales and corporate support. The conversion of each operation to SAP is an 8-month process. Our employees are coached on change management. Data standardization activities are performed. Garments are scanned and inventoried, and employees are trained and certified. Customers are notified of changes to invoice appearance and introduced to improvements in doing business with us because of the technology enhancements. Training and care continue for 2 months following the go-live date of the new system. A total of 108 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 34% of the total planned.
Looking ahead to -- looking ahead, fiscal 2019 will share some similarities with fiscal '18. We will continue to integrate G&K and realize more of the $130 million to $140 million in anticipated annual synergies. We expect to realize $90 million to $95 million in synergies in fiscal 2019 or $32 million to $37 million in incremental synergies. In addition, efforts will continue to convert more operations to the new SAP ERP system.
Like fiscal '18, inefficiencies will exist as our partners make further progress on acquisition integration and system implementations while executing on the day-to-day for our customers. However, we expect to extend our streak of profitable growth to 48 out of the past 50 years. We will accomplish that via the solid execution of our -- our shareholders have come to expect.
One important area in which fiscal '19 will differ from fiscal '18 is in capital allocation. With $600 million of acquisition debt repaid and our leverage target achieved, we returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.
We are honored to have been recently included in the Fortune 500 as #500. As our CEO, Scott Farmer, has stated, this accomplishment is built on our strong sense of culture, principles and values and reflects our strong financial growth, expanding line of products and services and innovative technologies. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employee partners. We're not satisfied with being #500, though, and our continued progression higher into that ranking starts in fiscal '19. Our expectations for fiscal '19 are for annual revenue to be in the range of $6,750,000,000 to $6,820,000,000.
I stated earlier that in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's revenue was organic as opposed to inorganic. This resulted in a lower organic growth rate due to the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With continued investment in selling resources, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter and then strengthen as we move through fiscal '19.
We expect fiscal '19 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7 to $7.15. Let me make a few comments about this EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 114 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million in fiscal '19. The guidance does include the impact of a change to our Cintas partner retirement policy in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. This change results in a shorter time period over which future stock-based compensation grants will be amortized. It is a non-cash impact, and it is expected to increase stock-based compensation expense by roughly $20 million in fiscal '19.
And lastly, the guidance also includes the impact of adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. With the adoption, we expect the following. Fiscal '19 revenue will be negatively affected by roughly $8 million along with the loss of the incremental operating margin associated with that revenue. SG&A, however, will benefit from the capitalization of sales rep commission payments and the subsequent amortization of those commissions over the expected service period of our contracts. This is also a non-cash impact, and we expect the net benefit to be roughly $16 million to $19 million. Overall, these last 2 non-cash items included in guidance will both be recorded in SG&A and generally will offset each other to have only a minor negative impact.
Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to Phillip Holloman, who is retiring from Cintas this month. Phillip has been with Cintas for 22 years and has been our President and Chief Operating Officer for the past 10 years. In our press release last month in which Scott Farmer thanked Phillip for his many contributions, Scott said, ""Those of us who have had the privilege of working with Phillip know that Cintas is a better company because of him, and he will be missed."" Thanks again, Phillip.
Phillip's retirement has led to several other leadership changes at Cintas. Scott Farmer announced the promotion of Todd Schneider to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer with the responsibility of leading all of our business divisions. Todd has been with Cintas for 29 years and has been our Rental division President and Chief Operating Officer for the last 5 years, leading our largest business through a very successful period and most notably, leading us through the integration of G&K.
Scott also announced the promotion of Mike Thompson to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Administration Officer. Mike has been with Cintas for 24 years and has been Cintas' Chief Information Officer for the last 5 years, most notably leading us through our SAP conversion. Mike will continue to lead our IT efforts and will also be responsible for our global supply chain and our safety and engineering groups. These changes are part of our normal succession planning process, and as we move into our fiscal '19 year, we remain as excited as ever about the future of Cintas.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul."

Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,342,000,000, an increase of 10.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.3%. As Mike stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the inclusion of G&K in organic as opposed to inorganic revenue for the first time. We expect the organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and strengthen as we move through the fiscal year.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. While we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation, we are realizing the expected cost synergies, which are benefiting our margins. These synergies plus better-than-expected revenue also enabled us to overcome an almost 20 basis point increase in energy expenses.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $147 million, which was 9.9% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 9.4%.
This segment's gross margin was 47.0% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.5% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 250 basis points. The significant amount of margin expansion was fueled in large part due to the realization of synergies from the ZEE Medical acquisition. With the synergies now realized in full, we expect margin expansion to continue in fiscal '19 but at a normalized rate.
The fourth quarter was another outstanding quarter for this segment. Organic growth continued to be strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account wins. The solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses place on having Cintas manage their first aid safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy and safe. The future of the first aid business segment remains bright.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace.
All Other revenue was $179 million, an increase of 1.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 0.2%. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was double digits. However, this strong performance was offset by a difficult revenue comparison for the Uniform Direct Sale business. In last year's fourth quarter, Uniform Direct Sale revenue included the rollouts of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large rollouts such as these do not repeat each year as businesses typically rebrand every 3 to 5 years. The benefit from Southwest last year was a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue.
All Other gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.8% for last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the fire business.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A benefited from favorable workers' compensation claims experience. In addition, we are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The effective tax rate, excluding G&K integration expenses, was 22.1%. Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $138 million. Free cash flow in fiscal '18 was $692 million, an increase of $201 million or 41% from the prior year period.
Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 were $271 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the year was as follows: $225 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $28 million in First Aid and Safety, and $18 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we repatriated about $110 million of international cash. We used the funds to pay down debts and to buy back stock. In the quarter, we purchased about $90 million in Cintas stock, and $410 million remain on the share buyback authorization approved by the Board of Directors. As of May 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000. At May 31, our leverage was 2.1x debt to EBITDA.
As Mike stated earlier, when we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, we committed to return our leverage to a target of about 2x in 3 years. We are pleased to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. We are excited to have returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

We face legacy like competition as well as other catalog type competitors, and so that's not going away. So I don't think that's going to have much of an impact on the pricing environment. From the standpoint of the revenue synergies, we're moving cautiously as we have -- as we've talked about in the past. But we have begun to introduce some of the products where we can, where we have converted systems or where we have integrated routes into Cintas locations. And while it's early, and we haven't seen any notable impact, it's anecdotally positive so far. So I would say, as we continue to move through this year, we've got a lot of integration activity left, and we're going to continue to introduce Cintas products and services to those customers. But I would not expect much of an impact at this point in time."

But more than anything from that system, we like the information and the power of that information. And we're not necessarily looking for a significant cost reduction. What we are looking for is more opportunity to make our selling team more productive. So how can we create warmer leads with better information? How can we use that information to be more directive in the way we approach our customers with our various products and services? So we're not looking necessarily for a significant SG&A reduction.

And George, as we move in to this year, you -- it's hard to think about that business as being separate at all. It's -- so many of the locations have been absorbed into legacy Cintas locations or have traded volume. So it's really hard to look at it separately. However, as we were working through the integration of last year, one of the biggest pieces was coming out of the closing of that deal. We had a sales team at G&K that had been -- had a tough environment, and we wanted to pull them out of their positions so that we could train them, get them to understand our systems, our products and services. There certainly were open positions that we had to fill, and that has gone very well. But as we've talked about in the last several quarters in our business, when you lose that new business momentum for a number of quarters, it takes a little bit of time to reverse that trend. We have done a very good job of training our new salespeople. We have seen the productivity tick up slightly each quarter throughout fiscal '18. And so the thing that will get us back to the Cintas-like levels of growth will be a combination of those sales partners being more and more productive and our ability to penetrate the G&K customers like we do with all of our other Cintas customers. So as we mentioned, we expect our first quarter organic growth to be somewhat similar, maybe slightly lower than what we reported here in this fourth quarter for our rental business, but we expect to see some improvement as we then go through the year to the point where fiscal '20, I would expect, we'd be back to our historical like levels, barring any change in the macro environment."

What we're really looking to do is make all of our routes more efficient and give them -- give our SSRs more time with our customers. But that's going to be a big project, and there will be -- we will start to see some of that benefit. We have already gotten a lot of G&A benefits, and we still have some more to go.

And we're keeping our eyes on how do we manage the best we can and be as efficient as we can. And one way to do that is to really work on our partner retention.

So when you break it all down, it's not a significant amount of the cost, but there is an impact. But when we see these spikes, in order for it to impact our P&L, it's got to be a long time of that spike.

So in that first month of shipping into the rental location, we see 1/18 of the impact. So as you can imagine, that cotton has to spike and stay elevated for quite a while before it has a real meaningful impact, and we haven't seen any of it yet."

So when you -- I mentioned earlier that we're -- one of the heavy projects is the route optimization. So I'll give you an example of a market route optimization. In a market where we've got Cintas facilities and G&K facilities that will remain open, we're going to take a look at all of the customers in that marketplace, and we are going to then take those customers in that marketplace and effectively reroute them to make all of our routes in that marketplace more efficient. Now we are certainly cautious because the -- our goal through this process is to minimize the disruption to the customer. And so we always have to keep that in mind, but we will make those routes more efficient. And sometimes, that means moving the processing of certain customers from one location to the other. And when we do that, that means we have to pull garments out of one location and transport them to the other location. That receiving location then has to re-barcode all of those garments, enter them into the system, and they have to do a little bit of that production integration all over again. That's an important part of what we're doing. And we're going to be cautious about it because, again, we're not -- we want to make sure that we don't disrupt the customer or minimize that.

After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.The Private Securities Litig",789,"Good evening, and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides the Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the first quarter, which ended August 31, was $1,697,000,000, an increase of 5.4% over last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 5.2%. 
The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 4.9%. And the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.0%. Note that the lower organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected. And as we have previously communicated was due to the lapping of the G&K Services acquisition. We expect this organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal '19.
Reported operating income for the first quarter was $265 million compared to $249 million in last year's first quarter. 
Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '19 was negatively impacted by $19 million in stock-based compensation expense related to a change in the Cintas retirement policy, in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. 
Slightly offsetting this was a $5.7 million benefit from lower commission expense, resulting from the adoption of the accounting standards update 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers. 
We discussed both items on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal '19 guidance. 
Lastly, operating income was reduced about $5 million in the first quarter of fiscal '19, and about $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '18 by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. 
Excluding these items, our first quarter operating income grew 12%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.7% compared to 15.7% last year.
Interest expense was $6 million lower in the first quarter of fiscal '19 compared to last year due to debt reduction of about $300 million. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '19 of $212 million increased 31.9% from last year's first quarter net income from continuing operations of $161 million. 
EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '19 were $1.89, an increase of about 30% from the EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 of $1.45. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year's first quarter compared to last fiscal year's first quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and '18 by $0.04 and $0.03, respectively, from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. 
As a result of our first quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.75 billion to $6.82 billion to a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion. 
An EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7 to $7.15 to a range of $7.19 to $7.29. 
Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate for the full fiscal year of 21.7%, which is the same rate we provided in July for our initial fiscal '19 guidance. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up and down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. 
The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 113.5 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million for the full fiscal year. 
As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in our earnings release, we are pleased with the start to the fiscal year. Our employees and we call partners continue to execute at a very high level, while also making significant progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."
260725,581537953,1561157,"Cintas Corporation, Q1 2019 Earnings Call, Sep 25, 2018",2018-09-25,"Earnings Calls","Cintas Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal first quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year's first quarter. Additionally, there will be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year as each quarter of fiscal '19",941,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal first quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year's first quarter. 
Additionally, there will be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments. Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. 
All Other consist of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. 
First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments include to the rental and servicing of uniform, mass and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.37 billion, an increase of 4.8% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 4.9%. 
As Mike previously stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the lapping of the acquired G&K business. However, we believe that the organic growth rate has reached a bottom. We expect the organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal '19. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.7% for the first quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's first quarter. 
We are starting to see cost pressures in a few areas. Energy expense was a headwind of about 20 basis points. We are experiencing wage inflation in certain areas. And we've seen some cost pressures on our hangers, which largely are sourced from China. 
Keep in mind that all of these are considered in our updated guidance. 
In addition, as previously disclosed, we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation. And these activities weigh on margins in the short term. With all that being said though, we are pleased with the gross margin expansion on a sequential basis of 70 basis points. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $153 million, which was 9.1% higher than last year's first quarter. 
On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.0%, which was a noteworthy accomplishment against a difficult comparison of prior year's first quarter organic growth of almost 12%. This segment's gross margin was 47.9% in the first quarter compared to 47.5% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business. The combination of the solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on having Cintas manage their First Aid, Safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive. 
Our fire protection services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other categories. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. 
Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us. And it's customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our Other business units. 
All Other revenue was $169 million, an increase of 6.6% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 4.0% and was driven by 8.9% organic growth in the fire business. 
All Other gross margin was 42.9% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.5% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Both Fire and Uniform Direct Sales realized expansion of gross margins. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.7% in the first quarter compared to 30.2% in last year's first quarter. A 110 basis points increase in stock-based compensation expense was more than offset by lower labor, workers compensation, medical and other expenses. 
We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of 12.0% benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. 
In addition, it was positively impacted by stock-based compensation. 
Our EPS guidance for fiscal '19 as soon as effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $118 million. Cash flow remains strong, and we expect fiscal '19 operating cash flow to exceed fiscal '18. 
Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64 million. 
Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $9 million in First Aid and Safety, and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million. 
As of August 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000, and consist entirely of fixed interest rate debt. At August 31, our leverage was 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

So yes, there are some timing things and accounts payable et cetera, but the one thing to note that I can tell you about from the balance sheet is inventory. We've had an increase in new goods inventory. We have a new distribution center, it's a facility services distribution center, that we just started up very recently due to the need to support that strong facility services growth. And so typical with the start up of the new distribution center. We've had a build of inventory. And once that DC continues to run as expected, it will burn that inventory off and that will come down. So again, nothing structural in terms of the organization that has us concerned about cash flow. Just some timing effects and we believe it will be strong at the end of the year."

We've closed all of the redundant plants but still some inefficiency about getting all of the plants that accepted new volume still working through inefficiencies and getting them back to kind of normal operating environment. And so we continue and we're very pleased with where we are. And we talked about in July getting an additional -- something in the way of $32 million to $37 million  of synergies. On top of the $58 million that we got last fiscal year. And we're very confident that we will see those. What can get us above the synergy -- above the synergy target in total of $130 million to $140 million, you know I think more than anything that would come from the sourcing opportunity. I think that's the biggest opportunity for out performance. So in other words, can we take the volume from G&K and incorporate that into our supply chain and translate that into larger sourcing savings than we have modeled. I am not ready to say that we can do that. But I think in answering your question, if we were to outperform, that's likely where it would come from.

And then if we have additional cash and we have an opportunity to be opportunistic with that cash, we will execute on the buyback program. We did a little bit of that in the first quarter.

And as I mentioned in our July call, that second half of the call we expect -- I mentioned in July, we expected that to be in a 5.5% to 6% range. And certainly by our guidance increase, we still feel very comfortable about that. So I would expect the second half of the year to be fairly good performance."

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the first quarter, which ended August 31, was $1,697,000,000, an increase of 5.4% over last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.2%. 
The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 4.9%. And the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.0%. Note that the lower organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the lapping of the G&K Services acquisition. We expect this organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal '19.
Reported operating income for the first quarter was $265 million compared to $249 million in last year's first quarter. 
Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '19 was negatively impacted by $19 million in stock-based compensation expense related to a change in the Cintas retirement policy, in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. 
Slightly offsetting this was a $5.7 million benefit from lower commission expense, resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. 
We discussed both items on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal '19 guidance. 
Lastly, operating income was reduced about $5 million in the first quarter of fiscal '19, and about $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '18 by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. 
Excluding these items, our first quarter operating income grew 12%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.7% compared to 15.7% last year.
Interest expense was $6 million lower in the first quarter of fiscal '19 compared to last year due to debt reduction of about $300 million. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '19 of $212 million increased 31.9% from last year's first quarter net income from continuing operations of $161 million. 
EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '19 were $1.89, an increase of about 30% from the EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 of $1.45. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year's first quarter compared to last fiscal year's first quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and '18 by $0.04 and $0.03, respectively, from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. 
As a result of our first quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.75 billion to $6.82 billion to a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion and EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7 to $7.15 to a range of $7.19 to $7.29. 
Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate for the full fiscal year of 21.7%, which is the same rate we provided in July for our initial fiscal '19 guidance. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up and down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. 
The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 113.5 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million for the full fiscal year. 
As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in our earnings release, we are pleased with the start to the fiscal year. Our employees, whom we call partners, continue to execute at a very high level, while also making significant progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

First, please note that our fiscal first quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year first quarter. Additionally, there will be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year, as each quarter of fiscal '19 c",937,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal first quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year first quarter. 
Additionally, there will be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year, as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments. Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. 
All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. 
First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniform, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.37 billion, an increase of 4.8% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 4.9%. 
As Mike previously stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the lapping of the acquired G&K business. However, we believe that the organic growth rate has reached a bottom. We expect the organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal '19. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.7% for the first quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's first quarter. 
We are starting to see cost pressures in a few areas. Energy expense was a headwind of about 20 basis points. We are experiencing wage inflation in certain areas, and we've seen some cost pressures on our hangers, which largely are sourced from China. 
Keep in mind that all of these are considered in our updated guidance. 
In addition, as previously disclosed, we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation. And these activities weigh on margins in the short term. With all that being said though, we were pleased with the gross margin expansion on a sequential basis of 70 basis points. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $153 million, which was 9.1% higher than last year's first quarter. 
On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.0%, which was a noteworthy accomplishment against a difficult comparison of prior year first quarter organic growth of almost 12%. This segment's gross margin was 47.9% in the first quarter compared to 47.5% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national-account new business. The combination of this solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on having Cintas manage their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other categories. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. 
Uniform Direct Sales, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. 
All Other revenue was $169 million, an increase of 6.6% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 4.0% and was driven by 8.9% organic growth in the fire business. 
All Other gross margin was 42.9% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.5% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Both fire and Uniform Direct Sales realized expansion of gross margins. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.7% in the first quarter compared to 30.2% in last year's first quarter. A 110 basis point increase in stock-based compensation expense was more than offset by lower labor, workers compensation, medical and other expenses. 
We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of 12.0% benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. In addition, it was positively impacted by stock-based compensation. 
Our EPS guidance for fiscal '19 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $118 million. Cash flow remains strong, and we expect fiscal '19 operating cash flow to exceed fiscal '18. 
Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64 million. 
Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $9 million in First Aid and Safety, and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million. 
As of August 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000 and consists entirely of fixed interest rate debt. At August 31, our leverage was 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

But as we just mentioned in our prepared remarks, when looking at our forecast for the remainder of the year, we believe that our operating cash flow will be strong and even exceed prior year. So there are some timing things and accounts payable, et cetera, but the one thing to note that I can tell you about from the balance sheet is inventory. We've had an increase in new goods inventory. We have a new distribution center. It's a facility services distribution center that we just started up very recently due to the need to support that strong facility services growth. And so typical with the startup of a new distribution center, we've had a build of inventory. And once that DC continues to run as expected, it will burn that inventory off, and that will come down. So again, nothing structural in terms of the organization that has us concerned about cash flow. Just some timing effects, and we believe it will be strong at the end of the year."

And so we continue, and we're very pleased with where we are. And we talked about in July getting an additional something in the way of $32 million to $37 million of synergies on top of the $58 million that we got last fiscal year, and we're very confident that we will see those. What can get us above the synergy target in total of $130 million to $140 million, I think more than anything, that would come from the sourcing opportunity. I think that's the biggest opportunity for outperformance. So in other words, can we take the volume from G&K and incorporate that into our supply chain and translate that into larger sourcing savings than we have modeled? I'm not ready to say that we can do that. But I think in answering your question, if we were to outperform, that's likely where it would come from.

And then if we have additional cash and we have an opportunity to be opportunistic with that cash, we will execute on the buyback program. We did a little bit of that in the first quarter.

And so the number one thing that we are doing is working on partner retention. And we want to make sure that we are very competitive in the wages, in the benefits, that we provide a great working environment and our retention is very good. When we grow, however, we do need to go and find additional labor. And finding additional labor has been a little bit more challenging, and we're recruiting certainly aggressively from the standpoint of looking at trade schools and recruiting fares and other types of things. But it really begins with partner retention, that's the most important thing for us. From the standpoint of the new business, I believe your question was the productivity from new hires, our salespeople. We -- as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've seen a nice uptick in our sales rep productivity, and we really like where we're headed. We are not back to pre-G&K levels yet, but we really like where we're headed in, and the performance has been going. And that gives us some confidence to raise our revenue guidance, like I mentioned."

I think as we move forward, the system conversion will -- just like it is with all of our business, there's going to be some disruption market-by-market. But the good news is we're not converting the entire company at one time. It is a market-by-market conversion. And so that disruption is not going to be significant from quarter-to-quarter.

From a stock-based compensation, that $46 million that you see in the first quarter is loaded with that $19 million impact that we mentioned earlier. And so that is not a good run rate. You would take out a fairly good chunk of that, probably most of the $19 million, to get to a better run rate for the rest of the year.

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the first quarter, which ended August 31, was $1,697,000,000, an increase of 5.4% over last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.2%. 
The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 4.9%. And the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.0%. Note that the lower organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and, as we have previously communicated, was due to the lapping of the G&K Services acquisition. We expect this organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal '19.
Reported operating income for the first quarter was $265 million compared to $249 million in last year's first quarter. 
Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '19 was negatively impacted by $19 million in stock-based compensation expense related to a change in the Cintas retirement policy, in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. 
Slightly offsetting this was a $5.7 million benefit from lower commission expense, resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. 
We discussed both items on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal '19 guidance. 
Lastly, operating income was reduced about $5 million in the first quarter of fiscal '19, and about $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '18 by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. 
Excluding these items, our first quarter operating income grew 12%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.7% compared to 15.7% last year.
Interest expense was $6 million lower in the first quarter of fiscal '19 compared to last year due to debt reduction of about $300 million. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '19 of $212 million increased 31.9% from last year's first quarter net income from continuing operations of $161 million. 
EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '19 were $1.89, an increase of about 30% from the EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 of $1.45. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year's first quarter compared to last fiscal year's first quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and '18 by $0.04 and $0.03, respectively, from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. 
As a result of our first quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.75 billion to $6.82 billion to a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion and EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7 to $7.15 to a range of $7.19 to $7.29. 
Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate for the full fiscal year of 21.7%, which is the same rate we provided in July for our initial fiscal '19 guidance. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up and down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. 
The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 113.5 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million for the full fiscal year. 
As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in our earnings release, we are pleased with the start to the fiscal year. Our employees, whom we call partners, continue to execute at a very high level, while also making significant progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

We have 2 reportable operating segments. Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. 
All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. 
First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniform, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.37 billion, an increase of 4.8% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 4.9%. 
As Mike previously stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the lapping of the acquired G&K business. However, we believe that the organic growth rate has reached a bottom. We expect the organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal '19. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.7% for the first quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's first quarter. 
We are starting to see cost pressures in a few areas. Energy expense was a headwind of about 20 basis points. We are experiencing wage inflation in certain areas, and we've seen some cost pressures on our hangers, which largely are sourced from China. 
Keep in mind that all of these are considered in our updated guidance. 
In addition, as previously disclosed, we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation. And these activities weigh on margins in the short term. With all that being said though, we were pleased with the gross margin expansion on a sequential basis of 70 basis points. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $153 million, which was 9.1% higher than last year's first quarter. 
On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.0%, which was a noteworthy accomplishment against a difficult comparison of prior year first quarter organic growth of almost 12%. This segment's gross margin was 47.9% in the first quarter compared to 47.5% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national-account new business. The combination of this solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on having Cintas manage their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other categories. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. 
Uniform Direct Sales, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. 
All Other revenue was $169 million, an increase of 6.6% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 4.0% and was driven by 8.9% organic growth in the fire business. 
All Other gross margin was 42.9% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.5% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Both fire and Uniform Direct Sales realized expansion of gross margins. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.7% in the first quarter compared to 30.2% in last year's first quarter. A 110 basis point increase in stock-based compensation expense was more than offset by lower labor, workers compensation, medical and other expenses. 
We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of 12.0% benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. In addition, it was positively impacted by stock-based compensation. 
Our EPS guidance for fiscal '19 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $118 million. Cash flow remains strong, and we expect fiscal '19 operating cash flow to exceed fiscal '18. 
Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64 million. 
Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $9 million in First Aid and Safety, and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million. 
As of August 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000 and consists entirely of fixed interest rate debt. At August 31, our leverage was 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

I think from a cash flow perspective, we did have some timing issues in this quarter. But as we just mentioned in our prepared remarks, when looking at our forecast for the remainder of the year, we believe that our operating cash flow will be strong and even exceed prior year. So there are some timing things and accounts payable, et cetera, but the one thing to note that I can tell you about from the balance sheet is inventory. We've had an increase in new goods inventory. We have a new distribution center. It's a facility services distribution center that we just started up very recently due to the need to support that strong facility services growth. And so typical with the startup of a new distribution center, we've had a build of inventory. And once that DC continues to run as expected, it will burn that inventory off, and that will come down. So again, nothing structural in terms of the organization that has us concerned about cash flow. Just some timing effects, and we believe it will be strong at the end of the year."

And we talked about in July getting an additional something in the way of $32 million to $37 million of synergies on top of the $58 million that we got last fiscal year, and we're very confident that we will see those. What can get us above the synergy target in total of $130 million to $140 million, I think more than anything, that would come from the sourcing opportunity. I think that's the biggest opportunity for outperformance. So in other words, can we take the volume from G&K and incorporate that into our supply chain and translate that into larger sourcing savings than we have modeled? I'm not ready to say that we can do that. But I think in answering your question, if we were to outperform, that's likely where it would come from.

We have raised our dividend for every year since we went public. I would expect that we'll evaluate that, and that's very important to us. And then if we have additional cash and we have an opportunity to be opportunistic with that cash, we will execute on the buyback program. We did a little bit of that in the first quarter.

In other words, just like with our own business, penetration takes some time, and it's not something that we rush into with any of our customers. So it's going to be a bit of a subtle improvement, but it certainly is something, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, that gives us confidence to raise our guidance a little bit this year, and I would expect that, that will continue into the future. It does certainly -- the system conversion certainly does have an impact on that conversion. Now all legacy G&K locations are on Cintas operating systems, and so that allows us to really get into and start that process, which we have started, and it's certainly more in earnest in the first quarter. I think as we move forward, the system conversion will -- just like it is with all of our business, there's going to be some disruption market-by-market. But the good news is we're not converting the entire company at one time. It is a market-by-market conversion. And so that disruption is not going to be significant from quarter-to-quarter. But I don't think that's going to have much impact on our ability to penetrate. It is going to have a little bit -- that system conversion is going to have a little bit more impact on the timing of route optimization, but that's a little bit of a different topic."

From an amortization standpoint, yes, with the accounting change, that commission expense does run through the amortization now. So that's a pretty good run rate. Keep in mind, that's going to be offset down in working capital in the prepaid expenses line, you'll see a big increase there. And that offset will continue through the rest of the year as well. So net-net, the operating cash flows aren't really impacted much by this change in accounting. So that's the rev rec change. From a stock-based compensation, that $46 million that you see in the first quarter is loaded with that $19 million impact that we mentioned earlier. And so that is not a good run rate. You would take out a fairly good chunk of that, probably most of the $19 million, to get to a better run rate for the rest of the year. That $19 million is kind of a change, where we expense -- we accelerate the expense of certain stock options and restricted shares related to Cintas partners who have attained retirement age and tenure.

With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the first quarter, which ended August 31, was $1,697,000,000, an increase of 5.4% over last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.2%. 
The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 4.9%. And the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.0%. Note that the lower organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and, as we have previously communicated, was due to the lapping of the G&K Services acquisition. We expect this organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal '19.
Reported operating income for the first quarter was $265 million compared to $249 million in last year's first quarter. 
Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '19 was negatively impacted by $19 million in stock-based compensation expense related to a change in the Cintas retirement policy, in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. 
Slightly offsetting this was a $5.7 million benefit from lower commission expense, resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. 
We discussed both items on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal '19 guidance. 
Lastly, operating income was reduced about $5 million in the first quarter of fiscal '19, and about $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '18 by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. 
Excluding these items, our first quarter operating income grew 12%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.7% compared to 15.7% last year.
Interest expense was $6 million lower in the first quarter of fiscal '19 compared to last year due to debt reduction of about $300 million. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '19 of $212 million increased 31.9% from last year's first quarter net income from continuing operations of $161 million. 
EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '19 were $1.89, an increase of about 30% from the EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 of $1.45. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year's first quarter compared to last fiscal year's first quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and '18 by $0.04 and $0.03, respectively, from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. 
As a result of our first quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.75 billion to $6.82 billion to a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion and EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7 to $7.15 to a range of $7.19 to $7.29. 
Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate for the full fiscal year of 21.7%, which is the same rate we provided in July for our initial fiscal '19 guidance. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up and down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. 
The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 113.5 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million for the full fiscal year. 
As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in our earnings release, we are pleased with the start to the fiscal year. Our employees, whom we call partners, continue to execute at a very high level, while also making significant progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. 
I will now turn the call over to Paul."

Additionally, there will be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year, as each quarter of fiscal '19 c",937,"Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal first quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year first quarter. 
Additionally, there will be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year, as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18. 
We have 2 reportable operating segments. Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. 
All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. 
First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. 
The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniform, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. 
The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.37 billion, an increase of 4.8% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 4.9%. 
As Mike previously stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the lapping of the acquired G&K business. However, we believe that the organic growth rate has reached a bottom. We expect the organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal '19. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.7% for the first quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's first quarter. 
We are starting to see cost pressures in a few areas. Energy expense was a headwind of about 20 basis points. We are experiencing wage inflation in certain areas, and we've seen some cost pressures on our hangers, which largely are sourced from China. 
Keep in mind that all of these are considered in our updated guidance. 
In addition, as previously disclosed, we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation. And these activities weigh on margins in the short term. With all that being said though, we were pleased with the gross margin expansion on a sequential basis of 70 basis points. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $153 million, which was 9.1% higher than last year's first quarter. 
On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.0%, which was a noteworthy accomplishment against a difficult comparison of prior year first quarter organic growth of almost 12%. This segment's gross margin was 47.9% in the first quarter compared to 47.5% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national-account new business. The combination of this solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on having Cintas manage their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other categories. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account. 
Uniform Direct Sales, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. 
All Other revenue was $169 million, an increase of 6.6% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 4.0% and was driven by 8.9% organic growth in the fire business. 
All Other gross margin was 42.9% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.5% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. 
Both fire and Uniform Direct Sales realized expansion of gross margins. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.7% in the first quarter compared to 30.2% in last year's first quarter. A 110 basis point increase in stock-based compensation expense was more than offset by lower labor, workers compensation, medical and other expenses. 
We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of 12.0% benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. In addition, it was positively impacted by stock-based compensation. 
Our EPS guidance for fiscal '19 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $118 million. Cash flow remains strong, and we expect fiscal '19 operating cash flow to exceed fiscal '18. 
Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64 million. 
Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $9 million in First Aid and Safety, and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million.

I think from a cash flow perspective, we did have some timing issues in this quarter. But as we just mentioned in our prepared remarks, when looking at our forecast for the remainder of the year, we believe that our operating cash flow will be strong and even exceed prior year. So there are some timing things and accounts payable, et cetera, but the one thing to note that I can tell you about from the balance sheet is inventory. We've had an increase in new goods inventory. We have a new distribution center. It's a facility services distribution center that we just started up very recently due to the need to support that strong facility services growth. And so typical with the startup of a new distribution center, we've had a build of inventory. And once that DC continues to run as expected, it will burn that inventory off, and that will come down. So again, nothing structural in terms of the organization that has us concerned about cash flow. Just some timing effects, and we believe it will be strong at the end of the year."

What can get us above the synergy target in total of $130 million to $140 million, I think more than anything, that would come from the sourcing opportunity. I think that's the biggest opportunity for outperformance. So in other words, can we take the volume from G&K and incorporate that into our supply chain and translate that into larger sourcing savings than we have modeled? I'm not ready to say that we can do that. But I think in answering your question, if we were to outperform, that's likely where it would come from.

From an amortization standpoint, yes, with the accounting change, that commission expense does run through the amortization now. So that's a pretty good run rate.

So net-net, the operating cash flows aren't really impacted much by this change in accounting. So that's the rev rec change. From a stock-based compensation, that $46 million that you see in the first quarter is loaded with that $19 million impact that we mentioned earlier. And so that is not a good run rate. You would take out a fairly good chunk of that, probably most of the $19 million, to get to a better run rate for the rest of the year. That $19 million is kind of a change, where we expense -- we accelerate the expense of certain stock options and restricted shares related to Cintas partners who have attained retirement age and tenure.

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,718,000,000, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was also 7%.
The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.6%. And the organic growth rate from the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.2%. Since the announcement of the G&K Services acquisition nearly 2 years ago, we communicated our expected trajectory of the acquired revenue and its impact on Uniform Rental and Facility Services growth rates. We discussed that the organic revenue growth rate would reach a bottom in the first quarter of this fiscal year due to the lapping of the G&K acquisition, and that we expect that the organic growth rate to accelerate during the remainder of fiscal '19. 
Our second quarter rental organic growth rate of 6.6% rebounded as expected, from the first quarter's rate of 4.9%. In fact, this organic growth rate of 6.6% exceeded our internal expectations. We have seen of our sales productivity reach preacquisition levels and we've seen good performance in penetrating legacy G&K customers, particularly in the hygiene space.
Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '19 of $775 million increased 8.2% from last year's second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.1% for the second quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 44.6% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Uniform Rental and Facility Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved to 45.3% from 44.7% in the second quarter of last fiscal year.
Gross margin improved in the quarter and year-to-date despite some cost headwinds recited on last quarter's earnings call, including wage inflation and higher-cost for certain commodities.
Reported operating income for the second quarter was $275 million compared to $235 million in last year's second quarter. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $7.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '19 and $13.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal '18. Excluding integration expenses, our second quarter operating income grew 14.2%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.5% compared to 15.5% last year.
Net interest expense was $4 million lower in the second quarter of fiscal '19 compared to last year due to debt reduction.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 of $243 million increased 76% from last year's second quarter net income from continuing operations of $138 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 were $2.18, an increase of about 76% from the EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '18 of $1.24. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year's second quarter compared to last year's second quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net income and EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 benefited $0.47 from a gain on the sale of a cost method investment. Also, net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in second quarter of fiscal '19 and '18 by $0.05 and $0.07, respectively, from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition.
Excluding these special items, our second quarter EPS from continuing operations were $1.76 compared to last year's EPS from continuing operations of $1.31. We provided these figures in a table in today's press release.
As a result of our second quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we're increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.8 billion to $6.85 million to a range of $6.87 billion to $6.91 billion. And EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.19 to $7.29 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.38. Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an additional $2.5 million to $3 million of interest expense from last quarter's guidance due to having some commercial paper.
It still assumes an effective rate of 21.7% for the year. This is the same rate guidance as last quarter. It assumes our total diluted share count for computing EPS of 112 million shares. It does not assume any additional G&K integration expenses.  However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $18 million to $22 million for the full fiscal year.
As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with the progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. We are on track to achieve another year of solid revenue and earnings growth. And additionally, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. As a reminder, on December 7, we paid an annual dividend of $2.05 per share, an increase of 26.5% over last year's annual dividend. And through the end of our second quarter, we purchased $447 million of Cintas stock under our buyback authorizations.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul."

We have 2 reportable operating segments. Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in all other.
All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sales business.
First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towers, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services.
The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,390,000,000, an increase of 6.3% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.6%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.3% for the second quarter compared to 44.7% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points.
Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.4% equal to last year's second quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion this quarter and year-to-date and our ability to overcome wage inflation, increased commodity costs, such as for hangers, which are sourced mostly from China. And the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration in the ERP system implementation.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $153 million, which was 10.3% higher than last year's second quarter.
On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.2%. This segment's gross margin was 48% in the second quarter compared to 46.9% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 110 basis points.
Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business. 
Solid revenue growth and expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on outsourcing the Cintas the management of their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the all other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion-dollar account.
Uniform Direct Sales, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units.
All Other revenue was $174 million, an increase of 9.3% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.9% and was driven by 14% organic growth in the Fire business.
All Other gross margin was 41.2% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year's second quarter. Improvement in the Fire business gross margin year-over-year was more than offset by lower gross margins and Uniform Direct Sales business. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the second quarter compared to 29.1% in last year's second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '19, there was a benefit of $6.1 million from lower commission expense resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers. We discussed this on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal '19 guidance. In addition to this benefit, we are getting good leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations from the second quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. Our EPS guidance for fiscal '19 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve billed and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $88 million. Capital expenditures in the second quarter was $73 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $58 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $10 million in First Aid and Safety; and $5 million in all other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million.
As of November 30, total debt was $2,710,000,000. $2,536,000,000 is fixed interest rate debt and $173 million is variable rates commercial paper. At November 30, our leverage was 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

From an energy perspective, it was flat in the quarter year-over-year and we're expecting it to be just up slightly. We don't give the specific enough to provide you an oil price right. But we think it'll be up slightly for the back half of the year. We have talked a little bit about the labor. We're seeing that in the pockets as we've said over the last several quarters, and that certainly is within our numbers for the first half of the year and it is contemplated in our guidance for the second half of the year. So the great news is, we've been able to increase gross margins in this quarter and for the year, and expect that to continue despite some pressure from labor. We also talked a little bit about commodities. You can kind of think of this as the trade impact, right. And last -- if you think about China for example, we've seen a bucket announced in July of tariff increases on a certain set of products and services. We were not impacted by that. The second bucket team in September, we were slightly impacted by that and we touched on that last quarter. Again, it's a pretty small amount, but that may continue. And certainly, then, it's too early to tell on anything else that may change with China. We also -- we didn't touch on it last time, but certainly, it's been in the news quite a bit. And if we can continue to see the structure to replace NAFTA or continue NAFTA, if you can see the structure to replace NAFTA in the U.S. MCA, not much of a change there either. So the really good news is, while we do see a little bit of an impact, it hasn't been significant and it is certainly within our guided numbers. And really, while we're on trade, if we think about our supply chain, we've got a really good global supply chain. And we've talked about how we control much of what we purchase. And when I say control, we either have owned manufacturing to a lesser extent, but we also control then fabric purchases and the shipment of those fabrics around the world to different sowing suppliers. We have the ability to be flexible with that trade and as trade changes, we have the ability to be flexible where many of our competitors do not. They are either tied to their own manufacturing or tied to third-party suppliers. We have the flexibility to be much more flexible than that. And so if you think about all of these different pressures, we like the way we were able to perform. We like the way we were able to leverage our infrastructure to find efficiencies. And that's what you're seeing in this guidance and in our current results. We're able to increase our gross and operating margins, despite some of these pressures. Now that could change if the macro environment or trade significantly changes and we'll certainly let you know about that.

I don't have a percentage or $1 revenue number of share Andy, but we are continuing to move forward with that. And it's going well, and I think the cautious approach is certainly helping us. From an overall G&K standpoint as you mentioned, it continues to get more and more. And part of the rerouting and the route optimization is even more intertwining. So I think, I talked a little bit about this where if we have multiple locations, legacy Cintas and legacy G&K, part of that route optimization results in volume possibly moving from 1 plan to another. So even a legacy G&K facility today that has participated in route optimization may have some legacy Cintas volume in there. So it gives more and more intertwined. However, we certainly like the performance that we've seen out of the business, out of the integration activities and we still feel very good about the synergy numbers that we've put out there. We estimate that the current quarter is about $25 million in synergies that continues very well on to our expectation for this fiscal '19 year.

And then finally Shlomo, we're a little bit inventory build because what we're finding is, we've had asked skews historically with Cintas stand-alone, but we're not sufficient enough in that demand for us to inventory them and stock them in our distribution centers. So what would happen is our operations would just 4 of these items from various vendors directly and they would shipped back to those operations. But now with the increased volume from G&K, it does make sense to put more skews in distribution, managed it centrally, negotiate better cost by doing that.

We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,718,000,000, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was also 7%.
The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.6%. And the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.2%. 
Since the announcement of the G&K Services acquisition nearly 2 years ago, we communicated our expected trajectory of the acquired revenue and its impact on Uniform Rental and Facility Services growth rates. We've discussed that the organic revenue growth rate would reach bottom in the first quarter of this fiscal year due to the lapping of the G&K acquisition and that we expect the organic growth rate to accelerate during the remainder of fiscal '19. 
Our second quarter rental organic growth rate of 6.6% rebounded as expected from the first quarter's rate of 4.9%. In fact, this organic growth rate of 6.6% exceeded our internal expectation. We have seen of our sales rep productivity reach preacquisition levels, and we've seen good performance in penetrating legacy G&K customers, particularly in the hygiene space.
Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '19 of $775 million increased 8.2% from last year's second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.1% for the second quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 44.6% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Uniform Rental and Facility Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved to 45.3% from 44.7% in the second quarter of last fiscal year.
Gross margin improved in the quarter and year-to-date, despite some cost headwinds recited on last quarter's earnings call, including wage inflation and higher cost for certain commodities.
Reported operating income for the second quarter was $275 million compared to $235 million in last year's second quarter. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $7.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '19 and $13.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal '18. Excluding integration expenses, our second quarter operating income grew 14.2%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.5% compared to 15.5% last year.
Net interest expense was $4 million lower in the second quarter of fiscal '19 compared to last year due to debt reduction.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 of $243 million increased 76% from last year's second quarter net income from continuing operations of $138 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 were $2.18, an increase of about 76% from the EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '18 of $1.24. Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year's second quarter compared to last year's second quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 benefited $0.47 from a gain on the sale of a cost method investment. Also, net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in second quarter of fiscal '19 and '18 by $0.05 and $0.07, respectively, from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition.
Excluding these special items, our second quarter EPS from continuing operations were $1.76 compared to last year's EPS from continuing operations of $1.31. We provided these figures in a table in today's press release.
As a result of our second quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we're increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion to a range of $6.87 billion to $6.91 billion and EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.19 to $7.29 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.38. 
Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an additional $2.5 million to $3 million of interest expense from last quarter's guidance due to having some commercial paper. It still assumes an effective rate of 21.7% for the year. This is the same rate guidance as last quarter. It assumes the total diluted share count for computing EPS of 112 million shares. It does not assume any additional G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $18 million to $22 million for the full fiscal year.
As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. We are on track to achieve another year of solid revenue and earnings growth. And additionally, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. As a reminder, on December 7, we paid an annual dividend of $2.05 per share, an increase of 26.5% over last year's annual dividend. And through the end of our second quarter, we purchased 447 million of Cintas stock under our buyback authorizations.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul."

We have 2 reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other.
All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sales business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,390,000,000, an increase of 6.3% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.6%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.3% for the second quarter compared to 44.7% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points.
Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.4%, equal to last year's second quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion this quarter and year-to-date and our ability to overcome wage inflation; increased commodity costs, such as for hangers, which are sourced mostly from China; and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $153 million, which was 10.3% higher than last year's second quarter.
On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.2%. This segment's gross margin was 48% in the second quarter compared to 46.9% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. 
Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business. Solid revenue growth and expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on outsourcing to Cintas the management of their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sales business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account.
Uniform Direct Sales, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.
All Other revenue was $174 million, an increase of 9.3% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.9% and was driven by 14% organic growth in the fire business.
All Other gross margin was 41.2% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year's second quarter. Improvement in the fire business gross margin year-over-year was more than offset by lower gross margins and Uniform Direct Sales business. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the second quarter compared to 29.1% in last year's second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '19, there was a benefit of $6.1 million from lower commission expense resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers. We discussed this on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal '19 guidance. In addition to this benefit, we are getting good leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations from the second quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. Our EPS guidance for fiscal '19 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $88 million. Capital expenditures in the second quarter was $73 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $58 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10 million in First Aid and Safety, and $5 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million.
As of November 30, total debt was $2,710,000,000. $2,536,000,000 is fixed interest rate debt and $173 million is variable rates commercial paper. At November 30, our leverage was 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

But",547,"Well, let's talk about the pressures -- the cost pressures that we've cited. From an energy perspective, it was flat in the quarter year-over-year and we're expecting it to be just up slightly. We don't get specific enough to provide you an oil price. But we think it'll be up slightly for the back half of the year. We have talked a little bit about the labor. We're seeing that in pockets, as we've said over the last several quarters, and that certainly is within our numbers for the first half of the year and it is contemplated in our guidance for the second half of the year. So the great news is we've been able to increase gross margins in this quarter and for the year and expect that to continue despite some pressure from labor. We also talked a little bit about some commodities. You can kind of think of this as the trade impact, right? And last, if you think about China, for example, we've seen a bucket announced in July of tariff increases on a certain set of products and services. We were not impacted by that. The second bucket team in September, we were slightly impacted by that, and we touched on that last quarter. Again, it's a pretty small amount, but that may continue. And certainly then, it's too early to tell on anything else that may change with China. We also -- we didn't touch on it last time, but certainly, NAFTA has been in the news quite a bit. And if we can continue to see the structure to replace NAFTA or continue NAFTA, but if we can see the structure to replace NAFTA in the U.S. MCA, not much of a change there either. So the really good news is, while we do see a little bit of an impact, it hasn't been significant and it is certainly within our guided numbers. And really while we're on trade, if we think about our supply chain, we've got a really good global supply chain. And we've talked about how we control much of what we purchase. And when I say control, we either have owned manufacturing to a lesser extent, but we also control then fabric purchases and the shipment of those fabrics around the world to different sewing suppliers. We have the ability to be flexible with that. And as trade and -- as trade changes, we have the ability to be flexible where many of our competitors do not. They are either tied to their own manufacturing or tied to third-party suppliers. We have the flexibility to be much more flexible than that. And so if we think about all of these different pressures, we like the way we are able to perform. We like the way we are able to leverage our infrastructure to find efficiencies. And that's what you're seeing in this guidance and in our current results. We're able to increase our gross and operating margins despite some of these pressures. Now that could change if the macro environment or trade significantly changes, and we'll certainly let you know about that. But as we stand today, we like the way we're able to adapt to some changes in the environment and still improve margins."

But we are continuing to move forward with that, and it's going well. And I think the cautious approach is certainly helping us. From an overall G&K standpoint, as you mentioned, it continues to get more and more intertwined. And part of the rerouting and the route optimization is even more intertwining. So I think I've talked a little bit about this where if we have multiple locations, legacy Cintas and legacy G&K, part of that route optimization results in volume possibly moving from one plant to another. So even a legacy G&K facility today that has participated in route optimization may have some legacy Cintas volume in there. So it gets more and more intertwined. However, we certainly like the performance that we've seen out of the business, out of the integration activities, and we still feel very good about the synergy numbers that we've put out there.

And we don't have concerns about collectability. Our customers really need. And ones what we provide, they do pay. But Mike has talked many times on prior calls about the inefficiencies that exist within the organization when you have 2 significant projects going on at the same time, the G&K integration, the SAP implementation. We've a lot of system conversions, customers are impacted, billing changes, invoices looks different. And because of that disruption, it is causing some slowdown in cash coming in and a little bit of a build of AR. But again, we believe it's nothing but temporary, and we will collect."

And to build on Mike's comment about the growth, the other bucket is inventory. And we talked last quarter about the fact that to support our growth, we have a new distribution center, a facility services distribution center that came online. We're building inventory to ramp that up and then get ready to put that operation in place. So we're still burning off that inventory. It's a little bit elevated at this point in time. And then finally, Shlomo, we have a little bit of inventory build, because what we're finding is we've had asked SKUs historically with just Cintas standalone that were not sufficient enough and the demand for us to inventory them and stock them in our distribution centers. So what would happen is our operations would just order these items from various vendors directly, and they would ship back to those operations. But now with the increased volume from G&K, it does make sense to put more SKUs into the  distribution center, manage it centrally, negotiate better cost by doing that. And so that is a little bit of an inventory build. But ultimately, again that's a timing thing and that's a measure we're putting in place, because we believe that will help us manage costs and lower them."

We do a lot of communication. We do a lot of training. We do a lot of not just training in terms of looking at documents and understanding, but actually doing and working in the system. So we've gotten, we believe, to be pretty efficient at a pretty good at getting our locations prepared. Having said that, it certainly is still a disruption and it takes time to get through. It takes time to get our customers used to seeing that different kind of invoice, et cetera. So disruption will continue until we're finished with it, but we get better and better with each one. From a standpoint of what have we seen out of the system, we really do like the efficiency that it brings to our SSRs. Our SSRs are our drivers. They have handheld computers. They are much better and much more efficient than they used to be. And so we like how those are working. Our First Aid and Safety business has been on SAP for a few years, and we like the knowledge and the information that gives to that business. We're starting to see a little bit of that in the rental business. And as you can tell from the First Aid and Safety business, we like how our growth is going there.

We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,718,000,000, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was also 7%.
The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.6%. And the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.2%. 
Since the announcement of the G&K Services acquisition nearly 2 years ago, we communicated our expected trajectory of the acquired revenue and its impact on Uniform Rental and Facility Services growth rates. We've discussed that the organic revenue growth rate would reach bottom in the first quarter of this fiscal year due to the lapping of the G&K acquisition and that we expected the organic growth rate to accelerate during the remainder of fiscal '19. 
Our second quarter rental organic growth rate of 6.6% rebounded as expected from the first quarter's rate of 4.9%. In fact, this organic growth rate of 6.6% exceeded our internal expectations. We have seen our sales rep productivity reach preacquisition levels, and we've seen good performance in penetrating legacy G&K customers, particularly in the hygiene space.
Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '19 of $775 million increased 8.2% from last year's second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.1% for the second quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 44.6% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Uniform Rental and Facility Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved to 45.3% from 44.7% in the second quarter of last fiscal year.
Gross margin improved in the quarter and year to date, despite some cost headwinds we cited on last quarter's earnings call, including wage inflation and higher cost for certain commodities.
Reported operating income for the second quarter was $275 million compared to $235 million in last year's second quarter. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $7.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '19 and $13.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal '18. Excluding integration expenses, our second quarter operating income grew 14.2%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.5% compared to 15.5% last year.
Net interest expense was $4 million lower in the second quarter of fiscal '19 compared to last year due to debt reduction.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 of $243 million increased 76% from last year's second quarter net income from continuing operations of $138 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 were $2.18, an increase of about 76% from the EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '18 of $1.24. Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year's second quarter compared to last year's second quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 benefited $0.47 from a gain on the sale of a cost method investment. Also, net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in second quarter of fiscal '19 and '18 by $0.05 and $0.07, respectively from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition.
Excluding these special items, our second quarter EPS from continuing operations were $1.76 compared to last year's EPS from continuing operations of $1.31. We provided these figures in a table in today's press release.
As a result of our second quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we're increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion to a range of $6.87 billion to $6.91 billion and EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.19 to $7.29 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.38. 
Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an additional $2.5 million to $3 million of interest expense from last quarter's guidance due to having some commercial paper. It still assumes an effective rate of 21.7% for the year. This is the same rate guidance as last quarter. It assumes a total diluted share count for computing EPS of 112 million shares. It does not assume any additional G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $18 million to $22 million for the full fiscal year.
As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. We are on track to achieve another year of solid revenue and earnings growth. And additionally, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. As a reminder, on December 7, we paid an annual dividend of $2.05 per share, an increase of 26.5% over last year's annual dividend. And through the end of our second quarter, we purchased 447 million of Cintas stock under our buyback authorizations.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul."

Please note that our fiscal second quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year second quarter.

We have 2 reportable operating segments, uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other.
All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sales business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,390,000,000, an increase of 6.3% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.6%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.3% for the second quarter compared to 44.7% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points.
Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.4%, equal to last year's second quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion this quarter and year to date and our ability to overcome wage inflation; increased commodity costs, such as for hangers, which are sourced mostly from China; and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $153 million, which was 10.3% higher than last year's second quarter.
On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.2%. This segment's gross margin was 48% in the second quarter compared to 46.9% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. 
Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business. Solid revenue growth and expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on outsourcing to Cintas the management of their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account.
Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.
All Other revenue was $174 million, an increase of 9.3% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.9% and was driven by 14% organic growth in the fire business.
All Other gross margin was 41.2% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year's second quarter. Improvement in the fire business gross margin year-over-year was more than offset by lower gross margins and Uniform Direct Sale business. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the second quarter compared to 29.1% in last year's second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '19, there was a benefit of $6.1 million from lower commission expense resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers. We discussed this on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal '19 guidance. In addition to this benefit, we are getting good leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. Our EPS guidance for fiscal '19 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $88 million. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $73 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows,  $58 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10 million in First Aid and Safety and $5 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million.
As of November 30, total debt was $2,710,000,000. $2,536,000,000 is fixed interest rate debt and $173 million is variable rates commercial paper. At November 30, our leverage was 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

From an energy perspective, it was flat in the quarter year-over-year and we're expecting it to be just up slightly. We don't get specific enough to provide you an oil price. But we think it'll be up slightly for the back half of the year. We have talked a little bit about the labor. We're seeing that in pockets, as we've said over the last several quarters, and that certainly is within our numbers for the first half of the year and it is contemplated in our guidance for the second half of the year. So the great news is we've been able to increase gross margins in this quarter and for the year and expect that to continue despite some pressure from labor. We also talked a little bit about some commodities. You can kind of think of this as the trade impact, right? And last, if you think about China, for example, we've seen a bucket announced in July of tariff increases on a certain set of products and services. We were not impacted by that. The second bucket team in September, we were slightly impacted by that, and we touched on that last quarter. Again, it's a pretty small amount, but that may continue. And certainly then, it's too early to tell on anything else that may change with China. We also -- we didn't touch on it last time, but certainly, NAFTA has been in the news quite a bit. And if we can continue to see the structure to replace NAFTA or continue NAFTA, but if we can see the structure to replace NAFTA in the U.S. MCA, not much of a change there either. So the really good news is, while we do see a little bit of an impact, it hasn't been significant and it is certainly within our guided numbers. And really while we're on trade, if we think about our supply chain, we've got a really good global supply chain. And we've talked about how we control much of what we purchase. And when I say control, we either have owned manufacturing to a lesser extent, but we also control then fabric purchases and the shipment of those fabrics around the world to different sewing suppliers. We have the ability to be flexible with that. And as trade and -- as trade changes, we have the ability to be flexible where many of our competitors do not. They are either tied to their own manufacturing or tied to third-party suppliers. We have the flexibility to be much more flexible than that. And so as we think about all of these different pressures, we like the way we are able to perform. We like the way we are able to leverage our infrastructure to find efficiencies. And that's what you're seeing in this guidance and in our current results. We're able to increase our gross and operating margins despite some of these pressures. Now that could change if the macro environment or trade significantly changes, and we'll certainly let you know about that. But as we stand today, we like the way we're able to adapt to some changes in the environment and still improve margins."

But we are continuing to move forward with that, and it's going well. And I think the cautious approach is certainly helping us. From an overall G&K standpoint, as you mentioned, it continues to get more and more intertwined. And part of the rerouting and the route optimization is even more intertwining. So I think I've talked a little bit about this where if we have multiple locations, legacy Cintas and legacy G&K, part of that route optimization results in volume possibly moving from one plant to another. So even a legacy G&K facility today that has participated in route optimization may have some legacy Cintas volume in there. So it gets more and more intertwined. However, we certainly like the performance that we've seen out of the business, out of the integration activities, and we still feel very good about the synergy numbers that we've put out there. We estimate that the current quarter is about $25 million in synergies that continues us very well on to our expectation for this fiscal '19 year.

And then finally, Shlomo, we have a little bit of inventory build, because what we're finding is we've had SKUs historically with just Cintas standalone that were not sufficient enough in the demand for us to inventory them and stock them in our distribution centers. So what would happen is our operations would just order these items from various vendors directly, and they would ship back to those operations. But now with the increased volume from G&K, it does make sense to put more SKUs into the  distribution center, manage it centrally, negotiate better cost by doing that.

We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.
Our revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,718,000,000, an increase of 7% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was also 7%.
The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.6%. And the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.2%. 
Since the announcement of the G&K Services acquisition nearly 2 years ago, we communicated our expected trajectory of the acquired revenue and its impact on Uniform Rental and Facility Services growth rates. We've discussed that the organic revenue growth rate would reach bottom in the first quarter of this fiscal year due to the lapping of the G&K acquisition and that we expected the organic growth rate to accelerate during the remainder of fiscal '19. 
Our second quarter rental organic growth rate of 6.6% rebounded as expected from the first quarter's rate of 4.9%. In fact, this organic growth rate of 6.6% exceeded our internal expectations. We have seen our sales rep productivity reach preacquisition levels, and we've seen good performance in penetrating legacy G&K customers, particularly in the hygiene space.
Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '19 of $775 million increased 8.2% from last year's second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.1% for the second quarter of fiscal '19 compared to 44.6% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Uniform Rental and Facility Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved to 45.3% from 44.7% in the second quarter of last fiscal year.
Gross margin improved in the quarter and year to date, despite some cost headwinds we cited on last quarter's earnings call, including wage inflation and higher cost for certain commodities.
Reported operating income for the second quarter was $275 million compared to $235 million in last year's second quarter. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $7.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '19 and $13.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal '18. Excluding integration expenses, our second quarter operating income grew 14.2%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.5% compared to 15.5% last year.
Net interest expense was $4 million lower in the second quarter of fiscal '19 compared to last year due to debt reduction.
Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 of $243 million increased 76% from last year's second quarter net income from continuing operations of $138 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 were $2.18, an increase of about 76% from the EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '18 of $1.24. Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year's second quarter compared to last year's second quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Net income and EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '19 benefited $0.47 from a gain on the sale of a cost method investment. Also, net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in second quarter of fiscal '19 and '18 by $0.05 and $0.07, respectively from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition.
Excluding these special items, our second quarter EPS from continuing operations were $1.76 compared to last year's EPS from continuing operations of $1.31. We provided these figures in a table in today's press release.
As a result of our second quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we're increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion to a range of $6.87 billion to $6.91 billion and EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.19 to $7.29 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.38. 
Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an additional $2.5 million to $3 million of interest expense from last quarter's guidance due to having some commercial paper. It still assumes an effective rate of 21.7% for the year. This is the same rate guidance as last quarter. It assumes a total diluted share count for computing EPS of 112 million shares. It does not assume any additional G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $18 million to $22 million for the full fiscal year.
As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. We are on track to achieve another year of solid revenue and earnings growth. And additionally, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. As a reminder, on December 7, we paid an annual dividend of $2.05 per share, an increase of 26.5% over last year's annual dividend. And through the end of our second quarter, we purchased 447 million of Cintas stock under our buyback authorizations.
I'll now turn the call over to Paul."

We have 2 reportable operating segments, uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other.
All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sales business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,390,000,000, an increase of 6.3% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.6%.
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.3% for the second quarter compared to 44.7% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points.
Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.4%, equal to last year's second quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion this quarter and year to date and our ability to overcome wage inflation; increased commodity costs, such as for hangers, which are sourced mostly from China; and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $153 million, which was 10.3% higher than last year's second quarter.
On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.2%. This segment's gross margin was 48% in the second quarter compared to 46.9% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. 
Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business. Solid revenue growth and expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on outsourcing to Cintas the management of their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account.
Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.
All Other revenue was $174 million, an increase of 9.3% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.9% and was driven by 14% organic growth in the fire business.
All Other gross margin was 41.2% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year's second quarter. Improvement in the fire business gross margin year-over-year was more than offset by lower gross margins and Uniform Direct Sale business. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the second quarter compared to 29.1% in last year's second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '19, there was a benefit of $6.1 million from lower commission expense resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers. We discussed this on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal '19 guidance. In addition to this benefit, we are getting good leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. Our EPS guidance for fiscal '19 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.
Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $88 million. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $73 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows,  $58 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10 million in First Aid and Safety and $5 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million.
As of November 30, total debt was $2,710,000,000. $2,536,000,000 is fixed interest rate debt and $173 million is variable rates commercial paper. At November 30, our leverage was 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

From an energy perspective, it was flat in the quarter year-over-year and we're expecting it to be just up slightly. We don't get specific enough to provide you an oil price. But we think it'll be up slightly for the back half of the year. We have talked a little bit about the labor. We're seeing that in pockets, as we've said over the last several quarters, and that certainly is within our numbers for the first half of the year and it is contemplated in our guidance for the second half of the year. So the great news is we've been able to increase gross margins in this quarter and for the year and expect that to continue despite some pressure from labor. We also talked a little bit about some commodities. You can kind of think of this as the trade impact, right? And last, if you think about China, for example, we've seen a bucket announced in July of tariff increases on a certain set of products and services. We were not impacted by that. The second bucket team in September, we were slightly impacted by that, and we touched on that last quarter. Again, it's a pretty small amount, but that may continue. And certainly then, it's too early to tell on anything else that may change with China. We also -- we didn't touch on it last time, but certainly, NAFTA has been in the news quite a bit. And if we can continue to see the structure to replace NAFTA or continue NAFTA, but if we can see the structure to replace NAFTA in the U.S. MCA, not much of a change there either. So the really good news is, while we do see a little bit of an impact, it hasn't been significant and it is certainly within our guided numbers. And really while we're on trade, if we think about our supply chain, we've got a really good global supply chain. And we've talked about how we control much of what we purchase. And when I say control, we either have owned manufacturing to a lesser extent, but we also control then fabric purchases and the shipment of those fabrics around the world to different sewing suppliers. We have the ability to be flexible with that. And as trade and -- as trade changes, we have the ability to be flexible where many of our competitors do not. They are either tied to their own manufacturing or tied to third-party suppliers. We have the flexibility to be much more flexible than that. And so as we think about all of these different pressures, we like the way we are able to perform. We like the way we are able to leverage our infrastructure to find efficiencies. And that's what you're seeing in this guidance and in our current results. We're able to increase our gross and operating margins despite some of these pressures. Now that could change if the macro environment or trade significantly changes, and we'll certainly let you know about that. But as we stand today, we like the way we're able to adapt to some changes in the environment and still improve margins."

But we are continuing to move forward with that, and it's going well. And I think the cautious approach is certainly helping us. From an overall G&K standpoint, as you mentioned, it continues to get more and more intertwined. And part of the rerouting and the route optimization is even more intertwining. So I think I've talked a little bit about this where if we have multiple locations, legacy Cintas and legacy G&K, part of that route optimization results in volume possibly moving from one plant to another. So even a legacy G&K facility today that has participated in route optimization may have some legacy Cintas volume in there. So it gets more and more intertwined. However, we certainly like the performance that we've seen out of the business, out of the integration activities, and we still feel very good about the synergy numbers that we've put out there.

And we don't have concerns about collectability. Our customers really need and want what we provide, and they do pay. But Mike has talked many times on prior calls about the inefficiencies that exist within the organization when you have 2 significant projects going on at the same time, the G&K integration, the SAP implementation. We've a lot of system conversions, customers are impacted, billing changes, invoices looks different. And because of that disruption, it is causing some slowdown in cash coming in, a little bit of a build of AR. But again, we believe it's nothing but temporary, and we will collect."

And to build on Mike's comment about the growth, the other bucket is inventory. And we talked last quarter about the fact that to support our growth, we have a new distribution center, a facility services distribution center that came online. We were building inventory to ramp that up and then get ready to put that operation in place. So we're still burning off that inventory. It's a little bit elevated at this point in time. And then finally, Shlomo, we have a little bit of inventory build, because what we're finding is we've had SKUs historically with just Cintas standalone that were not sufficient enough in the demand for us to inventory them and stock them in our distribution centers. So what would happen is our operations would just order these items from various vendors directly, and they would ship back to those operations. But now with the increased volume from G&K, it does make sense to put more SKUs into the  distribution center, manage it centrally, negotiate better cost by doing that. And so that is a little bit of an inventory build. But ultimately, again that's a timing thing and that's a measure we're putting in place, because we believe that will help us manage costs and lower them in the..."

We do a lot of communication. We do a lot of training. We do a lot of not just training in terms of looking at documents and understanding, but actually doing and working in the system. So we've gotten, we believe, to be pretty efficient and pretty good at getting our locations prepared. Having said that, certainly is still a disruption and it takes time to get through. It takes time to get our customers used to seeing that different kind of invoice, et cetera. So disruption will continue until we're finished with it, but we get better and better with each one. From the standpoint of what have we seen out of the system, we really do like the efficiency that it brings to our SSRs. Our SSRs are our drivers. They have handheld computers. They are much better and much more efficient than they used to be. And so we like how those are working.
