After increasing the dividend in October for the 6th straight year, we completed 2",796,"Thanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today. 2017 was a strong year for our company financially, operationally and in the areas of safety and public policy. 
After increasing the dividend in October for the 6th straight year, we completed 2017 with earnings exceeding expectations. Jim will discuss the financial results. My comments will focus on our 2017 highlights in the year ahead. Our fleet continued to perform well in 2017. Palo Verde generating station completed another outstanding year of carbon-free electricity production, generating 32.3 million-megawatt hours of energy. It's also notable that the team of Palo Verde has completed each of the scheduled 2017 spring and fall refuelings and maintenance outages in 30 days. This is the first time in plant's history when both outages were completed and 30 days. Our generation fleet continues to evolve by integrating additional clean energy and by focusing on meeting our peak demand. The 2017 request for proposal for heating capacity resources concluded with a power purchase agreement for 65 megawatts of solar with 50 megawatts of battery storage. This will be one of our largest battery storage systems in the country. Although, APS has recognized that it's the national leader in the solar energy with more than a gigawatt of solar power on our system, this next step toward battery storage will ensure that sun helps power Arizona homes into the early evening when our customer demand for electricity peaks. The facility is expected to begin serving customers in 2021. 
Our investments are focused both on additional clean energy resources and the technology necessary to support these resources. 
Our 2017 operations benefited from the robust technology investments, that were further strengthening our electric system, increased efficiency of our operations and improved our customers' experience. Among the most significant improvements were the implementation of a new advanced distribution management system, or ADMS, and customer information system. ADMS has increased our ability to control the grid remotely, while the customer information system has increased our ability to respond to customers. 
Our continued investment in system improvements has resulted in other tangible customer benefits. In 2017, we achieved top quartile distribution reliability metrics and had the best summer reliability in 5 years, despite the hot and demanding whether. APS also remains top best for safety performance as compared to our pure electric utilities. The transmission and distribution organization had its safest year ever. The safety of our men and women is our top priority. It's indicative not only of our commitment to our people but it also reflects our commitment to operational excellence. 
We'll continue to strive for 0, a truly injury-free workplace. Turning to the regulatory fund. 
A positive and collaborative outcome of our rate review was a milestone accomplishment in 2017. The Arizona Corporations Commission's decision clearly demonstrates Arizona's interest in capitalizing on the changing dynamics of the electric utility industry and meeting the evolving needs of our customers. We will continue this progress in 2018 as our customers transition to the new rates. Although the rate review is complete, there are a number of public policy items to be decided in 2018. A step increase request for the SCR environmental control project at Four Corners will be filed in April. And the commission's expected to vote on the 2018 demand-side management plan, and yesterday, the commission approved a $119 million of bill induction for customers based on federal corporate tax reductions. The savings from the tax reductions will be passed directly to customers through the tax expense adjustor mechanism, a new adjustor mechanism that was included in our 2017 rate review. 
We intend to file a subsequent application with the commission later this year and pass through additional savings from the federal tax reform to our customers. 
In addition, discussions continue on ways to economically integrate more clean energy resources statewide without jeopardizing reliability or magnifying the over generation challenges in the middle of the day. 
For 2018, our strategic priority is centered around consumer engagement, flexible resources, employees and innovation. Specifically, we plan to deliver consumer-driven programs and services, develop new initiatives that leverage our core capabilities, adopt sustainable programs that support our people and integrate new technologies to enhance performance reliability and the overall experience of our customers. These priorities align with our mission of safely and efficiently delivering energy to meet the changing needs of our customers. In summary, we achieved another year of outstanding performance as we focus on delivering on our commitments for the customers who depend on us, the communities we serve, our dedicated employees and the shareholders who trust us with their investment. 
For 2018, we have clear priorities and alignment amongst the senior leadership that execute selectively on these priorities. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. As you can see on Slide 3, the materials. We had a solid year. Before I review the details o",1370,"Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. 
As you can see on Slide 3, the materials. We had a solid year. Before I review the details of our 2017 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter of 2017, we were at $0.19 per share compared to $0.47 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the decrease in our quarterly earnings. Looking at adjusted gross margin, the rate increase, higher sales-related revenue and transmission revenue were all positive contributions. 
As we anticipated, higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the 2016, decreased earnings, largely due to the higher planned outage costs related to the SCR installation that Four Corners advised. Not turning your attention to Slide 5, I'll review some highlights of our full year results. We delivered strong results in 2017 that exceeded our guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30, earning $4.35 per share compared to $3.95 per share in 2016. 
Actual results were higher than projected due, in part, to effective cost management and higher revenues. 
Gross margin was a key driver in 2017 with the key core components. The rate increase that went into effect on August 19, 2017, contributed $0.30. Note, however, that there were related increases in operating expenses that partially offset the benefit of gross margin. 
Higher sales-related revenue added $0.13 to gross margin in 2017, driven by customer growth and higher average affected prices. 
Transmission and LFCR revenues also continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin, and combined, contributed $0.31 per share. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Operations and maintenance expense was up slightly in 2017 compared to 2016, and decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, primarily due to higher employee benefit and information technology costs, partially offset by lower Palo Verde operating cost and lower powerful generating costs. Higher depreciation and amortization expenses was the largest offset for 2017 earnings compared to 2016. The increase was primarily related to plant additions and includes a $61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in 2016 great review order. Other taxes were higher in 2017 relative to 2016, reflecting higher property value and the impacts related to the amortization of a property tax referral as part of the 2017 rate review order. Lastly, higher interest expense, net of AFUDC, reduced earnings in 2016 compared to 2016. This included higher interest charges due to higher allowances, partially offset by higher construction work in progress balances contributed to AFUDC. As you know, Arizona's continues to be an integral part of our investment pieces. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our overall economy. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth among above the national average, assuming the upper panel on Slide 6. Through December, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 4% compared to 1.3% for the entire U.S. This above average job growth is broad-based and driven largely by tourism, healthcare, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 3.7% also reflects the strength of the job market. Arizona's political and community leaders continue supporting economic development. 
Recently, Nicola Motor Company announced it would move its headquarters and build a new $1 billion manufacturing plant West of Phoenix. This moment is expected to bring 2,000 jobs in the Metro area with construction set to begin this year. This is one example of the ongoing business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market. Metro Phoenix also had growth in the red venture on real estate market. As you can see on the lower panel on Slide 6, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend, for new single-family homes in 2017 were the highest level since 2007. The activity in the market is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to the levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy, more generally, to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. 
Reflecting this day improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.8% in 2017, which is also the highest growth rate since 2007. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate and respond to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Before my long-term fundamental supporting future population job growth and the economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. Switching topics to our financing activities. On November 30, Pinnacle West issued $300 million of 3-year 2.25% senior unsecured notes. The net proceeds were used to repay Pinnacle West $125 million term loans, and for general corporate purposes. In 2018, we expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had $95 million short-term debt outstanding, and APS had no short-term borrowings outstanding. 
A quick note on pension. The funded staff from our pension remains healthy at 95% as of year-end 2017. This is largely due to the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy. 
Turning to our earning trends and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will now be in the range of $4.35 per share to $4.55 per share, up $0.10 from $4.25 to $4.45 per share. This increase in guidance is supported by our coordination of our cost management and variable cost trends, coupled with accelerated solid gross margin forecasts. Our earnings outlook also incorporates financial impacts from tax reform, including the tax expense adjuster mechanism, which was approved in last year's rate review in the lower effective tax rate. 
This rate increase or adjustor mechanism in sales growth remain important gross margins, which we expect, will be partially offset by higher fossil-planned outage costs and higher other operating expense related to more plant and service, including higher D&A and property taxes. 
As a reminder, we have higher fossil plant outage costs in the first half of 2018, including the 9 and 5 day SGR installation of Four Corners for planned outages at our gas plants such as Red Hawk. As updated -- an updated list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our revived 2018 outlook is concluded in the appendix to our slides. Also included in today's materials, you will see that we have extended our capital expenditures and rate-based forecast due to 2020. We increase our capitalize miniatures forecasts from 2019 to $1.15 billion and we anticipate APS's spend to be around $1.2 billion in 2020. With this capital spending level, we expect our databases to continue to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7%, although individual years may vary. 
Before closing, I'll take a few minutes to walk to the impacts of tax reform. With the various effects or mix, our balance, we view the impacts of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act as favorable. Most notably, the preservation of interest and property tax deductions from a regulated utility. The reform will also release some questions. The corporate tax rate reduction to 21%, beginning at 2018, results in $1.1 billion of excess deferred tax and regulatory liability of $1.5 billion, after the required revenue grows up for APS. Other than new tax provision, the majority of these excess deferred taxes are subject to IRS normalization provisions. During 2018, we will be working with our federal state regulators to determine the period over which to return this excess deferred tax to customers. We go back dispatching materials earnings impact from the tax reform package, especially given the minimal parent level debt. From a rate base perspective, our preliminary estimates share incremental rate base increasing approximately $150 million per year in 2018 and 2019, as a result of both the lower tax rate and the legislative changes related to tax depreciation. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the callback over to the operator for questions."

After increasing the dividend in October for the 6th straight year, we completed 2017 with earnings exceeding expectations. Jim will discuss the financial results. My comments will focus on our 2017 highlights in the year ahead. Our fleet continued to perform well in 2017. Palo Verde generating station completed another outstanding year of carbon-free electricity production, generating 32.3 million megawatt hours of energy. It's also notable that the team of Palo Verde completed each of the scheduled 2017 spring and fall refuelings and maintenance outages in 30 days. This is the first time in plant's history when both outages were completed in 30 days. Our generation fleet continues to evolve by integrating additional clean energy and by focusing on meeting our peak demand. The 2017 request for proposal for heating capacity resources concluded with a power purchase agreement for 65 megawatts of solar with 50 megawatts of battery storage. This will be one of the largest battery storage systems in the country.
Although, APS has recognized that it's the national leader in solar energy with more than a gigawatt of solar power on our system, this next step toward battery storage will ensure the sun helps power Arizona homes into the early evening when our customer demand for electricity peaks. The facility is expected to begin serving customers in 2021.
Our investments are focused both on additional clean energy resources and the technology necessary to support these resources.
Our 2017 operations benefited from the robust technology investments that were further strengthening our electric system, increased efficiency of our operations and improved our customers' experience. Among the most significant improvements were the implementation of a new advanced distribution management system, or ADMS, and customer information system. ADMS has increased our ability to control the grid remotely, while the customer information system has increased our ability to respond to customers.
Our continued investment in system improvements has resulted in other tangible customer benefits. In 2017, we achieved top quartile distribution reliability metrics and had the best summer reliability in 5 years despite the hot and demanding weather. APS also remain top decile for safety performance as compared to our pure electric utilities. The transmission and distribution organization had its safest year ever. The safety of our men and women is our top priority. It's indicative not only of our commitment to our people, but it also reflects our commitment to operational excellence. We'll continue to strive for zero, a truly injury-free workplace.
Turning to the regulatory front. A positive and collaborative outcome of our rate review was a milestone accomplishment in 2017. The Arizona Corporations Commission's decision clearly demonstrates Arizona's interest in capitalizing on the changing dynamics of the electric utility industry and meeting the evolving needs of our customers. We will continue this progress in 2018 as our customers transition to the new rates. Although the rate review is complete, there are a number of public policy items to be decided in 2018. A step-increase request for the SCR environmental control project at Four Corners will be filed in April. And the commission's expected to vote on the 2018 demand-side management plan, and yesterday, the commission approved a $119 million of bill reduction for customers based on federal corporate tax reductions. The savings from the tax reductions will be passed directly to customers through the tax expense adjustor mechanism, a new adjustor mechanism that was included in our 2017 rate review.
We intend to file a subsequent application with the commission later this year and pass through additional savings from the federal tax reform to our customers.
In addition, discussions continue on ways to economically integrate more clean energy resources statewide without jeopardizing reliability or magnifying the over generation challenges in the middle of the day.
For 2018, our strategic priority is centered around consumer engagement, flexible resources, employees and innovation. Specifically, we plan to deliver consumer-driven programs and services, develop new initiatives that leverage our core capabilities, adopt sustainable programs that support our people and integrate new technologies to enhance performance reliability and the overall experience of our customers. These priorities align with our mission of safely and efficiently delivering energy to meet the changing needs of our customers.
In summary, we achieved another year of outstanding performance as we focus on delivering on our commitments to the customers who depend on us, the communities we serve, our dedicated employees and the shareholders who trust us with their investment. For 2018, we have clear priorities and alignment amongst the senior leadership to execute collectively on these priorities.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year. Before I review the details",1389,"Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.
As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year. Before I review the details of our 2017 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2017, we were at $0.19 per share compared to $0.47 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the decrease in our quarterly earnings. Looking at adjusted gross margin, the rate increase, higher sales-related revenue and transmission revenue were all positive contributions.
As we anticipated, higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the 2016 decreased earnings, largely due to the higher planned outage costs related to the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 5.
Now turning your attention to Slide 5, I'll review some highlights of our full year results. We delivered strong results in 2017 that exceeded our guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30, earning $4.35 per share compared to $3.95 per share in 2016. Actual results were higher than projected due in part to effective cost management and higher revenues.
Gross margin was a key driver in 2017 with the key core components. The rate increase that went into effect on August 19, 2017, contributed $0.30. Note, however, that there were related increases in operating expenses that partially offset the benefit of gross margin. Higher sales-related revenue added $0.13 to gross margin in 2017, driven by customer growth and higher average affected prices.
Transmission and LFCR revenues also continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin and combined contributed $0.31 per share.
Looking next at operating expenses. Operations and maintenance expense was up slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased earnings by $0.03 per share primarily due to higher employee benefit and information technology costs, partially offset by lower Palo Verde operating cost and lower [ possible ] generating cost. Higher depreciation and amortization expense was the largest offset for 2017 earnings compared to 2016. The increase was primarily related to plant additions and includes a $61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in 2016 great review order. Other taxes were higher in 2017 relative to 2016, reflecting higher property value and the impacts related to the amortization of a property tax deferral as part of the 2017 rate review order.
Lastly, higher interest expense, net of AFUDC, reduced earnings in 2017 compared to 2016. This included higher interest charges due to higher balances, partially offset by higher construction work-in-progress balances contributed to AFUDC. As we know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment pieces. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth among -- above the national average, as seen in the upper panel of Slide 6. Through December, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 4% compared to 1.3% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is broad-based and driven largely by tourism, health care, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate at 3.7% also reflects the strength of the job market. Arizona's political and community leaders continue supporting economic development.
Recently, Nikola Motor Company announced it would move its headquarters and build a new $1 billion manufacturing plant West of Phoenix. This movement is expected to bring 2,000 jobs in the Metro area with construction set to begin this year. This is one example of the ongoing business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market. Metro Phoenix also had growth in the residential and real estate market. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 6, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. Permits for new single-family homes in 2017 were the highest level since 2007. The activity in the market is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to the levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy, more generally, to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years.
Reflecting this daily improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.8% in 2017, which is also the highest growth rate since 2007. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and the economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. Switching topics to our financing activities, on November 30, Pinnacle West issued $300 million of 3-year, 2.25% senior unsecured notes. The net proceeds were used to repay Pinnacle West $125 million term loans and for general corporate purposes. In 2018, we expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had $95 million in short-term debt outstanding, and APS had no short-term borrowings outstanding.
A quick note on pension. The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 95% as of year end 2017. This is largely due to the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy.
Turning to our earning guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will now be in the range of $4.35 per share to $4.55 per share, up $0.10 from $4.25 to $4.45 per share. This increase in guidance is supported by continuation of our cost management and favorable cost trends coupled with a solid gross margin forecast. Our earnings outlook also incorporates the financial impacts from tax reform, including the tax expense adjustor mechanism, which was approved in last year's rate review in the lower effective tax rate.
This rate increase or adjustor mechanism in sales growth remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect will be partially offset by higher fossil plant outage costs and higher other operating expense related to more plant and service, including higher D&A and property taxes.
As a reminder, we have higher fossil plant outage costs in the first half of 2018, including the 9 and 5-day SGR installation of Four Corners Unit 4 and planned outages at our gas plants such as Redhawk. As updated -- an updated list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our revived 2018 outlook is included in the appendix to our slides. Also included in today's materials, you will see that we have extended our capital expenditures in our rate base forecast through to 2020. We increased our capital expenditures forecast for 2019 to $1.15 billion, and we anticipate APS' spend to be around $1.2 billion in 2020. With this capital spending level, we expect our rate base to continue to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7%, although annual individual years may vary.
Before closing, I'll take a few minutes to walk through the impacts of the tax reform. Though the various effects or mix, our balance, we view the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as favorable. Most notably, the preservation of interest and property tax deductions from a regulated utility. The reform package will also relieve some rate pressures. The corporate tax rate reduction to 21%, beginning in 2018, results in $1.1 billion of excess deferred tax and regulatory liability of $1.5 billion after the required revenue grows up for APS. Under the new tax revision, a majority of these excess deferred taxes are subject to IRS normalization provisions.
During 2018, we will be working with our federal and state regulators to determine the period over which to return these excess deferred tax to customers. We got [indiscernible] back to material earnings impact from the tax reform package, especially given PNW's minimal parent-level debt. From a rate base perspective, our preliminary estimates show incremental rate base increasing approximately $150 million per year in 2018 and 2019 as a result of both the lower tax rate and the legislative changes related to tax depreciation.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

After increasing the dividend in October for the 6th straight year, we completed 2017 with earnings exceeding expectations. Jim will discuss the financial results. My comments will focus on our 2017 highlights in the year ahead. Our fleet continued to perform well in 2017. Palo Verde generating station completed another outstanding year of carbon-free electricity production, generating 32.3 million megawatt hours of energy. It's also notable that the team of Palo Verde completed each of the scheduled 2017 spring and fall refuelings and maintenance outages in 30 days. This is the first time in plant's history when both outages were completed in 30 days. Our generation fleet continues to evolve by integrating additional clean energy and by focusing on meeting our peak demand. The 2017 request for proposal for heating capacity resources concluded with a power purchase agreement for 65 megawatts of solar with 50 megawatts of battery storage. This will be one of the largest battery storage systems in the country.
Although, APS has recognized that it's the national leader in solar energy with more than a gigawatt of solar power on our system, this next step toward battery storage will ensure the sun helps power Arizona homes into the early evening when our customer demand for electricity peaks. The facility is expected to begin serving customers in 2021.
Our investments are focused both on additional clean energy resources and the technology necessary to support these resources.
Our 2017 operations benefited from the robust technology investments that were further strengthening our electric system, increased efficiency of our operations and improved our customers' experience. Among the most significant improvements were the implementation of a new advanced distribution management system, or ADMS, and customer information system. ADMS has increased our ability to control the grid remotely, while the customer information system has increased our ability to respond to customers.
Our continued investment in system improvements has resulted in other tangible customer benefits. In 2017, we achieved top quartile distribution reliability metrics and had the best summer reliability in 5 years despite the hot and demanding weather. APS also remained top decile for safety performance as compared to our pure electric utilities. The transmission and distribution organization had its safest year ever. The safety of our men and women is our top priority. It's indicative not only of our commitment to our people, but it also reflects our commitment to operational excellence. We'll continue to strive for zero, a truly injury-free workplace.
Turning to the regulatory front. A positive and collaborative outcome of our rate review was a milestone accomplishment in 2017. The Arizona Corporations Commission's decision clearly demonstrates Arizona's interest in capitalizing on the changing dynamics of the electric utility industry and meeting the evolving needs of our customers. We will continue this progress in 2018 as our customers transition to the new rates. Although the rate review is complete, there are a number of public policy items to be decided in 2018. A step-increase request for the SCR environmental control project at Four Corners will be filed in April. And the commission's expected to vote on the 2018 demand-side management plan, and yesterday, the commission approved a $119 million bill reduction for customers based on federal corporate tax reductions. The savings from the tax reductions will be passed directly to customers through the tax expense adjustor mechanism, a new adjustor mechanism that was included in our 2017 rate review.
We intend to file a subsequent application with the commission later this year and pass through additional savings from the federal tax reform to our customers.
In addition, discussions continue on ways to economically integrate more clean energy resources statewide without jeopardizing reliability or magnifying the over generation challenges in the middle of the day.
For 2018, our strategic priority is centered around consumer engagement, flexible resources, employees and innovation. Specifically, we plan to deliver consumer-driven programs and services, develop new initiatives that leverage our core capabilities, adopt sustainable programs that support our people and integrate new technologies to enhance performance reliability and the overall experience of our customers. These priorities align with our mission of safely and efficiently delivering energy to meet the changing needs of our customers.
In summary, we achieved another year of outstanding performance as we focus on delivering on our commitments to the customers who depend on us, the communities we serve, our dedicated employees and the shareholders who trust us with their investment. For 2018, we have clear priorities and alignment amongst the senior leadership to execute collectively on these priorities.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year. Before I review the details",1383,"Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.
As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year. Before I review the details of our 2017 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2017, we earned $0.19 per share compared to $0.47 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the decrease in our quarterly earnings. Looking at adjusted gross margin, the rate increase, higher sales-related revenue and transmission revenue were all positive contributions.
As we anticipated, higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the 2016 decreased earnings, largely due to the higher planned outage costs related to the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 5.
Now turning your attention to Slide 5, I'll review some highlights of our full year results. We delivered strong results in 2017 that exceeded our guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30, earning $4.35 per share compared to $3.95 per share in 2016. Actual results were higher than projected due in part to effective cost management and higher revenues.
Gross margin was a key driver in 2017 with the key core components. The rate increase that went into effect on August 19, 2017, contributed $0.30. Note, however, that there were related increases in operating expenses that partially offset the benefit of gross margin. Higher sales-related revenue added $0.13 to gross margin in 2017, driven by customer growth and higher average affected prices.
Transmission and LFCR revenues also continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin and combined contributed $0.31 per share.
Looking next at operating expenses. Operations and maintenance expense was up slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased earnings by $0.03 per share primarily due to higher employee benefit and information technology costs, partially offset by lower Palo Verde operating cost and lower possible generating cost. Higher depreciation and amortization expense was the largest offset for 2017 earnings compared to 2016. The increase was primarily related to plant additions and includes a $61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in 2016 rate review order. Other taxes were higher in 2017 relative to 2016, reflecting higher property value and the impacts related to the amortization of the property tax deferral as part of the 2017 rate review order.
Lastly, higher interest expense, net of AFUDC, reduced earnings in 2017 compared to 2016. This included higher interest charges due to higher balances, partially offset by higher construction work-in-progress balances contributed to AFUDC. As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth among -- above the national average, as seen in the upper panel of Slide 6. Through December, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 4% compared to 1.3% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is broad-based and driven largely by tourism, health care, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate at 3.7% also reflects the strength of the job market. Arizona's political and community leaders continue supporting economic development.
Recently, Nikola Motor Company announced it would move its headquarters and build a new $1 billion manufacturing plant West of Phoenix. This movement is expected to bring 2,000 jobs to the Metro area with construction set to begin this year. This is one example of the ongoing business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market. Metro Phoenix also had growth in the residential and real estate market. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 6, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. Permits for new single-family homes in 2017 were the highest level since 2007. The activity in the market is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to the levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy, more generally, to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years.
Reflecting this steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.8% in 2017, which is also the highest growth rate since 2007. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and the economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. Switching topics to our financing activities, on November 30, Pinnacle West issued $300 million of 3-year, 2.25% senior unsecured notes. The net proceeds were used to repay Pinnacle West $125 million term loans and for general corporate purposes. In 2018, we expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had $95 million in short-term debt outstanding, and APS had no short-term borrowings outstanding.
A quick note on pension. The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 95% as of year end 2017. This is largely due to the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy.
Turning to our earning guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will now be in the range of $4.35 per share to $4.55 per share, up $0.10 from $4.25 to $4.45 per share. This increase in guidance is supported by continuation of our cost management and favorable cost trends coupled with a solid gross margin forecast. Our earnings outlook also incorporates the financial impacts from tax reform, including the tax expense adjustor mechanism, which was approved in last year's rate review in the lower effective tax rate.
This rate increase, our adjustor mechanism and sales growth remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect will be partially offset by higher fossil plant outage costs and higher other operating expense related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and property taxes.
As a reminder, we have higher fossil plant outage costs in the first half of 2018, including the 9 and 5-day SCR installation of Four Corners Unit 4 and planned outages at our gas plants such as Redhawk. As updated -- an updated list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our revised 2018 outlook is included in the appendix to our slides. Also included in today's materials, you will see that we have extended our capital expenditures in our rate base forecast through 2020. We increased our capital expenditures forecast for 2019 to $1.15 billion, and we anticipate APS' spend to be around $1.2 billion in 2020. With this capital spending level, we expect our rate base to continue to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7%, although annual individual years may vary.
Before closing, I'll take a few minutes to walk through the impacts of the tax reform. Though the various effects our mix, on balance, we view the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as favorable. Most notably, the preservation of interest and property tax deductions for the regulated utility. The reform package will also relieve some rate pressures. The corporate tax rate reduction to 21%, beginning in 2018, results in $1.1 billion of excess deferred tax and regulatory liability of $1.5 billion after the required revenue grows up for APS. Under the new tax provision, a majority of these excess deferred taxes are subject to IRS normalization provisions.
During 2018, we will be working with our federal and state regulators to determine the period over which to return these excess deferred tax to customers. We do not expect material earnings impact from the tax reform package, especially given PNW's minimal parent-level debt. From a rate base perspective, our preliminary estimates show incremental rate base increasing approximately $150 million per year in 2018 and 2019 as a result of both the lower tax rate and the legislative changes related to tax depreciation.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

After increasing the dividend in October for the 6th straight year, we completed 2017 with earnings exceeding expectations. Jim will discuss the financial results. My comments will focus on our 2017 highlights in the year ahead. Our fleet continued to perform well in 2017. Palo Verde generating station completed another outstanding year of carbon-free electricity production, generating 32.3 million megawatt hours of energy. It's also notable that the team of Palo Verde completed each of the scheduled 2017 spring and fall refuelings and maintenance outages in 30 days. This is the first time in plant's history when both outages were completed in 30 days. Our generation fleet continues to evolve by integrating additional clean energy and by focusing on meeting our peak demand. The 2017 request for proposal for heating capacity resources concluded with a power purchase agreement for 65 megawatts of solar with 50 megawatts of battery storage. This will be one of the largest battery storage systems in the country.
Although, APS has recognized that it's the national leader in solar energy with more than a gigawatt of solar power on our system, this next step toward battery storage will ensure the sun helps power Arizona homes into the early evening when our customer demand for electricity peaks. The facility is expected to begin serving customers in 2021.
Our investments are focused both on additional clean energy resources and the technology necessary to support these resources.
Our 2017 operations benefited from the robust technology investments that were further strengthening our electric system, increased efficiency of our operations and improved our customers' experience. Among the most significant improvements were the implementation of a new advanced distribution management system, or ADMS, and customer information system. ADMS has increased our ability to control the grid remotely, while the customer information system has increased our ability to respond to customers.
Our continued investment in system improvements has resulted in other tangible customer benefits. In 2017, we achieved top quartile distribution reliability metrics and had the best summer reliability in 5 years despite the hot and demanding weather. APS also remained top decile for safety performance as compared to our pure electric utilities. The transmission and distribution organization had its safest year ever. The safety of our men and women is our top priority. It's indicative not only of our commitment to our people, but it also reflects our commitment to operational excellence. We'll continue to strive for zero, a truly injury-free workplace.
Turning to the regulatory front. A positive and collaborative outcome of our rate review was a milestone accomplishment in 2017. The Arizona Corporations Commission's decision clearly demonstrates Arizona's interest in capitalizing on the changing dynamics of the electric utility industry and meeting the evolving needs of our customers. We will continue this progress in 2018 as our customers transition to the new rates. Although the rate review is complete, there are a number of public policy items to be decided in 2018. A step-increase request for the SCR environmental control project at Four Corners will be filed in April. And the commission's expected to vote on the 2018 demand-side management plan, and yesterday, the commission approved a $119 million bill reduction for customers based on federal corporate tax reductions. The savings from the tax reductions will be passed directly to customers through the tax expense adjustor mechanism, a new adjustor mechanism that was included in our 2017 rate review.
We intend to file a subsequent application with the commission later this year and pass through additional savings from the federal tax reform to our customers.
In addition, discussions continue on ways to economically integrate more clean energy resources statewide without jeopardizing reliability or magnifying the over generation challenges in the middle of the day.
For 2018, our strategic priority is centered around consumer engagement, flexible resources, employees and innovation. Specifically, we plan to deliver consumer-driven programs and services, develop new initiatives that leverage our core capabilities, adopt sustainable programs that support our people and integrate new technologies to enhance performance reliability and the overall experience of our customers. These priorities align with our mission of safely and efficiently delivering energy to meet the changing needs of our customers.
In summary, we achieved another year of outstanding performance as we focus on delivering on our commitments to the customers who depend on us, the communities we serve, our dedicated employees and the shareholders who trust us with their investment. For 2018, we have clear priorities and alignment amongst the senior leadership to execute collectively on these priorities.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year. Before I review the details",1382,"Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.
As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year. Before I review the details of our 2017 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2017, we earned $0.19 per share compared to $0.47 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the decrease in our quarterly earnings. Looking at adjusted gross margin, the rate increase, higher sales-related revenue and transmission revenue were all positive contributions.
As we anticipated, higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the 2016 decreased earnings, largely due to the higher planned outage costs related to the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 5.
Now turning your attention to Slide 5, I'll review some highlights of our full year results. We delivered strong results in 2017 that exceeded our guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30, earning $4.35 per share compared to $3.95 per share in 2016. Actual results were higher than projected due in part to effective cost management and higher revenues.
Gross margin was a key driver in 2017 with the key core components. The rate increase that went into effect on August 19, 2017, contributed $0.30. Note, however, that there were related increases in operating expenses that partially offset the benefit of gross margin. Higher sales-related revenue added $0.13 to gross margin in 2017, driven by customer growth and higher average affected prices.
Transmission and LFCR revenues also continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin and combined contributed $0.31 per share.
Looking next at operating expenses. Operations and maintenance expense was up slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 and decreased earnings by $0.03 per share primarily due to higher employee benefit and information technology costs, partially offset by lower Palo Verde operating cost and lower possible generating cost. Higher depreciation and amortization expense was the largest offset for 2017 earnings compared to 2016. The increase was primarily related to plant additions and includes a $61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in 2016 rate review order. Other taxes were higher in 2017 relative to 2016, reflecting higher property value and the impacts related to the amortization of the property tax deferral as part of the 2017 rate review order.
Lastly, higher interest expense, net of AFUDC, reduced earnings in 2017 compared to 2016. This included higher interest charges due to higher balances, partially offset by higher construction work-in-progress balances contributed to AFUDC. As you know, Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth among -- above the national average, as seen in the upper panel of Slide 6. Through December, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 4% compared to 1.3% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is broad-based and driven largely by tourism, health care, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate at 3.7% also reflects the strength of the job market. Arizona's political and community leaders continue supporting economic development.
Recently, Nikola Motor Company announced it would move its headquarters and build a new $1 billion manufacturing plant West of Phoenix. This movement is expected to bring 2,000 jobs to the Metro area with construction set to begin this year. This is one example of the ongoing business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market. Metro Phoenix also had growth in the residential and real estate market. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 6, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. Permits for new single-family homes in 2017 were the highest level since 2007. The activity in the market is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to the levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy, more generally, to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years.
Reflecting this steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.8% in 2017, which is also the highest growth rate since 2007. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and the economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. Switching topics to our financing activities, on November 30, Pinnacle West issued $300 million of 3-year, 2.25% senior unsecured notes. The net proceeds were used to repay Pinnacle West $125 million term loans and for general corporate purposes. In 2018, we expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had $95 million in short-term debt outstanding, and APS had no short-term borrowings outstanding.
A quick note on pension. The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 95% as of year-end 2017. This is largely due to the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy.
Turning to our earning guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 7, we expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will now be in the range of $4.35 per share to $4.55 per share, up $0.10 from $4.25 to $4.45 per share. This increase in guidance is supported by continuation of our cost management and favorable cost trends coupled with a solid gross margin forecast. Our earnings outlook also incorporates the financial impacts from tax reform, including the tax expense adjustor mechanism, which was approved in last year's rate review in the lower effective tax rate.
This rate increase, our adjustor mechanism and sales growth remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect will be partially offset by higher fossil plant outage costs and higher other operating expense related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and property taxes.
As a reminder, we have higher fossil plant outage costs in the first half of 2018, including the 9 and 5-day SCR installation of Four Corners Unit 4 and planned outages at our gas plants such as Redhawk. As updated -- an updated list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our revised 2018 outlook is included in the appendix to our slides. Also included in today's materials, you will see that we have extended our capital expenditures in our rate base forecast through 2020. We increased our capital expenditures forecast for 2019 to $1.15 billion, and we anticipate APS' spend to be around $1.2 billion in 2020. With this capital spending level, we expect our rate base to continue to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7%, although annual individual years may vary.
Before closing, I'll take a few minutes to walk through the impacts of the tax reform. Though the various effects our mix, on balance, we view the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as favorable. Most notably, the preservation of interest and property tax deductions for the regulated utility. The reform package will also relieve some rate pressures. The corporate tax rate reduction to 21%, beginning in 2018, results in $1.1 billion of excess deferred tax and regulatory liability of $1.5 billion after the required revenue grows up for APS. Under the new tax provision, a majority of these excess deferred taxes are subject to IRS normalization provisions.
During 2018, we will be working with our federal and state regulators to determine the period over which to return these excess deferred tax to customers. We do not expect material earnings impact from the tax reform package, especially given PNW's minimal parent-level debt. From a rate base perspective, our preliminary estimates show incremental rate base increasing approximately $150 million per year in 2018 and 2019 as a result of both the lower tax rate and the legislative changes related to tax depreciation.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

In the first quarter of 2018, we executed on our priorities and remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. The installation of selective catalytic reduction, or SCR, emission controller equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant was completed on April 24, on time and under budget. This project provides substantial environmental benefits, including a 90% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions at the plant. On April 27, we filed for a $67.5 million step increase to recover our investment in these improvements. The step increase is an effective tool that eliminates the need to file a full rate review immediately after the conclusion of our last rate review, and provides rate gradualism for our customers. The commission previously approved the use of a step increase for the SCR installation. With calculated that the step increase request would result in approximately a 2% customer bill increase, which will likely be offset by a reduction in customer bills from other adjustor mechanism decreases. We've requested the commission approve the rate increase effective January 1, 2019. Turning to our operations. Palo Verde generating station had another successful quarter, operating at full capacity. A planned refueling outage for Palo Verde unit 3 began on April 7, and is proceeding very well. Additionally, construction activity is on track for our Ocotillo Modernization Project. The units in Ocotillo are expected to come online in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 to meet our 2019 Summer capacity needs. Technology continues to play an important -- excuse me, an important role in the efficiency of our operations. In 2012, APS became one of the first utilities in the nation to received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones in shared aerospace. Since then, the use of drones for inspecting lines, building substations, monitoring solar fields, new powerlines and inspecting storm damage and accessing hard-to-reach areas has produced significant savings for our customers. Looking to the future, a resource plan is designed to achieve a cleaner, sustainable energy mix that is anchored by Palo Verde, the largest carbon-free electric resource in the United States. In fact, we've already reached a significant milestone in this effort. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our energy mix was carbon-free. Our next integrated resource plan filings scheduled for April 2020 will continue to support the goal of achieving a cleaner, sustainable energy mix, and will incorporate updates as the commission's discussion around a possible energy modernization plan progresses. We recently announced our plan to issue multiple resource RFPs this year. On April 26, we issued an RFP for 400 to 800 megawatts of peak in capacity, with an in-service date of 2021. The peak period is between June and September and from 3:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. We also plan to see competitive proposals that utilize Arizona forest bioenergy solutions and that provide battery retrofit opportunities for APS on solar facilities. These RFPs are part of the comprehensive effort to meet our resource needs, beginning in the early 2020s. More specific information about these solicitations will be released in the coming weeks. As you may be aware, an out-of-state group primarily funded by California billionaire, Tom, has filed a ballot initiative that would require some Arizona utilities to obtain 50% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030. The sponsors must gather approximately 226,000 ballot signatures by July 5 to place the proposal on a November 2018 ballot. This initiative is overly prescriptive and irresponsible. Pinnacle West is actively opposing this ballot proposal. The initiative seeks to impair Arizona's oversight and regulation utilities, which has provided Arizona residents with some of the safest, cleanest and most reliable and affordable energy in the country over 100 years. It would trying in the state constitution, a regulatory mandate that is bad for customers potentially doubling the average customers electricity bill by 2030. At least 13 Chambers of Commerce, including the greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, in addition to numerous other organizations, have voiced opposition to the ballot initiative. The sponsors campaign contains inaccurate information about clean energy, its economic impacts to the state and the cost to customers. We believe it's important for customers to have accurate information to make an informed decision, if this proposal is on a November ballot. As a company that's dedicated time not only providing safe, reliable and affordable electricity, by also to maintaining and improving the communities we serve, we will continue to actively oppose this proposal. Lastly, I would like to share with you that crews from Arizona Public service who were part of the nationwide mutual assistance effort, coordinated by the Edison Electric Institute to assist Puerto Rico with power restoration following the Hurricane Maria. We said 83 line workers and support staff as well as 42 vehicles to Puerto Rico in mid-January when our first return on March 31 restoration on the island had reached 95%. Crew members who took this special assignment are proud to have helped. Throughout their deployment, they did more than just restore power. On their own time and their days off, they immersed themselves in the community, helping to clean up storm damage, rebuilding homes and providing household essentials to families in need. One of our crewmembers even bought a bicycle for a child, so that he can ride with other neighborhood children. I'm extremely proud of how each and every one of these individuals represented our companreinvestment the state of Arizona. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we have reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were in line with our expectations as shown on Slide 3 of the materials. For the first quarter",990,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we have reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were in line with our expectations as shown on Slide 3 of the materials. For the first quarter of 2018, we had $0.03 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.13 per share compared with the prior year first quarter period, supported by the rate increase, higher transmission revenues and higher sales-related revenues. Deposit factors were partially offset by the attack of the federal tax rate change and unfavorable weather. Specific to Tax Reform, the financial impact decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2018, including a reduction in customer rates passed through our tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM. And as production has always maintenance income tax changes in our wholesale transmission rates. You will notice there is not offsetting the effective tax rate driver initiative for the quarter. To refund customers through the TEAM is based on a per road kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact of the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings and was closely aligned with our core pretax earnings pattern. As a result, there will be a timing difference throughout the year. Looking out at operating expenses. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily due to higher planned outage cost related to the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 4. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.09 per share. The increase was primarily related to the higher DNA rates approved in 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, we'll see a new quarterly driver related to pension and other postretirement benefits nonservice credits. We adopted the new [indiscernible] accounting standard in January, resulting in the presentation of nonservice credit and other income. In addition, we are no longer capitalizing a portion of the nonservice credits. In 2018, the change in capitalization, combined with the increased returns, increased pretax income by approximately $7 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferral related to Four Corners SCR's installation and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I've discussed a capital deferral associated with the Four Corners SCRs as they are was no net impact on our first quarter 2018 results. Turning now to the Arizona economy as it continues to be an integral part of our business story. Arizona Metro Phoenix continues to be an attractive place to live and do business. Arizona's population surpassed 7 million in 2017 and Maricopa County has been ranked as the fastest-growing county in the nation for the past 2 years. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. This February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.8% compared to 1.5% for the entire U.S. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 4.4% also reflects the strength of the job market. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen in the upper panel of Slide 4, vacancy rates in the commercial markets continue to fall, and are at levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. As a result of the increasing activity and lower vacancy rates, about 6 million square feet of new industrial space was under construction at the end of Q1. Additionally, about 4 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter as well. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower part of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,000 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. To reduce -- reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS has retail customer base 1.7% in the first quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 to be will the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanism and sales growth will remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect will be partly offset by higher fossil plant outage cost and higher other operating expenses related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and property tax. As a reminder, we have higher fossil plant outage cost in the first half of 2018. A complete list of risk factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is in the appendix to the slide, which had been revised to reflect some changes to guidance related to the adoption of the new pension and other postretirement benefit accounting standards I discussed earlier. We continue to expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS this year, and overall liquidity remains very strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020. The company also continues to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

In the first quarter of 2018, we executed on our priorities and remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. The installation of selective catalytic reduction, or SCR, emission control equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant was completed on April 24, on time and under budget. This project provides substantial environmental benefits, including a 90% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions at the plant. On April 27, we filed for a $67.5 million step increase to recover our investment in these improvements. The step increase is an effective tool that eliminates the need to file a full rate review immediately after the conclusion of our last rate review, and provides rate gradualism for our customers. The commission previously approved the use of a step increase for the SCR installation. We've calculated that the step increase request would result in approximately a 2% customer bill increase, which will likely be offset by a reduction in customer bills from other adjustor mechanism decreases. We've requested the commission approve the rate increase effective January 1, 2019. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde generating station had another successful quarter, operating at full capacity. A planned refueling outage for Palo Verde Unit 3 began on April 7, and is proceeding very well. Additionally, construction activity is on track for our Ocotillo Modernization Project. The units in Ocotillo are expected to come online in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 to meet our 2019 summer capacity needs. 
Technology continues to play an important role in the efficiency of our operations. In 2012, APS became one of the first utilities in the nation to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones in shared aerospace. Since then, the use of drones for inspecting lines, building substations, monitoring solar fields, [ bedding ] new power lines, inspecting storm damage and accessing hard-to-reach areas has produced significant savings for our customers. 
Looking to the future. Our resource plan is designed to achieve a cleaner, sustainable energy mix that is anchored by Palo Verde, the largest carbon-free electric resource in the United States. In fact, we've already reached a significant milestone in this effort. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our energy mix was carbon-free. Our next integrated resource plan filings scheduled for April 2020 will continue to support the goal of achieving a cleaner, sustainable energy mix, and we'll incorporate updates as the commission's discussion around a possible energy modernization plan progresses. 
We recently announced our plan to issue multiple resource RFPs this year. On April 26, we issued an RFP for 400 to 800 megawatts of peaking capacity, with an in-service date of 2021. The peak period is between June and September and from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. We also plan to seek competitive proposals that utilize Arizona forest bioenergy solutions and that provide battery retrofit opportunities for APS on solar facilities. These RFPs are part of a comprehensive effort to meet our resource needs, beginning in the early 2020s. More specific information about these solicitations will be released in the coming weeks. 
As you may be aware, an out-of-state group primarily funded by California billionaire, Tom Steyer, has filed a ballot initiative that would require some Arizona utilities to obtain 50% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030. The sponsors must gather approximately 226,000 ballot signatures by July 5 to place the proposal on a November 2018 ballot. This initiative is overly prescriptive and irresponsible. Pinnacle West is actively opposing this ballot proposal. The initiative seeks to impair Arizona's oversight and regulation of utilities, which has provided Arizona residents with some of the safest, cleanest and most reliable and affordable energy in the country over 100 years. And with enshrining in the state constitution, a regulatory mandate which is bad for customers, potentially doubling the average customers' electricity bill by 2030. At least 13 Chambers of Commerce, including the greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, in addition to numerous other local organizations, have voiced opposition to the ballot initiative. The sponsor's campaign contains inaccurate information about clean energy, its economic impacts to the state and the cost to customers. We believe it's important for customers to have accurate information to make an informed decision, if this proposal is on the November ballot. As a company that's dedicated to not only providing safe, reliable and affordable electricity but also to maintaining and improving the communities we serve, we will continue to actively oppose this proposal. 
Lastly, I would like to share with you that crews from Arizona Public Service who were part of a nationwide mutual assistance effort, coordinated by the Edison Electric Institute, to assist Puerto Rico with power restoration following Hurricane Maria. We sent 83 line workers and support staff as well as 42 vehicles to Puerto Rico in mid-January. When our crews returned on March 31, restoration on the island had reached 95%. Crew members who took this special assignment are proud to have helped. Throughout their deployment, they did more than just restore power. On their own time and their days off, they immersed themselves in the community, helping to clean up storm damage, rebuilding homes and providing household essentials to families in need. One of our crew members even bought a bicycle for a child so that he can ride with other neighborhood children. I'm extremely proud of how each and every one of these individuals represented our company in the state of Arizona. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

For the first quarter of 20",1004,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were in line with our expectations as shown on Slide 3 of the materials. For the first quarter of 2018, we earned $0.03 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.13 per share compared with the prior year first quarter period, supported by the rate increase, higher transmission revenues and higher sales-related revenues. These positive factors were partially offset by the effect of a federal tax rate change and unfavorable weather. 
Specific to tax reform, the financial impact decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2018, including a reduction in customer rates passed through our tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM. And as [ may ] reduction is always the maintenance income tax changes in our wholesale transmission rates. You will notice there is not an offsetting effective tax rate driver initiative for the quarter. To refund the customers through the TEAM is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact of the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings and more closely aligned with our core pretax earnings pattern. As a result, there will be a timing difference throughout the year. 
Looking out to operating expenses. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily due to higher planned outage cost related to the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 4. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.09 per share. The increase was primarily related to the higher D&A rates approved in a 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, you will see a new quarterly driver related to pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits. We adopted the new [ pitch in ] accounting standard in January, resulting in the presentation of nonservice credit component and other income. In addition, we are no longer capitalizing a portion of the nonservice credits. 
In 2018, the change in capitalization, combined with the increased returns, increased pretax income by approximately $7 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferral related to Four Corners SCR's installation and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed account for the deferral associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on our first quarter 2018 results. 
Turning now to the Arizona economy as it continues to be an integral part of our business story. Arizona Metro Phoenix continues to be an attractive place to live and do business. Arizona's population surpassed 7 million in 2017 and Maricopa County has been ranked as the fastest-growing county in the nation for the past 2 years. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. This February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.8% compared to 1.5% for the entire U.S. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 4.4% also reflects the strength of the job market. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. 
As seen in the upper panel of Slide 4, vacancy rates in the commercial markets continue to fall, and are at levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. As a result of the increasing activity and lower vacancy rates, about 6 million square feet of new industrial space was under construction at the end of Q1. Additionally, about 4 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter as well. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,000 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. To reduce -- reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS has retail customer base grew 1.7% in the first quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. 
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanism and sales growth will remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect will be partly offset by higher fossil plant outage cost and higher other operating expenses related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and property tax. As a reminder, we have higher fossil plant outage cost in the first half of 2018. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides, which had been revised to reflect the changes to guidance related to the adoption of the new pension and other postretirement benefit accounting standards I discussed earlier. 
We continue to expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS this year, and overall liquidity remains very strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020. The company also continues to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

In the first quarter of 2018, we executed on our priorities and remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. The installation of selective catalytic reduction, or SCR, emission control equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant was completed on April 24, on time and under budget. This project provides substantial environmental benefits, including a 90% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions at the plant. On April 27, we filed for a $67.5 million step increase to recover our investment in these improvements. The step increase is an effective tool that eliminates the need to file a full rate review immediately after the conclusion of our last rate review, and provides rate gradualism for our customers. The commission previously approved the use of a step increase for the SCR installation. We've calculated that the step increase request would result in approximately a 2% customer bill increase, which will likely be offset by a reduction in customer bills from other adjustor mechanism decreases. We've requested the commission approve the rate increase effective January 1, 2019. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde generating station had another successful quarter, operating at full capacity. A planned refueling outage for Palo Verde Unit 3 began on April 7, and is proceeding very well. Additionally, construction activity is on track for our Ocotillo Modernization Project. The units in Ocotillo are expected to come online in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 to meet our 2019 summer capacity needs. 
Technology continues to play an important role in the efficiency of our operations. In 2012, APS became one of the first utilities in the nation to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones in shared aerospace. Since then, the use of drones for inspecting lines, building substations, monitoring solar fields, sighting new power lines, inspecting storm damage and accessing hard-to-reach areas has produced significant savings for our customers. 
Looking to the future. Our resource plan is designed to achieve a cleaner, sustainable energy mix that is anchored by Palo Verde, the largest carbon-free electric resource in the United States. In fact, we've already reached a significant milestone in this effort. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our energy mix was carbon-free. Our next integrated resource plan filing, scheduled for April 2020 will continue to support the goal of achieving a cleaner, sustainable energy mix, and we'll incorporate updates as the commission's discussion around a possible energy modernization plan progresses. 
We recently announced our plan to issue multiple resource RFPs this year. On April 26, we issued an RFP for 400 to 800 megawatts of peaking capacity, with an in-service date of 2021. The peak period is between June and September and from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. We also plan to seek competitive proposals that utilize Arizona forest bioenergy solutions and that provide battery retrofit opportunities for APS on solar facilities. These RFPs are part of a comprehensive effort to meet our resource needs, beginning in the early 2020s. More specific information about these solicitations will be released in the coming weeks. 
As you may be aware, an out-of-state group primarily funded by California billionaire, Tom Steyer, has filed a ballot initiative that would require some Arizona utilities to obtain 50% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030. The sponsors must gather approximately 226,000 ballot signatures by July 5 to place the proposal on a November 2018 ballot. This initiative is overly prescriptive and irresponsible. Pinnacle West is actively opposing this ballot proposal. The initiative seeks to impair Arizona's oversight and regulation of utilities, which has provided Arizona residents with some of the safest, cleanest and most reliable and affordable energy in the country over 100 years. It would enshrine in the state constitution, a regulatory mandate that is bad for customers, potentially doubling the average customers' electricity bill by 2030. At least 13 Chambers of Commerce, including the greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, in addition to numerous other local organizations, have voiced opposition to the ballot initiative. The sponsor's campaign contains inaccurate information about clean energy, its economic impacts to the state and the cost to customers. We believe it's important for customers to have accurate information to make an informed decision if, this proposal is on the November ballot. As a company that's dedicated to not only providing safe, reliable and affordable electricity but also to maintaining and improving the communities we serve, we will continue to actively oppose this proposal. 
Lastly, I would like to share with you that crews from Arizona Public Service who were part of a nationwide mutual assistance effort, coordinated by the Edison Electric Institute, to assist Puerto Rico with power restoration following Hurricane Maria. We sent 83 line workers and support staff as well as 42 vehicles to Puerto Rico in mid-January. When our crews returned on March 31, restoration on the island had reached 95%. Crew members who took this special assignment are proud to have helped. Throughout their deployment, they did more than just restore power. On their own time and their days off, they immersed themselves in the community, helping to clean up storm damage, rebuilding homes and providing household essentials to families in need. One of our crew members even bought a bicycle for a child so that he can ride with other neighborhood children. I'm extremely proud of how each and every one of these individuals represented our company in the state of Arizona. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were in line with our expectations as shown on Slide 3 of the materials. For the first quarter of 20",997,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were in line with our expectations as shown on Slide 3 of the materials. For the first quarter of 2018, we earned $0.03 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.13 per share compared with the prior year first quarter period, supported by the rate increase, higher transmission revenues and higher sales-related revenues. These positive factors were partially offset by the effect of a federal tax rate change and unfavorable weather. 
Specific to tax reform, the financial impact decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2018, including a reduction in customer rates passed through our tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM. And estimated reductions, is always from income tax changes in our wholesale transmission rates. You will notice there is not an offsetting effective tax rate driver initiatives for the quarter. The refund to customers through the TEAM is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact of the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings and will more closely align with our quarter pretax earnings pattern. As a result, there will be a timing difference throughout the year. 
Looking out to operating expenses. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily due to higher planned outage cost related to the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 4. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.09 per share. The increase was primarily related to the higher D&A rates approved in a 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, you will see a new quarterly driver related to pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits. We adopted the new pension accounting standard in January, resulting in the presentation of nonservice credit component and other income. In addition, we are no longer capitalizing a portion of the nonservice credits. 
In 2018, the change in capitalization, combined with the increased returns, increased pretax income by approximately $7 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferral related to Four Corners SCR's installation and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed account for the deferral associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on our first quarter 2018 results. 
Turning now to the Arizona economy as it continues to be an integral part of our business story. Arizona Metro Phoenix continues to be an attractive place to live and do business. Arizona's population surpassed 7 million in 2017 and Maricopa County has been ranked as the fastest-growing county in the nation for the past 2 years. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. This February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.8% compared to 1.5% for the entire U.S. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 4.4% also reflects the strength of the job market. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. 
As seen in the upper panel of Slide 4, vacancy rates in the commercial markets continue to fall, and are at levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. As a result of the increasing activity and lower vacancy rates, about 6 million square feet of new industrial space was under construction at the end of Q1. Additionally, about 4 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter as well. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,000 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. To reduce -- reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.7% in the first quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. 
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanism and sales growth will remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect will be partly offset by higher fossil plant outage cost and higher other operating expenses related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and property tax. As a reminder, we have higher fossil plant outage cost in the first half of 2018. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides, which had been revised to reflect the changes to guidance related to the adoption of the new pension and other postretirement benefit accounting standards I discussed earlier. 
We continue to expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS this year, and overall liquidity remains very strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020. The company also continues to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

In the first quarter of 2018, we executed on our priorities and remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. The installation of selective catalytic reduction, or SCR, emission control equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant was completed on April 24, on time and under budget. This project provides substantial environmental benefits, including a 90% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions at the plant. On April 27, we filed for a $67.5 million step increase to recover our investment in these improvements. The step increase is an effective tool that eliminates the need to file a full rate review immediately after the conclusion of our last rate review, and provides rate gradualism for our customers. The commission previously approved the use of a step increase for the SCR installation. We've calculated that the step increase request would result in approximately a 2% customer bill increase, which will likely be offset by a reduction in customer bills from other adjustor mechanism decreases. We've requested the commission approve the rate increase effective January 1, 2019. 
Turning to our operations. Palo Verde generating station had another successful quarter, operating at full capacity. A planned refueling outage for Palo Verde Unit 3 began on April 7, and is proceeding very well. Additionally, construction activity is on track for our Ocotillo Modernization Project. The units in Ocotillo are expected to come online in the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019 to meet our 2019 summer capacity needs. 
Technology continues to play an important role in the efficiency of our operations. In 2012, APS became one of the first utilities in the nation to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones in shared aerospace. Since then, the use of drones for inspecting lines, building substations, monitoring solar fields, sighting new power lines, inspecting storm damage and accessing hard-to-reach areas has produced significant savings for our customers. 
Looking to the future. Our resource plan is designed to achieve a cleaner, sustainable energy mix that is anchored by Palo Verde, the largest carbon-free electric resource in the United States. In fact, we've already reached a significant milestone in this effort. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our energy mix was carbon-free. Our next integrated resource plan filing, scheduled for April 2020 will continue to support the goal of achieving a cleaner, sustainable energy mix, and we'll incorporate updates as the commission's discussion around a possible energy modernization plan progresses. 
We recently announced our plan to issue multiple resource RFPs this year. On April 26, we issued an RFP for 400 to 800 megawatts of peaking capacity, with an in-service date of 2021. The peak period is between June and September and from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. We also plan to seek competitive proposals that utilize Arizona forest bioenergy solutions and that provide battery retrofit opportunities for APS on solar facilities. These RFPs are part of a comprehensive effort to meet our resource needs, beginning in the early 2020s. More specific information about these solicitations will be released in the coming weeks. 
As you may be aware, an out-of-state group primarily funded by California billionaire, Tom Steyer, has filed a ballot initiative that would require some Arizona utilities to obtain 50% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030. The sponsors must gather approximately 226,000 ballot signatures by July 5 to place the proposal on a November 2018 ballot. This initiative is overly prescriptive and irresponsible. Pinnacle West is actively opposing this ballot proposal. The initiative seeks to impair Arizona's oversight and regulation of utilities, which has provided Arizona residents with some of the safest, cleanest and most reliable and affordable energy in the country over 100 years. It would enshrine in the state constitution, a regulatory mandate that is bad for customers, potentially doubling the average customers' electricity bill by 2030. At least 13 Chambers of Commerce, including the greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, in addition to numerous other local organizations, have voiced opposition to the ballot initiative. The sponsor's campaign contains inaccurate information about clean energy, its economic impacts to the state and the cost to customers. We believe it's important for customers to have accurate information to make an informed decision if, this proposal is on the November ballot. As a company that's dedicated to not only providing safe, reliable and affordable electricity but also to maintaining and improving the communities we serve, we will continue to actively oppose this proposal. 
Lastly, I would like to share with you that crews from Arizona Public Service who were part of a nationwide mutual assistance effort, coordinated by the Edison Electric Institute, to assist Puerto Rico with power restoration following Hurricane Maria. We sent 83 line workers and support staff as well as 42 vehicles to Puerto Rico in mid-January. When our crews returned on March 31, restoration on the island had reached 95%. Crew members who took this special assignment are proud to have helped. Throughout their deployment, they did more than just restore power. On their own time and their days off, they immersed themselves in the community, helping to clean up storm damage, rebuilding homes and providing household essentials to families in need. One of our crew members even bought a bicycle for a child so that he can ride with other neighborhood children. I'm extremely proud of how each and every one of these individuals represented our company in the state of Arizona. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were in line with our expectations as shown on Slide 3 of the materials. For the first quarter of 20",997,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which were in line with our expectations as shown on Slide 3 of the materials. For the first quarter of 2018, we earned $0.03 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.13 per share compared with the prior year first quarter period, supported by the rate increase, higher transmission revenues and higher sales-related revenues. These positive factors were partially offset by the effect of a federal tax rate change and unfavorable weather. 
Specific to tax reform, the financial impact decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2018, including a reduction in customer rates passed through our tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM. And estimated reductions, is always from income tax changes in our wholesale transmission rates. You will notice there is not an offsetting effective tax rate driver initiatives for the quarter. The refund to customers through the TEAM is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact of the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings and will more closely align with our quarter pretax earnings pattern. As a result, there will be a timing difference throughout the year. 
Looking out to operating expenses. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily due to higher planned outage cost related to the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 4. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.09 per share. The increase was primarily related to the higher D&A rates approved in a 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, you will see a new quarterly driver related to pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits. We adopted the new pension accounting standard in January, resulting in the presentation of nonservice credit component and other income. In addition, we are no longer capitalizing a portion of the nonservice credits. 
In 2018, the change in capitalization, combined with the increased returns, increased pretax income by approximately $7 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferral related to Four Corners SCR's installation and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed account for the deferral associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on our first quarter 2018 results. 
Turning now to the Arizona economy as it continues to be an integral part of our business story. Arizona Metro Phoenix continues to be an attractive place to live and do business. Arizona's population surpassed 7 million in 2017 and Maricopa County has been ranked as the fastest-growing county in the nation for the past 2 years. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. This February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.8% compared to 1.5% for the entire U.S. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 4.4% also reflects the strength of the job market. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. 
As seen in the upper panel of Slide 4, vacancy rates in the commercial markets continue to fall, and are at levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. As a result of the increasing activity and lower vacancy rates, about 6 million square feet of new industrial space was under construction at the end of Q1. Additionally, about 4 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter as well. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,000 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. To reduce -- reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.7% in the first quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. 
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanism and sales growth will remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect will be partly offset by higher fossil plant outage cost and higher other operating expenses related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and property tax. As a reminder, we have higher fossil plant outage cost in the first half of 2018. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides, which had been revised to reflect the changes to guidance related to the adoption of the new pension and other postretirement benefit accounting standards I discussed earlier. 
We continue to expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS this year, and overall liquidity remains very strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020. The company also continues to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on a recent regulatory and operational developments. The step increase request for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant is progressing. on the corporation commission hearing is scheduled to begin on September 5, and we continue to expect the decision around the end of the year. As required by the 2017 rate review order, all residential customers, except grandfathered solar customers, were migrated to new rates. We successfully transitioned nearly 1 million residential customers to new rates in a few short months. Turning to our operations. On May 5, Palo Verde generating station completed its scheduled Unit 3 spring maintenance and refueling outage in a plant record 28 days and 13 hours. The team's collective performance resulted into one of our best outages ever. Looking to our capital investment program. Nearly 200 miles of transmission lines and 15 new substations supporting the additional capacity had been added in the past 3 years. In May, the last 110-mile section of a 500 KV loop around the northern part of the valley here, known as Sun Valley Morgan, was commissioned. Notably, the Sun Valley Morgan project has garnered national attention for its innovative design and permitting process and collaborative work with the Bureau of Land Management. The 4 500-KB projects commissioned since 2015, including completion of this loop, provide added reliability, increased economic development opportunities and enhanced import and export capabilities with neighboring states. It should come as no surprise that each year, we go through extensive preparation and planning to maintain reliability throughout Arizona's intense summer heat. This year, in addition to expanding and strengthening our transmission system, we implemented new strategies to lower fire risk during the wildfire season. To reduce fire risk, our teams performed the vegetation management activities, held wildfire prevention training and continue to expand our clearance around polls program. Implementing these strategies is the right thing to do for customers, the environment and the health of our company during increasingly dry conditions. For future resource needs, we recently issued request for proposals regarding peaking capacity and forest bioenergy solutions. Proposals for the peaking capacity solicitation were due by July 20, and we're in the process of evaluating those proposals. The submission deadline for the forest bioenergy RFP is August 17. In addition, we issued a battery storage RFP for up to 600 megawatts located on APS Solar facilities with an in-service date no later than June 2020. We intend to own any projects selected as part of the battery storage RFP. We expect to make final selections for each of these solicitations during the fourth quarter of 2018. As utility industry continues to evolve, so does the grid technology landscape. As part of an ongoing process to modernize the grid, we are upgrading the cellular communication technology for our meters from 2G to 4G. Over the next 18 months, we will replace roughly 2,000 2G devices, with about 1,500 4G devices, providing improved real-time outage information to system operators. Devices that have already been installed and transmitting information more quickly and efficiently than the old system, which means added reliability and quicker outage response for our customers. This investment is just 1 of many that aimed to make the grid more advanced and more reliable for our customers. Turning to the ballot initiative. On July 5, the Tom-Steyer-funded California campaign turned in signatures in attempt to place a constitutional mandate for 50% renewable energy by 2030 on the Arizona ballot for the election this November. On July 19, a lawsuit was filed, arguing that fraud as well as other systemic errors, disqualifies the majority of the signatures collected. The trial is set to begin on August 20, and we anticipate that the judge will issue a decision in August. Borrowing action by the judge, by late August or early September, the Arizona Secretary of State will make an official statement announcing whether the Steyer-funded initiative will be on the Arizona ballot. It is clear the impact from the trend Steyer-funded ballot initiative are bad for our customers and the state of Arizona. We estimate that the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would require APS to add over 5,500 megawatts of new resources above and beyond our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan estimates by 2030. This would equate to over $10 billion in incremental capital investment by 2030. Further, customers would bear the broad of our recovery of the costs associated with the first early retirement of the existing facilities. At the time of a possible early retirement, the remaining book value and other costs associated with the early shutdown for Palo Verde generating station and the Four Corners Power Plant could be $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. But with we expect the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would significantly increase our rate base estimates. Customer fills in 2030 would likely be double today's bills. We are not opposing this ballot initiative because we are opposed cleaner and renewable energy. We are opposing it because a constitutional amendment is an irresponsible way to set energy policy and it will harm our customers. We know clean energy is important to our customers, and it's important to our company. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our diverse energy mix was carbon-free. Our renewable resources, including 9 large solar farms across the state and 80,000 rooftop solar installations, provide about 14% of that total. APS is in the top tier of all utilities in terms of solar power nationwide. Pairing with our nuclear fleet and other clean sources, we have a long proven track record of advancing both clean and renewable energy. As a long-term leader in integrating sustainable clean energy resources, we continue to invite further thoughtful discussion about increasing the amount of renewables and other technologies that support clean energy in our state. In fact, this week, we filed a letter encouraging the Arizona Corporation Commission to continue to move the energy modernization plan forward. As we had stated since the concept was first introduced, APS believes this proposal to achieve 80% clean energy by 2050 is a bold vision for the future. But we're proud of our accomplishments, we recognized that we need to continue to do more to achieve the best energy future for Arizona in a way that is right for our state. We believe the energy modernization plan is important to designing the energy future. We look forward to working with the Arizona Corporation Commission and stakeholders to further develop and implement this vision. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we are on $1.48 per share compared t",1116,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we are on $1.48 per share compared to $1.49 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.12 per share compared with the second quarter in 2007, supported primarily by the rate increase offset by the federal tax rate change, unfavorable weather and lower retail sales. Although retail sales were lower this quarter versus the prior year quarter, weather-adjusted gross sales, excluding the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. I will discuss our sales trends in more detail in a moment. Continuing with the key drivers. Refund to customers due to a lower federal corporate income tax rate decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share but we're partially offset by the lower effective tax rate. The net impact of tax reform in the quarter was a $0.10 per share benefit to net income. As a reminder, they refund the customer so the tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM, is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact on the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings, and will more closely align with our quarterly pretax pattern. Please see Slide 8 for more information related to the timing impact of tax reform. Looking now to operating expense. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, primarily due to the higher planned outage cost related to the select catalytic reduction equipment and solar Four Corners. As you may recall, our guidance for 2018 outage spend was concentrated in the first half of the year as compared to the 2017 outage schedule, which was concentrated in the second half of the year. Additional drivers are higher operations and maintenance expense for transmission, distribution and customers service cost at APS. And at the parent company level, public outreach cost, primarily associated with the Steyer-funded ballot initiative. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.13 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher D&A rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $5 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher a margin of returns and the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferrals related to the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction equipment installations and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed above account for the deferrals associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on second quarter 2018 results. Turning now to the Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.6% for the entire United States. The solid job growth continued to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also added growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the effort post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and low mortgage rates should allow our Phoenix Metro housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand. Reflecting the stated improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.6% in the second quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. As I mentioned earlier, our weather-adjusted growth sales, excluding the impact of energy efficiency and the distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. The solid sales growth was led by healthy growth in the residential sector of 2.2%, mixed with about flat growth in the commercial and industrial sector. In terms of commercial and industrial sales growth, there result were somewhat disappointing and have asked what the positive economic growth trend we had seen, but we believe this divergence will likely be short-lived. We also expect to see the other headwinds to sales growth declining in magnitude. Notably, the installation of grandfathered distributed generation systems eligible for net metering subtracted a 2 full percentage point on the residential growth rate this quarter. As the grandfathering deadline has now passed, we expect this sales reduction from new installations going forward will be less than half of this quarter's rate. It is also worth noting that the 2018 demand-side management plan currently are awaiting approval from the Arizona Corporation Commission, focus of energy efficiency programs off-peak demand reduction, better aligning the benefits for customers with realized systems benefits. In closing, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase and our adjusted mechanism remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect to be partly offset by a higher cost of plant outage cost and higher than other operating expenses related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and operating tax. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides. We continue to expect to issue up to $300 million of debt at APS this year, but overall, liquidity remain strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020 supported by a robust capital investment needs. We also continue to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
The step increase request for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant is progressing. The Arizona Corporation Commission hearing is scheduled to begin on September 5, and we continue to expect a decision around the end of the year. 
As required by the 2017 rate review order, all residential customers, except grandfathered solar customers, were migrated to new rates. We successfully transitioned nearly 1 million residential customers to new rates in a few short months. 
Turning to our operations. On May 5, Palo Verde generating station completed its scheduled Unit 3 spring maintenance and refueling outage in a plant record 28 days and 13 hours. The team's collective performance resulted into one of our best outages ever. 
Looking to our capital investment program. Nearly 200 miles of transmission lines and 15 new substations supporting the additional capacity had been added in the past 3 years. In May, the last 110-mile section of a 500 kV loop around the northern part of the valley here, known as Sun Valley to Morgan, was commissioned. Notably, the Sun Valley to Morgan project has garnered national attention for its innovative design and permitting process and collaborative work with the Bureau of Land Management. The 4 500 kV projects commissioned since 2015, including completion of this loop, provide added reliability, increased economic development opportunities and enhanced import and export capabilities with neighboring states. 
It should come as no surprise that each year, we go through extensive preparation and planning to maintain reliability throughout Arizona's intense summer heat. This year, in addition to expanding and strengthening our transmission system, we implemented new strategies to lower fire risk during wildfire season. To reduce fire risk, our teams performed the vegetation management activities, held wildfire prevention training and continue to expand our clearance around polls program. Implementing these strategies is the right thing to do for customers, the environment and the health of our company during increasingly dry conditions. 
For future resource needs, we recently issued request for proposals regarding peaking capacity and forest bioenergy solutions. Proposals for the peaking capacity solicitation were due by July 20, and we're in the process of evaluating those proposals. The submission deadline for the forest bioenergy RFP is August 17. In addition, we issued a battery storage RFP for up to 106 megawatts located on APS solar Facilities with an in-service date no later than June 2020. We intend to own any projects selected as part of the battery storage RFP. We expect to make final selections for each of these solicitations during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
As the utility industry continues to evolve, so does the grid technology landscape. As part of an ongoing process to modernize the grid, we are upgrading the cellular communication technology for our meters from 2G to 4G. Over the next 18 months, we will replace roughly 2,000 2G devices, with about 1,500 4G devices, providing improved real-time outage information to system operators. Devices that have already been installed are transmitting information more quickly and efficiently than the old system, which means added reliability and quicker outage response for our customers. This investment is just one of many that aim to make the grid more advanced and more reliable for our customers. 
Turning to the ballot initiative. On July 5, the Tom-Steyer-funded California campaign turned in signatures in an attempt to place a constitutional mandate for 50% renewable energy by 2030 on the Arizona ballot for the election this November. On July 19, a lawsuit was filed, arguing that fraud as well as other systemic errors disqualifies the majority of the signatures collected. The trial is set to begin on August 20, and we anticipate that the judge will issue a decision in August. Borrowing action by the judge, by late August or early September, the Arizona Secretary of State will make an official statement announcing whether the Steyer-funded initiative will be on the Arizona ballot. It is clear the impact from the Steyer-funded ballot initiative are bad for our customers and the state of Arizona. We estimate that the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would require APS to add over 5,500 megawatts of new resources above and beyond our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan estimates by 2030. This would equate to over $10 billion in incremental capital investment by 2030. Further, customers would bear the brunt of our recovery of the costs associated with the forced early retirement of existing facilities. At the time of a possible early retirement, the remaining book value and other costs associated with the early shutdown for Palo Verde generating station and the Four Corners Power Plant could be $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. But we expect the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would significantly increase our rate base estimates. Customer bills in 2030 would likely be double today's bills. We are not opposing this ballot initiative because we're opposed to clean or renewable energy. We're opposing it because a constitutional amendment is an irresponsible way to set energy policy and it will harm our customers. We know clean energy is important to our customers, and it's important to our company. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our diverse energy mix was carbon-free. Our renewable resources, including 9 large solar farms across the state and 80,000 rooftop solar installations, provide about 14% of that total. APS is in the top tier of all utilities in terms of solar power nationwide. Paired with our nuclear fleet and other clean sources, we have a long proven track record of advancing both clean and renewable energy. As a long-term leader in integrating sustainable clean energy resources, we continue to invite further thoughtful discussion about increasing the amount of renewables and other technologies that support clean energy in our state. In fact, this week, we filed a letter encouraging the Arizona Corporation Commission to continue to move the energy modernization plan forward. As we had stated since the concept was first introduced, APS believes this proposal to achieve 80% clean energy by 2050 is a bold vision for the future. 
But we're proud of our accomplishments. We recognize that we need to continue to do more to achieve the best energy future for Arizona in a way that is right for our state. We believe the energy modernization plan is important to designing the energy future. We look forward to working with the Arizona Corporation Commission and stakeholders to further develop and implement this vision. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared",1111,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared to $1.49 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.12 per share compared with the second quarter in 2007, supported primarily by the rate increase offset by the federal tax rate change, unfavorable weather and lower retail sales. Although retail sales were lower this quarter versus the prior year quarter, weather-adjusted gross sales, excluding the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. I will discuss our sales trends in more detail in a moment. 
Continuing with the key drivers. Refund to customers due to the lower federal corporate income tax rate decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share but were partially offset by the lower effective tax rate. The net impact of tax reform in the quarter was a $0.10 per share benefit to net income. As a reminder, the refund to customer due to tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM, is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact on the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings and will more closely align with our quarterly pretax earnings pattern. Please see Slide 8 for more information related to the timing impact of tax reform. 
Looking now to operating expense. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, primarily due to the higher planned outage cost related to the select catalytic reduction equipment installed at Four Corners. As you may recall, our guidance for 2018 outage spend was concentrated in the first half of the year as compared to the 2017 outage schedule, which was concentrated in the second half of the year. Additional drivers to higher operations and maintenance expense were transmission distribution and customers' service cost at APS. And at the parent company level, public outreach cost, primarily associated with the Steyer-funded ballot initiative. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.13 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher D&A rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $5 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns and the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferrals related to the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction equipment installations and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed above account for the deferrals associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on second quarter 2018 results. 
Turning now to the -- Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.6% for the entire United States. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the effort post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market, and the economy more generally, to continue to expand. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.6% in the second quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate the response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
As I mentioned earlier, our weather-adjusted growth sales, excluding the impact of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. The solid sales growth was led by healthy growth in the residential sector of 2.2%, mixed with about flat growth in the commercial and industrial sector. In terms of commercial and industrial sales growth, the result were somewhat disappointing and at odds with the positive economic growth trends we have seen. But we believe this divergence will likely be short-lived. We also expect to see the other headwinds to sales growth declining in magnitude. Notably, the installation of grandfathered distributed generation systems eligible for net metering subtracted a 2 full percentage points on the residential growth rate this quarter. As the grandfathering deadline has now passed, we expect this sales reduction from new installations going forward will be less than half of this quarter's rate. It is also worth noting that the 2018 demand-side management plan currently awaiting approval from the Arizona Corporation Commission, focus of energy efficiency programs off-peak demand reduction, better aligning the benefits for customers with realized systems benefits. 
In closing, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase and our adjusted mechanism remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect to be partly offset by higher fossil plant outage costs and higher than other operating expenses related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and operating tax. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides. 
We continue to expect to issue up to $300 million of debt at APS this year. But overall, liquidity remains strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020 supported by robust capital investment needs. We also continue to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And then my last question, if I look at some of the data mix that you all have already talked about, i.e., that you're O&M costs are usually high this year given the outage schedule, so they should come down to a more normalized level next year. And then you have the step up in grids coming from the Four Corners SCR investment. Would that imply -- I mean, at least to me, that would imply that the owned ROE next year should be higher than this year. Is that a fair way to be thinking about this, or am I missing some other dynamic there?"

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
The step increase request for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant is progressing. The Arizona Corporation Commission hearing is scheduled to begin on September 5, and we continue to expect a decision around the end of the year. 
As required by the 2017 rate review order, all residential customers, except grandfathered solar customers, were migrated to new rates. We successfully transitioned nearly 1 million residential customers to new rates in a few short months. 
Turning to our operations. On May 5, Palo Verde generating station completed its scheduled Unit 3 spring maintenance and refueling outage in a plant record 28 days and 13 hours. The team's collective performance resulted into one of our best outages ever. 
Looking to our capital investment program. Nearly 200 miles of transmission lines and 15 new substations supporting the additional capacity had been added in the past 3 years. In May, the last 110-mile section of a 500 kV loop around the northern part of the valley here, known as Sun Valley to Morgan, was commissioned. Notably, the Sun Valley to Morgan project has garnered national attention for its innovative design and permitting process and collaborative work with the Bureau of Land Management. The 4 500 kV projects commissioned since 2015, including completion of this loop, provide added reliability, increased economic development opportunities and enhanced import and export capabilities with neighboring states. 
It should come as no surprise that each year, we go through extensive preparation and planning to maintain reliability throughout Arizona's intense summer heat. This year, in addition to expanding and strengthening our transmission system, we implemented new strategies to lower fire risk during wildfire season. To reduce fire risk, our teams performed the vegetation management activities, held wildfire prevention training and continue to expand our clearance around polls program. Implementing these strategies is the right thing to do for customers, the environment and the health of our company during increasingly dry conditions. 
For future resource needs, we recently issued request for proposals regarding peaking capacity and forest bioenergy solutions. Proposals for the peaking capacity solicitation were due by July 20, and we're in the process of evaluating those proposals. The submission deadline for the forest bioenergy RFP is August 17. In addition, we issued a battery storage RFP for up to 106 megawatts located on APS solar Facilities with an in-service date no later than June 2020. We intend to own any projects selected as part of the battery storage RFP. We expect to make final selections for each of these solicitations during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
As the utility industry continues to evolve, so does the grid technology landscape. As part of an ongoing process to modernize the grid, we are upgrading the cellular communication technology for our meters from 2G to 4G. Over the next 18 months, we will replace roughly 2,000 2G devices, with about 1,500 4G devices, providing improved real-time outage information to system operators. Devices that have already been installed are transmitting information more quickly and efficiently than the old system, which means added reliability and quicker outage response for our customers. This investment is just one of many that aim to make the grid more advanced and more reliable for our customers. 
Turning to the ballot initiative. On July 5, the Tom-Steyer-funded California campaign turned in signatures in an attempt to place a constitutional mandate for 50% renewable energy by 2030 on the Arizona ballot for the election this November. On July 19, a lawsuit was filed, arguing that fraud as well as other systemic errors disqualifies the majority of the signatures collected. The trial is set to begin on August 20, and we anticipate that the judge will issue a decision in August. Borrowing action by the judge, by late August or early September, the Arizona Secretary of State will make an official statement announcing whether the Steyer-funded initiative will be on the Arizona ballot. It is clear the impact from the Steyer-funded ballot initiative are bad for our customers and the state of Arizona. We estimate that the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would require APS to add over 5,500 megawatts of new resources above and beyond our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan estimates by 2030. This would equate to over $10 billion in incremental capital investment by 2030. Further, customers would bear the brunt of our recovery of the costs associated with the forced early retirement of existing facilities. At the time of a possible early retirement, the remaining book value and other costs associated with the early shutdown for Palo Verde generating station and the Four Corners Power Plant could be $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. But we expect the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would significantly increase our rate base estimates. Customer bills in 2030 would likely be double today's bills. We are not opposing this ballot initiative because we're opposed to clean or renewable energy. We're opposing it because a constitutional amendment is an irresponsible way to set energy policy and it will harm our customers. We know clean energy is important to our customers, and it's important to our company. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our diverse energy mix was carbon-free. Our renewable resources, including 9 large solar farms across the state and 80,000 rooftop solar installations, provide about 14% of that total. APS is in the top tier of all utilities in terms of solar power nationwide. Paired with our nuclear fleet and other clean sources, we have a long proven track record of advancing both clean and renewable energy. As a long-term leader in integrating sustainable clean energy resources, we continue to invite further thoughtful discussion about increasing the amount of renewables and other technologies that support clean energy in our state. In fact, this week, we filed a letter encouraging the Arizona Corporation Commission to continue to move the energy modernization plan forward. As we had stated since the concept was first introduced, APS believes this proposal to achieve 80% clean energy by 2050 is a bold vision for the future. 
But we're proud of our accomplishments. We recognize that we need to continue to do more to achieve the best energy future for Arizona in a way that is right for our state. We believe the energy modernization plan is important to designing the energy future. We look forward to working with the Arizona Corporation Commission and stakeholders to further develop and implement this vision. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared",1111,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared to $1.49 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.12 per share compared with the second quarter in 2007, supported primarily by the rate increase offset by the federal tax rate change, unfavorable weather and lower retail sales. Although retail sales were lower this quarter versus the prior year quarter, weather-adjusted gross sales, excluding the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. I will discuss our sales trends in more detail in a moment. 
Continuing with the key drivers. Refund to customers due to the lower federal corporate income tax rate decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share but were partially offset by the lower effective tax rate. The net impact of tax reform in the quarter was a $0.10 per share benefit to net income. As a reminder, the refund to customer due to tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM, is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact on the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings and will more closely align with our quarterly pretax earnings pattern. Please see Slide 8 for more information related to the timing impact of tax reform. 
Looking now to operating expense. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, primarily due to the higher planned outage cost related to the select catalytic reduction equipment installed at Four Corners. As you may recall, our guidance for 2018 outage spend was concentrated in the first half of the year as compared to the 2017 outage schedule, which was concentrated in the second half of the year. Additional drivers to higher operations and maintenance expense were transmission distribution and customers' service cost at APS. And at the parent company level, public outreach cost, primarily associated with the Steyer-funded ballot initiative. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.13 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher D&A rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $5 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns and the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferrals related to the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction equipment installations and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed above account for the deferrals associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on second quarter 2018 results. 
Turning now to the -- Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.6% for the entire United States. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the effort post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market, and the economy more generally, to continue to expand. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.6% in the second quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate the response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
As I mentioned earlier, our weather-adjusted growth sales, excluding the impact of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. The solid sales growth was led by healthy growth in the residential sector of 2.2%, mixed with about flat growth in the commercial and industrial sector. In terms of commercial and industrial sales growth, the result were somewhat disappointing and at odds with the positive economic growth trends we have seen. But we believe this divergence will likely be short-lived. We also expect to see the other headwinds to sales growth declining in magnitude. Notably, the installation of grandfathered distributed generation systems eligible for net metering subtracted a 2 full percentage points on the residential growth rate this quarter. As the grandfathering deadline has now passed, we expect this sales reduction from new installations going forward will be less than half of this quarter's rate. It is also worth noting that the 2018 demand-side management plan currently awaiting approval from the Arizona Corporation Commission, focus of energy efficiency programs off-peak demand reduction, better aligning the benefits for customers with realized systems benefits. 
In closing, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase and our adjusted mechanism remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect to be partly offset by higher fossil plant outage costs and higher than other operating expenses related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and operating tax. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides. 
We continue to expect to issue up to $300 million of debt at APS this year. But overall, liquidity remains strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020 supported by robust capital investment needs.

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
The step increase request for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant is progressing. The Arizona Corporation Commission hearing is scheduled to begin on September 5, and we continue to expect a decision around the end of the year. 
As required by the 2017 rate review order, all residential customers, except grandfathered solar customers, were migrated to new rates. We successfully transitioned nearly 1 million residential customers to new rates in a few short months. 
Turning to our operations. On May 5, Palo Verde generating station completed its scheduled Unit 3 spring maintenance and refueling outage in a plant record 28 days and 13 hours. The team's collective performance resulted into one of our best outages ever. 
Looking to our capital investment program. Nearly 200 miles of transmission lines and 15 new substations supporting the additional capacity have been added in the past 3 years. In May, the last 110-mile section of a 500 kV loop around the northern part of the valley here, known as Sun Valley to Morgan, was commissioned. Notably, the Sun Valley to Morgan project has garnered national attention for its innovative design and permitting process and collaborative work with the Bureau of Land Management. The 4 500 kV projects commissioned since 2015, including completion of this loop, provide added reliability, increased economic development opportunities and enhanced import and export capabilities with neighboring states. 
It should come as no surprise that each year, we go through extensive preparation and planning to maintain reliability throughout Arizona's intense summer heat. This year, in addition to expanding and strengthening our transmission system, we implemented new strategies to lower fire risk during wildfire season. To reduce fire risk, our teams performed the vegetation management activities, held wildfire prevention training and continue to expand our clearance-around- poles program. Implementing these strategies is the right thing to do for customers, the environment and the health of our company during increasingly dry conditions. 
For future resource needs, we recently issued requests for proposals regarding peaking capacity and forest bioenergy solutions. Proposals for the peaking capacity solicitation were due by July 20, and we're in the process of evaluating those proposals. The submission deadline for the forest bioenergy RFP is August 17. In addition, we issued a battery storage RFP for up to 106 megawatts located on APS solar Facilities with an in-service date no later than June 2020. We intend to own any projects selected as part of the battery storage RFP. We expect to make final selections for each of these solicitations during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
As the utility industry continues to evolve, so does the grid technology landscape. As part of an ongoing process to modernize the grid, we are upgrading the cellular communication technology for our meters from 2G to 4G. Over the next 18 months, we will replace roughly 2,000 2G devices, with about 1,500 4G devices, providing improved real-time outage information to system operators. Devices that have already been installed are transmitting information more quickly and efficiently than the old system, which means added reliability and quicker outage response for our customers. This investment is just one of many that aim to make the grid more advanced and more reliable for our customers. 
Turning to the ballot initiative. On July 5, the Tom Steyer-funded California campaign turned in signatures in an attempt to place a constitutional mandate for 50% renewable energy by 2030 on the Arizona ballot for the election this November. On July 19, a lawsuit was filed, arguing that fraud as well as other systemic errors disqualifies the majority of the signatures collected. The trial is set to begin on August 20, and we anticipate that the judge will issue a decision in August. Barring action by the judge, by late August or early September, the Arizona Secretary of State will make an official statement announcing whether the Steyer-funded initiative will be on the Arizona ballot. It is clear the impact from the Steyer-funded ballot initiative are bad for our customers and the state of Arizona. We estimate that the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would require APS to add over 5,500 megawatts of new resources above and beyond our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan estimates by 2030. This would equate to over $10 billion in incremental capital investment by 2030. Further, customers would bear the brunt of our recovery of the costs associated with the forced early retirement of existing facilities. At the time of a possible early retirement, the remaining book value and other costs associated with the early shutdown for Palo Verde generating station and the Four Corners Power Plant could be $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. But we expect the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would significantly increase our rate base estimates. Customer bills in 2030 would likely be double today's bills. We are not opposing this ballot initiative because we're opposed to clean or renewable energy. We're opposing it because a constitutional amendment is an irresponsible way to set energy policy and it will harm our customers. We know clean energy is important to our customers, and it's important to our company. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our diverse energy mix was carbon-free. Our renewable resources, including 9 large solar farms across the state and 80,000 rooftop solar installations, provide about 14% of that total. APS is in the top tier of all utilities in terms of solar power nationwide. Paired with our nuclear fleet and other clean sources, we have a long proven track record of advancing both clean and renewable energy. As a long-term leader in integrating sustainable clean energy resources, we continue to invite further thoughtful discussion about increasing the amount of renewables and other technologies that support clean energy in our state. In fact, this week, we filed a letter encouraging the Arizona Corporation Commission to continue to move the energy modernization plan forward. As we had stated since the concept was first introduced, APS believes this proposal to achieve 80% clean energy by 2050 is a bold vision for the future. 
While  we're proud of our accomplishments, we recognize that we need to continue to do more to achieve the best energy future for Arizona in a way that is right for our state. We believe the energy modernization plan is important to designing the energy future. We look forward to working with the Arizona Corporation Commission and stakeholders to further develop and implement this vision. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared",1110,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared to $1.49 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.12 per share compared with the second quarter in 2007, supported primarily by the rate increase offset by the federal tax rate change, unfavorable weather and lower retail sales. Although retail sales were lower this quarter versus the prior year quarter, weather-adjusted gross sales, excluding the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. I will discuss our sales trends in more detail in a moment. 
Continuing with the key drivers. Refunds to customers due to the lower federal corporate income tax rate decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share but were positively offset by the lower effective tax rate. The net impact of tax reform in the quarter was a $0.10 per share benefit to net income. As a reminder, the refund to customers due to tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM, is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact on the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings and will more closely align with our quarterly pretax earnings pattern. Please see Slide 8 for more information related to the timing impact of tax reform. 
Looking now to operating expense. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, primarily due to the higher planned outage cost related to the select catalytic reduction equipment installed at Four Corners. As you may recall, our guidance for 2018 outage spend was concentrated in the first half of the year as compared to the 2017 outage schedule, which was concentrated in the second half of the year. Additional drivers to higher operations and maintenance expense were transmission distribution and customers' service cost at APS. And at the parent company level, public outreach cost, primarily associated with the Steyer-funded ballot initiative. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.13 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher D&A rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $5 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns and the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferrals related to the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction equipment installations and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed above account for the deferrals associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on second quarter 2018 results. 
Turning now to the -- Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth, the Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.6% for the entire United States. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the effort post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market, and the economy more generally, to continue to expand. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.6% in the second quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate the response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
As I mentioned earlier, our weather-adjusted gross sales, including the impact of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. This solid sales growth was led by healthy growth in the residential sector of 2.2%, mixed with about flat growth in the commercial and industrial sector. In terms of commercial and industrial sales growth, the results were somewhat disappointing and at odds with the positive economic growth trends we have seen. But we believe this divergence will likely be short-lived. We also expect to see the other headwinds to sales growth declining in magnitude. Notably, the installation of grandfathered distributed generation systems eligible for net metering subtracted a 2 full percentage points on the residential growth rate this quarter. As the grandfathering deadline has now passed, we expect this sales reduction from new installations going forward will be less than half of this quarter's rate. It is also worth noting that the 2018 demand-side management plan currently awaiting approval from the Arizona Corporation Commission, focuses energy efficiency programs off-peak demand reduction, better aligning the benefits for customers with realized systems benefits. 
In closing, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase and our adjusted mechanism remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect to be partly offset by higher fossil plant outage costs and higher than other operating expenses related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and operating tax. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides. 
We continue to expect to issue up to $300 million of debt at APS this year. But overall, liquidity remains strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020 supported by robust capital investment needs. We also continue to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I just wanted to be clear, so is there a mechanism right now in Arizona? I mean, presumably there would be a mechanism if plants retire early for companies to recover those costs. Is there a step mechanism already in place?"

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
The step increase request for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant is progressing. The Arizona Corporation Commission hearing is scheduled to begin on September 5, and we continue to expect a decision around the end of the year. 
As required by the 2017 rate review order, all residential customers, except grandfathered solar customers, were migrated to new rates. We successfully transitioned nearly 1 million residential customers to new rates in a few short months. 
Turning to our operations. On May 5, Palo Verde generating station completed its scheduled Unit 3 spring maintenance and refueling outage in a plant record 28 days and 13 hours. The team's collective performance resulted into one of our best outages ever. 
Looking to our capital investment program. Nearly 200 miles of transmission lines and 15 new substations supporting the additional capacity have been added in the past 3 years. In May, the last 110-mile section of a 500 kV loop around the northern part of the valley here, known as Sun Valley to Morgan, was commissioned. Notably, the Sun Valley to Morgan project has garnered national attention for its innovative design and permitting process and collaborative work with the Bureau of Land Management. The 4 500 kV projects commissioned since 2015, including completion of this loop, provide added reliability, increased economic development opportunities and enhanced import and export capabilities with neighboring states. 
It should come as no surprise that each year, we go through extensive preparation and planning to maintain reliability throughout Arizona's intense summer heat. This year, in addition to expanding and strengthening our transmission system, we implemented new strategies to lower fire risk during wildfire season. To reduce fire risk, our teams performed the vegetation management activities, held wildfire prevention training and continue to expand our clearance-around- poles program. Implementing these strategies is the right thing to do for customers, the environment and the health of our company during increasingly dry conditions. 
For future resource needs, we recently issued requests for proposals regarding peaking capacity and forest bioenergy solutions. Proposals for the peaking capacity solicitation were due by July 20, and we're in the process of evaluating those proposals. The submission deadline for the forest bioenergy RFP is August 17. In addition, we issued a battery storage RFP for up to 106 megawatts located on APS solar Facilities with an in-service date no later than June 2020. We intend to own any projects selected as part of the battery storage RFP. We expect to make final selections for each of these solicitations during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
As the utility industry continues to evolve, so does the grid technology landscape. As part of an ongoing process to modernize the grid, we are upgrading the cellular communication technology for our meters from 2G to 4G. Over the next 18 months, we will replace roughly 2,000 2G devices, with about 1,500 4G devices, providing improved real-time outage information to system operators. Devices that have already been installed are transmitting information more quickly and efficiently than the old system, which means added reliability and quicker outage response for our customers. This investment is just one of many that aim to make the grid more advanced and more reliable for our customers. 
Turning to the ballot initiative. On July 5, the Tom Steyer-funded California campaign turned in signatures in an attempt to place a constitutional mandate for 50% renewable energy by 2030 on the Arizona ballot for the election this November. On July 19, a lawsuit was filed, arguing that fraud as well as other systemic errors disqualifies the majority of the signatures collected. The trial is set to begin on August 20, and we anticipate that the judge will issue a decision in August. Barring action by the judge, by late August or early September, the Arizona Secretary of State will make an official statement announcing whether the Steyer-funded initiative will be on the Arizona ballot. It is clear the impact from the Steyer-funded ballot initiative are bad for our customers and the state of Arizona. We estimate that the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would require APS to add over 5,500 megawatts of new resources above and beyond our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan estimates by 2030. This would equate to over $10 billion in incremental capital investment by 2030. Further, customers would bear the brunt of our recovery of the costs associated with the forced early retirement of existing facilities. At the time of a possible early retirement, the remaining book value and other costs associated with the early shutdown for Palo Verde generating station and the Four Corners Power Plant could be $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. But we expect the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would significantly increase our rate base estimates. Customer bills in 2030 would likely be double today's bills. We are not opposing this ballot initiative because we're opposed to clean or renewable energy. We're opposing it because a constitutional amendment is an irresponsible way to set energy policy and it will harm our customers. We know clean energy is important to our customers, and it's important to our company. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our diverse energy mix was carbon-free. Our renewable resources, including 9 large solar farms across the state and 80,000 rooftop solar installations, provide about 14% of that total. APS is in the top tier of all utilities in terms of solar power nationwide. Paired with our nuclear fleet and other clean sources, we have a long proven track record of advancing both clean and renewable energy. As a long-term leader in integrating sustainable clean energy resources, we continue to invite further thoughtful discussion about increasing the amount of renewables and other technologies that support clean energy in our state. In fact, this week, we filed a letter encouraging the Arizona Corporation Commission to continue to move the energy modernization plan forward. As we had stated since the concept was first introduced, APS believes this proposal to achieve 80% clean energy by 2050 is a bold vision for the future. 
While  we're proud of our accomplishments, we recognize that we need to continue to do more to achieve the best energy future for Arizona in a way that is right for our state. We believe the energy modernization plan is important to designing the energy future. We look forward to working with the Arizona Corporation Commission and stakeholders to further develop and implement this vision. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared",1110,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared to $1.49 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.12 per share compared with the second quarter in 2007, supported primarily by the rate increase offset by the federal tax rate change, unfavorable weather and lower retail sales. Although retail sales were lower this quarter versus the prior year quarter, weather-adjusted gross sales, excluding the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. I will discuss our sales trends in more detail in a moment. 
Continuing with the key drivers. Refunds to customers due to the lower federal corporate income tax rate decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share but were positively offset by the lower effective tax rate. The net impact of tax reform in the quarter was a $0.10 per share benefit to net income. As a reminder, the refund to customers due to tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM, is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact on the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings and will more closely align with our quarterly pretax earnings pattern. Please see Slide 8 for more information related to the timing impact of tax reform. 
Looking now to operating expense. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, primarily due to the higher planned outage cost related to the select catalytic reduction equipment installed at Four Corners. As you may recall, our guidance for 2018 outage spend was concentrated in the first half of the year as compared to the 2017 outage schedule, which was concentrated in the second half of the year. Additional drivers to higher operations and maintenance expense were transmission distribution and customers' service cost at APS. And at the parent company level, public outreach cost, primarily associated with the Steyer-funded ballot initiative. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.13 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher D&A rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $5 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns and the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferrals related to the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction equipment installations and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed above account for the deferrals associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on second quarter 2018 results. 
Turning now to the -- Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth, the Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.6% for the entire United States. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the effort post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market, and the economy more generally, to continue to expand. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.6% in the second quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate the response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
As I mentioned earlier, our weather-adjusted gross sales, including the impact of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. This solid sales growth was led by healthy growth in the residential sector of 2.2%, mixed with about flat growth in the commercial and industrial sector. In terms of commercial and industrial sales growth, the results were somewhat disappointing and at odds with the positive economic growth trends we have seen. But we believe this divergence will likely be short-lived. We also expect to see the other headwinds to sales growth declining in magnitude. Notably, the installation of grandfathered distributed generation systems eligible for net metering subtracted a 2 full percentage points on the residential growth rate this quarter. As the grandfathering deadline has now passed, we expect this sales reduction from new installations going forward will be less than half of this quarter's rate. It is also worth noting that the 2018 demand-side management plan currently awaiting approval from the Arizona Corporation Commission, focuses energy efficiency programs off-peak demand reduction, better aligning the benefits for customers with realized systems benefits. 
In closing, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase and our adjusted mechanism remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect to be partly offset by higher fossil plant outage costs and higher than other operating expenses related to more plant in-service, including higher D&A and operating tax. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides. 
We continue to expect to issue up to $300 million of debt at APS this year. But overall, liquidity remains strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020 supported by robust capital investment needs. We also continue to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
The step increase request for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant is progressing. The Arizona Corporation Commission hearing is scheduled to begin on September 5, and we continue to expect a decision around the end of the year. 
As required by the 2017 rate review order, all residential customers, except grandfathered solar customers, were migrated to new rates. We successfully transitioned nearly 1 million residential customers to new rates in a few short months. 
Turning to our operations. On May 5, Palo Verde generating station completed its scheduled Unit 3 spring maintenance and refueling outage in a plant record 28 days and 13 hours. The team's collective performance resulted into one of our best outages ever. 
Looking to our capital investment program. Nearly 200 miles of transmission lines and 15 new substations supporting the additional capacity have been added in the past 3 years. In May, the last 110-mile section of a 500 kV loop around the northern part of the valley here, known as Sun Valley to Morgan, was commissioned. Notably, the Sun Valley to Morgan project has garnered national attention for its innovative design and permitting process and collaborative work with the Bureau of Land Management. The 4 500 kV projects commissioned since 2015, including completion of this loop, provide added reliability, increased economic development opportunities and enhanced import and export capabilities with neighboring states. 
It should come as no surprise that each year, we go through extensive preparation and planning to maintain reliability throughout Arizona's intense summer heat. This year, in addition to expanding and strengthening our transmission system, we implemented new strategies to lower fire risk during wildfire season. To reduce fire risk, our teams performed the vegetation management activities, held wildfire prevention training and continue to expand our clearance-around- poles program. Implementing these strategies is the right thing to do for customers, the environment and the health of our company during increasingly dry conditions. 
For future resource needs, we recently issued requests for proposals regarding peaking capacity and forest bioenergy solutions. Proposals for the peaking capacity solicitation were due by July 20, and we're in the process of evaluating those proposals. The submission deadline for the forest bioenergy RFP is August 17. In addition, we issued a battery storage RFP for up to 106 megawatts located on APS solar Facilities with an in-service date no later than June 2020. We intend to own any projects selected as part of the battery storage RFP. We expect to make final selections for each of these solicitations during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
As the utility industry continues to evolve, so does the grid technology landscape. As part of an ongoing process to modernize the grid, we are upgrading the cellular communication technology for our meters from 2G to 4G. Over the next 18 months, we will replace roughly 2,000 2G devices, with about 1,500 4G devices, providing improved real-time outage information to system operators. Devices that have already been installed are transmitting information more quickly and efficiently than the old system, which means added reliability and quicker outage response for our customers. This investment is just one of many that aim to make the grid more advanced and more reliable for our customers. 
Turning to the ballot initiative. On July 5, the Tom Steyer-funded California campaign turned in signatures in an attempt to place a constitutional mandate for 50% renewable energy by 2030 on the Arizona ballot for the election this November. On July 19, a lawsuit was filed, arguing that fraud as well as other systemic errors disqualifies the majority of the signatures collected. The trial is set to begin on August 20, and we anticipate that the judge will issue a decision in August. Barring action by the judge, by late August or early September, the Arizona Secretary of State will make an official statement announcing whether the Steyer-funded initiative will be on the Arizona ballot. It is clear the impact from the Steyer-funded ballot initiative are bad for our customers and the state of Arizona. We estimate that the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would require APS to add over 5,500 megawatts of new resources above and beyond our 2017 Integrated Resource Plan estimates by 2030. This would equate to over $10 billion in incremental capital investment by 2030. Further, customers would bear the brunt of our recovery of the costs associated with the forced early retirement of existing facilities. At the time of a possible early retirement, the remaining book value and other costs associated with the early shutdown for Palo Verde generating station and the Four Corners Power Plant could be $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. But we expect the Steyer-funded ballot initiative would significantly increase our rate base estimates. Customer bills in 2030 would likely be double today's bills. We are not opposing this ballot initiative because we're opposed to clean or renewable energy. We're opposing it because a constitutional amendment is an irresponsible way to set energy policy and it will harm our customers. We know clean energy is important to our customers, and it's important to our company. At the end of 2017, over 50% of our diverse energy mix was carbon-free. Our renewable resources, including 9 large solar farms across the state and 80,000 rooftop solar installations, provide about 14% of that total. APS is in the top tier of all utilities in terms of solar power nationwide. Paired with our nuclear fleet and other clean sources, we have a long proven track record of advancing both clean and renewable energy. As a long-term leader in integrating sustainable clean energy resources, we continue to invite further thoughtful discussion about increasing the amount of renewables and other technologies that support clean energy in our state. In fact, this week, we filed a letter encouraging the Arizona Corporation Commission to continue to move the energy modernization plan forward. As we had stated since the concept was first introduced, APS believes this proposal to achieve 80% clean energy by 2050 is a bold vision for the future. 
While  we're proud of our accomplishments, we recognize that we need to continue to do more to achieve the best energy future for Arizona in a way that is right for our state. We believe the energy modernization plan is important to designing the energy future. We look forward to working with the Arizona Corporation Commission and stakeholders to further develop and implement this vision. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared",1111,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2018. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2018, we earned $1.48 per share compared to $1.49 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Slide 3 also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.12 per share compared with the second quarter in 2007, supported primarily by the rate increase offset by the federal tax rate change, unfavorable weather and lower retail sales. Although retail sales were lower this quarter versus the prior year quarter, weather-adjusted gross sales, excluding the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. I will discuss our sales trends in more detail in a moment. 
Continuing with the key drivers. Refunds to customers due to the lower federal corporate income tax rate decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share but were positively offset by the lower effective tax rate. The net impact of tax reform in the quarter was a $0.10 per share benefit to net income. As a reminder, the refund to customers due to tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM, is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact on the lower federal income tax rate is based on pretax earnings and will more closely align with our quarterly pretax earnings pattern. Please see Slide 8 for more information related to the timing impact of tax reform. 
Looking now to operating expense. Higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, primarily due to the higher planned outage cost related to the select catalytic reduction equipment installed at Four Corners. As you may recall, our guidance for 2018 outage spend was concentrated in the first half of the year as compared to the 2017 outage schedule, which was concentrated in the second half of the year. Additional drivers to higher operations and maintenance expense were transmission distribution and customers' service cost at APS. And at the parent company level, public outreach cost, primarily associated with the Steyer-funded ballot initiative. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.13 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher D&A rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and planned additions. Also, on Slide 3, pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits increased pretax income by approximately $5 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns and the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018. As a reminder, in the 2017 rate review order, we were granted accounting deferrals related to the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction equipment installations and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed above account for the deferrals associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on second quarter 2018 results. 
Turning now to the -- Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth, the Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.6% for the entire United States. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the effort post-recession trend. In 2018, housing permits are expected to increase by about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market, and the economy more generally, to continue to expand. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.6% in the second quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate the response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
As I mentioned earlier, our weather-adjusted gross sales, including the impact of energy efficiency and distributed generation, were up 1.2% in the quarter. This solid sales growth was led by healthy growth in the residential sector of 2.2%, mixed with about flat growth in the commercial and industrial sector. In terms of commercial and industrial sales growth, the results were somewhat disappointing and at odds with the positive economic growth trends we have seen. But we believe this divergence will likely be short-lived. We also expect to see the other headwinds to sales growth declining in magnitude. Notably, the installation of grandfathered distributed generation systems eligible for net metering subtracted a 2 full percentage points on the residential growth rate this quarter. As the grandfathering deadline has now passed, we expect this sales reduction from new installations going forward will be less than half of this quarter's rate. It is also worth noting that the 2018 demand-side management plan currently awaiting approval from the Arizona Corporation Commission, focuses energy efficiency programs off-peak demand reduction, better aligning the benefits for customers with realized systems benefits. 
In closing, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase and our adjusted mechanism remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect to be partly offset by higher fossil plant outage costs and higher than other operating expenses related to more plant in service, including higher D&A and operating tax. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides. 
We continue to expect to issue up to $300 million of debt at APS this year. But overall, liquidity remains strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% on average through 2020 supported by robust capital investment needs. We also continue to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Throughout this year, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet the financial commitments. The Pinnacle West board also displayed confidence in the company's outlook by proving a 6.1% dividend increase, effective with the December 2018 payment. 
Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results and guidance, I'll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments, including the valid initiative and certain elections. Our operations team did an excellent job, maintaining the generating fleet and electrical grid again this summer. Our workforce quickly restored service to customers after several storms, toppled the combined 451 poles, which is almost as many as the 2016 and 2017 summers combined. 
The [indiscernible] generating station also performed well with all 3 units operating at a combined 97.3% capacity. To meet customer demand and increase our clean energy mix, we issued 3 request for proposals this year. We've received bids on our request for forest, bioenergy solutions, peaking capacity and energy storage. Our energy storage RFP is particularly noteworthy because it will allow our customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sunsets. We're in the process of evaluating the bids and anticipate making our selection for each in the late 2018 or early 2019 timeframe. 
Our capital investment program continues to be robust, supporting investments and clean energy resources and maintaining safe and reliable service for our customers. Approximately 51% of our distribution capital investment from 2018 through 2020 will be driven by customer growth. For generation-related investments, the installation of 5 new fast start flexible generating units at the [indiscernible] plant is on track to be completed in the second quarter 2019. 
Turning to our regulatory updates. The hearing for the Four Corners step increased request concluded on September 7. On September 24, the Arizona Corporation Commission stay our filed as close in brief, which recommended a $58.5 million step up in revenue compared to our filed request were $67.5 million increase. Next, the Administrative Law Judge will issue a recommended opinion in order. The step increase request will then be scheduled for an open meeting and the ACC will issue a decision. APS's insulation of pollution controls at the Four Corners Power Plant is part of our continued investment in the cleaner energy future. We commissioned the selective catalytic reduction equipment earlier this year and now are achieving an 88% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions. 
In August, APS filed a second request with the Arizona Corporation Commission to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers beginning to generate January 1, 2019. If approved, the second label savings from tax reform will all set the request Corners step increase. The total tax savings for customers, when combined with the first reduction implemented in March of 2018, would be $205.5 million. 
Over the last 20 years, our price increases have been below the rate of inflation. With the rate reductions from tax reform and other price reductions, customer rates will be lower at the end of 2018 than they were at the beginning of the year. 
As required by the 2017 rate review decision, each year, the resource comparison proxy must be recalculated to determine the amount new rooftop solar customers will receive for the generation they export back to the grid. 
Beginning October 1, 2018, the Arizona Corporation Commission approved a rate of $0.116 per kilowatt hour, which is 10% less than the previous rate of $0.129 per kilowatt hour. This reduction continues to move the amount received by solar customers or excess generation closer to our avoided cost and further mitigates the courtship between solar and non-solar customers. 
Lastly, on October 1, the Arizona Corporation Commission concluded its hearing regarding a customer complaint, alleging the average residential bill increases higher than the average approved from the 2017 rate review order. We're confident that the rate increase was implemented appropriately and is consistent with the rate review order. 
Final briefs in this matter are due on November 16, and a recommended opinion in order will subsequently be issued by the administrative law judge. 
We anticipate that commissioners will issue a decision in this matter in 2019. 
As you are aware, Arizona held its midterm elections on November 6. While the Corporation commission rates have not been officially declared, as of this morning, Commissioner [indiscernible] and Republican Rodney Glassman are head of the Democratic candidates. Commissioners done to open numbers will continue serving through the remainder of their terms, ending in January 2021. 
Importantly, the residents of Arizona voted overwhelmingly to defeat proposition 127. Assumed an energy policy in Arizona will continue to involved in a thoughtful and constructive manner. With proposition 127 behind us, we can now work with stakeholders to establish forward-thinking energy policies that move towards an increasingly clean energy mix. 
Arizona is #3 nationally in solar energy installed, and our APS energy mix is already 50% clean. We are in the cutting edge of advanced battery storage technology. Arizona is uniquely positioned to achieve a clear energy mix with our abundant solar resource, leadership in advanced technologies and polymer generating stations, the largest clean energy generator in the nation. 
Additional infrastructure investments will not only support our clean energy focus, they are also necessary to support our microburst customer growth. [indiscernible] County was the fastest growing in the United States the last 2 years in a row. We estimate that 340,000 new customers will move into the APS service territory by 2030. And our customers energy needs are expected to increase by more than 30% over that same period. Significant investments in new resources, including grid infrastructure, cleaner power generation and advanced energy technologies will be required to support Arizona's growing economy. 
Let me conclude by saying that I'm proud of our team's commitment to our customers and our community. We not only supported the effort to protect Arizonians but we remained focused on our operation performance and delivering on our commitments. Our capital investment opportunities and emphasis on cost management continue to create value for our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 2",1216,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 2019 guidance. 
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2018, we had $2.80 per share compared to $2.46 per share in the third quarter of 2017. 
Slide 4 outlines a variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.04 per share compared with the third quarter and 2017 supported by favorable weather, the price increase from the 2017 rate review, higher sales the in transformation revenue, sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1.2% in the quarter driven by strong commercial sales growth and robust residential customer growth. 
The strong commercial sales growth reflects the positive economic trend we have seen in the Metro Phoenix area. Offsetting drivers include the refunds to customers resulting from the federal tax reform, and a shift in the seasonality of revenue resulting from the residential rate design changes approved in the 2017 rate order review. As previously discussed, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new red shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue connection with the cost to serve. 
Looking out to our operating expenses, higher adjusted operating and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.12 per share due to higher costs at APS for transmission, distribution, customer service and information technology. And at the parent company level, for public outreach cost primarily associated with prop 127. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter 2018 compared to the third quarter of the 2017, reducing earnings by $0.08 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher depreciation rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and plant additions. 
Pension and other pay stamp benefits, not service credits, increased pretax income of approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns in the adoption of the new pension and [indiscernible] accounting guidance for 2018. 
Lastly, the refund customers resulting from federal tax reform was positively offset by a lower effective tax rate. The net impact of pivotal corporate tax cuts in the quarter was $0.14 per share benefit to net income. 
Turning now to the Arizona's economy, customer growth in sales growth. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. As shown in the top panel of Slide 5. Through August, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 3.1% compared to 1.6% of the entire U.S. Job growth is particularly strong in the construction sector, [indiscernible] of strength in the areas commercial and residential real estate markets. Construction employment has increased by 10.4% versus 2017. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial development. 
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward post recession trend as shown in the lower panel of Slide 5. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017 driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth in relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix [indiscernible] market and economy more [indiscernible] to continue to expand faster than the national average. Reflecting this steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.6% in the third quarter of 2018. We expect this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. 
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development there in Arizona appeared to be in place. And we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas. 
As I mentioned earlier, net sales were up 1.2% in the quarter. Commercial and [indiscernible] sales increased 2.3% over the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the positive economic growth trends we have seen in the region. 
Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On August 9, 2018, APS issued $300 million of 30 years, 4.0% unsecured senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had approximately $128 million of short-term debt outstanding. 
Later, this year, we expect to infuse up to $150 million of equity capital from Pinnacle West into APS. Turning to guidance, as shown on Slide 6. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $435 million to $455 per share. While we've benefited from a hot September, we also have had a very mild October. We expect October weather will negatively impact the full year 2018 earnings by approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Offsetting that [indiscernible] 2018 guidance can be found on the appendix to our slides. 
Before I introduce 2019 guidance, I would like to confirm that we do not intend to file a rate review request in 2019. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order prohibited APS in filing and news on micro attribute before June 1 of 2019. After review in our financial expectations, we have determined that final rate review in May 2020 will meet our financial objectives. In preparation for this filing, we expect to keep our capital structure similar to the level approved in our last rate review. 
Continuing with guidance, we're introducing 2019 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Positive drivers for 2019 include the anticipated Four Corners, SCR revenue increase, higher weather normalized sales, higher transmission revenue, [indiscernible] interest expense and lower operating and maintenance expenses, primarily due to lower planned outages in our continued cost management. 
We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher D&A related to more plant in service, higher property taxes and lower AFUDC. The estimated effective tax rate is 10% for 2019 reflects the amortization of $71 million of excess deferred taxes associated with the second-team filing. The decrease in the effective tax rate is offset by the proposed $86.5 million refund to customer, which is also part of the second-team filing. 
Our 2019 capital expenditure for cost remains at $1.15 billion. We will provide updated to our CapEx forecast and rate base on our fourth quarter call. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2018 and 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2020. And we still expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated and return on average common equity of more than 9.5% over the same period. As we have said, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. However, over the long term, the opportunity to lead Arizona to a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Throughout this year, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet financial commitments. The Pinnacle West Board also displayed confidence in the company's outlook by approving a 6.1% dividend increase, effective with the December 2018 payment.
Before Jim discusses the detail of our third quarter results and guidance, I'll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments, including the ballot initiative and certain elections. Our operations team did an excellent job, maintaining the generating fleet and electrical grid again this summer. Our workforce quickly restored service to customers after several storms toppled a combined 451 poles, which is almost as many as the 2016 and 2017 summers combined.
The Palo Verde generating station also performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined 97.3% capacity. To meet customer demand and increase our clean energy mix, we issued 3 request for proposals this year. We've received bids on our request for forest, bioenergy solutions, peaking capacity and energy storage. Our energy storage RFP is particularly noteworthy because it will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets. We're in the process of evaluating the bids and anticipate making our selection for each in the late 2018 or early 2019 timeframe.
Our capital investment program continues to be robust, supporting investments in clean energy resources and maintaining safe and reliable service for our customers. Approximately 51% of our distribution capital investment from 2018 through 2020 will be driven by customer growth. For generation-related investments, the installation of 5 new fast-start flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant is on track to be completed in the second quarter 2019.
Turning to our regulatory updates. The hearing for the Four Corners step increase request concluded on September 7. On September 24, the Arizona Corporation Commission staff filed its closing brief, which recommended a $58.5 million step up in revenue compared to our filed request worth $67.5 million increase.
Next, the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion in order. The step increase request will then be scheduled for an open meeting and the ACC will issue a decision. APS' installation of pollution controls at the Four Corners Power Plant is part of our continued investment in a cleaner energy future. We commissioned the selective catalytic reduction equipment earlier this year and now are achieving an 88% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions.
In August, APS filed their second request with the Arizona Corporation Commission to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers beginning January 1, 2019. If approved, the second layer savings from tax reform will offset the requested Four Corners step increase. The total tax savings for customers, when combined with the first reduction implemented in March of 2018, would be $205.5 million.
Over the last 20 years, our price increases have been below the rate of inflation. With the rate reductions from tax reform and other price reductions, customer rates will be lower at the end of 2018 than they were at the beginning of the year.
As required by the 2017 rate review decision, each year, the resource comparison proxy must be recalculated to determine the amount new rooftop solar customers will receive for the generation they export back to the grid.
Beginning October 1, 2018, the Arizona Corporation Commission approved a rate of $0.116 per kilowatt hour, which is 10% less than the previous rate of $0.129 per kilowatt hour. This reduction continues to move the amount received by solar customers or excess generation closer to our avoided cost and further mitigates the cost shift between solar and non-solar customers.
Lastly, on October 1, the Arizona Corporation Commission concluded its hearing regarding a customer complaint, alleging the average residential bill increases higher than the average approved from the 2017 rate review order. We're confident that the rate increase was implemented appropriately and is consistent with the rate review order.
Final briefs in this matter are due on November 16, and a recommended opinion in order will subsequently be issued by the administrative law judge.
We anticipate that commissioners will issue a decision in this matter in 2019.
As you are aware, Arizona held its midterm elections on November 6. While the Corporation Commission race has not been officially declared, as of this morning, Commissioner Olson and Republican Rodney Glassman are ahead of the Democratic candidates. Commissioners Dunn, Tobin and Burns will continue serving through the remainder of their terms, ending in January 2021.
Importantly, the residents of Arizona voted overwhelmingly to defeat Proposition 127, insuring the energy policy in Arizona will continue to evolve in a thoughtful and constructive manner. With Proposition 127 behind us, we can now work with stakeholders to establish forward-thinking energy policies that move towards an increasingly clean energy mix.
Arizona is #3 nationally in solar energy installed, and our APS energy mix is already 50% clean. We're on the cutting-edge of advanced battery storage technology. Arizona is uniquely positioned to achieve a cleaner energy mix with our abundant solar resource, leadership in advanced technologies and Palo Verde generating station, the largest clean energy generator in the nation.
Additional infrastructure investments will not only support our clean energy focus, they are also necessary to support our robust customer growth. Maricopa County was the fastest growing in the United States the last 2 years in a row. We estimate that 340,000 new customers will move into the APS service territory by 2030, and our customers' energy needs are expected to increase by more than 30% over that same period. Significant investments in new resources, including grid infrastructure, cleaner power generation and advanced energy technologies will be required to support Arizona's growing economy.
Let me conclude by saying that I'm proud of our team's commitment to our customers and our community. We not only supported the effort to protect Arizonians, but we also remained focused on our operational performance and delivering on our commitments. Our capital investment opportunities and emphasis on cost management continue to create value for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,584889619,1598499,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2018",2018-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 2",1214,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 2019 guidance.
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2018, we earned $2.80 per share compared to $2.46 per share in the third quarter of 2017.
Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.04 per share compared with the third quarter in 2017, supported by favorable weather, the price increase from the 2017 rate review, higher sales and transformation revenue, sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1.2% in the quarter, driven by strong commercial sales growth and robust residential customer growth.
The strong commercial sales growth reflects the positive economic trends we have seen in the Metro Phoenix area. Offsetting drivers include the refunds to customers resulting from the federal tax reform, and a shift in the seasonality of revenue resulting from the residential rate design changes approved in the 2017 rate order review. As previously discussed, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new rate shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve.
Looking out to our operating expenses, higher adjusted operating and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.12 per share due to a higher cost at APS for transmission, distribution, customer service and information technology. And at the parent company level, for public outreach cost primarily associated with Prop 127.
Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.08 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher depreciation rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and plant additions.
Pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits, increased pretax income by approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns in the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018.
Lastly, the refunded customers resulting from federal tax reform was positively offset by a lower effective tax rate. The net impact of pivotal corporate tax cuts in the quarter was of $0.14 per share benefit to net income.
Turning now to the Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average, as shown in the top panel of Slide 5. Through August, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 3.1% compared to 1.6% of the entire U.S. Job growth is particularly strong in the construction sector. A sign of strength in the areas commercial and residential real estate markets. Construction employment has increased by 10.4% versus 2017. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial development.
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward postrecession trend as shown in the lower panel of Slide 5. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average. Reflecting this steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.6% in the third quarter of 2018. We expect this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed.
Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place, and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas.
As I mentioned earlier, net sales were up 1.2% in the quarter. Commercial and industrial sales increased 2.3% over the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the positive economic growth trends we have seen in the region.
Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On August 9, 2018, APS issued $300 million of 30-year 4.20% unsecured senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings.
Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had approximately $128 million of short-term debt outstanding.
Later this year, we expect to infuse up to $150 million of equity capital from Pinnacle West into APS.
Turning to guidance, as shown on Slide 6, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $435 million to $455 per share. While we benefited from a hot September, we also had a very mild October. We expect October weather will negatively impact the full year 2018 earnings by approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Offsetting updates to our 2018 guidance can be found on the appendix to our slides. 
Before I introduce 2019 guidance, I would like to confirm that we do not intend to file a rate review request in 2019. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order prohibited APS from filing a new general rate review before June 1, 2019. After reviewing our financial expectations, we have determined that filling our rate review in mid-2020 will meet our financial objectives. In preparation for this filing, we expect to keep our capital structure similar to the level approved in our last rate review.
Continuing with guidance, we're introducing 2019 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Positive drivers for 2019 include the anticipated Four Corners' SCR revenue increase, higher weather normalized sales, higher transmission revenue, flat to lower interest expense and lower operating and maintenance expenses, primarily due to lower planned outages in our continued cost management.
We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher D&A related to more plant in service, higher property taxes and lower AFUDC. We estimated effective tax rate of 10% for 2019 reflects the amortization of $71 million of excess deferred taxes associated with the second team filing. The decrease in the effective tax rate is offset by the proposed $86.5 million refund to customers, which is also part of the second team filing.
Our 2019 capital expenditure forecast remains at $1.15 billion. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and rate base on our fourth quarter call.
A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2018 and 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides.
Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2020. And we still expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated and return on average common equity of more than 9.5% over the same period.
As we have said, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. However, over the long term, the opportunity to lead Arizona to a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Throughout this year, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet financial commitments. The Pinnacle West board also displayed confidence in the company's outlook by approving a 6.1% dividend increase, effective with the December 2018 payment.
Before Jim discusses the detail of our third quarter results and guidance, I'll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments, including the ballot initiative and certain elections. Our operations team did an excellent job maintaining the generating fleet and electrical grid again this summer. Our workforce quickly restored service to customers after several storms toppled a combined 451 poles, which is almost as many as the 2016 and 2017 summers combined. The Palo Verde generating station also performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined 97.3% capacity status. 
To meet customer demand and increase our clean energy mix, we issued 3 request for proposals this year. We've received bids on our request for forest bioenergy solutions, peaking capacity and energy storage. Our energy storage RFP is particularly noteworthy because it will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets. We're in the process of evaluating the bids and anticipate making our selection for each in the late 2018 or early 2019 time frame.
Our capital investment program continues to be robust, supporting investments in clean energy resources and maintaining safe and reliable service for our customers. Approximately 51% of our distribution capital investment from 2018 through 2020 will be driven by customer growth. For generation-related investments, the installation of 5 new fast-start flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant is on track to be completed in the second quarter 2019.
Turning to our regulatory updates. The hearing for the Four Corners step increase request concluded on September 7. On September 24, the Arizona Corporation Commission staff filed its closing brief, which recommended a $58.5 million step up in revenue compared to our filed request worth $67.5 million increase.
Next, the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion and order. The step increase request will then be scheduled for an open meeting, and the ACC will issue a decision. APS' installation of pollution controls at the Four Corners Power Plant is part of our continued investment in a cleaner energy future. We commissioned a selective catalytic reduction equipment earlier this year and now are achieving an 88% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions.
In August, APS filed a second request with the Arizona Corporation Commission to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers beginning January 1, 2019. If approved, the second wave of savings from tax reform will offset the requested Four Corners step increase. The total tax savings for customers, when combined with the first reduction implemented in March of 2018, would be $205.5 million. Over the last 20 years, our price increases have been below the rate of inflation. With the rate reductions from tax reform and other price reductions, customer rates will be lower at the end of 2018 than they were at the beginning of the year.
As required by the 2017 rate review decision, each year, the resource comparison proxy must be recalculated to determine the amount new rooftop solar customers will receive for the generation they export back to the grid. Beginning October 1, 2018, the Arizona Corporation Commission approved a rate of $0.116 per kilowatt hour, which is 10% less than the previous rate of $0.129 per kilowatt hour. This reduction continues to move the amount received by solar customers for excess generation closer to our avoided cost and further mitigates the cost shift between solar and non-solar customers.
Lastly, on October 1, the Arizona Corporation Commission concluded its hearing regarding a customer complaint alleging the average residential bill increase was higher than the average approved in the 2017 rate review order. We're confident that the rate increase was implemented appropriately and is consistent with the rate review order. Final briefs on this matter are due on November 16, and a recommended opinion and order will subsequently be issued by the administrative law judge. We anticipate the commissioners will issue a decision on this matter in 2019.
As you are aware, Arizona held its midterm elections on November 6. While the corporation commission race has not been officially declared, as of this morning, Commissioner Olson and Republican Rodney Glassman are ahead of the Democratic candidates. Commissioners Dunn, Tobin and Burns will continue serving through the remainder of their terms, ending in January 2021. Importantly, the residents of Arizona voted overwhelmingly to defeat Proposition 127, ensuring that energy policy in Arizona will continue to evolve in a thoughtful and constructive manner. With Proposition 127 behind us, we can now work with stakeholders to establish forward-thinking energy policies that move towards an increasingly clean energy mix.
Arizona is #3 nationally in solar energy installed, and our APS energy mix is already 50% clean. We're on the cutting edge of advanced battery storage technology. Arizona is uniquely positioned to achieve a cleaner energy mix with our abundant solar resource, leadership in advanced technologies and Palo Verde generating station, the largest clean energy generator in the nation.
Additional infrastructure investments will not only support our clean energy focus, they are also necessary to support our robust customer growth. Maricopa County was the fastest growing in the United States the last 2 years in a row. We estimate that 340,000 new customers will move into the APS service territory by 2030, and our customers' energy needs are expected to increase by more than 30% over that same period. Significant investments in new resources, including grid infrastructure, cleaner power generation and advanced energy technologies, will be required to support Arizona's growing economy.
Let me conclude by saying that I'm proud of our team's commitment to our customers and our community. We not only supported the effort to protect Arizonans, but we also remain focused on our operational performance and delivering on our commitments. Our capital investment opportunities and emphasis on cost management continue to create value for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,584889619,1613277,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2018",2018-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and thank you again everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 201",1216,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 2019 guidance.
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2018, we earned $2.80 per share compared to $2.46 per share in the third quarter of 2017.  Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. 
Adjusted gross margin was up $0.04 per share compared with the third quarter in 2017, supported by favorable weather, the price increase from the 2017 rate review, higher sales and transmission revenue. Sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1.2% in the quarter, driven by strong commercial sales growth and robust residential customer growth. The strong commercial sales growth reflects the positive economic trends we have seen in the Metro Phoenix area. 
Offsetting drivers include the refunds to customers resulting from the federal tax reform and a shift in the seasonality of revenue resulting from the residential rate design changes approved in the 2017 rate order review. As previously discussed, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new rate shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve.
Looking now to our operating expenses. Higher adjusted operating and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.12 per share due to a higher cost at APS for transmission, distribution, customer service and information technology; and at the parent company level, for public outreach cost primarily associated with Prop 127. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.08 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher depreciation rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and plant additions.
Pension and other postretirement benefits and non-service credits increased pretax income by approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns and the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018.
Lastly, the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform was positively offset by a lower effective tax rate. The net impact of federal corporate tax cuts in the quarter was a $0.14 per share benefit to net income.
Turning now to Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average, as shown in the top panel of Slide 5. Through August, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 3.1% compared to 1.6% of the entire U.S. Job growth is particularly strong in the construction sector, a sign of strength in the area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Construction employment has increased by 10.4% versus 2017. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial development.
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward postrecession trend, as shown in the lower panel of Slide 5. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average. 
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.6% in the third quarter of 2018. We expect this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place, and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas.
As I mentioned earlier, net sales were up 1.2% in the quarter. Commercial and industrial sales increased 2.3% over the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the positive economic growth trends we have seen in the region.
Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On August 9, 2018, APS issued $300 million of 30-year 4.20% unsecured senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had approximately $128 million of short-term debt outstanding. Later this year, we expect to infuse up to $150 million of equity capital from Pinnacle West into APS.
Turning to guidance. As shown on Slide 6, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. While we benefited from a hot September, we also had a very mild October. We expect October weather will negatively impact the full year 2018 earnings by approximately $0.10 to  $0.15 per share. Offsetting [ drivers ] to our 2018 guidance can be found on the appendix to our slides. 
Before I introduce 2019 guidance, I would like to confirm that we do not intend to file a rate review request in 2019. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order prohibited APS from filing a new general rate review before June 1 of 2019. After reviewing our financial expectations, we have determined that filing a rate review in mid-2020 will meet our financial objectives. In preparation for this filing, we expect to keep our capital structure similar to the level approved in our last rate review.
Continuing with guidance, we're introducing 2019 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Positive drivers for 2019 include the anticipated Four Corners' SCR revenue increase, higher weather-normalized sales, higher transmission revenue, flat to lower interest expense and lower operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower planned outages and our continued cost management. We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher D&A related to more plant in service, higher property taxes and lower AFUDC. 
The estimated effective tax rate of 10% for 2019 reflects the amortization of $71 million of excess deferred taxes associated with the second TEAM filing. The decrease in the effective tax rate is offset by the proposed $86.5 million refund to customers, which is also part of the second TEAM filing. Our 2019 capital expenditure forecast remains at $1.15 billion. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and rate base on our fourth quarter call.
A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2018 and 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2020, and we still expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% over the same period. 
As we have said, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. However, over the long term, the opportunity to lead Arizona to a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Throughout this year, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet financial commitments. The Pinnacle West board also displayed confidence in the company's outlook by approving a 6.1% dividend increase, effective with the December 2018 payment.
Before Jim discusses the detail of our third quarter results and guidance, I'll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments, including the ballot initiative and certain elections. Our operations team did an excellent job maintaining the generating fleet and electrical grid again this summer. Our workforce quickly restored service to customers after several storms toppled a combined 451 poles, which is almost as many as the 2016 and 2017 summers combined. The Palo Verde generating station also performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined 97.3% capacity status. 
To meet customer demand and increase our clean energy mix, we issued 3 request for proposals this year. We've received bids on our request for forest bioenergy solutions, peaking capacity and energy storage. Our energy storage RFP is particularly noteworthy because it will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets. We're in the process of evaluating the bids and anticipate making our selection for each in the late 2018 or early 2019 time frame.
Our capital investment program continues to be robust, supporting investments in clean energy resources and maintaining safe and reliable service for our customers. Approximately 51% of our distribution capital investment from 2018 through 2020 will be driven by customer growth. For generation-related investments, the installation of 5 new fast-start flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant is on track to be completed in the second quarter 2019.
Turning to our regulatory updates. The hearing for the Four Corners step increase request concluded on September 7. On September 24, the Arizona Corporation Commission staff filed its closing brief, which recommended a $58.5 million step up in revenue compared to our filed request worth $67.5 million increase.
Next, the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion and order. The step increase request will then be scheduled for an open meeting, and the ACC will issue a decision. APS' installation of pollution controls at the Four Corners Power Plant is part of our continued investment in a cleaner energy future. We commissioned a selective catalytic reduction equipment earlier this year and now are achieving an 88% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions.
In August, APS filed a second request with the Arizona Corporation Commission to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers beginning January 1, 2019. If approved, the second wave of savings from tax reform will offset the requested Four Corners step increase. The total tax savings for customers, when combined with the first reduction implemented in March of 2018, would be $205.5 million. Over the last 20 years, our price increases have been below the rate of inflation. With the rate reductions from tax reform and other price reductions, customer rates will be lower at the end of 2018 than they were at the beginning of the year.
As required by the 2017 rate review decision, each year, the resource comparison proxy must be recalculated to determine the amount new rooftop solar customers will receive for the generation they export back to the grid. Beginning October 1, 2018, the Arizona Corporation Commission approved a rate of $0.116 per kilowatt hour, which is 10% less than the previous rate of $0.129 per kilowatt hour. This reduction continues to move the amount received by solar customers for excess generation closer to our avoided cost and further mitigates the cost shift between solar and non-solar customers.
Lastly, on October 1, the Arizona Corporation Commission concluded its hearing regarding a customer complaint alleging the average residential bill increase was higher than the average approved in the 2017 rate review order. We're confident that the rate increase was implemented appropriately and is consistent with the rate review order. Final briefs on this matter are due on November 16, and a recommended opinion and order will subsequently be issued by the administrative law judge. We anticipate the commissioners will issue a decision on this matter in 2019.
As you are aware, Arizona held its midterm elections on November 6. While the corporation commission race has not been officially declared, as of this morning, Commissioner Olson and Republican Rodney Glassman are ahead of the Democratic candidates. Commissioners Dunn, Tobin and Burns will continue serving through the remainder of their terms, ending in January 2021. Importantly, the residents of Arizona voted overwhelmingly to defeat Proposition 127, ensuring that energy policy in Arizona will continue to evolve in a thoughtful and constructive manner. With Proposition 127 behind us, we can now work with stakeholders to establish forward-thinking energy policies that move towards an increasingly clean energy mix.
Arizona is #3 nationally in solar energy installed, and our APS energy mix is already 50% clean. We're on the cutting edge of advanced battery storage technology. Arizona is uniquely positioned to achieve a cleaner energy mix with our abundant solar resource, leadership in advanced technologies and Palo Verde generating station, the largest clean energy generator in the nation.
Additional infrastructure investments will not only support our clean energy focus, they are also necessary to support our robust customer growth. Maricopa County was the fastest growing in the United States the last 2 years in a row. We estimate that 340,000 new customers will move into the APS service territory by 2030, and our customers' energy needs are expected to increase by more than 30% over that same period. Significant investments in new resources, including grid infrastructure, cleaner power generation and advanced energy technologies, will be required to support Arizona's growing economy.
Let me conclude by saying that I'm proud of our team's commitment to our customers and our community. We not only supported the effort to protect Arizonans, but we also remain focused on our operational performance and delivering on our commitments. Our capital investment opportunities and emphasis on cost management continue to create value for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,584889619,1615937,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2018",2018-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and thank you again everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 201",1216,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 2019 guidance.
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2018, we earned $2.80 per share compared to $2.46 per share in the third quarter of 2017.  Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. 
Adjusted gross margin was up $0.04 per share compared with the third quarter in 2017, supported by favorable weather, the price increase from the 2017 rate review, higher sales and transmission revenue. Sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1.2% in the quarter, driven by strong commercial sales growth and robust residential customer growth. The strong commercial sales growth reflects the positive economic trends we have seen in the Metro Phoenix area. 
Offsetting drivers include the refunds to customers resulting from the federal tax reform and a shift in the seasonality of revenue resulting from the residential rate design changes approved in the 2017 rate order review. As previously discussed, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new rate shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve.
Looking now to our operating expenses. Higher adjusted operating and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.12 per share due to a higher cost at APS for transmission, distribution, customer service and information technology; and at the parent company level, for public outreach cost primarily associated with Prop 127. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.08 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher depreciation rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and plant additions.
Pension and other postretirement benefits and non-service credits increased pretax income by approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns and the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018.
Lastly, the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform was positively offset by a lower effective tax rate. The net impact of federal corporate tax cuts in the quarter was a $0.14 per share benefit to net income.
Turning now to Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average, as shown in the top panel of Slide 5. Through August, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 3.1% compared to 1.6% of the entire U.S. Job growth is particularly strong in the construction sector, a sign of strength in the area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Construction employment has increased by 10.4% versus 2017. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial development.
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward postrecession trend, as shown in the lower panel of Slide 5. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average. 
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.6% in the third quarter of 2018. We expect this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place, and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas.
As I mentioned earlier, net sales were up 1.2% in the quarter. Commercial and industrial sales increased 2.3% over the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the positive economic growth trends we have seen in the region.
Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On August 9, 2018, APS issued $300 million of 30-year 4.20% unsecured senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had approximately $128 million of short-term debt outstanding. Later this year, we expect to infuse up to $150 million of equity capital from Pinnacle West into APS.
Turning to guidance. As shown on Slide 6, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. While we benefited from a hot September, we also had a very mild October. We expect October weather will negatively impact the full year 2018 earnings by approximately $0.10 to  $0.15 per share. Offsetting [ drivers ] to our 2018 guidance can be found on the appendix to our slides. 
Before I introduce 2019 guidance, I would like to confirm that we do not intend to file a rate review request in 2019. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order prohibited APS from filing a new general rate review before June 1 of 2019. After reviewing our financial expectations, we have determined that filing a rate review in mid-2020 will meet our financial objectives. In preparation for this filing, we expect to keep our capital structure similar to the level approved in our last rate review.
Continuing with guidance, we're introducing 2019 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Positive drivers for 2019 include the anticipated Four Corners' SCR revenue increase, higher weather-normalized sales, higher transmission revenue, flat to lower interest expense and lower operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower planned outages and our continued cost management. We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher D&A related to more plant in service, higher property taxes and lower AFUDC. 
The estimated effective tax rate of 10% for 2019 reflects the amortization of $71 million of excess deferred taxes associated with the second TEAM filing. The decrease in the effective tax rate is offset by the proposed $86.5 million refund to customers, which is also part of the second TEAM filing. Our 2019 capital expenditure forecast remains at $1.15 billion. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and rate base on our fourth quarter call.
A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2018 and 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2020, and we still expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% over the same period. 
As we have said, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. However, over the long term, the opportunity to lead Arizona to a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Throughout this year, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet financial commitments. The Pinnacle West board also displayed confidence in the company's outlook by approving a 6.1% dividend increase, effective with the December 2018 payment.
Before Jim discusses the detail of our third quarter results and guidance, I'll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments, including the ballot initiative and certain elections. Our operations team did an excellent job maintaining the generating fleet and electrical grid again this summer. Our workforce quickly restored service to customers after several storms toppled a combined 451 poles, which is almost as many as the 2016 and 2017 summers combined. The Palo Verde generating station also performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined 97.3% capacity status. 
To meet customer demand and increase our clean energy mix, we issued 3 request for proposals this year. We've received bids on our request for forest bioenergy solutions, peaking capacity and energy storage. Our energy storage RFP is particularly noteworthy because it will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets. We're in the process of evaluating the bids and anticipate making our selection for each in the late 2018 or early 2019 time frame.
Our capital investment program continues to be robust, supporting investments in clean energy resources and maintaining safe and reliable service for our customers. Approximately 51% of our distribution capital investment from 2018 through 2020 will be driven by customer growth. For generation-related investments, the installation of 5 new fast-start flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant is on track to be completed in the second quarter 2019.
Turning to our regulatory updates. The hearing for the Four Corners step increase request concluded on September 7. On September 24, the Arizona Corporation Commission staff filed its closing brief, which recommended a $58.5 million step up in revenue compared to our filed request worth $67.5 million increase.
Next, the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion and order. The step increase request will then be scheduled for an open meeting, and the ACC will issue a decision. APS' installation of pollution controls at the Four Corners Power Plant is part of our continued investment in a cleaner energy future. We commissioned a selective catalytic reduction equipment earlier this year and now are achieving an 88% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions.
In August, APS filed a second request with the Arizona Corporation Commission to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers beginning January 1, 2019. If approved, the second wave of savings from tax reform will offset the requested Four Corners step increase. The total tax savings for customers, when combined with the first reduction implemented in March of 2018, would be $205.5 million. Over the last 20 years, our price increases have been below the rate of inflation. With the rate reductions from tax reform and other price reductions, customer rates will be lower at the end of 2018 than they were at the beginning of the year.
As required by the 2017 rate review decision, each year, the resource comparison proxy must be recalculated to determine the amount new rooftop solar customers will receive for the generation they export back to the grid. Beginning October 1, 2018, the Arizona Corporation Commission approved a rate of $0.116 per kilowatt hour, which is 10% less than the previous rate of $0.129 per kilowatt hour. This reduction continues to move the amount received by solar customers or excess generation closer to our avoided cost and further mitigates the cost shift between solar and non-solar customers.
Lastly, on October 1, the Arizona Corporation Commission concluded its hearing regarding a customer complaint alleging the average residential bill increase was higher than the average approved in the 2017 rate review order. We're confident that the rate increase was implemented appropriately and is consistent with the rate review order. Final briefs on this matter are due on November 16, and a recommended opinion and order will subsequently be issued by the administrative law judge. We anticipate the commissioners will issue a decision on this matter in 2019.
As you are aware, Arizona held its midterm elections on November 6. While the corporation commission race has not been officially declared, as of this morning, Commissioner Olson and Republican Rodney Glassman are ahead of the Democratic candidates. Commissioners Dunn, Tobin and Burns will continue serving through the remainder of their terms, ending in January 2021. Importantly, the residents of Arizona voted overwhelmingly to defeat Proposition 127, ensuring that energy policy in Arizona will continue to evolve in a thoughtful and constructive manner. With Proposition 127 behind us, we can now work with stakeholders to establish forward-thinking energy policies that move towards an increasingly clean energy mix.
Arizona is #3 nationally in solar energy installed, and our APS energy mix is already 50% clean. We're on the cutting edge of advanced battery storage technology. Arizona is uniquely positioned to achieve a cleaner energy mix with our abundant solar resource, leadership in advanced technologies and Palo Verde generating station, the largest clean energy generator in the nation.
Additional infrastructure investments will not only support our clean energy focus, they are also necessary to support our robust customer growth. Maricopa County was the fastest growing in the United States the last 2 years in a row. We estimate that 340,000 new customers will move into the APS service territory by 2030, and our customers' energy needs are expected to increase by more than 30% over that same period. Significant investments in new resources, including grid infrastructure, cleaner power generation and advanced energy technologies, will be required to support Arizona's growing economy.
Let me conclude by saying that I'm proud of our team's commitment to our customers and our community. We not only supported the effort to protect Arizonans, but we also remain focused on our operational performance and delivering on our commitments. Our capital investment opportunities and emphasis on cost management continue to create value for our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,584889619,1626685,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2018",2018-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and thank you again everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 201",1216,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I'll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 2019 guidance.
As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2018, we earned $2.80 per share compared to $2.46 per share in the third quarter of 2017.  Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. 
Adjusted gross margin was up $0.04 per share compared with the third quarter in 2017, supported by favorable weather, the price increase from the 2017 rate review, higher sales and transmission revenue. Sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1.2% in the quarter, driven by strong commercial sales growth and robust residential customer growth. The strong commercial sales growth reflects the positive economic trends we have seen in the Metro Phoenix area. 
Offsetting drivers include the refunds to customers resulting from the federal tax reform and a shift in the seasonality of revenue resulting from the residential rate design changes approved in the 2017 rate order review. As previously discussed, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new rate shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve.
Looking now to our operating expenses. Higher adjusted operating and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.12 per share due to a higher cost at APS for transmission, distribution, customer service and information technology; and at the parent company level, for public outreach cost primarily associated with Prop 127. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.08 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher depreciation rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and plant additions.
Pension and other postretirement benefits and non-service credits increased pretax income by approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns and the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018.
Lastly, the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform was positively offset by a lower effective tax rate. The net impact of federal corporate tax cuts in the quarter was a $0.14 per share benefit to net income.
Turning now to Arizona's economy, customer growth and sales growth. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average, as shown in the top panel of Slide 5. Through August, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 3.1% compared to 1.6% of the entire U.S. Job growth is particularly strong in the construction sector, a sign of strength in the area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Construction employment has increased by 10.4% versus 2017. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial development.
The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward postrecession trend, as shown in the lower panel of Slide 5. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average. 
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.6% in the third quarter of 2018. We expect this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place, and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country's fastest-growing large metropolitan areas.
As I mentioned earlier, net sales were up 1.2% in the quarter. Commercial and industrial sales increased 2.3% over the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the positive economic growth trends we have seen in the region.
Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On August 9, 2018, APS issued $300 million of 30-year 4.20% unsecured senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had approximately $128 million of short-term debt outstanding. Later this year, we expect to infuse up to $150 million of equity capital from Pinnacle West into APS.
Turning to guidance. As shown on Slide 6, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. While we benefited from a hot September, we also had a very mild October. We expect October weather will negatively impact the full year 2018 earnings by approximately $0.10 to  $0.15 per share. Offsetting [ drivers ] to our 2018 guidance can be found on the appendix to our slides. 
Before I introduce 2019 guidance, I would like to confirm that we do not intend to file a rate review request in 2019. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order prohibited APS from filing a new general rate review before June 1 of 2019. After reviewing our financial expectations, we have determined that filing a rate review in mid-2020 will meet our financial objectives. In preparation for this filing, we expect to keep our capital structure similar to the level approved in our last rate review.
Continuing with guidance, we're introducing 2019 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Positive drivers for 2019 include the anticipated Four Corners' SCR revenue increase, higher weather-normalized sales, higher transmission revenue, flat to lower interest expense and lower operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower planned outages and our continued cost management. We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher D&A related to more plant in service, higher property taxes and lower AFUDC. 
The estimated effective tax rate of 10% for 2019 reflects the amortization of $71 million of excess deferred taxes associated with the second TEAM filing. The decrease in the effective tax rate is offset by the proposed $86.5 million refund to customers, which is also part of the second TEAM filing. Our 2019 capital expenditure forecast remains at $1.15 billion. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and rate base on our fourth quarter call.
A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2018 and 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2020, and we still expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% over the same period. 
As we have said, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. However, over the long term, the opportunity to lead Arizona to a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success.
