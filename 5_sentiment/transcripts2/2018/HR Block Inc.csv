We're off to a strong start this tax season and I'm very pleased with our results. Before I jump into the details, let me outline the areas we'll cover on today's call. First, I'll give a brief update on long-term strategy work. Next, I'll provide our perspectives on what we have seen in the industry, followed by our mid-season results. Then I'll talk about our expectations for the second half of the season. And finally, Tony will review our third key financial results and outlook for the fiscal year.
First, let me provide a few thoughts on our strategy. As we discussed on the Q2 earnings call in December, we're taking fresh look at our long-term strategy. While we don't have specifics to share today, I can tell you that our challenge the team to go deeper than we have in the past and to think differently about our business and their delivering. This work would allow us to make informed decisions about the ways to continue to improve our assisted and DIY business and to position us for long-term sustainable growth. We expect to provide an update in late fall.
Turning to the overall industry performance, the latest results from the IRS showed a decline in returns of 0.4% on day-to-day basis through February 23. While better than last year, these results are fairly consistent with what we've seen in the years prior as it is typical to see year-over-year decline on a day-to-day basis at this point in the season.
Consistent with prior years, industry results with February show a shift from assisted to DIY. Early-season filers are you more like made the change tax preparation methods so the shift in their early is typically greater, and then moderate in the second half. Last year, the season ended with an assisted to DIY shift of approximately 40 basis points, which is about half of what the industry experienced the previous few years. At this point in the season, we're seeing a shift consistent with last year.
Based on the early-season results, we continue to expect total federal filings to increase approximately 1% this tax season with industry assisted volumes flat to slightly up, and the remainder of the growth coming from DIY.
Turning to out performance. Our goal for the season was to build on our momentum from last year, continuing to improve the client trajectory. We've brought a more client-centric approach to everything we do, which is focused on 3 areas. One from improving operational excellence. Two, new products and partnerships. And 3, marketing and promotions that drive demand for the H&R Block brand.
In the assisted business, we outpaced the industry in the first half on the strength of our promotions and improved execution. We again offered Refund Advance in free federal 1040EZ, this is the second year for these 2 promotions, which attract new clients and helped us improve retention.
Refund Advance it's an interest-free loan that is especially relevant to early-season filers who PATH faced delays in receiving the refund during the [indiscernible] This has been an extremely competitive season for Refund Advance with multiple tax prep providers, including H&R Block, offering larger loans than in previous years. Given our strong offer in execution, our results were positive and we stabilized EITC clients for the second year in a row in area of significant historical client declines.
While promotions held drives filers to H&R Block, we must exceed their expectations at the office. Our clients are now more engaged in the process and our tax are providing more value-added expertise, including our people like me enhancement, which utilizes machine learning to provide occupation-specific advice for scheduled filers. Additionally, we're offering our clients personalized assessments of the future impact of the new tax law. That many variables in this new law make it difficult for taxpayers to know how they ultimately be affected. Our clients will learn if they would pay more or less under the new tax law, and then determine how to appropriately adjust the withholding. This is a great example of how we are nearly 80,000 tax pros offer value to our clients and provide the personalized advice so many of them need.
Collectively, these efforts have translated into positive assisted results driven by increased retention. Client volumes in line with our expectations, and we achieved early season share gains in the overall assisted category with IRS assisted the files down 3.2% on a day-to-day basis this February 23, and comparable H&R Block volume down just 2.1%. And while we are pleased with these results, we do expect our performance to moderate in the second half.
Turning to DIY, this year marks the second season for our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free. We also strengthen our partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most. Additionally, we continue to make enhancements with improved drag-and-drop and further capture capabilities, making it easier than ever to switch to our product and pre-populated information and tax forms, and we are seeing positive results with our new online products for self-employed filers. These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY driven by new clients. This February 23rd, IRS DIY E-files increased 2.4% on a day-to-day basis and comparable H&R Block volume increased 6.2%.
Now I would like to provide an update on virtual tax, which includes realtime tax per review and our new product, Tax Pro Go. These innovative products have been designed to meet revolving consumer needs and begin to represent the range of ways taxpayers can count on H&R Block whether they went little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between. We launched Tax Pro Review, an improved version of an innovative product previously called Best of Both. This is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from the Peace of Mind of knowing that one of our highly trained experts has identified all available credit and deductions and has also reviewed their return for accuracy.
We also did a soft launch at Tax Pro Go, our virtual assistant offering. This product addresses the needs of consumers who wants assistance but don't want or have time to visit one of our offices. Clients get upfront pricing, upload their documents through the secure MyBlock portal and work virtually with one of our tax pro to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, but focus on Tax Pro Go this year has been understand the client experience in order to optimize the product going forward.
Initial feedback on both products has been positive. We are forming a more comprehensive view of the types of filers who are attracted to these products. And while we don't anticipate the meaning volume of the season, our learnings will assist us in enhancing these products over time.
Now that I've covered early-season results, I'd like to discuss our plan for the second half of the season. Last week, we brought back the Hats off promotion as we look to drive more new clients to the H&R Block brand. Additionally, in order to deliver more valuable, we are partnering with Lending Tree to provide our clients easy access to information that can help them improve their credit and financial health. And in the DIY space, we continue to optimize our product to drive conversion and deliver an exceptional client experience.
In summary, we are pleased with our results so far. Our focus on operational excellence, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotions is driving results, and we remain laser focus on execution for the second half of the season.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results and outlook."

As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our results to midpoint of this tax season.

As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our results to midpoint of this tax season. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, and we are on track to achieve the financial outlook we provided in December.
Before get into the details, as a reminder, we've typically report a loss during the fiscal third quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, third quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $37 million or 8% to $488 million. This is primarily the results of an increase in total U.S. client volumes of 4% through January 31, and planned inflationary increases in net average charge in our safety business.
Turning to expense. Total operating expenses increased $9 million or 2% to $586 million primarily due to increased compensation cost, which were partially offset by the timing of marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in compensation is due to variable labor related to revenue increases in the U.S. as well as planned conversion of higher cost contract -- contractors to lower-cost full time associates.
As Jeff mentioned, we saw positive results from Refund Advance this season. When the program ended on February 28, applications for Refund Advance totaled $1.2 million, a 14% increase over last year. Among the average loan amount increased 40% due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier, we were able to maintain the cost per loan at the cost approximately the same level of last year.
Moving through the remainder of the income statement. We saw interest expense decreased $1 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. Putting it altogether, pretax loss from continuing operations improved by $30 million. However, loss per share increased $0.67 from $0.49 to $1.16, solely due to changes to the company's effective tax rate resulting from the recently enacted federal tax legislation. The negative impact on these corporate tax rate changes was anticipated and is unique to our fiscal third quarter as the impact will be favorable on a fiscal year basis. We now expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 6% to 9%, which is an update to the range provided in our previously filed 8-K in January. For fiscal '19 and beyond, our effective tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 25% range. As a reminder, we don't anticipate any unpack to our core bases in fiscal '18 from the recent changes to individual taxes. We will offer more clarity on the potential impact of these changes on our core business when we provide our fiscal '19 outlook in December.
Turning to discontinued operations. Same [indiscernible] corporation made settlement payments of $4.5 million in the quarter, which were previously accrued and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal '16. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC filings. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is, and always has been, operated and separately from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil-piercing arguments.
I'd now like to provide thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal '18. Overall, we expect results to be in line with the outlook we provided in December. In assisted, we continue to expect improvement on our client trajectory driven by promotional offers in client experience enhancements, and we are on track to deliver moderate inflationary price increases as outlined in December.
In DIY, we anticipate growth in planed volumes with net average charge consistent with fiscal '17. The net result is that we continue to expect overall revenue to increase modestly this year. Considering the revenue projection and the impact of inflationary costs and investments, we continue to expect EBITDA margin at the high end of the 27% to 30% range. With respect to the capital allocation, consistent with the message we shared on our Q2 call regarding share repurchases, we did not repurchase any shares in Q3. No significant share repurchases are planned for the remainder of fiscal '18.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

We're off to a strong start this tax season and I'm very pleased with our results. Before I jump into the details, let me outline the areas we'll cover on today's call. First, I'll give a brief update on our long-term strategy work. Next, I'll provide our perspectives on what we have seen in the industry, followed by our mid-season results. Then I'll talk about our expectations for the second half of the season. And finally, Tony will review our third quarter financial results and outlook for the fiscal year.
First, let me provide a few thoughts on our strategy. As we discussed on our Q2 earnings call in December, we're taking a fresh look at our long-term strategy. While we don't have specifics to share today, I can tell you that I've challenged the team to go deeper than we have in the past and to think differently about our business. And they're delivering. This work will allow us to make informed decisions about ways to continue to improve our assisted and DIY business and to position us for long-term sustainable growth. We expect to provide an update in late fall.
Turning to the overall industry performance, the latest results from the IRS showed decline in returns of 0.4% on a day-to-day basis through February 23. While better than last year, these results are fairly consistent with what we've seen in the years prior as it is typical to see year-over-year decline on a day-to-day basis at this point in the season.  
Consistent with prior years, industry results from February show a shift from assisted to DIY. Early season filers are more likely to change tax preparation methods so the shift in the early season is typically greater, and then moderates in the second half. Last year, the season ended with an assisted to DIY shift of approximately 40 basis points, which is about half of what the industry experienced the previous few years. At this point in the season, we're seeing a shift consistent with last year.
Based on the early season results, we continue to expect total federal filings to increase approximately 1% this tax season, with industry-assisted volumes flat to slightly up, and the remainder of the growth coming from DIY.
Turning to our performance. Our goal for the season was to build on our momentum from last year, continuing to improve the client trajectory. We've brought a more client-centric approach to everything we do, which is focused on 3 areas. One, improving operational excellence. Two, new products and partnerships. And three, marketing and promotions that drive demand for the H&R Block brand.
In the assisted business, we outpaced the industry in the first half on the strength of our promotions and improved execution. We again offered Refund Advance in free federal 1040EZ, this is the second year for these 2 promotions, which attract new clients and help us improve retention.
Refund Advance is an interest-free loan that is especially relevant to early season filers who faced delays in receiving the refunds due to the PATH Act. This has been an extremely competitive season for Refund Advance, with multiple tax prep providers, including H&R Block, offering larger loans than in previous years. Given our strong offer and execution, our results were positive and we stabilized EITC clients for the second year in a row in area of significant historical client declines.
While promotions helps drives filers to H&R Block, we must exceed their expectations at the office. Our clients are now more engaged in the process and our tax pros are providing more value-added expertise, including our people like me enhancement, which utilizes machine learning to provide occupation-specific advice for Schedule C filers. Additionally, we're offering our clients personalized assessments of the future impact of the new tax law. That many variables in this new law make it difficult for taxpayers to know how they will ultimately be affected. Our clients will learn if they would pay more or less under the new tax law, and then determine how to appropriately adjust their withholding. This is a great example of how our nearly 80,000 tax pros offer value to our clients and provide the personalized advice so many of them need.
Collectively, these efforts have translated into positive assisted results driven by increased retention. Client volume is in line with our expectations and we achieved early season share gains in the overall assisted category, with IRS-assisted e-files down 3.2% on a day-to-day basis this February 23, and comparable H&R Block volume down just 2.1%. And while we were pleased with these results, we do expect our performance to moderate in the second half.
Turning to DIY, this year marks the second season for our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free. We also strengthened our partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most. Additionally, we continue to make enhancements with improved drag-and-drop and further capture capabilities, making it easier than ever to switch to our product and pre-populated information in tax forms, and we're seeing positive results with our new online product for self-employed filers. These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY, driven by new clients. This February 23, IRS DIY e-files increased 2.4% on a day-to-day basis and comparable H&R Block volume increased 6.2%.
Now I would like to provide an update on virtual tax, which includes redesigned Tax Pro Review and our new product, Tax Pro Go. These innovative products have been designed to meet evolving consumer needs and begin to represent the range of ways taxpayers can count on H&R Block, whether they went little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between. We launched Tax Pro Review, an improved version of an innovative product previously called Best of Both. This is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from the peace of mind of knowing that one of our highly trained experts has identified all available credit and deductions and has also reviewed their return for accuracy.
We also did a soft launch of Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering. This product addresses the needs of consumers who wants assistance but don't want or have time to visit one of our offices. Clients get upfront pricing, upload their documents through the secure MyBlock portal and work virtually with one of our tax pros to have their taxes seamlessly prepared. The focus on Tax Pro Go this year has been to understand the client experience in order to optimize the product going forward.
Initial feedback on both products has been positive. We are forming a more comprehensive view of the types of filers who are attracted to these products. And while we don't anticipate a meaningful volume lift this season, our learnings will assist us in enhancing these products over time.
Now that I've covered early season results, I'd like to discuss our plan for the second half of the season. Last week, we brought back the half off promotion as we look to drive more new clients to the H&R Block brand. Additionally, in order to deliver more value, we are partnering with Lending Tree to provide our clients easy access to information that can help them improve their credit and financial health. And in the DIY space, we continue to optimize our product to drive conversion and deliver an exceptional client experience.
In summary, we are pleased with our results so far. Our focus on operational excellence, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotions is driving results, and we remain laser-focused on execution for the second half of the season.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results and outlook."

As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our results with the midpoint of this tax season.

As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our results with the midpoint of this tax season. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, and we are on track to achieve the financial outlook we provided in December.
Before I get into the details, as a reminder, we'd typically report a loss during the fiscal third quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, third quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $37 million or 8% to $488 million. This is primarily the result of an increase in total U.S. client volumes of 4% through January 31, and planned inflationary increases and net average charge in our assisted business.
Turning to expense. Total operating expenses increased $9 million or 2% to $586 million, primarily due to increased compensation cost, which were partially offset by the timing of marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in compensation was due to variable labor related to revenue increases in the U.S. as well as planned conversion of higher-cost contractors to lower-cost full time associates.
As Jeff mentioned, we saw positive results from Refund Advance this season. When the program ended on February 28, applications for Refund Advance totaled 1.2 million, a 14% increase over last year. And while the average loan amount increased 40% due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier, we were able to maintain the cost per loan at approximately the same level as last year.
Moving through the remainder of the income statement. We saw interest expense decrease $1 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. Putting it altogether, pretax loss from continuing operations improved by $30 million. However, loss per share increased $0.67 from $0.49 to $1.16, solely due to changes in the company's effective tax rate resulting from the recently enacted federal tax legislation. The negative impact from these corporate tax rate changes was anticipated and is unique to our fiscal third quarter as the impact will be favorable on a fiscal year basis. We now expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 6% to 9%, which is an update to the range provided in our previously filed 8-K in January. For fiscal '19 and beyond, our effective tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 25% range. As a reminder, we don't anticipate any impact to our core business in fiscal '18 from the recent changes to individual taxes. We will offer more clarity on the potential impact of these changes on our core business when we provide our fiscal '19 outlook in December.
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon Corporation made settlement payments of $4.5 million in the quarter, which were previously accrued and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal '16. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC filings. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is, and always has been, operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil-piercing arguments.
I'd now like to provide thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal '18. Overall, we expect results to be in line with the outlook we provided in December. In assisted, we continue to expect improvement in our client trajectory, driven by promotional offers and client experience enhancements, and we are on track to deliver moderate inflationary price increases, as outlined in December.
In DIY, we anticipate growth in client volumes with net average charge consistent with fiscal '17. The net result is that we continue to expect overall revenue to increase modestly this year. Considering the revenue projection and the impact of inflationary costs and investments, we continue to expect EBITDA margin at the high end of the 27% to 30% range. With respect to capital allocation, consistent with the message we shared on our Q2 call regarding share repurchases, we did not repurchase any shares in Q3. No significant share repurchases are planned for the remainder of fiscal '18.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

We're off to a strong start this tax season and I'm very pleased with our results. Before I jump into the details, let me outline the areas we'll cover on today's call. First, I'll give a brief update on our long-term strategy work. Next, I'll provide our perspectives on what we have seen in the industry, followed by our mid-season results. Then I'll talk about our expectations for the second half of the season. And finally, Tony will review our third quarter financial results and outlook for the fiscal year.
First, let me provide a few thoughts on our strategy. As we discussed on our Q2 earnings call in December, we're taking a fresh look at our long-term strategy. While we don't have specifics to share today, I can tell you that I've challenged the team to go deeper than we have in the past and to think differently about our business. And they're delivering. This work will allow us to make informed decisions about ways to continue to improve our assisted and DIY business and to position us for long-term sustainable growth. We expect to provide an update in late fall.
Turning to the overall industry performance, the latest results from the IRS showed decline in returns of 0.4% on a day-to-day basis through February 23. While better than last year, these results are fairly consistent with what we've seen in the years prior as it is typical to see year-over-year decline on a day-to-day basis at this point in the season.  
Consistent with prior years, industry results from February show a shift from assisted to DIY. Early season filers are more likely to change tax preparation methods so the shift in the early season is typically greater, and then moderates in the second half. Last year, the season ended with an assisted to DIY shift of approximately 40 basis points, which is about half of what the industry experienced the previous few years. At this point in the season, we're seeing a shift consistent with last year.
Based on the early season results, we continue to expect total federal filings to increase approximately 1% this tax season, with industry-assisted volumes flat to slightly up, and the remainder of the growth coming from DIY.
Turning to our performance. Our goal for the season was to build on our momentum from last year, continuing to improve the client trajectory. We've brought a more client-centric approach to everything we do, which is focused on 3 areas: one, improving operational excellence; two, new products and partnerships; and three, marketing and promotions that drive demand for the H&R Block brand.
In the assisted business, we outpaced the industry in the first half on the strength of our promotions and improved execution. We again offered Refund Advance in free federal 1040EZ, this is the second year for these 2 promotions, which attract new clients and help us improve retention.
Refund Advance is an interest-free loan that is especially relevant to early season filers who faced delays in receiving the refunds due to the PATH Act. This has been an extremely competitive season for Refund Advance, with multiple tax prep providers, including H&R Block, offering larger loans than in previous years. Given our strong offer and execution, our results were positive and we stabilized EITC clients for the second year in a row in area of significant historical client declines.
While promotions helps drive filers to H&R Block, we must exceed their expectations at the office. Our clients are now more engaged in the process and our tax pros are providing more value-added expertise, including our people like me enhancement, which utilizes machine learning to provide occupation-specific advice for Schedule C filers. Additionally, we're offering our clients personalized assessments of the future impact of the new tax law. That many variables in this new law make it difficult for taxpayers to know how they will ultimately be affected. Our clients will learn if they would pay more or less under the new tax law, and then determine how to appropriately adjust their withholding. This is a great example of how our nearly 80,000 tax pros offer value to our clients and provide the personalized advice so many of them need.
Collectively, these efforts have translated into positive assisted results driven by increased retention. Client volume is in line with our expectations and we achieved early season share gains in the overall assisted category, with IRS-assisted e-files down 3.2% on a day-to-day basis this February 23, and comparable H&R Block volume down just 2.1%. And while we were pleased with these results, we do expect our performance to moderate in the second half.
Turning to DIY, this year marks the second season for our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free. We also strengthened our partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most. Additionally, we continue to make enhancements with improved drag-and-drop and further capture capabilities, making it easier than ever to switch to our product and pre-populated information in tax forms, and we're seeing positive results with our new online product for self-employed filers. These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY, driven by new clients. This February 23, IRS DIY e-files increased 2.4% on a day-to-day basis and comparable H&R Block volume increased 6.2%.
Now I would like to provide an update on virtual tax, which includes redesigned Tax Pro Review and our new product, Tax Pro Go. These innovative products have been designed to meet evolving consumer needs and begin to represent the range of ways taxpayers can count on H&R Block, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between. We launched Tax Pro Review, an improved version of an innovative product previously called Best of Both. This is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from the peace of mind of knowing that one of our highly trained experts has identified all available credits and deductions and has also reviewed their return for accuracy.
We also did a soft launch of Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering. This product addresses the needs of consumers who want assistance but don't want or have time to visit one of our offices. Clients get upfront pricing, upload their documents through the secure MyBlock portal and work virtually with one of our tax pros to have their taxes seamlessly prepared. The focus on Tax Pro Go this year has been to understand the client experience in order to optimize the product going forward.
Initial feedback on both products has been positive. We are forming a more comprehensive view of the types of filers who are attracted to these products. And while we don't anticipate a meaningful volume lift this season, our learnings will assist us in enhancing these products over time.
Now that I've covered early season results, I'd like to discuss our plans for the second half of the season. Last week, we brought back the half off promotion as we look to drive more new clients to the H&R Block brand. Additionally, in order to deliver more value, we are partnering with Lending Tree to provide our clients easy access to information that can help them improve their credit and financial health. And in the DIY space, we continue to optimize our product to drive conversion and deliver an exceptional client experience.
In summary, we are pleased with our results so far. Our focus on operational excellence, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotions is driving results, and we remain laser-focused on execution for the second half of the season.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results and outlook."

As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our results through the midpoint of this tax season. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, and we are on track to achieve the financial outloo",714,"Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our results through the midpoint of this tax season. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, and we are on track to achieve the financial outlook we provided in December.
Before I get into the details, as a reminder, we'd typically report a loss during the fiscal third quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, third quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $37 million or 8% to $488 million. This is primarily the result of an increase in total U.S. client volumes of 4% through January 31, and planned inflationary increases and net average charge in our assisted business.
Turning to expense. Total operating expenses increased $9 million or 2% to $586 million, primarily due to increased compensation cost, which were partially offset by the timing of marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in compensation was due to variable labor related to revenue increases in the U.S. as well as planned conversion of higher-cost contractors to lower-cost full time associates.
As Jeff mentioned, we saw positive results from Refund Advance this season. When the program ended on February 28, applications for Refund Advance totaled 1.2 million, a 14% increase over last year. And while the average loan amount increased 40% due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier, we were able to maintain the cost per loan at approximately the same level as last year.
Moving through the remainder of the income statement. We saw interest expense decrease $1 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. Putting it all together, pretax loss from continuing operations improved by $30 million. However, loss per share increased $0.67 from $0.49 to $1.16, solely due to changes in the company's effective tax rate resulting from the recently enacted federal tax legislation. The negative impact from these corporate tax rate changes was anticipated and is unique to our fiscal third quarter as the impact will be favorable on a fiscal year basis. We now expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 6% to 9%, which is an update to the range provided in our previously filed 8-K in January. For fiscal '19 and beyond, our effective tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 25% range. As a reminder, we don't anticipate any impact to our core business in fiscal '18 from the recent changes to individual taxes. We will offer more clarity on the potential impact of these changes on our core business when we provide our fiscal '19 outlook in December.
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon Corporation made settlement payments of $4.5 million in the quarter, which were previously accrued and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal '16. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC filings. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is, and always has been, operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil-piercing arguments.
I'd now like to provide thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal '18. Overall, we expect results to be in line with the outlook we provided in December. In assisted, we continue to expect improvement in our client trajectory, driven by our promotional offers and client experience enhancements, and we are on track to deliver moderate inflationary price increases, as outlined in December.
In DIY, we anticipate growth in client volumes with net average charge consistent with fiscal '17. The net result is that we continue to expect overall revenue to increase modestly this year. Considering the revenue projection and the impact of inflationary costs and investments, we continue to expect EBITDA margin at the high end of the 27% to 30% range. With respect to capital allocation, consistent with the message we shared on our Q2 call regarding share repurchases, we did not repurchase any shares in Q3. No significant share repurchases are planned for the remainder of fiscal '18.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

Tax Pro Review, it's a redesigned product from Best of Both. Tax Pro Go, brand-new. Tax Pro Review, we're marketing. Tax Pro Go, we're not. And in both cases, we're really trying to understand more about the kind of clients that we attract and more about the user experience, just trying to keep it as easy as possible for people who engage with us on whatever terms they choose to engage. So not large volume contributors this year but really important products in the portfolio, and we're getting some very positive learning that I expect us to integrate and improve for what we do next."

Refund Advance, for example, is additional value that we're delivering to that early season client who wants a refund quickly. It's a no cost, no fee loan. And there's definitely been a change in trajectory for those clients. But we know we've got to be nimble from a pricing perspective. We've got to figure out places where we're not bringing in enough new clients or incremental clients and think about how do we adjust our pricing model going forward. So it's definitely a living, breathing thing, but we feel good that we made significant progress over the last couple of years with changing our client trajectory."

We're off to a strong start this tax season and I'm very pleased with our results. Before I jump into the details, let me outline the areas we'll cover on today's call. First, I'll give a brief update on our long-term strategy work. Next, I'll provide our perspectives on what we have seen in the industry, followed by our mid-season results. Then I'll talk about our expectations for the second half of the season. And finally, Tony will review our third quarter financial results and outlook for the fiscal year.
First, let me provide a few thoughts on our strategy. As we discussed on our Q2 earnings call in December, we're taking a fresh look at our long-term strategy. While we don't have specifics to share today, I can tell you that I've challenged the team to go deeper than we have in the past and to think differently about our business. And they're delivering. This work will allow us to make informed decisions about ways to continue to improve our assisted and DIY business and to position us for long-term sustainable growth. We expect to provide an update in late fall.
Turning to the overall industry performance. The latest results from the IRS showed decline in returns of 0.4% on a day-to-day basis through February 23. While better than last year, these results are fairly consistent with what we've seen in the years prior as it is typical to see year-over-year decline on a day-to-day basis at this point in the season. 
Consistent with prior years, industry results from February show a shift from assisted to DIY. Early season filers are more likely to change tax preparation methods so the shift in the early season is typically greater, and then moderates in the second half. Last year, the season ended with an assisted to DIY shift of approximately 40 basis points, which is about half of what the industry experienced the previous few years. At this point in the season, we're seeing a shift consistent with last year.
Based on the early season results, we continue to expect total federal filings to increase approximately 1% this tax season, with industry-assisted volumes flat to slightly up, and the remainder of the growth coming from DIY.
Turning to our performance. Our goal for the season was to build on our momentum from last year, continuing to improve the client trajectory. We've brought a more client-centric approach to everything we do, which is focused on 3 areas: one, improving operational excellence; two, new products and partnerships; and three, marketing and promotions that drive demand for the H&R Block brand.
In the assisted business, we outpaced the industry in the first half on the strength of our promotions and improved execution. We again offered Refund Advance in free federal 1040EZ, this is the second year for these 2 promotions, which attract new clients and help us improve retention.
Refund Advance is an interest-free loan that is especially relevant to early season filers who faced delays in receiving the refunds due to the PATH Act. This has been an extremely competitive season for Refund Advance, with multiple tax prep providers, including H&R Block, offering larger loans than in previous years. Given our strong offer and execution, our results were positive and we stabilized EITC clients for the second year in a row in area of significant historical client declines.
While promotions helps drive filers to H&R Block, we must exceed their expectations at the office. Our clients are now more engaged in the process and our tax pros are providing more value-added expertise, including our people like me enhancement, which utilizes machine learning to provide occupation-specific advice for Schedule C filers. Additionally, we're offering our clients personalized assessments of the future impact of the new tax law. That many variables in this new law make it difficult for taxpayers to know how they will ultimately be affected. Our clients will learn if they would pay more or less under the new tax law, and then determine how to appropriately adjust their withholding. This is a great example of how our nearly 80,000 tax pros offer value to our clients and provide the personalized advice so many of them need.
Collectively, these efforts have translated into positive assisted results driven by increased retention. Client volume is in line with our expectations and we achieved early season share gains in the overall assisted category, with IRS-assisted e-files down 3.2% on a day-to-day basis this February 23, and comparable H&R Block volume down just 2.1%. And while we were pleased with these results, we do expect our performance to moderate in the second half.
Turning to DIY. This year marks the second season for our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free. We also strengthened our partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most. Additionally, we continue to make enhancements with improved drag-and-drop and further capture capabilities, making it easier than ever to switch to our product and pre-populated information in tax forms, and we're seeing positive results with our new online product for self-employed filers. These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY, driven by new clients. This February 23, IRS DIY e-files increased 2.4% on a day-to-day basis and comparable H&R Block volume increased 6.2%.
Now I would like to provide an update on virtual tax, which includes redesigned Tax Pro Review and our new product, Tax Pro Go. These innovative products have been designed to meet evolving consumer needs and begin to represent the range of ways taxpayers can count on H&R Block, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between. We launched Tax Pro Review, an improved version of an innovative product previously called Best of Both. This is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from the peace of mind of knowing that one of our highly trained experts has identified all available credits and deductions and has also reviewed their return for accuracy.
We also did a soft launch of Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering. This product addresses the needs of consumers who want assistance but don't want or have time to visit one of our offices. Clients get upfront pricing, upload their documents through the secure MyBlock portal and work virtually with one of our tax pros to have their taxes seamlessly prepared. The focus on Tax Pro Go this year has been to understand the client experience in order to optimize the product going forward.
Initial feedback on both products has been positive. We are forming a more comprehensive view of the types of filers who are attracted to these products. And while we don't anticipate a meaningful volume lift this season, our learnings will assist us in enhancing these products over time.
Now that I've covered early season results, I'd like to discuss our plans for the second half of the season. Last week, we brought back the half off promotion as we look to drive more new clients to the H&R Block brand. Additionally, in order to deliver more value, we are partnering with Lending Tree to provide our clients easy access to information that can help them improve their credit and financial health. And in the DIY space, we continue to optimize our product to drive conversion and deliver an exceptional client experience.
In summary, we are pleased with our results so far. Our focus on operational excellence, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotions is driving results, and we remain laser-focused on execution for the second half of the season.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our financial results and outlook."

As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our results through the midpoint of this tax season. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, and we are on track to achieve the financial outloo",714,"Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with our results through the midpoint of this tax season. Our third quarter financial results were in line with our expectations, and we are on track to achieve the financial outlook we provided in December.
Before I get into the details, as a reminder, we'd typically report a loss during the fiscal third quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, third quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $37 million or 8% to $488 million. This is primarily the result of an increase in total U.S. client volumes of 4% through January 31, and planned inflationary increases and net average charge in our assisted business.
Turning to expense. Total operating expenses increased $9 million or 2% to $586 million, primarily due to increased compensation cost, which were partially offset by the timing of marketing and advertising expenses. The increase in compensation was due to variable labor related to revenue increases in the U.S. as well as planned conversion of higher-cost contractors to lower-cost full time associates.
As Jeff mentioned, we saw positive results from Refund Advance this season. When the program ended on February 28, applications for Refund Advance totaled 1.2 million, a 14% increase over last year. And while the average loan amount increased 40% due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier, we were able to maintain the cost per loan at approximately the same level as last year.
Moving through the remainder of the income statement. We saw interest expense decrease $1 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. Putting it all together, pretax loss from continuing operations improved by $30 million. However, loss per share increased $0.67 from $0.49 to $1.16, solely due to changes in the company's effective tax rate resulting from the recently enacted federal tax legislation. The negative impact from these corporate tax rate changes was anticipated and is unique to our fiscal third quarter as the impact will be favorable on a fiscal year basis. We now expect our fiscal year effective tax rate to be in the range of 6% to 9%, which is an update to the range provided in our previously filed 8-K in January. For fiscal '19 and beyond, our effective tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 25% range. As a reminder, we don't anticipate any impact to our core business in fiscal '18 from the recent changes to individual taxes. We will offer more clarity on the potential impact of these changes on our core business when we provide our fiscal '19 outlook in December.
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon Corporation made settlement payments of $4.5 million in the quarter, which were previously accrued and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal '16. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q and other SEC filings. As a reminder, Sand Canyon is, and always has been, operated as a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We continue to believe our legal position is strong on any potential veil-piercing arguments.
I'd now like to provide thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal '18. Overall, we expect results to be in line with the outlook we provided in December. In assisted, we continue to expect improvement in our client trajectory, driven by our promotional offers and client experience enhancements, and we are on track to deliver moderate inflationary price increases, as outlined in December.
In DIY, we anticipate growth in client volumes with net average charge consistent with fiscal '17. The net result is that we continue to expect overall revenue to increase modestly this year. Considering the revenue projection and the impact of inflationary costs and investments, we continue to expect EBITDA margin at the high end of the 27% to 30% range. With respect to capital allocation, consistent with the message we shared on our Q2 call regarding share repurchases, we did not repurchase any shares in Q3. No significant share repurchases are planned for the remainder of fiscal '18.
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

We've got to figure out places where we're not bringing in enough new clients or incremental clients and think about how do we adjust our pricing model going forward.

We have a lot to cover so let me outline the 3 areas we'll talk about today. First, I'll share my perspective on the tax season and our results. I'll then give an update on the enterprise strategy work, including key opportunities for improvement and the 5 pillars that will guide us over the next several years. I'll then highlight some of the strategic initiatives for 2019. Finally, Tony will review our 2018 financial results and we'll provide results on our outlook for fiscal '19.
Let me begin by looking back at tax season '18, starting with overall industry. Total U.S. return growth was approximately 1.5%, as expected, with assisted returns growing 0.5% and DIY returns increasing 2.5%. Consistent with prior years, industry results show a slight shift from assisted to DIY. However, like last year, it was moderate. We estimate the shift was only 40 to 50 basis points, which is less than the average over the last several years. This moderation is likely due to the IRS's great work to crack down on fraud in the system and confirms what we hear from a large percentage of the tax population that they turned the tax pros at H&R Block for health because they want to ensure they're getting all they deserve, and they want someone they can count on should questions arise. We continue to see the primary driver in choosing a method is the individual's confidence with taxes, not the complexity of their tax situation.
Turning to H&R Block, our goal for the season was to build on our momentum from 2017 by continuing to improve the client trajectory, and we achieved that goal. We outperformed the market and took share overall and in the DIY category, and we delivered improve the results in assisted. As I shared in December, we focused on 3 areas. Improving operational execution, new products and partnerships and the marketing and promotion that drive demand from the H&R Block brand.
In the assisted business, we saw improved performance driven by client retention and well executed promotions. U.S. assisted volumes declined 60 basis points compared to a 2.5% decline last year, and a 6% decline the year before. Retention continue to improve, increasing 65 basis points to 73% as our clients continue to see the benefit of the health our tax pros provide.
Regarding new clients, while we didn't see the growth we wanted, we continue to see millennials turning to H&R Block with over half of our new assisted clients under 35 years old. And from an overall mix and pricing perspective, our net average charge grew 2%, was translated to growth in assisted revenues, as expected. As a great example of how our tax pros help clients, this season, we offered personalized assessments of the future impact of the new tax law. Our clients learned whether they would have paid more or less if the new tax law had been in effect for 2017, which helped them determine how to appropriately adjust their withholdings for 2018. We know, due to lower withholdings, is like in many consumers will now receive lower refunds, and they can turn to us throughout the year with any questions they have.
Turning to DIY. We achieved outstanding client growth overall and we believe several factors contributed to this performance. Importantly, we've made significant improvements to the user experience and are making it easier than ever to pre-populate information from tax forms and switch to H&R Block. These changes are being recognized and our products continue to receive accolades and third-party reviews. We're also doing more to ensure that consumers know H&R Block do-it-yourself is a great alternative to others in the industry. A strong product, great value and consumer awareness is a winning combination we will continue to improve and deliver.
This tax season, we introduced the new online product for self-employed filers and partnered that with Stride to make it easier to track expenses and lower their tax bills. We also strengthened existing partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most, including Walmart and Amazon. Additionally, clients continue to see the value in our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free. These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY. We saw an 11% increase in new clients, and nearly 200 basis-point increase in online conversion and an over 20% increase in the use of mobile. The net result is an increase in total DIY clients of 8% driven by online growth of 10%.
Let me now the key strength of H&R Block is being to able to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company, whether they know little to no help complete in-person assistance or anything in between. This is why we stayed excited about the possibility of H&R Block tax pro go and our redesigned Tax Pro Review products. By developing the technology platform to enable our large trusted network of tax professionals to serve clients virtually, we leverage a major asset in new ways and create an experience for consumers that gives them ultimate choice. Initial feedbacks from clients has been positive and our learnings will future offerings to enable clients to start and finish the return using whatever channel or method they prefer.
The strong performance across the H&R Block portfolio translated to positive results. Overall, U.S. clients grew 2.5%, and total revenues increased 4%. EBITDA margin was at the high end of our guidance ranges and earnings per share increased $1.02 to $2.98. Of this increase, $0.85 was due to a lower corporate tax rate resulting from the recently passed tax legislation. Tony will cover this in more detail.
In summary, we are pleased with our results. Our focus on operational execution, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotion help drive these results and will inform our plan as we look to fiscal '19. I'd like to now shift gears and provide an update on the enterprise strategy work that's underway. When I joined Block, I challenged the team to go deeper than we have in the past and to think differently about our business. Over the last 6 months, we've taken an objective and analytical look at every aspect of our business as well as the consumer trends and truce will inform our future plans. We've taken an inventory of our strategic assets, those tangible and intangible Ottomans of H&R Block that can be more fully leveraged. And we reviewed nearly 2 decades of history to gain a very clear picture of where we've been what we've got then right and wrong along the way.
Our work has confirmed that while we have a trusted brand, we have opportunities in, which we can improve such as brand relevance and new client growth. By addressing these opportunities from our current position of strength, we are setting a company up to achieve sustainable growth over time.
We came out of fiscal '18 with a large client base in 2 straight years of improved results in both our assisted and DIY businesses. Our client retention is very strong, the new client growth is not where we wanted to be. We have the opportunity to improve to do greater differentiation, a stronger value proposition and ensuring the client experience is delivered seamlessly and consistently across all our channels. We continue to be the only tax company that can serve clients however they want to be served. This creates opportunity to further improve our cross-channel experience for technology and tax pro's need.
Our financial position is strong with a solid balance sheet and significant cash flows by using the 3 resources wisely with a focus on investing in our business for the long-term, we can position Block for a successful future. And while it's easy to think of us as simply a U.S. tax preparation provider, we currently have a diverse portfolio of products and services, both within and outside the tax event, and across a number of countries. We have opportunities to leverage of these assets even more. For example, we have an emerging X tax business that caters to the taxpayers living abroad through a required to file the U.S. tax returns. Many of our offices are driving growth through bookkeeping and business services. Clients turn to us year round for help resolving issues when they receive a letter from the IRS. And our Tax Plus Suite of products, including among other things, Emerald Advance and Emeralcard, provide opportunities to interact with our customers more than once a year. The strength in opportunities we've identified have informed the framework that will guide us towards sustainable growth over the next several years, which is driven by 5 strategic pillars. Within these 5 pillars are specific initiatives, the tactical work that will occur each year. We expect the initiatives to evolve over time, but the strategic pillars will remain constant to ensure we're taking a multi-year view of our business and will be a guide for how we talk about H&R Block going forward. The first strategic pillar is to elevate our talent and culture. This is simply about investing in our people and ensuring that our leaders are equipped with a training and tools they need to help us deliver the best possible experience for our clients. It's also important culturally to recommit to serving and connecting with communities where we do business, a hallmark of our founders.
Second, we will own a sustainable brand position by delivering compelling value for clients to differentiate and demonstrate why we're the best rates for help. H&R Block is a well-known blend that is trusted in synonymous with tax. And while our strong history has positioned us well, we earn is relevant as we need to be to today's consumer. By differentiating ourselves and demonstrating why we are the best choice for consumers, we will position H&R Block as a modern brand with momentum. Part of this involves making sure our clients see the value they expect for the price they pay. Simply put, we've been too reliant on price to grow revenues, so we're challenging how we think about the value of inflation going forward. Third, we will win on customer experience by leveraging innovation and personalization to give our clients the experience they want. Customer experience is essential across the spectrum from complete in-person assistance to do-it-yourself and everything in between. We are uniquely positioned to meet the needs of consumers regardless of what channel they choose. We are modernizing our capabilities for acquiring and engaging and retaining clients, and we will innovate to develop and scale seamless cross-channel experiences.
Fourth, we will build operational excellence by improving the quality and consistency of execution in our tax office us and across other organization, including simplifying our processes and continually seeking ways to improve.
And finally, we will invest for the long term by modernizing a core technology platform, funding strategic investments and building capabilities that enable growth. Consumer expectations about how they seek and want tell from H&R Block are constantly evolving, and we need consumer-facing products that not only meets but exceeds consumer expectations.
For 2019, we have a number of initiatives that are planned or in process. We will make investments to modernize our key technology platform to enable more innovation and reduce our IT run rate spend over time. Additionally, we'll invest to improve cross-channel client experiences and enhance our marketing and advertising capabilities. We'll improve the service quality and consistency in our offices. This work is in process, and we've already started to making changes, including our decision to consolidated 400 smaller company run offices. This action will help optimize our footprint and enable us to more effectively manage our field operations, elevate our talent and deliver more consistent quality to our clients.
Additionally, we will focus on improving the value proposition by evaluating how we price for tax preparation, taking into account the recent tax legislation. These changes will require an investment in fiscal '19, which Tony will provide more details on in a moment.
Strengthening our value proposition, modernizing key technology platforms, building brand differentiation, delivering cross channel client experiences and focusing on quality and consistent execution are important steps. These investments coming from a position of strength, enable us to deliver sustainable growth over time and ensure the health of H&R Block for the next generation of clients and associates.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our fiscal '18 results and financial outlook."

I'm excited about the work we've done on our enterprise strategy and what it means for the future H&R Block. Through this work, we're taking steps to ensure we can achieve sustainable growth for the long-term.
Before I provide some additional detail on our outlook for fiscal '19, I'll walk through our fiscal '18 results and how we performed against our expectations. Let me start with the objectives that we outlined prior to the tax season and how our performance measured up. With respect to volume and pricing in our assisted business, we expect improvement in the client trajectory and moderate inflationary price increases. We achieved these objectives with the decline in returns of just 0.6% compared to a decline of 2.5% in fiscal '17. Net average charge increased 2%, which was in line with our expectations.
In DIY, we anticipated that increase in client volumes, along with a net average charge consistent with fiscal '17. We outperformed expectations with overall DIY client growth of 8%, including 10% growth in online. Additionally, we delivered a 3% increase in net average charge due to better-than-expected product mix. Overall, we came into the year expecting modest revenue growth, and I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our expectations with revenue increasing 4.1%.
From an earnings perspective, considering our revenue growth projection and the impact of inflationary costs and investments, we expect that EBITDA margin to be at the high end of the 27% to 30% range. Similar to fiscal '17, and expected, we delivered a margin of 29.8%.
In summary, we achieved or exceeded all of our objectives.
With that context, I would loud like to provide additional details on our key financial metrics, starting with the income statement. As I just mentioned, revenue grew 4.1% or $124 million. U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalty together increased $40 million due to increase net average charge and favorable mix, partially offset by the decline and return volumes.
DIY tax increased $24 million to increase return volumes and net average charge, which was due to favorable product mix. Regarding our tax plus products, we saw an increase in net overall peace of mind and tax [indiscernible]. Additionally, we increased the price of refund we increased the price that we fund transfer this year, which led to a $24 million increase in revenue, balanced against our slight tax decline in the tax rate. This was our second year for Refund Advance, applications of Refund Advance increased 14% over last year and the average loan amount increased 45%, due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier. Despite these increases, we are able to keep the total cost of the program flat at approximately $30 million.
International revenues increased $17 million due to favorable results and exchange rates in Australia and Canada. Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses lower rate than revenue increasing $88 million or 3.8%. This was primarily due to our expected increase is on compensation cost related to the increasing revenue, occupancy costs and bad debt expense as well as the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and advertising expenses.
Moving through the remainder of the income statement. We saw an interest expense decrease $3.6 million due to lower draws on our line up credit compared to the prior year. Regarding corporate taxes, fiscal '18 represented a unique year for the 35% statutory rates for the first 8 month of the year, and we generate a loss, and a 21% rate for the final 4 months of the year when we generate a profit. This resulted in a full year effective tax rate of 6.3%. Going forward, we expect an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% for fiscal '19 and beyond. Our solid financial performance, coupled with the unique corporate tax situation, resulted in a 52% increase in EPS from $1.96 in fiscal '17 to $2.98 in fiscal '18. Of the $1.02 increase, $0.85 was due to a lower corporate tax rate resulting from the recent tax legislation.
Turning to discontinued operations. [indiscernible] corporation made several payments of $4.5 million this fiscal year, which were previously accrued and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal '16. For additional information on Sand Canyon come up is free for each of to disclosures in the conference reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.
I'd now provide some initial thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal '19. As Jeff shared, we have developed a multi-year strategic framework to guide us over the next several years and outline of the areas we will be focusing on for fiscal '19.
Historically, we have provided our financial -- our fiscal year outlook on the December earnings call, just prior the beginning of the tax season. This generally included our thoughts on volume and net average charge, along with an EBITDA margin range. Considering the changes planned for next year, including investments in the business as well as the impact of tax legislation, on both the corporate and individual side, we are taking the next step of providing more details than we have historically at this time of the year.
As Jeff mentioned, we are making changes to our pricing structure, which will improve our ability to deliver value in our assisted business and address the impacts of the recent tax legislation. As a result, we currently expect total revenues to be $3.05 million to $3.1 billion in fiscal '19. We will also be making strategic investments in technology as well as operations, including charges related to our office footprint optimization. Digital revenue expedition and these plane investments, EBITDA margin is expected to be 24% to 26% for fiscal '19. As we previously shared, fiscal '18 represented our high watermark for depreciation and amortization as we see the impact of office upgrades and franchise progress several years ago rollout. Thus, we expect D&A to decline in fiscal '19 and be between $170 million and $180 million. As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is CapEx related, but it remains 1/3 is related to acquisitions. We expect CapEx in fiscal '19 to be $95 million to $105 million. Interest expense will be at $80 million to $85 million, and as mentioned earlier, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 25% range.
Regarding capital structure. our solid financial performance this fiscal year, along with the help from the changing corporate tax rates, from free grow strong free cash flow of $751 million, a 62% increase over last year's free cash flow of $463 million. For reference, we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. At the top of the list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs stuck on for our seasonality. We didn't make investments back into the business that we believe deliver value to our clients who drive sustainable growth. Next, we will deploy excess capital to quarterly dividends and share repurchases. These priorities are grounded in our commitment to maintain investment-grade credit rating metrics, an integral part of our financial strategy.
I'm pleased that our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in our dividend to an annual rate of $1 or $0.25 per quarter. This represents a third consecutive year of dividend increases. We remain committed to being quarterly dividend and will continue to perform an annual review of the dividends after each fiscal year. With respect to share repurchases, as we discussed on prior calls, there were no repurchases made in fiscal '18. For fiscal '19, we are adjusting our prior practice and plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants in order to, at the minimum, prevent an increase in our shares outstanding. We believe this it's an important part of our capital allocation and in addition to offsetting equity grants and will continue to be opportunistic in share repurchases going forward. In summary, I'm excited about the changes we are making in the business as we position ourselves for sustainable growth. Without, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

So I don't think about in terms of specific ROI in the short term because none of the things are foundation and capabilities that we need to position us over that longer-term period. As far as client acquisition cost, again, not something that we want to get into today. It's a combination, obviously, of not on the new clients, but also continuing to drive retention we made improvement over the last few years, but was still want to try to increase retention, especially across other various bands. I mean, when we think about our 10-year of new clients all the way to a 10-year-plus client, we still have opportunities to retain more new clients on the second year they come back and see H&R Block. So it's obviously largely new client story, but it's also providing a great service and persistent experience at the desk. We should drive additional retention over the long term."

I think it's grown 4 out of the last 8 years, if my memory serves properly. So we definitely still see viability and growth in the assisted tax preparation business. Now we've improved retention. We extend our client loss, but we believe that a better value proposition and more clear differentiation, leveraging all the assets that make H&R Block the leading tax preparation company gives us opportunity to win back clients who may have defected for some reason, or we attract net new clients who haven't yet tried us. As I mentioned, in my prepared remarks, more of this as we get closer to the season, but little fact that I love seeing that give me optimism for the health of the business are things like the number of millennials who choose H&R Block assisted every year. So one of the things that's become very clear to me is that it's not just about is someone complex or simple, I mean, think about today, 70% of tax filers already take a standard deduction. The majority of tax filers take a standard deduction. While the majority of tax filers also using assisted method today. We know that, that shift from assisted to DIY has moderated in the next couple of years, and we talked about what a couple of those may be. So there's a lot of evidence for us that make us optimistic about better quality and consistency, stronger value proposition, more clear differentiation are all reasons we can get back to growth. And as Tony said, that's revenue growth and new client growth, and we think both of those are important to our future."

We have a lot to cover, so let me outline the 3 areas we'll talk about today. First, I'll share my perspective on the tax season and our results. I'll then give an update on the enterprise strategy work, including key opportunities for improvement and the 5 pillars that will guide us over the next several years. I'll then highlight some of the strategic initiatives for 2019. Finally, Tony will review our 2018 financial results and we'll provide thoughts on our outlook for fiscal '19.
Let me begin by looking back at tax season '18, starting with overall industry. Total U.S. return growth was approximately 1.5%, as expected, with assisted returns growing 0.5% and DIY returns increasing 2.5%. Consistent with prior years, industry results show a slight shift from assisted to DIY. However, like last year, it was moderate. We estimate the shift was only 40 to 50 basis points, which is less than the average over the last several years. This moderation is likely due to the IRS' great work to crack down on fraud in the system, and confirms what we hear from a large percentage of the tax paying population that they turned to Tax Pros at H&R Block for health because they want to ensure they're getting all they deserve, and they want someone they can count on, should questions arise. We continue to see the primary driver in choosing a method is the individual's confidence with taxes, not the complexity of their tax situation.
Turning to H&R Block. Our goal for the season was to build on our momentum from 2017 by continuing to improve the client trajectory, and we achieved that goal. We outperformed the market and took share overall and in the DIY category, and we delivered improved results in Assisted. As I shared in December, we focused on 3 areas: improving operational execution, new products and partnerships, and marketing and promotion that drive demand from the H&R Block brand.
In the Assisted business, we saw improved performance, driven by client retention and well executed promotions. U.S. assisted volumes declined 60 basis points compared to a 2.5% decline last year, and a 6% decline the year before. Retention continue to improve, increasing 65 basis points to 73% as our clients continue to see the benefit of the health our tax pros provide.
Regarding new clients, while we didn't see the growth we wanted, we continue to see millennials turning to H&R Block with over half of our new assisted clients under 35 years old. And from an overall mix and pricing perspective, our net average charge grew 2%, was translated to growth in assisted revenues, as expected. As a great example of how our tax pros help clients, this season, we offered personalized assessments of the future impact of the new tax law. Our clients learned whether they would have paid more or less if the new tax law had been in effect for 2017, which helped them determine how to appropriately adjust their withholdings for 2018. We know, due to lower withholdings, it's like many consumers will now receive lower refunds, and they can turn to us throughout the year with any questions they have.
Turning to DIY. We achieved outstanding client growth overall, and we believe several factors contributed to this performance. Importantly, we've made significant improvements to the user experience, and are making it easier than ever to pre-populate information from tax forms and switch to H&R Block. These changes are being recognized, and our products continue to receive accolades and third-party reviews. We're also doing more to ensure that consumers know H&R Block do-it-yourself is a great alternative to others in the industry. A strong product, great value and consumer awareness is a winning combination we will continue to improve and deliver.
This tax season, we introduced the new online product for self-employed filers, and partnered with Stride to make it easier to track expenses and lower their tax bills. We also strengthened existing partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most, including Walmart and Amazon. Additionally, clients continue to see the value in our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free. These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY. We saw an 11% increase in new clients, and nearly 200 basis-point increase in online conversion and an over 20% increase in the use of mobile. The net result is an increase in total DIY clients of 8%, driven by online growth of 10%.
Let me note that key strength of H&R Block is being to able to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company, whether they want little to no help complete in-person assistance or anything in between. It's why we're still excited about the possibility of H&R Block Tax Pro Go, and our redesigned Tax Pro Review products. By developing the technology platform to enable our large trusted network of tax professionals to serve clients virtually, we leverage a major asset in new ways, and create an experience for consumers that gives them ultimate choice. Initial feedback from clients has been positive and our learnings will shape future innovations and offerings to enable clients to start and finish their return, using whatever channel or method they prefer.
The strong performance across the H&R Block portfolio translated to positive results. Overall, U.S. clients grew 2.5%, and total revenues increased 4%. EBITDA margin was at the high end of our guidance range, and earnings per share increased $1.02 to $2.98. Of this increase, $0.85 was due to a lower corporate tax rate, resulting from the recently passed tax legislation. Tony will cover this in more detail.
In summary, we are pleased with our results. Our focus on operational execution, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotion help drive these results, and will inform our plans as we look to fiscal '19. I'd like to now shift gears, and provide an update on the enterprise strategy work that's underway. When I joined Block, I challenged the team to go deeper than we have in the past and to think differently about our business. Over the last 6 months, we've taken an objective and analytical look at every aspect of our business, as well as the consumer trends and truths that will inform our future plans. We've taken an inventory of our strategic assets, those tangible and intangible elements of H&R Block that can be more fully leveraged, and we reviewed nearly 2 decades of history to gain a very clear picture of where we've been and what we've gotten right and wrong along the way.
Our work has confirmed that while we have a trusted brand, we have opportunities in which we can improve, such as brand relevance and new client growth. By addressing these opportunities from our current position of strength, we're setting the company up to achieve sustainable growth over time.
We came out of fiscal '18 with a large client base in 2 straight years of improved results in both our assisted and DIY businesses. Our client retention is very strong, but new client growth is not where we want it to be. We have the opportunity to improve to do greater differentiation, a stronger value proposition, and ensuring the client experience is delivered seamlessly and consistently across all our channels. We continue to be the only tax company that can serve clients however they want to be served. This creates opportunity to further improve our cross-channel experience for technology in Tax Pros need.
Our financial position is strong with a solid balance sheet and significant cash flows. By using these resources wisely, with a focus on investing in our business for the long-term, we can position Block for a successful future. And while it's easy to think of us as simply a U.S. tax preparation provider, we currently have a diverse portfolio of products and services, both within and outside the tax event, and across a number of countries. We have opportunities to leverage these assets even more. For example, we have an emerging expat business that caters to the taxpayers living abroad who are required to file U.S. tax returns. Many of our offices are driving growth through bookkeeping and business services. Clients turn to us year round for help resolving issues when they receive a letter from the IRS. And our Tax Plus suite of products, including among other things, Emerald Advance and Emerald Card, provide opportunities to interact with our customers more than once a year. The strength and opportunities we've identified have informed the framework that will guide us towards sustainable growth over the next several years, which is driven by 5 strategic pillars. Within these 5 pillars are specific initiatives, the tactical work that will occur each year. We expect the initiatives to evolve over time, but the strategic pillars will remain constant to ensure we're taking a multi-year view of our business, and it will be a guide for how we talk about H&R Block, going forward. The first strategic pillar is to elevate our talent and culture. This is simply about investing in our people, and ensuring that our leaders are equipped with the training and tools they need to help us deliver the best possible experience for our clients. It's also important culturally to recommit to serving and connecting with communities where we do business, the hallmark of our founders.
Second, we will own a sustainable brand position by delivering compelling value for clients to differentiate and demonstrate why we're the best choice for help. H&R Block is a well-known brand that is trusted and synonymous with tax. And while our strong history has positioned us well, we aren't as relevant as we need to be to today's consumer. By differentiating ourselves and demonstrating why we are the best choice for consumers, we will position H&R Block as a modern brand with momentum. Part of this involves making sure our clients see the value they expect for the price they pay. Simply put, we've been too reliant on price to grow revenues, so we're challenging how we think about the value equation, going forward. 
Third, we will win on customer experience by leveraging innovation and personalization to give our clients the experience they want. Customer experience is essential across the spectrum from complete in-person assistance to do-it-yourself and everything in between. We are uniquely positioned to meet the needs of consumers, regardless of what channel they choose. We are modernizing our capabilities for acquiring, engaging and retaining clients, and we will innovate to develop and scale seamless cross-channel experiences.
Fourth, we will build operational excellence by improving the quality and consistency of execution in our tax offices and across other organization, including simplifying our processes and continually seeking ways to improve.
And finally, we will invest for the long term by modernizing a core technology platform, funding strategic investments and building capabilities that enable growth. Consumer expectations about how they seek and want help from H&R Block are constantly evolving, and we need consumer-facing products that not only meets, but exceeds consumer expectations.
For 2019, we have a number of initiatives that are planned or in process. We will make investments to modernize our key technology platform to enable more innovation and reduce our IT run rate spend over time. Additionally, we'll invest to improve cross-channel client experiences, and enhance our marketing and advertising capabilities. We'll improve the service quality and consistency in our offices. This work is in process, and we've already started to make some changes, including our decision to consolidate 400 smaller company-run offices. This action will help optimize our footprint, and enable us to more effectively manage our field operations, elevate our talent and deliver more consistent quality to our clients.
Additionally, we will focus on improving the value proposition by evaluating how we price for tax preparation, taking into account the recent tax legislation. These changes will require an investment in fiscal '19, which Tony will provide more details on in a moment.
Strengthening our value proposition, modernizing key technology platforms, building brand differentiation, delivering cross channel client experiences and focusing on quality and consistent execution are important steps. These investments, coming from a position of strength, enable us to deliver sustainable growth over time, and ensure the health of H&R Block for the next generation of clients and associates.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our fiscal '18 results and financial outlook."

I'm excited about the work we've done on our enterprise strategy and what it means for the future of H&R Block. Through this work, we are taking the steps to ensure we can achieve sustainable growth for the long term.
Before I provide some additional detail on our outlook for fiscal '19, I'll walk through our fiscal '18 results and how we performed against our expectations. Let me start with the objectives that we outlined prior to the tax season and how our performance measured up. With respect to volume and pricing in our Assisted business, we expect an improvement in the client trajectory and moderate inflationary price increases. We achieved these objectives with the decline in returns of just 0.6% compared to a decline of 2.5% in fiscal '17. Net average charge increased 2%, which was in line with our expectations.
In DIY, we anticipated an increase in client volumes, along with a net average charge consistent with fiscal '17. We outperformed expectations with overall DIY client growth of 8%, including 10% growth in online. Additionally, we delivered a 3% increase in net average charge due to better-than-expected product mix. Overall, we came into the year expecting modest revenue growth, and I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our expectations with revenue increasing 4.1%.
From an earnings perspective, considering our revenue growth projection and the impact of inflationary costs and investments, we expected EBITDA margin to be at the high end of the 27% to 30% range. Similar to fiscal '17, and as expected, we delivered a margin of 29.8%. In summary, we achieved or exceeded all of our objectives.
With that context, I now like to provide additional details on our key financial metrics, starting with the income statement. As I've just mentioned, revenue grew 4.1% or $124 million. U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties together increased $40 million due to increased net average charge and favorable mix, partially offset by the decline in return volumes.
DIY tax spread fees increased $24 million due to increased return volumes and net average charge, which was due to favorable product mix. Regarding our Tax Plus products, we saw an increase in the tax rates overall, driven by Emerald Card, Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield. Additionally, we increased the price of refund transfer this year, which led to a $24 million increase in revenue, balanced against a slight tax decline in the tax rate. This was our second year for Refund Advance. Applications of Refund Advance increased 14% over last year, and the average loan amount increased 45%, due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier. Despite these increases, we are able to keep the total cost of the program flat at approximately $30 million. International revenues increased $17 million due to favorable results and exchange rates in Australia and Canada. 
Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses were at a lower rate than revenue, increasing $88 million or 3.8%. This was primarily due to our expected increases in compensation cost related to the increasing revenue, occupancy costs and bad debt expense, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and advertising expenses.
Moving through the remainder of the income statement. We saw interest expense decrease $3.6 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. Regarding corporate taxes, fiscal '18 represented a unique year, with a 35% statutory rate for the first 8 months of the year when we generate a loss, and a 21% rate for the final 4 months of the year when we generate a profit. This resulted in a full year effective tax rate of 6.3%. Going forward, we expect an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% for fiscal '19 and beyond. Our solid financial performance, coupled with the unique corporate tax situation, resulted in a 52% increase in EPS from $1.96 in fiscal '17 to $2.98 in fiscal '18. Of the $1.02 increase, $0.85 was due to the lower corporate tax rate, resulting from the recent tax legislation.
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon Corporation made settlement payments of $4.5 million this fiscal year, which were previously accrued, and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal '16. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.
I'd now like provide some initial thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal '19. As Jeff shared, we have developed a multi-year strategic framework to guide us over the next several years, and outline the areas we will be focusing on for fiscal '19.
Historically, we have provided our financial -- our fiscal year outlook on the December earnings call, just prior the beginning of the tax season. This generally included our thoughts on volume and net average charge, along with an EBITDA margin range. Considering the changes planned for next year, including investments in the business, as well as the impact of tax legislation on both the corporate and individual side, we are taking the unique step of providing more detail than we have historically at this time of the year.
As Jeff mentioned, we are making changes to our pricing structure, which will improve our ability to deliver value in our Assisted business, and address the impact of the recent tax legislation. As a result, we currently expect total revenues to be $3.05 million to $3.1 billion in fiscal '19. We will also be making strategic investments in technology, as well as operations, including charges related to our office footprint optimization. Given our revenue expectation and these planned investments, EBITDA margin is expected to be 24% to 26% for fiscal '19. As we've previously shared, fiscal '18 represented our high watermark for depreciation and amortization, as we see the impact of office upgrades and franchise buybacks from several years ago roll off. Thus, we expect D&A to decline in fiscal '19 and be between $170 million and $180 million. As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is CapEx related, but the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. We expect CapEx in fiscal '19 to be $95 million to $105 million. Interest expense will be at $80 million to $85 million, and as mentioned earlier, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 25% range.
Regarding capital structure. Our solid financial performance this fiscal year, along with the help from the changing corporate tax rates, grow strong free cash flow of $751 million, a 62% increase over last year's free cash flow of $463 million. For reference, we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. At the top of the list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality. We didn't make investments back into the business that we believe deliver value to our clients who drive sustainable growth. Next, we will deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. These priorities are grounded in our commitment to maintain investment-grade credit rating metrics, an integral part of our financial strategy.
I'm pleased that our Board of Directors has approved a 4% increase in our dividend to an annual rate of $1 or $0.25 per quarter. This represents the third consecutive year of dividend increases. We remain committed to paying quarterly dividends, and will continue to perform an annual review of the dividends after each fiscal year. With respect to share repurchases, as we've discussed on prior calls, there were no repurchases made in fiscal '18. 
For fiscal '19, we are adjusting our prior practice, and plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants in order to, at a minimum, prevent an increase in our shares outstanding. We believe this is an important part of our capital allocation. And in addition to offsetting equity grants, we will continue to be opportunistic in share repurchases, going forward. In summary, I'm excited about the changes we're making in the business, as we position ourselves for sustainable growth. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

And the big opportunities for us, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are really about relevance and a new client growth, in particular. And so while your question is specific about earnings guidance, the macro point for us is this really is about long-term, sustainable growth to the business. As we get closer to '19 and the tax season, we'll have more to share as we get closer to the season. But for now, we just believe it's the right time coming from a position of strength to start positioning the business for real long-term growth."

It's really -- what we've seen over time is the Block brand is extremely well known, we're synonymous with taxes, we start from a positive place. But as the competitive landscape is shift, as consumer preferences have shifted, we've just realized that our promise to the marketplace is less differentiated.

I mean, I think what these investments are allowing us to do and the changes we're making along with different -- from a strategic perspective is really setting us up for long-term sustainable growth. And as we talked about new clients' continuing decline in the most recent year, overall clients in the assisted business, while much better, still declining last year. And we're trying to think about what are the changes that we need to make so that over the long term, not the next 2 or 3 years, but 10 or 20 years, H&R Block is still a viable company with its healthy growing revenue, growing client. So I don't think about it in terms of specific ROI in the short term because none of the things are foundational capabilities that we need to position us over that longer-term period. As far as client acquisition cost, again, not something that we want to get into today. It's a combination, obviously, of not only new clients, but also continuing to drive retention. We made improvements over the last few years, but we still want to try to increase retention, especially across the various bands. I mean, when we think about our tenure of new clients all the way up to a 10-year-plus client, we still have opportunities to retain more new clients on the second year they come back and see H&R Block. So it's obviously, largely, a new client story, but it's also providing a great service and consistent experience at the desk which should drive additional retention over the long term."

I'll tee it up and let Tony chime in as well. I mean, I think in addition to our improved performance in client trajectory in assisted the last couple of years, it's important to note that the assisted category grew about 50 basis points this year, the second year out of the last 3 that the assisted category has grown. I think it's grown 4 out of the last 8 years, if my memory serves properly. So we definitely still see viability and growth in the assisted tax preparation business. Now we've improved retention. We extend our client loss, but we believe that a better value proposition and more clear differentiation, leveraging all the assets that make H&R Block the leading tax preparation company give us opportunity to win back clients who may have defected for some reason or to attract net new clients who haven't yet tried us. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, more on this as we get closer to the season, but little fact that I love seeing that give me optimism for the health of the business are things like the number of millennials who choose H&R Block assisted every year. So one of the things that's become very clear to me is that it's not just about is someone complex or simple. I mean, think about today, 70% of tax filers already take a standard deduction. The majority of tax filers take a standard deduction. Well, the majority of tax filers also using assisted method today. We know that, that shift from assisted to DIY has moderated in the next couple of years, and we talked about what a couple of those reasons may be. So there's a lot of evidence for us that make us optimistic about better quality and consistency, a stronger value proposition, more clear differentiation are all reasons we can get back to growth. And as Tony said, that's revenue growth and new client growth, and we think both of those are important to our future."

We have a lot to cover, so let me outline the 3 areas we'll talk about today. First, I'll share my perspective on the tax season and our results. I'll then give an update on the enterprise strategy work, including key opportunities for improvement and the 5 pillars that will guide us over the next several years. I'll then highlight some of the strategic initiatives for 2019. Finally, Tony will review our 2018 financial results and we'll provide thoughts on our outlook for fiscal '19.
Let me begin by looking back at tax season '18, starting with overall industry. Total U.S. return growth was approximately 1.5%, as expected, with assisted returns growing 0.5% and DIY returns increasing 2.5%. Consistent with prior years, industry results show a slight shift from assisted to DIY. However, like last year, it was moderate. We estimate the shift was only 40 to 50 basis points, which is less than the average over the last several years. This moderation is likely due to the IRS' great work to crack down on fraud in the system, and confirms what we hear from a large percentage of the tax paying population that they turned to Tax Pros at H&R Block for help because they want to ensure they're getting all they deserve, and they want someone they can count on, should questions arise. We continue to see the primary driver in choosing a method is the individual's confidence with taxes, not the complexity of their tax situation.
Turning to H&R Block. Our goal for the season was to build on our momentum from 2017 by continuing to improve the client trajectory, and we achieved that goal. We outperformed the market and took share overall and in the DIY category, and we delivered improved results in Assisted. As I shared in December, we focused on 3 areas: improving operational execution, new products and partnerships, and marketing and promotion that drive demand from the H&R Block brand.
In the Assisted business, we saw improved performance, driven by client retention and well executed promotions. U.S. assisted volumes declined 60 basis points compared to a 2.5% decline last year, and a 6% decline the year before. Retention continued to improve, increasing 65 basis points to 73% as our clients continue to see the benefit of the help our tax pros provide.
Regarding new clients, while we didn't see the growth we wanted, we continue to see millennials turning to H&R Block with over half of our new assisted clients under 35 years old. And from an overall mix and pricing perspective, our net average charge grew 2%, which translated to growth in assisted revenues, as expected. As a great example of how our tax pros help clients, this season, we offered personalized assessments of the future impact of the new tax law. Our clients learned whether they would have paid more or less if the new tax law had been in effect for 2017, which helped them determine how to appropriately adjust their withholdings for 2018. We know, due to lower withholdings, it's likely many consumers will now receive lower refunds, and they can turn to us throughout the year with any questions they have.
Turning to DIY. We achieved outstanding client growth overall, and we believe several factors contributed to this performance. Importantly, we've made significant improvements to the user experience, and are making it easier than ever to pre-populate information from tax forms and switch to H&R Block. These changes are being recognized, and our products continue to receive accolades in third-party reviews. We're also doing more to ensure that consumers know H&R Block do-it-yourself is a great alternative to others in the industry. A strong product, great value and consumer awareness is a winning combination we will continue to improve and deliver.
This tax season, we introduced the new online product for self-employed filers, and partnered with Stride to make it easier to track expenses and lower their tax bills. We also strengthened existing partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most, including Walmart and Amazon. Additionally, clients continue to see the value in our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free. These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY. We saw an 11% increase in new clients, a nearly 200 basis-point increase in online conversion and an over 20% increase in the use of mobile. The net result is an increase in total DIY clients of 8%, driven by online growth of 10%.
Let me note that key strength of H&R Block is being to able to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance, or anything in between. It's why we're still excited about the possibility of H&R Block Tax Pro Go, and our redesigned Tax Pro Review products. By developing the technology platform to enable our large trusted network of tax professionals to serve clients virtually, we leverage a major asset in new ways, and create an experience for consumers that gives them ultimate choice. Initial feedback from clients has been positive and our learnings will shape future innovations and offerings to enable clients to start and finish their return, using whatever channel or method they prefer.
The strong performance across the H&R Block portfolio translated to positive results. Overall, U.S. clients grew 2.5%, and total revenues increased 4%. EBITDA margin was at the high end of our guidance range, and earnings per share increased $1.02 to $2.98. Of this increase, $0.85 was due to a lower corporate tax rate, resulting from the recently passed tax legislation. Tony will cover this in more detail.
In summary, we are pleased with our results. Our focus on operational execution, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotion help drive these results, and will inform our plans as we look to fiscal '19. I'd like to now shift gears, and provide an update on the enterprise strategy work that's underway. When I joined Block, I challenged the team to go deeper than we have in the past and to think differently about our business. Over the last 6 months, we've taken an objective and analytical look at every aspect of our business, as well as the consumer trends and truths that will inform our future plans. We've taken an inventory of our strategic assets, those tangible and intangible elements of H&R Block that can be more fully leveraged, and we reviewed nearly 2 decades of history to gain a very clear picture of where we've been and what we've gotten right and wrong along the way.
Our work has confirmed that while we have a trusted brand, we have opportunities in which we can improve, such as brand relevance and new client growth. By addressing these opportunities from our current position of strength, we're setting the company up to achieve sustainable growth over time.
We came out of fiscal '18 with a large client base and 2 straight years of improved results in both our assisted and DIY businesses. Our client retention is very strong, but new client growth is not where we want it to be. We have the opportunity to improve to do greater differentiation, a stronger value proposition, and ensuring the client experience is delivered seamlessly and consistently across all our channels. We continue to be the only tax company that can serve clients however they want to be served. This creates opportunity to further improve our cross-channel experience for technology in Tax Pros need.
Our financial position is strong with a solid balance sheet and significant cash flows. By using these resources wisely, with a focus on investing in our business for the long-term, we can position Block for a successful future. And while it's easy to think of us as simply a U.S. tax preparation provider, we currently have a diverse portfolio of products and services, both within and outside the tax event, and across a number of countries. We have opportunities to leverage these assets even more. For example, we have an emerging expat business that caters to the taxpayers living abroad who are required to file U.S. tax returns. Many of our offices are driving growth through bookkeeping and business services. Clients turn to us year round for help resolving issues when they receive a letter from the IRS. And our Tax Plus suite of products, including among other things, Emerald Advance and Emerald Card, provide opportunities to interact with our customers more than once a year. The strength and opportunities we've identified have informed the framework that will guide us towards sustainable growth over the next several years, which is driven by 5 strategic pillars. Within these 5 pillars are specific initiatives, the tactical work that will occur each year. We expect the initiatives to evolve over time, but the strategic pillars will remain constant to ensure we're taking a multi-year view of our business, and it will be a guide for how we talk about H&R Block, going forward. The first strategic pillar is to elevate our talent and culture. This is simply about investing in our people, and ensuring that our leaders are equipped with the training and tools they need to help us deliver the best possible experience for our clients. It's also important culturally to recommit to serving and connecting with communities where we do business, the hallmark of our founders.
Second, we will own a sustainable brand position by delivering compelling value for clients to differentiate and demonstrate why we're the best choice for help. H&R Block is a well-known brand that is trusted and synonymous with tax. And while our strong history has positioned us well, we aren't as relevant as we need to be to today's consumer. By differentiating ourselves and demonstrating why we are the best choice for consumers, we will position H&R Block as a modern brand with momentum. Part of this involves making sure our clients see the value they expect for the price they pay. Simply put, we've been too reliant on price to grow revenues, so we're challenging how we think about the value equation, going forward. 
Third, we will win on customer experience by leveraging innovation and personalization to give our clients the experience they want. Customer experience is essential across the spectrum from complete in-person assistance to do-it-yourself and everything in between. We are uniquely positioned to meet the needs of consumers, regardless of what channel they choose. We are modernizing our capabilities for acquiring, engaging and retaining clients, and we will innovate to develop and scale seamless cross-channel experiences.
Fourth, we will build operational excellence by improving the quality and consistency of execution in our tax offices and across the organization, including simplifying our processes and continually seeking ways to improve.
And finally, we will invest for the long term by modernizing our core technology platform, funding strategic investments and building capabilities that enable growth. Consumer expectations about how they seek and want help from H&R Block are constantly evolving, and we need consumer-facing products that not only meet, but exceed consumer expectations.
For 2019, we have a number of initiatives that are planned or in process. We will make investments to modernize our key technology platform to enable more innovation and reduce our IT run rate spend over time. Additionally, we'll invest to improve cross-channel client experiences, and enhance our marketing and advertising capabilities. We'll improve the service quality and consistency in our offices. This work is in process, and we've already started to make some changes, including our decision to consolidate 400 smaller company-run offices. This action will help optimize our footprint, and enable us to more effectively manage our field operations, elevate our talent and deliver more consistent quality to our clients.
Additionally, we will focus on improving the value proposition by evaluating how we price for tax preparation, taking into account the recent tax legislation. These changes will require an investment in fiscal '19, which Tony will provide more details on in a moment.
Strengthening our value proposition, modernizing key technology platforms, building brand differentiation, delivering cross channel client experiences and focusing on quality and consistent execution are important steps. These investments, coming from a position of strength, enable us to deliver sustainable growth over time, and ensure the health of H&R Block for the next generation of clients and associates.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our fiscal '18 results and financial outlook."

Before I provide some additional detail on our outlook for fiscal '19, I'll walk through our fiscal '18 results and how we performed against our expectations. Let me start with the objectives that we outlined prior to the tax season and how our performance measured up. With respect to volume and pricing in our Assisted business, we expect an improvement in the client trajectory and moderate inflationary price increases. We achieved these objectives with the decline in returns of just 0.6% compared to a decline of 2.5% in fiscal '17. Net average charge increased 2%, which was in line with our expectations.
In DIY, we anticipated an increase in client volumes, along with a net average charge consistent with fiscal '17. We outperformed expectations with overall DIY client growth of 8%, including 10% growth in online. Additionally, we delivered a 3% increase in net average charge due to better-than-expected product mix. Overall, we came into the year expecting modest revenue growth, and I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our expectations with revenue increasing 4.1%.
From an earnings perspective, considering our revenue growth projection and the impact of inflationary costs and investments, we expected EBITDA margin to be at the high end of the 27% to 30% range. Similar to fiscal '17, and as expected, we delivered a margin of 29.8%. In summary, we achieved or exceeded all of our objectives.
With that context, I now like to provide additional details on our key financial metrics, starting with the income statement. As I've just mentioned, revenue grew 4.1% or $124 million. U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties together increased $40 million due to increased net average charge and favorable mix, partially offset by the decline in return volumes.
DIY tax spread fees increased $24 million due to increased return volumes and net average charge, which was due to favorable product mix. Regarding our Tax Plus products, we saw an increase in the tax rates overall, driven by Emerald Card, Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield. Additionally, we increased the price of refund transfer this year, which led to a $24 million increase in revenue, balanced against a slight tax decline in the tax rate. This was our second year for Refund Advance. Applications of Refund Advance increased 14% over last year, and the average loan amount increased 45%, due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier. Despite these increases, we are able to keep the total cost of the program flat at approximately $30 million. International revenues increased $17 million due to favorable results and exchange rates in Australia and Canada. 
Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses grew at a lower rate than revenue, increasing $88 million or 3.8%. This was primarily due to our expected increases in compensation cost related to the increasing revenue, occupancy costs and bad debt expense, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and advertising expenses.
Moving through the remainder of the income statement. We saw interest expense decrease $3.6 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. Regarding corporate taxes, fiscal '18 represented a unique year, with a 35% statutory rate for the first 8 months of the year when we generate a loss, and a 21% rate for the final 4 months of the year when we generate a profit. This resulted in a full year effective tax rate of 6.3%. Going forward, we expect an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% for fiscal '19 and beyond. Our solid financial performance, coupled with the unique corporate tax situation, resulted in a 52% increase in EPS from $1.96 in fiscal '17 to $2.98 in fiscal '18. Of the $1.02 increase, $0.85 was due to the lower corporate tax rate, resulting from the recent tax legislation.
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon Corporation made settlement payments of $4.5 million this fiscal year, which were previously accrued, and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal '16. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.
I'd now like provide some initial thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal '19. As Jeff shared, we have developed a multi-year strategic framework to guide us over the next several years, and outline the areas we will be focusing on for fiscal '19.
Historically, we have provided our financial -- our fiscal year outlook on the December earnings call, just prior the beginning of the tax season. This generally included our thoughts on volume and net average charge, along with an EBITDA margin range. Considering the changes planned for next year, including investments in the business, as well as the impact of tax legislation on both the corporate and individual side, we are taking the unique step of providing more detail than we have historically at this time of the year.
As Jeff mentioned, we are making changes to our pricing structure, which will improve our ability to deliver value in our Assisted business, and address the impact of the recent tax legislation. As a result, we currently expect total revenues to be $3.05 million to $3.1 billion in fiscal '19. We will also be making strategic investments in technology, as well as operations, including charges related to our office footprint optimization. Given our revenue expectation and these planned investments, EBITDA margin is expected to be 24% to 26% for fiscal '19. As we've previously shared, fiscal '18 represented our high watermark for depreciation and amortization, as we see the impact of office upgrades and franchise buybacks from several years ago roll off. Thus, we expect D&A to decline in fiscal '19 and be between $170 million and $180 million. As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is CapEx related, but the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. We expect CapEx in fiscal '19 to be $95 million to $105 million. Interest expense will be at $80 million to $85 million, and as mentioned earlier, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 25% range.
Regarding capital structure. Our solid financial performance this fiscal year, along with the help from the changing corporate tax rates, show strong free cash flow of $751 million, a 62% increase over last year's free cash flow of $463 million. For reference, we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. At the top of the list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality. We then make investments back into the business that we believe deliver value to our clients and drive sustainable growth. Next, we will deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. These priorities are grounded in our commitment to maintain investment-grade credit rating metrics, an integral part of our financial strategy.
I'm pleased that our Board of Directors has approved a 4% increase in our dividend to an annual rate of $1 or $0.25 per quarter. This represents the third consecutive year of dividend increases. We remain committed to paying quarterly dividends, and will continue to perform an annual review of the dividends after each fiscal year. With respect to share repurchases, as we've discussed on prior calls, there were no repurchases made in fiscal '18. 
For fiscal '19, we are adjusting our prior practice, and plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants in order to, at a minimum, prevent an increase in our shares outstanding. We believe this is an important part of our capital allocation. And in addition to offsetting equity grants, we will continue to be opportunistic in share repurchases, going forward. In summary, I'm excited about the changes we're making in the business, as we position ourselves for sustainable growth. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

And the big opportunities for us, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are really about relevance and a new client growth, in particular. And so while your question is specific about earnings guidance, the macro point for us is this really is about long-term, sustainable growth to the business. As we get closer to '19 and the tax season, we'll have more to share as we get closer to the season. But for now, we just believe it's the right time coming from a position of strength to start positioning the business for real long-term growth."

And we have -- because we have closed offices over the course of time, we have a really good plan in place for how we think about migrating clients to adjacent offices.

So some of the investments we've made have resulted in improved retention. As we mentioned, the big opportunity for us is in new clients and it's a big part when we talk about brand differentiation and value proposition. It's really -- what we've seen over time is the Block brand is extremely well known, we're synonymous with taxes, we start from a positive place. But as the competitive landscape is shift, as consumer preferences have shifted, we've just realized that our promise to the marketplace is less differentiated. And so we think the key to starting to see client growth over time in Assisted is actually making a really clear promise about the value that H&R Block can provide, and that's what our strategy work is really intended to do."

I mean, I think what these investments are allowing us to do and the changes we're making along with different -- from a strategic perspective is really setting us up for long-term sustainable growth. And as we talked about new clients' continuing decline in the most recent year, overall clients in the assisted business, while much better, still declining last year. And we're trying to think about what are the changes that we need to make so that over the long term, not the next 2 or 3 years, but 10 or 20 years, H&R Block is still a viable company with its healthy growing revenue, growing client. So I don't think about it in terms of specific ROI in the short term because none of the things are foundational capabilities that we need to position us over that longer-term period. As far as client acquisition cost, again, not something that we want to get into today. It's a combination, obviously, of not only new clients, but also continuing to drive retention. We've made improvements over the last few years, but we still want to try to increase retention, especially across the various bands. I mean, when we think about our tenure of new clients all the way up to a 10-year-plus client, we still have opportunities to retain more new clients on the second year they come back and see H&R Block. So it's obviously, largely, a new client story, but it's also providing a great service and consistent experience at the desk which should drive additional retention over the long term."

I mean, I think in addition to our improved performance in client trajectory in Assisted the last couple of years, it's important to note that the Assisted category grew about 50 basis points this year, the second year out of the last 3 that the Assisted category has grown. I think it's grown 4 out of the last 8 years, if my memory serves properly. So we definitely still see viability and growth in the assisted tax preparation business. Now we've improved retention. We extend our client loss, but we believe that a better value proposition and more clear differentiation, leveraging all the assets that make H&R Block the leading tax preparation company give us opportunity to win back clients who may have defected for some reason or to attract net new clients who haven't yet tried us. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, more on this as we get closer to the season, but little fact that I love seeing that give me optimism for the health of the business are things like the number of millennials who choose H&R Block Assisted every year. So one of the things that's become very clear to me is that it's not just about is someone complex or simple. I mean, think about today, 70% of tax filers already take a standard deduction. The majority of tax filers take a standard deduction. Well, the majority of tax filers also use an assisted method today. We know that, that shift from assisted to DIY has moderated in the next couple of years, and we talked about what a couple of those reasons may be. So there's a lot of evidence for us that make us optimistic about better quality and consistency, a stronger value proposition, more clear differentiation are all reasons we can get back to growth. And as Tony said, that's revenue growth and new client growth, and we think both of those are important to our future."

We have a lot to cover, so let me outline the 3 areas we'll talk about today. First, I'll share my perspective on the tax season and our results. I'll then give an update on the enterprise strategy work, including key opportunities for improvement and the 5 pillars that will guide us over the next several years. I'll then highlight some of the strategic initiatives for 2019. Finally, Tony will review our 2018 financial results and we'll provide thoughts on our outlook for fiscal '19.
Let me begin by looking back at tax season '18, starting with overall industry. Total U.S. return growth was approximately 1.5%, as expected, with assisted returns growing 0.5% and DIY returns increasing 2.5%. Consistent with prior years, industry results show a slight shift from assisted to DIY. However, like last year, it was moderate. We estimate the shift was only 40 to 50 basis points, which is less than the average over the last several years. This moderation is likely due to the IRS' great work to crack down on fraud in the system, and confirms what we hear from a large percentage of the tax paying population that they turned to Tax Pros at H&R Block for help because they want to ensure they're getting all they deserve, and they want someone they can count on, should questions arise. We continue to see the primary driver in choosing a method is the individual's confidence with taxes, not the complexity of their tax situation.
Turning to H&R Block. Our goal for the season was to build on our momentum from 2017 by continuing to improve the client trajectory, and we achieved that goal. We outperformed the market and took share overall and in the DIY category, and we delivered improved results in Assisted. As I shared in December, we focused on 3 areas: improving operational execution, new products and partnerships, and marketing and promotion that drive demand from the H&R Block brand.
In the Assisted business, we saw improved performance, driven by client retention and well executed promotions. U.S. assisted volumes declined 60 basis points compared to a 2.5% decline last year, and a 6% decline the year before. Retention continued to improve, increasing 65 basis points to 73% as our clients continue to see the benefit of the help our tax pros provide.
Regarding new clients, while we didn't see the growth we wanted, we continue to see millennials turning to H&R Block with over half of our new assisted clients under 35 years old. And from an overall mix and pricing perspective, our net average charge grew 2%, which translated to growth in assisted revenues, as expected. As a great example of how our tax pros help clients, this season, we offered personalized assessments of the future impact of the new tax law. Our clients learned whether they would have paid more or less if the new tax law had been in effect for 2017, which helped them determine how to appropriately adjust their withholdings for 2018. We know, due to lower withholdings, it's likely many consumers will now receive lower refunds, and they can turn to us throughout the year with any questions they have.
Turning to DIY. We achieved outstanding client growth overall, and we believe several factors contributed to this performance. Importantly, we've made significant improvements to the user experience, and are making it easier than ever to pre-populate information from tax forms and switch to H&R Block. These changes are being recognized, and our products continue to receive accolades in third-party reviews. We're also doing more to ensure that consumers know H&R Block do-it-yourself is a great alternative to others in the industry. A strong product, great value and consumer awareness is a winning combination we will continue to improve and deliver.
This tax season, we introduced the new online product for self-employed filers, and partnered with Stride to make it easier to track expenses and lower their tax bills. We also strengthened existing partnerships to bring H&R Block to more consumers in the places they frequent the most, including Walmart and Amazon. Additionally, clients continue to see the value in our H&R Block More Zero promotion, which allows a significant portion of the tax filing population to file both their federal and state taxes for free. These efforts have translated to strong results and market share gains in DIY. We saw an 11% increase in new clients, a nearly 200 basis-point increase in online conversion and an over 20% increase in the use of mobile. The net result is an increase in total DIY clients of 8%, driven by online growth of 10%.
Let me note that key strength of H&R Block is being to able to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance, or anything in between. It's why we're still excited about the possibility of H&R Block Tax Pro Go, and our redesigned Tax Pro Review products. By developing the technology platform to enable our large trusted network of tax professionals to serve clients virtually, we leverage a major asset in new ways, and create an experience for consumers that gives them ultimate choice. Initial feedback from clients has been positive and our learnings will shape future innovations and offerings to enable clients to start and finish their return, using whatever channel or method they prefer.
The strong performance across the H&R Block portfolio translated to positive results. Overall, U.S. clients grew 2.5%, and total revenues increased 4%. EBITDA margin was at the high end of our guidance range, and earnings per share increased $1.02 to $2.98. Of this increase, $0.85 was due to a lower corporate tax rate, resulting from the recently passed tax legislation. Tony will cover this in more detail.
In summary, we are pleased with our results. Our focus on operational execution, new products and partnerships and value-enhancing promotion help drive these results, and will inform our plans as we look to fiscal '19. I'd like to now shift gears, and provide an update on the enterprise strategy work that's underway. When I joined Block, I challenged the team to go deeper than we have in the past and to think differently about our business. Over the last 6 months, we've taken an objective and analytical look at every aspect of our business, as well as the consumer trends and truths that will inform our future plans. We've taken an inventory of our strategic assets, those tangible and intangible elements of H&R Block that can be more fully leveraged, and we reviewed nearly 2 decades of history to gain a very clear picture of where we've been and what we've gotten right and wrong along the way.
Our work has confirmed that while we have a trusted brand, we have opportunities in which we can improve, such as brand relevance and new client growth. By addressing these opportunities from our current position of strength, we're setting the company up to achieve sustainable growth over time.
We came out of fiscal '18 with a large client base and 2 straight years of improved results in both our assisted and DIY businesses. Our client retention is very strong, but new client growth is not where we want it to be. We have the opportunity to improve to do greater differentiation, a stronger value proposition, and ensuring the client experience is delivered seamlessly and consistently across all our channels. We continue to be the only tax company that can serve clients however they want to be served. This creates opportunity to further improve our cross-channel experience for technology in Tax Pros need.
Our financial position is strong with a solid balance sheet and significant cash flows. By using these resources wisely, with a focus on investing in our business for the long-term, we can position Block for a successful future. And while it's easy to think of us as simply a U.S. tax preparation provider, we currently have a diverse portfolio of products and services, both within and outside the tax event, and across a number of countries. We have opportunities to leverage these assets even more. For example, we have an emerging expat business that caters to the taxpayers living abroad who are required to file U.S. tax returns. Many of our offices are driving growth through bookkeeping and business services. Clients turn to us year round for help resolving issues when they receive a letter from the IRS. And our Tax Plus suite of products, including among other things, Emerald Advance and Emerald Card, provide opportunities to interact with our customers more than once a year. The strength and opportunities we've identified have informed the framework that will guide us towards sustainable growth over the next several years, which is driven by 5 strategic pillars. Within these 5 pillars are specific initiatives, the tactical work that will occur each year. We expect the initiatives to evolve over time, but the strategic pillars will remain constant to ensure we're taking a multi-year view of our business, and it will be a guide for how we talk about H&R Block, going forward. The first strategic pillar is to elevate our talent and culture. This is simply about investing in our people, and ensuring that our leaders are equipped with the training and tools they need to help us deliver the best possible experience for our clients. It's also important culturally to recommit to serving and connecting with communities where we do business, the hallmark of our founders.
Second, we will own a sustainable brand position by delivering compelling value for clients to differentiate and demonstrate why we're the best choice for help. H&R Block is a well-known brand that is trusted and synonymous with tax. And while our strong history has positioned us well, we aren't as relevant as we need to be to today's consumer. By differentiating ourselves and demonstrating why we are the best choice for consumers, we will position H&R Block as a modern brand with momentum. Part of this involves making sure our clients see the value they expect for the price they pay. Simply put, we've been too reliant on price to grow revenues, so we're challenging how we think about the value equation, going forward. 
Third, we will win on customer experience by leveraging innovation and personalization to give our clients the experience they want. Customer experience is essential across the spectrum from complete in-person assistance to do-it-yourself and everything in between. We are uniquely positioned to meet the needs of consumers, regardless of what channel they choose. We are modernizing our capabilities for acquiring, engaging and retaining clients, and we will innovate to develop and scale seamless cross-channel experiences.
Fourth, we will build operational excellence by improving the quality and consistency of execution in our tax offices and across the organization, including simplifying our processes and continually seeking ways to improve.
And finally, we will invest for the long term by modernizing our core technology platform, funding strategic investments and building capabilities that enable growth. Consumer expectations about how they seek and want help from H&R Block are constantly evolving, and we need consumer-facing products that not only meet, but exceed consumer expectations.
For 2019, we have a number of initiatives that are planned or in process. We will make investments to modernize our key technology platform to enable more innovation and reduce our IT run rate spend over time. Additionally, we'll invest to improve cross-channel client experiences, and enhance our marketing and advertising capabilities. We'll improve the service quality and consistency in our offices. This work is in process, and we've already started to make some changes, including our decision to consolidate 400 smaller company-run offices. This action will help optimize our footprint, and enable us to more effectively manage our field operations, elevate our talent and deliver more consistent quality to our clients.
Additionally, we will focus on improving the value proposition by evaluating how we price for tax preparation, taking into account the recent tax legislation. These changes will require an investment in fiscal '19, which Tony will provide more details on in a moment.
Strengthening our value proposition, modernizing key technology platforms, building brand differentiation, delivering cross channel client experiences and focusing on quality and consistent execution are important steps. These investments, coming from a position of strength, enable us to deliver sustainable growth over time, and ensure the health of H&R Block for the next generation of clients and associates.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our fiscal '18 results and financial outlook."

Through this work, we are taking the steps to ensure we can achieve sustainable growth for the long term.
Before I provide some additional detail on our outlook for fiscal '19, I'll walk through our fiscal '18 results and how we performed against our expectations. Let me start with the objectives that we outlined prior to the tax season and how our performance measured up. With respect to volume and pricing in our Assisted business, we expect an improvement in the client trajectory and moderate inflationary price increases. We achieved these objectives with the decline in returns of just 0.6% compared to a decline of 2.5% in fiscal '17. Net average charge increased 2%, which was in line with our expectations.
In DIY, we anticipated an increase in client volumes, along with a net average charge consistent with fiscal '17. We outperformed expectations with overall DIY client growth of 8%, including 10% growth in online. Additionally, we delivered a 3% increase in net average charge due to better-than-expected product mix. Overall, we came into the year expecting modest revenue growth, and I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our expectations with revenue increasing 4.1%.
From an earnings perspective, considering our revenue growth projection and the impact of inflationary costs and investments, we expected EBITDA margin to be at the high end of the 27% to 30% range. Similar to fiscal '17, and as expected, we delivered a margin of 29.8%. In summary, we achieved or exceeded all of our objectives.
With that context, I now like to provide additional details on our key financial metrics, starting with the income statement. As I've just mentioned, revenue grew 4.1% or $124 million. U.S. assisted tax preparation fees and royalties together increased $40 million due to increased net average charge and favorable mix, partially offset by the decline in return volumes.
DIY tax spread fees increased $24 million due to increased return volumes and net average charge, which was due to favorable product mix. Regarding our Tax Plus products, we saw an increase in the tax rates overall, driven by Emerald Card, Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield. Additionally, we increased the price of refund transfer this year, which led to a $24 million increase in revenue, balanced against a slight tax decline in the tax rate. This was our second year for Refund Advance. Applications of Refund Advance increased 14% over last year, and the average loan amount increased 45%, due to the addition of the $3,000 loan tier. Despite these increases, we are able to keep the total cost of the program flat at approximately $30 million. International revenues increased $17 million due to favorable results and exchange rates in Australia and Canada. 
Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses grew at a lower rate than revenue, increasing $88 million or 3.8%. This was primarily due to our expected increases in compensation cost related to the increasing revenue, occupancy costs and bad debt expense, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and advertising expenses.
Moving through the remainder of the income statement. We saw interest expense decrease $3.6 million due to lower draws on our line of credit compared to the prior year. Regarding corporate taxes, fiscal '18 represented a unique year, with a 35% statutory rate for the first 8 months of the year when we generate a loss, and a 21% rate for the final 4 months of the year when we generate a profit. This resulted in a full year effective tax rate of 6.3%. Going forward, we expect an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% for fiscal '19 and beyond. Our solid financial performance, coupled with the unique corporate tax situation, resulted in a 52% increase in EPS from $1.96 in fiscal '17 to $2.98 in fiscal '18. Of the $1.02 increase, $0.85 was due to the lower corporate tax rate, resulting from the recent tax legislation.
Turning to discontinued operations. Sand Canyon Corporation made settlement payments of $4.5 million this fiscal year, which were previously accrued, and related to a settlement agreement from fiscal '16. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.
I'd now like provide some initial thoughts on our financial outlook for fiscal '19. As Jeff shared, we have developed a multi-year strategic framework to guide us over the next several years, and outline the areas we will be focusing on for fiscal '19.
Historically, we have provided our financial -- our fiscal year outlook on the December earnings call, just prior the beginning of the tax season. This generally included our thoughts on volume and net average charge, along with an EBITDA margin range. Considering the changes planned for next year, including investments in the business, as well as the impact of tax legislation on both the corporate and individual side, we are taking the unique step of providing more detail than we have historically at this time of the year.
As Jeff mentioned, we are making changes to our pricing structure, which will improve our ability to deliver value in our Assisted business, and address the impact of the recent tax legislation. As a result, we currently expect total revenues to be $3.05 million to $3.1 billion in fiscal '19. We will also be making strategic investments in technology, as well as operations, including charges related to our office footprint optimization. Given our revenue expectation and these planned investments, EBITDA margin is expected to be 24% to 26% for fiscal '19. As we've previously shared, fiscal '18 represented our high watermark for depreciation and amortization, as we see the impact of office upgrades and franchise buybacks from several years ago roll off. Thus, we expect D&A to decline in fiscal '19 and be between $170 million and $180 million. As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is CapEx related, but the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. We expect CapEx in fiscal '19 to be $95 million to $105 million. Interest expense will be at $80 million to $85 million, and as mentioned earlier, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 25% range.
Regarding capital structure. Our solid financial performance this fiscal year, along with the help from the changing corporate tax rates, show strong free cash flow of $751 million, a 62% increase over last year's free cash flow of $463 million. For reference, we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures.
Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. At the top of the list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality. We then make investments back into the business that we believe deliver value to our clients and drive sustainable growth. Next, we will deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. These priorities are grounded in our commitment to maintain investment-grade credit rating metrics, an integral part of our financial strategy.
I'm pleased that our Board of Directors has approved a 4% increase in our dividend to an annual rate of $1 or $0.25 per quarter. This represents the third consecutive year of dividend increases. We remain committed to paying quarterly dividends, and will continue to perform an annual review of the dividends after each fiscal year. With respect to share repurchases, as we've discussed on prior calls, there were no repurchases made in fiscal '18. 
For fiscal '19, we are adjusting our prior practice, and plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants in order to, at a minimum, prevent an increase in our shares outstanding. We believe this is an important part of our capital allocation. And in addition to offsetting equity grants, we will continue to be opportunistic in share repurchases, going forward. In summary, I'm excited about the changes we're making in the business, as we position ourselves for sustainable growth. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

And so while your question is specific about earnings guidance, the macro point for us is this really is about long-term, sustainable growth to the business.

Two years in a row, we've really been focused on improving execution in the offices, the second monitor, the way the tax pros interact. So some of the investments we've made have resulted in improved retention. As we mentioned, the big opportunity for us is in new clients and it's a big part when we talk about brand differentiation and value proposition. It's really -- what we've seen over time is the Block brand is extremely well known, we're synonymous with taxes, we start from a positive place. But as the competitive landscape is shift, as consumer preferences have shifted, we've just realized that our promise to the marketplace is less differentiated. And so we think the key to starting to see client growth over time in Assisted is actually making a really clear promise about the value that H&R Block can provide, and that's what our strategy work is really intended to do."

I mean, I think what these investments are allowing us to do and the changes we're making along with different -- from a strategic perspective is really setting us up for long-term sustainable growth. And as we talked about new clients' continuing decline in the most recent year, overall clients in the assisted business, while much better, still declining last year. And we're trying to think about what are the changes that we need to make so that over the long term, not the next 2 or 3 years, but 10 or 20 years, H&R Block is still a viable company with its healthy growing revenue, growing client. So I don't think about it in terms of specific ROI in the short term because none of the things are foundational capabilities that we need to position us over that longer-term period. As far as client acquisition cost, again, not something that we want to get into today. It's a combination, obviously, of not only new clients, but also continuing to drive retention. We've made improvements over the last few years, but we still want to try to increase retention, especially across the various bands. I mean, when we think about our tenure of new clients all the way up to a 10-year-plus client, we still have opportunities to retain more new clients on the second year they come back and see H&R Block. So it's obviously, largely, a new client story, but it's also providing a great service and consistent experience at the desk which should drive additional retention over the long term."

I'll tee it up and let Tony chime in as well. I mean, I think in addition to our improved performance in client trajectory in Assisted the last couple of years, it's important to note that the Assisted category grew about 50 basis points this year, the second year out of the last 3 that the Assisted category has grown. I think it's grown 4 out of the last 8 years, if my memory serves properly. So we definitely still see viability and growth in the assisted tax preparation business. Now we've improved retention. We extend our client loss, but we believe that a better value proposition and more clear differentiation, leveraging all the assets that make H&R Block the leading tax preparation company give us opportunity to win back clients who may have defected for some reason or to attract net new clients who haven't yet tried us. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, more on this as we get closer to the season, but little fact that I love seeing that give me optimism for the health of the business are things like the number of millennials who choose H&R Block Assisted every year. So one of the things that's become very clear to me is that it's not just about is someone complex or simple. I mean, think about today, 70% of tax filers already take a standard deduction. The majority of tax filers take a standard deduction. Well, the majority of tax filers also use an assisted method today. We know that, that shift from assisted to DIY has moderated in the next couple of years, and we talked about what a couple of those reasons may be. So there's a lot of evidence for us that make us optimistic about better quality and consistency, a stronger value proposition, more clear differentiation are all reasons we can get back to growth. And as Tony said, that's revenue growth and new client growth, and we think both of those are important to our future."

It's been about a year since I joined H&R Block and I've even more excited about the future of this company. The tax industry continues to grow in both the assisted and DIY channels. And we're executing a strategy to take advantage of opportunities in each, plus developing new products to digitally enable human health and care, so H&R Block is available to people in any way they choose. Of course, all of this is stacked by solid cash flow and a strong financial position, allowing us to effectively balance investing for the future, while continuing to opportunistically return capital to shareholders and create long-term value.
On today's call, I want to spend time framing the opportunities we see and provide additional context for our strategy regarding the structure and evolution of the tax industry, how we're positioning H&R Block to win and the initiatives and investments we're making in fiscal '19.  Tony will provide details on our first quarter results, which were in line with expectations, as well as additional insight into our fiscal '19 outlook.
Let's start by talking about the industry and why we see opportunities in both that assisted and DIY categories? The Tax Plus industry has enjoyed stable and steady growth over decades. Since 2005, the industry grew on average 1% per year with assisted growing at an annual rate of 0.3% and DIY at 2.1%. And more recently, the assisted category has grown 2 out of the last 3 years. This growth has led to an increase in overall industry revenue as well, which currently stands at $21 billion. And while 56% of all filings are done with the help of the tax professional, the assisted category represents the vast majority of industry revenues at approximately 87%.
A common question I've heard over the past few months is why would consumers choose assisted when low-cost technology-enabled DIY solutions make it attractive to do taxes on your own? The answer is that we continued to see the primary driver in choosing the method to be a person of confidence with taxes much more so than the complexity of their situation, their comfort level with technology, their age, changes to tax laws or the cost to file. A proof point is that millions of consumers who use the Tax just file a 1040EZ. These filers typically have a single W-2, no dependence or deductions and few if any credits. Taxes cannot get any simpler, yet they still seek assistance because they want to know their taxes are done right and somewhat standing behind them should questions arise.
Secondary to confidence in making a decision about tax preparation is convenience in costs. The definition of convenience varies for many consumers. Some may find it most convenient to stop by in office to have their taxes prepared in-person, while others may find it most convenient to do their taxes themselves from the comfort of home. For all these reasons, we continued to see sustainable demand for both assisted and DIY, and we're excited about the opportunities in both.
To this point, much of what I have discussed is focused on 2 filing methods that have defined the industry for the past several decades. This binary choice is evolving as consumer expectations change. While the tax industry is early in this evolution to virtual, it creates opportunities for us, which I'll discuss more in a minute.
To wrap up on the industry, I'd like to spend just a minute on the recent updates to the tax code and how they may impact consumers. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous tax code changes and historically, they've not resulted in major swings in filing behavior. While tax rates are lower, we don't expect people to notice much of a difference when it comes to preparing the taxes. Even those of you no longer itemize deductions will gather the same documents they have in the past and provide same information to determine whether to take the standard deduction. Many filers who take the standard deduction also qualify for various credits and that process is largely unchanged.
Of course, it's hard to predict exactly how consumers will react to the upcoming tax season and whether this will cause a change from recent filing trends. That said, our assessment of these changes, combined with historical consumer filing behaviors, leave us to believe that there will not be significant changes in the patterns we've seen in recent years. 
For these reasons, we continued to believe that the overall industry will grow 1% to 2% for tax season '19, with assisted return flat to slightly up and DIY returns up 2% to 3%.
Clearly, there is opportunity in this industry, and given our 14% market share in both the assisted and DIY categories, we have significant runway for growth. I'd now like to provide additional details on the overarching objectives guiding our work for 2019.
Starting with the assisted business. We are focused on improving the value we deliver including an investment in price, developing and delivering on a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block to consumers and improving the quality and consistency of our service delivery in the tax office. 
In our DIY business, we will continue to invest to improve the product and user experience. We will price at a level that is competitive and provides value to our clients. And we will continue to communicate this value, growing awareness and compelling consumers to switch to H&R Block.
And in virtual, we will innovate as emerging space leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. We currently offer multiple products that combined digital technology with the unmatched scale and expertise of our Tax Pro network to ensure taxpayers can access H&R Block, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between.
In our DIY products, clients have access to help through live chat while preparing their return. This is something we offered for years. It is a great way to get a question answered by an expert.
Tax Pro Review is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from knowing that one of our highly trained experts has reviewed their sourced document as well as their entire returns to identify all available credits and deductions. At the end of the process, our Tax Pro then signed and filed returns.
Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering, addresses the need to consumers who want assistance, but don't want or has time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents through the secured MyBlock portal and work virtually with the tax pro matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed and filed by H&R Block.
products like Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review, we continue to be the only company to be complete or fully review a taxpayer's return virtually and then sign it, reflecting our commitment to stand behind the work and our clients. We're excited about this future of virtual and this start to how we will innovate to serve more clients in more ways.
As we outline on our June call, we're investing in 3 specific areas in fiscal '19, price, technology and operational excellence.
With respect to price, the reductions we've discussed will be targeted to assisted consumer segments, where we believe we can win. The impact of these pricing reduction is reflected in our fiscal '19 revenue outlook as a one-time reset. We'll share more about our plans repricing as we get closer to the tax season.
With technology, we're making investments to modernize our platforms to enable more innovation and greater agility and to reduce spend over time. There are 4 key areas of investment. First, we're building a new tax engine, which will consolidate multiple systems, creating efficiencies and eliminating unnecessary and redundant work.
Second, we're investing in cross-channel capabilities to enable a seamless client experience to cross platforms, something that will be key as we innovate in virtual. Third, we're migrating our physical data centers to the cloud, which is more appropriate for the seasonality of our operating model and will allow us to be more agile in reduced costs. And fourth, we're optimizing our data architecture and analytics platform to allow for faster and deeper insights into trends in our business. These investments are key to ensuring we achieve our long-term strategic objectives and will require elevated spend over the next several years.
With respect to operational excellence, we're focused on improving the quality and consistency of service delivery in our offices.  This work ranges from better execution of standard operating procedures to enhancing and differentiating the new client experience. While our overall retention rate is 73%, our new client retention is significantly lower. Taking steps to improve the experience for new clients in order to improve retention is crucial for future growth.
This work is the foundation to achieve our overall objectives of growing clients, revenue and earnings over the long term, all of which are necessary for a successful H&R Block. These investments are critical, and we do not intend them to result in continued margin declines in future years as we expect them to be offset by both top line growth and operating efficiencies. Specifically, our expectations for long-term sustainable growth includes assisted client growth, including increased new client retention, continued DIY market share gains and industry-leading in virtual and our revenue and earnings growth over time.
In summary, we're excited for the steps we're taking in 2019. We will continue to share more details as we approach the tax season, and we'll update you on our progress. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our first quarter financial results and outlook."

Before I get into the details of our Q1 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal first quarter due to seasonality of our business. Therefore, first quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $7 million or 5% to $145 million. This is primarily result of timing of revenues to our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products, partially offset by lower revenues from refund transfer. 
Turning to expense. Total operating expense has increased $4 million or 1% to $327 million, primarily due to increased compensation and consulting expenses, which were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and bad debt expense.
Also included in operating expenses were payments of $1 million related to our footprint optimization. The revenue increased due to improvement in pretax loss and continuing operations of $6 million or 3%. Loss per share, however, increased $0.10 to $0.72 due to a lower effective tax rate, which negatively impacts quarters for the seasonal loss. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was in line with our outlook at 25% compared to 38% in the prior year.
Turning to discontinued operations. There were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's report on Form 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.
Moving on to capital allocation. On our June call, we announced returning opportunistic share repurchases and would have a minimum repurchase enough shares to offset dilution from equity grants. During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million. The average purchase price was $23.27. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach going forward.
I'd now like to provide some additional context from the fiscal '19 outlook we discussed last quarter, which reflected the investments to enable our strategic objectives. Overall, we continued to expect fiscal '19 results to be in line with the outlook we provided in June. As a reminder, we expect total revenues at $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, EBITDA margin at 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%.
All of the revenue outlook reduction is due to our investment in price, partially offset by DIY, international and franchise buybacks and also represents approximately half of the change in EBITDA from fiscal '18. EBITDA is further impacted by the one-time cost related to our footprint optimization of $15 million to $20 million. The majority of this amount will be recognized in the second quarter. The remainder of the reduction in EBITDA is attributable to the technology investments mentioned by Jeff as well as inflationary increases in expenses.
While much of the focus has been on our margin, the midpoint of our outlook results in earnings per share at levels comparable to fiscal '17. Essentially, we are investing to benefit of lower corporate taxes back into the business, with the intent to grow revenue and earnings in fiscal '20 and beyond.
In summary, our robust cash generation and healthy balance sheet have enabled us to make the strategic investments in our business, which will position us to grow clients, revenue and earnings sustainably over time. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

It's been about a year since I joined H&R Block and I've even more excited about the future of this company. The tax industry continues to grow in both the assisted and DIY channels. And we're executing a strategy to take advantage of opportunities in each, plus developing new products to digitally enable human health and care, so H&R Block is available to people in any way they choose. Of course, all of this is stacked by solid cash flow and a strong financial position, allowing us to effectively balance investing for the future while continuing to opportunistically return capital to shareholders and create long-term value.
On today's call, I want to spend time framing the opportunities we see and provide additional context for our strategy regarding the structure and evolution of the tax industry, how we're positioning H&R Block to win and the initiatives and investments we're making in fiscal '19.  Tony will provide details on our first quarter results, which were in line with expectations, as well as additional insight into our fiscal '19 outlook.
Let's start by talking about the industry and why we see opportunities in both the assisted and DIY categories. The Tax Plus industry has enjoyed stable and steady growth over decades. Since 2005, the industry grew on average 1% per year with assisted growing at an annual rate of 0.3% and DIY at 2.1%. And more recently, the assisted category has grown 2 out of the last 3 years. This growth has led to an increase in overall industry revenue as well, which currently stands at $21 billion. And while 56% of all filings are done with the help of a tax professional, the assisted category represents the vast majority of industry revenues at approximately 87%. A common question I've heard over the past few months is, why would consumers choose assisted when low-cost technology-enabled DIY solutions make it attractive to do taxes on your own? The answer is that we continue to see the primary driver in choosing a method to be a person of confidence for taxes much more so than the complexity of their situation, their comfort level with technology, their age, changes to tax laws or the cost to file. A proof point is the millions of consumers who use a tax prepare just file a 1040EZ. These filers typically have a single W-2, no dependence or deductions and few if any credits. Taxes cannot get any simpler, yet they still seek assistance because they want to know their taxes are done right and someone standing behind them should questions arise.
Secondary to confidence in making a decision about tax preparation is convenience and costs. The definition of convenience varies for many consumers. Some may find it most convenient to stop by in office to have their taxes prepared in person, while others may find it most convenient to do their taxes themselves from the comfort of home. For all these reasons, we continue to see sustainable demand for both assisted and DIY, and we're excited about the opportunities in both.
To this point, much of what I have discussed is focused on the 2 filing methods that have defined the industry for the past several decades. This binary choice is evolving as consumer expectations change. While the tax industry is early in this evolution to virtual, it creates opportunities for us, which I'll discuss more in a minute.
To wrap up on the industry, I'd like to spend just a minute on the recent updates for the tax code and how they may impact consumers. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous tax code changes and historically, they've not resulted in major swings in filing behavior. While tax rates are lower, we don't expect people to notice much of a difference when it comes to preparing their taxes. Even those who no longer itemize deductions will gather the same documents they have in the past and will provide the same information to determine whether to take the standard deduction. Many filers who take the standard deduction also qualify for various credits and that process is largely unchanged.
Of course, it's hard to predict exactly how consumers will react to the upcoming tax season and whether this will cause a change from recent filing trends. That said, our assessment of these changes, combined with historical consumer filing behaviors, lead us to believe there will not be significant changes in the patterns we've seen in recent years. 
For these reasons, we continue to believe that the overall industry will grow 1% to 2% for tax season '19, with assisted returns flat to slightly up and DIY returns up 2% to 3%.
Clearly, there is opportunity in this industry. And given our 14% market share in both the assisted and DIY categories, we have significant runway for growth. I'd now like to provide additional details on the overarching objectives guiding our work for 2019.
Starting with the assisted business. We are focused on improving the value we deliver, including an investment and price, developing and delivering on a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block to consumers and improving the quality and consistency of our service delivery in the tax office. 
In our DIY business, we will continue to invest to improve the product and user experience. We will price at a level that is competitive and provides value to our clients. And we will continue to communicate this value, growing awareness and compelling consumers to switch to H&R Block.
And in virtual, we will innovate it as emerging space leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. We currently offer multiple products that combine digital technology with the unmatched scale and expertise of our Tax Pro network to ensure taxpayers can access H&R Block, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between.
In our DIY products, clients have access to help through live chat while preparing their return. This is something we've offered for years. It is a great way to get a question answered by an expert.
Tax Pro Review is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from knowing that one of our highly trained experts has reviewed their source documents as well as their entire return to identify all available credits and deductions. At the end of the process, our Tax Pro then signs and files the returns.
Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering, addresses the needs of consumers who want assistance, but don't want or has time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents through the secured MyBlock portal and work virtually with a Tax Pro matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed and filed by H&R Block. New products like Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review, we continue to be the only company to either complete or fully review a taxpayer's return virtually and then sign it, reflecting our commitment to stand behind the work and our clients. We're excited about the future of virtual and this start to how we will innovate to serve more clients in more ways.
As we outlined on our June call, we are investing in 3 specific areas in fiscal '19, price, technology and operational excellence.
With respect to price, the reductions we've discussed will be targeted to assisted consumer segments, where we believe we can win. The impact of these pricing reductions is reflected in our fiscal '19 revenue outlook as a one-time reset. We'll share more about our plans for pricing as we get closer to the tax season.
With technology, we're making investments to modernize our platforms to enable more innovation and greater agility and to reduce spend over time. There are 4 key areas of investment. First, we're building a new tax engine, which will consolidate multiple systems, creating efficiencies and eliminating unnecessary and redundant work.
Second, we're investing in cross-channel capabilities to enable a seamless client experience to cross platforms, something that will be key as we innovate in virtual. Third, we're migrating our physical data centers to the cloud, which is more appropriate for the seasonality of our operating model and will allow us to be more agile and reduced costs. And fourth, we're optimizing our data architecture and analytics platform to allow for faster and deeper insight into trends in our business. These investments are key to ensuring we achieve our long-term strategic objectives and will require elevated spend over the next several years.
With respect to operational excellence, we're focused on improving the quality and consistency of service delivery in our offices.  This work ranges from better execution of standard operating procedures to enhancing and differentiating the new client experience. While our overall retention rate is 73%, our new client retention is significantly lower. Taking steps to improve the experience for new clients in order to improve retention is crucial for future growth.
This work is the foundation to achieve our overall objectives of growing clients, revenue and earnings over the long term, all of which are necessary for a successful H&R Block. These investments are critical, and we do not intend them to result in continued margin declines in future years as we expect them to be offset by both top line growth and operating efficiencies. Specifically, our expectation for long-term sustainable growth includes assisted client growth, including increased new client retention, continued DIY market share gains, an industry-leading position in virtual and revenue and earnings growth over time.
In summary, we're excited for the steps we're taking in 2019. We will continue to share more details as we approach the tax season, and we'll update you on our progress. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our first quarter financial results and outlook."

Before I get into the details of our Q1 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal first quarter due to seasonality of our business. Therefore, first quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $7 million or 5% to $145 million. This is primarily a result of timing of revenues related to our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products, partially offset by lower revenues from refund transfer. 
Turning to expense. Total operating expense has increased $4 million or 1% to $327 million, primarily due to increased compensation and consulting expenses, which were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and bad debt expense.
Also included in operating expenses were payments of $1 million related to our footprint optimization. The revenue increased due to improvement in pretax loss and continuing operations of $6 million or 3%. Loss per share, however, increased $0.10 to $0.72 due to a lower effective tax rate, which negatively impacts quarters with a seasonal loss. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was in line with our outlook at 25% compared to 38% in the prior year.
Turning to discontinued operations. There were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.
Moving on to capital allocation. On our June call, we announced we will return into opportunistic share repurchase and would have a minimum repurchase enough shares to offset dilution from equity grants. During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million. The average purchase price was $23.27. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach going forward.
I'd now like to provide some additional context on the fiscal '19 outlook we discussed last quarter, which reflected the investments to enable our strategic objectives. Overall, we continue to expect fiscal '19 results to be in line with the outlook we provided in June. As a reminder, we expect total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%.
All of the revenue outlook reduction is due to our investment and price, partially offset by DIY, international and franchise buybacks and also represents approximately half of the change in EBITDA from fiscal '18. EBITDA was further impacted by the one-time cost related to our footprint optimization of $15 million to $20 million. The majority of this amount will be recognized in the second quarter. The remainder of the reduction in EBITDA is attributable to the technology investments mentioned by Jeff, as well as inflationary increases in expenses.
While much of the focus has been on our margin, the midpoint of our outlook results in earnings per share at levels comparable to fiscal '17. Essentially, we are investing the benefit of lower corporate taxes back into the business, with the intent to grow revenue and earnings in fiscal '20 and beyond.
In summary, our robust cash generation and healthy balance sheet have enabled us to make the strategic investments in our business, which will position us to grow clients, revenue and earnings sustainably over time. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

A very simple example of that is when consumers understand that this was a brand that's available year around to help them that we don't close after tax season is over.

I'm just trying to highlight that it's a broader story than just EBITDA margin because you have to go all the way to the bottom of the P&L.

So -- and the vast majority of those taxpayers use assistance to get help. So when you take everything into account, the history of message shift over time, tax changes over time, we see consumer from consumer research that our own research and third-party research we know consumers are confused about taxes went into the year. So our belief is that, in the near term we don't see big shifts in method type. And over the longer-term, we think we have to be positioned to serve clients however they want to be served.

It's clearly an area where our overall retention has moved several hundred basis points over the last few years so we know we can improve it. But new client retention is just a lot lower. And so we're focusing on plans this year to how to really attack those new clients that come to us for the first time.

It's been about a year since I joined H&R Block and I've even more excited about the future of this company. The tax industry continues to grow in both the assisted and DIY channels. And we're executing a strategy to take advantage of opportunities in each, plus developing new products to digitally enable human health and care, so H&R Block is available to people in any way they choose. Of course, all of this is stacked by solid cash flow and a strong financial position, allowing us to effectively balance investing for the future while continuing to opportunistically return capital to shareholders and create long-term value.
On today's call, I want to spend time framing the opportunities we see and provide additional context for our strategy regarding the structure and evolution of the tax industry, how we're positioning H&R Block to win and the initiatives and investments we're making in fiscal '19.  Tony will provide details on our first quarter results, which were in line with expectations, as well as additional insight into our fiscal '19 outlook.
Let's start by talking about the industry and why we see opportunities in both the assisted and DIY categories. The Tax Plus industry has enjoyed stable and steady growth over decades. Since 2005, the industry grew on average 1% per year with assisted growing at an annual rate of 0.3% and DIY at 2.1%. And more recently, the assisted category has grown 2 out of the last 3 years. This growth has led to an increase in overall industry revenue as well, which currently stands at $21 billion. And while 56% of all filings are done with the help of a tax professional, the assisted category represents the vast majority of industry revenues at approximately 87%. A common question I've heard over the past few months is, why would consumers choose assisted when low-cost technology-enabled DIY solutions make it attractive to do taxes on your own? The answer is that we continue to see the primary driver in choosing a method to be a person's confidence with taxes much more so than the complexity of their situation, their comfort level with technology, their age, changes to tax laws or the cost to file. A proof point is the millions of consumers who use a tax preparer just file a 1040EZ. These filers typically have a single W-2, no dependents or deductions and few if any credits. Taxes cannot get any simpler, yet they still seek assistance because they want to know their taxes are done right and someone is standing behind them should questions arise.
Secondary to confidence in making a decision about tax preparation is convenience and costs. The definition of convenience varies for many consumers. Some may find it most convenient to stop by an office to have their taxes prepared in person, while others may find it most convenient to do their taxes themselves from the comfort of home. For all these reasons, we continue to see sustainable demand for both assisted and DIY, and we're excited about the opportunities in both.
To this point, much of what I have discussed is focused on the 2 filing methods that have defined the industry for the past several decades. This binary choice is evolving as consumer expectations change. While the tax industry is early in this evolution to virtual, it creates opportunities for us, which I'll discuss more in a minute.
To wrap up on the industry, I'd like to spend just a minute on the recent updates to the tax code and how they may impact consumers. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous tax code changes and historically, they have not resulted in major swings in filing behavior. While tax rates are lower, we don't expect people to notice much of a difference when it comes to preparing their taxes. Even those who no longer itemize deductions will gather the same documents they have in the past and will provide the same information to determine whether to take the standard deduction. Many filers who take the standard deduction also qualify for various credits and that process is largely unchanged.
Of course, it's hard to predict exactly how consumers will react to the upcoming tax season and whether this will cause a change from recent filing trends. That said, our assessment of these changes, combined with historical consumer filing behaviors, lead us to believe there will not be significant changes in the patterns we've seen in recent years. 
For these reasons, we continue to believe that the overall industry will grow 1% to 2% for tax season '19, with assisted returns flat-to-slightly up and DIY returns up 2% to 3%.
Clearly, there is opportunity in this industry. And given our 14% market share in both the assisted and DIY categories, we have significant runway for growth. I'd now like to provide additional details on the overarching objectives guiding our work for 2019.
Starting with the assisted business. We are focused on improving the value we deliver, including an investment in price, developing and delivering on a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block to consumers and improving the quality and consistency of our service delivery in the tax office. 
In our DIY business, we will continue to invest to improve the product and user experience. We will price at a level that is competitive and provides value to our clients. And we will continue to communicate this value, growing awareness and compelling consumers to switch to H&R Block.
And in virtual, we will innovate it as emerging space leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. We currently offer multiple products that combine digital technology with the unmatched scale and expertise of our Tax Pro network to ensure taxpayers can access H&R Block, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between.
In our DIY products, clients have access to help through live chat while preparing their return. This is something we've offered for years. It is a great way to get a question answered by an expert.
Tax Pro Review is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from knowing that one of our highly trained experts has reviewed their source documents as well as their entire return to identify all available credits and deductions. At the end of the process, our Tax Pro then signs and files the returns.
Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering, addresses the needs of consumers who want assistance, but don't want or have time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents through the secured MyBlock portal and work virtually with a Tax Pro matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed and filed by H&R Block. Through products like Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review, we continue to be the only company to either complete or fully review a taxpayer's return virtually and then sign it, reflecting our commitment to stand behind the work and our clients. We're excited about the future of virtual and this start to how we will innovate to serve more clients in more ways.
As we outlined on our June call, we are investing in 3 specific areas in fiscal '19: price, technology and operational excellence.
With respect to price, the reductions we've discussed will be targeted to assisted consumer segments, where we believe we can win. The impact of these pricing reductions is reflected in our fiscal '19 revenue outlook as a one-time reset. We'll share more about our plans for pricing as we get closer to the tax season.
With technology, we're making investments to modernize our platforms to enable more innovation and greater agility and to reduce spend over time. There are 4 key areas of investment. First, we're building a new tax engine, which will consolidate multiple systems, creating efficiencies and eliminating unnecessary and redundant work.
Second, we're investing in cross-channel capabilities to enable a seamless client experience across platforms, something that will be key as we innovate in virtual. Third, we're migrating our physical data centers to the cloud, which is more appropriate for the seasonality of our operating model and will allow us to be more agile and reduce costs. And fourth, we're optimizing our data architecture and analytics platform to allow for faster and deeper insight into trends in our business. These investments are key to ensuring we achieve our long-term strategic objectives and will require elevated spend over the next several years.
With respect to operational excellence, we're focused on improving the quality and consistency of service delivery in our offices.  This work ranges from better execution of standard operating procedures to enhancing and differentiating the new client experience. While our overall retention rate is 73%, our new client retention is significantly lower. Taking steps to improve the experience for new clients in order to improve retention is crucial for future growth.
This work is the foundation to achieve our overall objectives of growing clients, revenue and earnings over the long term, all of which are necessary for a successful H&R Block. These investments are critical, and we do not intend them to result in continued margin declines in future years as we expect them to be offset by both top line growth and operating efficiencies. Specifically, our expectation for long-term sustainable growth includes assisted client growth, including increased new client retention, continued DIY market share gains, an industry-leading position in virtual and revenue and earnings growth over time.
In summary, we're excited for the steps we're taking in 2019. We will continue to share more details as we approach the tax season, and we'll update you on our progress. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our first quarter financial results and outlook."

Before I get into the details of our Q1 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal first quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, first quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $7 million or 5% to $145 million. This is primarily a result of timing of revenues related to our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products, partially offset by lower revenues from refund transfer. 
Turning to expense. Total operating expense has increased $4 million or 1% to $327 million, primarily due to increased compensation and consulting expenses, which were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and bad debt expense.

Also included in operating expenses were payments of $1 million related to our footprint optimization. The revenue increased due to improvement in pretax loss from continuing operations of $6 million or 3%. Loss per share, however, increased $0.10 to $0.72 due to a lower effective tax rate, which negatively impacts quarters with a seasonal loss. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was in line with our outlook at 25% compared to 38% in the prior year.
Turning to discontinued operations. There were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.
Moving on to capital allocation. On our June call, we announced we were returning to opportunistic share repurchases and would have a minimum repurchase enough shares to offset dilution from equity grants. During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million. The average purchase price was $23.27. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach going forward.
I'd now like to provide some additional context on the fiscal '19 outlook we discussed last quarter, which reflected the investments to enable our strategic objectives. Overall, we continue to expect fiscal '19 results to be in line with the outlook we provided in June. As a reminder, we expect total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%.
All of the revenue outlook reduction is due to our investment in price, partially offset by DIY, international and franchise buybacks and also represents approximately half of the change in EBITDA from fiscal '18. EBITDA was further impacted by the one-time cost related to our footprint optimization of $15 million to $20 million. The majority of this amount will be recognized in the second quarter. The remainder of the reduction in EBITDA is attributable to the technology investments mentioned by Jeff, as well as inflationary increases in expenses.
While much of the focus has been on our margin, the midpoint of our outlook results in earnings per share at levels comparable to fiscal '17. Essentially, we are investing the benefit of lower corporate taxes back into the business, with the intent to grow revenue and earnings in fiscal '20 and beyond.
In summary, our robust cash generation and healthy balance sheet have enabled us to make the strategic investments in our business, which will position us to grow clients, revenue and earnings sustainably over time. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

A very simple example of that is when consumers understand that this was a brand that's available year around to help them that we don't close after tax season is over. As simple as that sounds, those are the kind of really specific proof points that will be part of our marketing message because we know it helps consumers to understand the ultimate value that we provide.

I'm just trying to highlight that it's a broader story than just EBITDA margin because you have to go all the way to the bottom of the P&L.

So -- and the vast majority of those taxpayers use assistance to get help. So when you take everything into account, the history of message shift over time, tax changes over time, we see consumer -- from consumer research that our own research and third-party research we know consumers are confused about taxes going into the year.

It's clearly an area where our overall retention has moved several hundred basis points over the last few years so we know we can improve it. But new client retention is just a lot lower. And so we're focusing on plans this year to how to really attack those new clients that come to us for the first time.

It's been about a year since I joined H&R Block and I've even more excited about the future of this company. The tax industry continues to grow in both the assisted and DIY channels. And we're executing a strategy to take advantage of opportunities in each, plus developing new products to digitally enable human health and care, so H&R Block is available to people in any way they choose. Of course, all of this is stacked by solid cash flow and a strong financial position, allowing us to effectively balance investing for the future while continuing to opportunistically return capital to shareholders and create long-term value.
On today's call, I want to spend time framing the opportunities we see and provide additional context for our strategy regarding the structure and evolution of the tax industry, how we're positioning H&R Block to win and the initiatives and investments we're making in fiscal '19.  Tony will provide details on our first quarter results, which were in line with expectations, as well as additional insight into our fiscal '19 outlook.
Let's start by talking about the industry and why we see opportunities in both the assisted and DIY categories. The Tax Plus industry has enjoyed stable and steady growth over decades. Since 2005, the industry grew on average 1% per year with assisted growing at an annual rate of 0.3% and DIY at 2.1%. And more recently, the assisted category has grown 2 out of the last 3 years. This growth has led to an increase in overall industry revenue as well, which currently stands at $21 billion. And while 56% of all filings are done with the help of a tax professional, the assisted category represents the vast majority of industry revenues at approximately 87%. A common question I've heard over the past few months is, why would consumers choose assisted when low-cost technology-enabled DIY solutions make it attractive to do taxes on your own? The answer is that we continue to see the primary driver in choosing a method to be a person's confidence with taxes much more so than the complexity of their situation, their comfort level with technology, their age, changes to tax laws or the cost to file. A proof point is the millions of consumers who use a tax preparer just file a 1040EZ. These filers typically have a single W-2, no dependents or deductions and few if any credits. Taxes cannot get any simpler, yet they still seek assistance because they want to know their taxes are done right and someone is standing behind them should questions arise.
Secondary to confidence in making a decision about tax preparation is convenience and costs. The definition of convenience varies for many consumers. Some may find it most convenient to stop by an office to have their taxes prepared in person, while others may find it most convenient to do their taxes themselves from the comfort of home. For all these reasons, we continue to see sustainable demand for both assisted and DIY, and we're excited about the opportunities in both.
To this point, much of what I have discussed is focused on the 2 filing methods that have defined the industry for the past several decades. This binary choice is evolving as consumer expectations change. While the tax industry is early in this evolution to virtual, it creates opportunities for us, which I'll discuss more in a minute.
To wrap up on the industry, I'd like to spend just a minute on the recent updates to the tax code and how they may impact consumers. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous tax code changes and historically, they have not resulted in major swings in filing behavior. While tax rates are lower, we don't expect people to notice much of a difference when it comes to preparing their taxes. Even those who no longer itemize deductions will gather the same documents they have in the past and will provide the same information to determine whether to take the standard deduction. Many filers who take the standard deduction also qualify for various credits and that process is largely unchanged.
Of course, it's hard to predict exactly how consumers will react to the upcoming tax season and whether this will cause a change from recent filing trends. That said, our assessment of these changes, combined with historical consumer filing behaviors, lead us to believe there will not be significant changes in the patterns we've seen in recent years. 
For these reasons, we continue to believe that the overall industry will grow 1% to 2% for tax season '19, with assisted returns flat-to-slightly up and DIY returns up 2% to 3%.
Clearly, there is opportunity in this industry. And given our 14% market share in both the assisted and DIY categories, we have significant runway for growth. I'd now like to provide additional details on the overarching objectives guiding our work for 2019.
Starting with the assisted business. We are focused on improving the value we deliver, including an investment in price, developing and delivering on a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block to consumers and improving the quality and consistency of our service delivery in the tax office. 
In our DIY business, we will continue to invest to improve the product and user experience. We will price at a level that is competitive and provides value to our clients. And we will continue to communicate this value, growing awareness and compelling consumers to switch to H&R Block.
And in virtual, we will innovate it as emerging space leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. We currently offer multiple products that combine digital technology with the unmatched scale and expertise of our Tax Pro network to ensure taxpayers can access H&R Block, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between.
In our DIY products, clients have access to help through live chat while preparing their return. This is something we've offered for years. It is a great way to get a question answered by an expert.
Tax Pro Review is a powerful way for our DIY clients to benefit from knowing that one of our highly trained experts has reviewed their source documents as well as their entire return to identify all available credits and deductions. At the end of the process, our Tax Pro then signs and files the returns.
Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering, addresses the needs of consumers who want assistance, but don't want or have time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents through the secured MyBlock portal and work virtually with a Tax Pro matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed and filed by H&R Block. Through products like Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review, we continue to be the only company to either complete or fully review a taxpayer's return virtually and then sign it, reflecting our commitment to stand behind the work and our clients. We're excited about the future of virtual and this start to how we will innovate to serve more clients in more ways.
As we outlined on our June call, we are investing in 3 specific areas in fiscal '19: price, technology and operational excellence.
With respect to price, the reductions we've discussed will be targeted to assisted consumer segments, where we believe we can win. The impact of these pricing reductions is reflected in our fiscal '19 revenue outlook as a one-time reset. We'll share more about our plans for pricing as we get closer to the tax season.
With technology, we're making investments to modernize our platforms to enable more innovation and greater agility and to reduce spend over time. There are 4 key areas of investment. First, we're building a new tax engine, which will consolidate multiple systems, creating efficiencies and eliminating unnecessary and redundant work.
Second, we're investing in cross-channel capabilities to enable a seamless client experience across platforms, something that will be key as we innovate in virtual. Third, we're migrating our physical data centers to the cloud, which is more appropriate for the seasonality of our operating model and will allow us to be more agile and reduce costs. And fourth, we're optimizing our data architecture and analytics platform to allow for faster and deeper insight into trends in our business. These investments are key to ensuring we achieve our long-term strategic objectives and will require elevated spend over the next several years.
With respect to operational excellence, we're focused on improving the quality and consistency of service delivery in our offices.  This work ranges from better execution of standard operating procedures to enhancing and differentiating the new client experience. While our overall retention rate is 73%, our new client retention is significantly lower. Taking steps to improve the experience for new clients in order to improve retention is crucial for future growth.
This work is the foundation to achieve our overall objectives of growing clients, revenue and earnings over the long term, all of which are necessary for a successful H&R Block. These investments are critical, and we do not intend them to result in continued margin declines in future years as we expect them to be offset by both top line growth and operating efficiencies. Specifically, our expectation for long-term sustainable growth includes assisted client growth, including increased new client retention, continued DIY market share gains, an industry-leading position in virtual and revenue and earnings growth over time.
In summary, we're excited for the steps we're taking in 2019. We will continue to share more details as we approach the tax season, and we'll update you on our progress. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our first quarter financial results and outlook."

Before I get into the details of our Q1 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal first quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, first quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $7 million or 5% to $145 million. This is primarily a result of timing of revenues related to our Peace of Mind and Tax Identity Shield products, partially offset by lower revenues from refund transfer. 
Turning to expense. Total operating expense has increased $4 million or 1% to $327 million, primarily due to increased compensation and consulting expenses, which were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and bad debt expense.

Also included in operating expenses were payments of $1 million related to our footprint optimization. The revenue increased due to improvement in pretax loss from continuing operations of $6 million or 3%. Loss per share, however, increased $0.10 to $0.72 due to a lower effective tax rate, which negatively impacts quarters with a seasonal loss. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was in line with our outlook at 25% compared to 38% in the prior year.
Turning to discontinued operations. There were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings.
Moving on to capital allocation. On our June call, we announced we were returning to opportunistic share repurchases and would have a minimum repurchase enough shares to offset dilution from equity grants. During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million. The average purchase price was $23.27. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach going forward.
I'd now like to provide some additional context on the fiscal '19 outlook we discussed last quarter, which reflected the investments to enable our strategic objectives. Overall, we continue to expect fiscal '19 results to be in line with the outlook we provided in June. As a reminder, we expect total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%.
All of the revenue outlook reduction is due to our investment in price, partially offset by DIY, international and franchise buybacks and also represents approximately half of the change in EBITDA from fiscal '18. EBITDA was further impacted by the one-time cost related to our footprint optimization of $15 million to $20 million. The majority of this amount will be recognized in the second quarter. The remainder of the reduction in EBITDA is attributable to the technology investments mentioned by Jeff, as well as inflationary increases in expenses.
While much of the focus has been on our margin, the midpoint of our outlook results in earnings per share at levels comparable to fiscal '17. Essentially, we are investing the benefit of lower corporate taxes back into the business, with the intent to grow revenue and earnings in fiscal '20 and beyond.
In summary, our robust cash generation and healthy balance sheet have enabled us to make the strategic investments in our business, which will position us to grow clients, revenue and earnings sustainably over time. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

A very simple example of that is when consumers understand that this was a brand that's available year around to help them that we don't close after tax season is over. As simple as that sounds, those are the kind of really specific proof points that will be part of our marketing message because we know it helps consumers to understand the ultimate value that we provide.

So we're not providing the guidance, we're just doing a reference point to say that it's in the zone of FY '17, which is trying to highlight the point that we're essentially taking the corporate tax benefit that we've received on a run-rate basis and investing it back into the business. I'm just trying to highlight that it's a broader story than just EBITDA margin because you have to go all the way to the bottom of the P&L. Specific to EZ, obviously, with the single 1040 that the IRS announced and has been working on changes, changes that a little bit. We'll share additional details on our second quarter call for specific promotions, and how we're thinking about it for the upcoming season.

So -- and the vast majority of those taxpayers use assistance to get help. So when you take everything into account, the history of message shift over time, tax changes over time, we see consumer -- from consumer research that our own research and third-party research we know consumers are confused about taxes going into the year.

And so we're focusing on plans this year to how to really attack those new clients that come to us for the first time.

We appreciate everyone being flexible with the change in call time in honor of the late President George Bush. We've been -- the past several months focused on executing our plans for the upcoming tax season. I want to thank our associates, tax pros and franchisees for all they're doing to ensure we're ready to serve our clients as the season gets underway. We're taking the right steps toward long-term growth in clients, revenue and earnings and ultimately value for our shareholders. I continue to be excited for this season and for the future of our company. 
On today's call, I'll give a brief recap of our key objectives for the year, followed by how we bring new strategy to life in tax season '19. Tony will then provide details on our second quarter results and additional insight into our fiscal '19 outlook. 
As a reminder, we announced our long-term enterprise strategy in June and provided more detail on our Q1 call in August including our key objectives by channel. To recap, in our assisted business, we're focused on including the value we deliver to our clients, developing and delivering on a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block and improving the quality and consistency of our service delivery in the tax office. 
In our DIY business, we're investing to improve the product and user experience, pricing at a level that is competitive and provides value to our client clients and communicating this value to grow awareness and compel DIY consumers to switch to H&R Block. 
And in virtual, we will continue to innovate, leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. By combining digital technology with the unmatched scale and expertise of our tax pro network, we will ensure taxpayers can access H&R Block whether they need little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between. 
With those objectives as a backdrop, I'd now like to talk about the tangible ways we're bringing the strategy to live in the upcoming season. Let me start with an area in which we're making significant changes to improve our value proposition, our approach to pricing. In June, we announced that we will be investing in price decreases for certain segments of our assisted clients. Then in mid-October, we announced an important change in our approach, which is not only new for our business but represents a complete shift for the industry as a whole, upfront transparent pricing. 
So I'd like to share what led us to make these changes and what it means for consumers. Over the past year, we took a critical look at all aspects of our business and it is clear that pricing was a pain point. And it was not just about the amount but also the way prices were determined and communicated. 
In the Assisted category, we, along with the rest of our industry, have traditionally determined the price after the return was completed, leaving many in the dark throughout much of the process. This does not meet the expectations of today's consumer who wan tas much information as possible prior to getting started. This approach was a point of frustration for our current clients and also a barrier to attracting new clients who were willing to give our brand a chance without knowing what it is going to cost. The feedback we received from our clients and tax pros clearly conveyed that the approach the pricing added even more stress to what for many of our clients is already a stressful event. Specifically, they told us, pricing shouldn't be a mystery. Nothing else they purchase in life is okay. Online, they don't want to start at one price and finish at another with no idea why, and a person's price should be -- given their situation, not one-size-fits-all. 
So we knew the pricing was something we had to address in meaningful ways, but it wasn't a surprise to us. The decision to move to upfront transparent pricing is one that we've researched the past 2 years and is tested in select markets. We were pleased with the feedback and results we priced at, giving us confidence to making its move to do the right thing for our clients and for our company. I'm proud that H&R Block is leading the industry by offering upfront transparent pricing so consumers know the price before they begin as well as throughout the entire process. No mystery, no surprises and no hidden fees. 
In the office, the process of determining price can be done in 3 simple steps. First, the client identifies his her price based on the situation, then as the state return is needed and finally adds any additional item such as investments for business income. Nearly half of our clients will not have any of these items, meaning they -- pricing in 2 simple steps, and our tax pros will be there to help them to answer any questions and to provide a positive experience. 
In addition to the move to upfront transparent pricing, we are lowering prices for millions of our assisted clients. These reductions are targeted to consumer segments where we can compete most effectively and win. A significant portion of our client base will see the positive impacts with 1/3 paying at least 10% less than last year. 
There's one additional update in the Assisted business I'd like to talk about. Given the changes to the 1040 forms for the upcoming season, which included the elimination of the 1040EZ, we will no longer run the 1040EZ promotion. While 3 EZ brought new clients to our brand, they were increasingly expensive to acquire and had low lifetime value when compared to other client segments. So while eliminating this promotion will have a negative impact on assisted volume, it will partially offset the price decreases from a net average charge perspective. These changes are concentrated in our revenue outlook for the year, which Tony will discuss later in the call. 
In addition to pricing changes in our assisted business, we're also making enhancements in DIY. We will continue to price aggressively to encourage consumers to switch to our brand. An extension of this aggressive posture is how we are taking price transparency to another level for the DIY consumer. Our prices have always been stated up front, but as clients move to the process, the price should change, and they wouldn't know what they were ultimately going to pay until the very end. To address this, we're launching DIY price premium so clients will know in realtime when their price changes and why. We believe this will set a new industry expectation for DIY consumers over time. 
Finally in virtual, we will continue our upfront pricing approach, with Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review products. We will also continue to test throughout the upcoming season to ensure our products are optimally priced. We're excited for our clients to experience upfront transparent pricing as it will enhance the value they received and create one more reason to choose H&R Block. But a new pricing approach is just one of the many changes H&R Block is making to create a more modern, innovative consumer-focused brand. We're creating a client experience that demonstrates our expertise. It's tailored to each individual. It's available year round, and it's backed by a company that cares. And while it is not the first time we've discussed operational improvements, I believe the changes we are making this season are important steps to set us up for success over time. 
In our Assisted business, we're making a number of improvements to enhance the client experience that will benefit both new and existing clients. Our clients will receive greater help in planning for the future through an improved tax estimator to deliver key fast tips and more robust W-4 planning, both of which address the implications of tax reform. We're responding to the feedback from -- for a paperless experience, making it even easier to set up a secure MyBlock account for year-round access to their return. We're increasing the prominence of our drop-off service, which some find easier and more convenient than with the Tax Pro while their taxes are completed. Drop-off services always been available in our offices, but we haven't done a good job letting people know it's an option. 
For our field leaders, we have simplified and focused their efforts on the most essential operational protocols, was dedicated significantly more effort to training and certification and has elevated the performance expectations for key seasonal roles like office managers. 
And finally, we're enhancing and differentiating the experience for clients through our new H&R Block that demonstrate the value we provide in more tangible ways. 
It's also important to note that our franchise network is as engaged and excited as they've ever been. I've been delighted to see the number of franchisees who have embraced not only the client experience enhancements but also our upfront transparent pricing model. We also saw record participation by our franchisee at our convention in October and are seeing real momentum with our franchise base. 
Looking to DIY, we've made a number of enhancements to our product. First, we've improved the experience for mobile users to give more visibility to where they are in the process. We also continue to leverage data to make our products smarter and more personalized. By targeting questions relevant to the user, we are reducing the amount of streams to client feeds, in some cases, reducing the number of questions they need to answer by more than half. 
Another key area is the significant improvements we've made and how we provide help throughout the user experience. We've redesigned the help center to give client easier access to self-help. We're introducing a virtual assistant by leveraging machine learning to deliver quick answers. And finally, we're making it easier to get live product health. These improvements will eliminate Great Plains and experience and ultimately drive conversion. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce a brand new online service we will be launching called after Tax Pro. Those who choose this service will have a limited immediate access to a Tax Pro to answer their tax-related questions at any point in the experience. For years, our clients have had the ability to chat online with a highly qualified Tax Pro if the needed help. This new service now includes browsing capabilities, allowing our Tax Pros to work directly on the client stream to guide them to the answers they need. Clients can choose to interact with a Tax Pro through chat or phone, whichever is most convenient for them. 
It is yet another innovation that connects our clients to the expertise of our Tax Pros. We expect after tax pro to be the best value in the industry for those consumers who are confident doing taxes themselves but has a few questions along the way. This innovation mindset is driving our efforts to meet consumers' evolving needs as we continuously evaluate new ways to connect clients to help. To that end, we've made considerable improvement in our virtual hubs, Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review. 
Tax Pro Go, our virtual assisted offering, which was designed and optimized for mobile users, addresses the needs of consumers that want assistance or don't want or don't have the time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents to the MyBlock portal and work virtually with the Tax Pro matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed and filed by H&R Block. Our beta soft launch at Tax Pro Go last season has the goals of understanding who would be attracted to this product and refining the experience. We were pleased with the client this product attracted to the brand, with 70% being new to H&R Block and 55% being under 35 years old, demonstrating Tax Pro Go's ability to drive new clients and millennials to H&R Block. This year, we're continuing to improve the experience with more streamlined workflow, improved document upload and getting client the ability to schedule an upfront phone consultation with their assigned Tax Pro. 
Our second virtual product, Tax Pro Review, is a powerful way for our DIY clients to connect with one of our highly trained experts to review their source documents as well as their entire return and identify all available credit and deductions. At the end of the process, our tax pros then sign and file the return and clients can access the Tax Pro anytime during the year for any questions that may come up. We continue to make enhancements to Tax Pro Review to better demonstrate the benefits of working with an expert in this capacity. Additionally, we've optimized our network of tax pros completing these returns and have made improvements to the end-to-end mobile experience. Everything we just discussed across the Assisted, DIY and virtual spectrum shows our commitment to unmatched capability to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company. 
In addition to the improvements in pricing, client experience and virtual, we continue to look for ways to provide solutions through promotional offerings and partnerships. That's why we bring back key promotions in partnership this year that contributed to our performance in tax season '18. We will again offer refund advance, providing our clients early access to their money, in most cases on the same day in which they filed their taxes. Our loan amounts will be up to $3,000 and we're proud that our loans will remain 100% interest-free with no fee to the consumer. This contrasts with our offers that will have higher loan amounts but include interest charges. We will again be the exclusive provider of desktop software at Walmart and we'll have an aggressive program in place with Amazon. 
Additionally, for self-employed filers, we are continuing our partnership with Stride to give our clients the ability to track and -- into their return. Finally, we will provide access to free credit scores for our client in all our channels through our partnership with LendingTree. 
None of this matters if we don't effectively reach consumers and communicate the value we're delivering. So we're making changes to systematically improve our ability to acquire, retain and engage clients. We're utilizing improved data analytics and enhanced marketing techniques to optimize spend, deliver unique messages to include micro segment in the market and ultimately improve our ROI. This modern approach is key in building brand relevance and attracting new clients. 
To wrap up, we've made many significant improvements to our business across a number of areas, including pricing, client experience, operational excellence, virtual products, promotion and partnerships, demonstrating our commitment to delivering for our clients. Our product offering is the most robust it's been in the history of our company. We're innovating and taking bold steps to disrupt the industry to ensure that we compete not only this season but for the long term. In short, we're excited about our future and for the season to begin. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our second quarter financial results and outlook."
276601,591866991,1623464,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2019 Earnings Call, Dec 06, 2018",2018-12-06,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone.

Before I get into the details of our Q2 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal second quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, second quarter results are not representative of our full year performance. 
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $8 million or 6% to $149 million. This is primarily the result of increased assisted tax prep revenues and the timing of revenues related to our tax advantage shield product, partially offset by lower international revenues which were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates. 
Turning to our expense. Total operating expenses increased $7 million or 2% to $364 million, primarily due to onetime cost of $10 million related to our office footprint optimization as well as increased compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and marketing expense. The increases in revenue and operating expenses, combined with an increase in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and higher cash balances, drove an improvement in pretax loss from continuing operations of $4 million or 2%. While we saw an improvement in pretax loss, our loss per share increased $0.12 to $0.83. This was due to our lower tax benefit compared to last year as the lower corporate tax rate negatively impacts quarters due to seasonal loss. 
Turning to discontinued operations. There were no changes in accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. 
Turning to capital. Our priorities remain unchanged. We first focus on maintaining adequate liquidity to fund the business. We then look to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. We then fund our dividend, which we've done consistently since going public. And then finally, we look to opportunistically return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and, at a minimum, plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants. We do not refer to shares during to the most recent quarter but have repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million for the fiscal year. 
I now like to provide some thoughts on our fiscal '19 outlook. Starting with the tax industry, we anticipate overall returns to grow 1% to 2% in tax season '19, consistent with historical trends and the current low unemployment environment. As we shared on our Q1 call, we don't anticipate the recent tax legislation to have a material impact on the method filers use to prepare to taxes. Our research confirms that many filers are confused and will be looking for help this tax season. As a result, we anticipate assisted industry volume to be flat to slightly up, with the remainder of the industry growth coming in DIY. Overall, we expect the industry volumes to be very similar to the trends we've seen over the last few years. 
Specific to H&R Block, we expect to continue our trend of achieving overall client growth, driven by DIY and partially offset by a decline in Assisted due to the discontinuation of the free EZ promotion. The change in free EZ will impact the early part of the season and will be reflected in the results through February that we will release in early March. 
With respect to pricing, our new approach will result in a lower net average charge in our Assisted business. While we expect a net average charge to decline, it will be impacted by positive mix as we expect to serve fewer, free EZ type clients. 
In DIY, we expect our net average charge to be consistent with last year as we continue to focus on outpacing the category and returns and gaining market share. While there is some trade-down risk within DIY due to the new tax legislation which would negatively impact our net average charge, we believe that risk will largely be offset by after tax pro and favorable mix. We are confirming our previously provided guidance as we continue to expect total revenues at $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which takes into account the volume and pricing expectations I just shared. We're also maintaining our previously provided outlook at EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%. 
Moving on to the other items in our financial outlook. As we previously shared, fiscal '18 represented a high watermark for depreciation and amortization as we see the impact of office upgrade and franchise buybacks from several years ago roll out. We expect D&A to decline in fiscal '19 and be $165 million to $175 million. As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is related to CapEx while the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. We expect to spend approximately 3% of revenues on capital expenditures in fiscal '19 or $95 million to $105 million. 
With respect to acquisitions, we anticipate repurchasing approximately 125 franchise locations, which was better than we originally expected and adding approximately 45 independent locations to our network for a total capital investment of approximately $40 million. As a reminder, both franchise repurchases and independent acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our current trading multiple and as such are accretive to earnings. Beyond this year, we expect our franchise repurchase activity to moderate. 
For fiscal '19, we expect total interest expense to be $80 million to $85 million, driven by lower borrowing needs, offset by higher interest rates. 
Before I turn it back over to Jeff, I just want to share my excitement for the upcoming tax season. We have a great plan to put H&R Block on the path to long-term sustainable growth and I'm looking forward to seeing our plan come to life in the coming months. With that, over to you, Jeff, for some closing thoughts."

So I think H&R Block will demand some level of premium relative to a lot of the other offerings in the marketplace. Specific to your question on what type of premium, where are we at, it really depends. I think across the spectrum and different client complexity, our premiums vary. Obviously, on the simple land, the free EZ, and we were very competitive last year given we had the free EZ motion. I think given our pricing had over time, we definitely identified certain client segments where we were very much above the market average, if you will. The consumers don't really deal the average, and it's impossible to shop the average, but we know in certain segments and in certain geographies, there's definitely places that we were well above the market, and we're taking the opportunity as part of this reset to try to fix most of those and bring as much more in line and use pricing as a catalyst to try to return us to client growth. That being said, it's well beyond pricing. Pricing is one aspect of what we're trying to do the overall value proposition and all the elements that we're making, the changes we are making that all eventually going to allow us to be successful."

We've also seen that is just not the price the consumer was paying, it was the fact they had no idea what it was going to cost. And so when I think about our approach to pricing, there are really 3 different components. The first component is really about the fact that they'll know the price before they begin. The second is how easy it will be for them to figure out what their price is, and then the third will be the actual price, and so we're really thinking about all 3 of these elements."

We have ran various tests and that we're constantly doing on different pricing approaches. Several years ago, we used to have a version of the pricing board in our offices, and that may be what you're remembering. It's probably been 4 or 5 years ago. I think the main difference between that and what we really want now is that gave clients an indication of a range, but where they may fall, they fall based on a particular life situation. But the challenge with that model was the ranges were incredibly wide. You might have a range of 99 to 199, which isn't that helpful. And what we're rolling out this year is every client will know the pricing in its entirety and  the appropriate life situation and then particular add-ons they have based on the documents they're bringing into the office to know their exact price. Because the feedback we got from several years ago, is it's helpful versus nothing, but it still doesn't -- and some clients were worried that they were at the top end of the range and maybe it was more hopeful than anything. So I think that's specific to what you may be remembering as far as what we do in New York. What we are rolling out is nationwide. So in every company office, obviously, franchisees have the ability to opt in. We're very pleased that we have incredible opt-in rates. The vast majority of franchisees will be following the model this year on a national level. Franchisees, though, as you remember, do set their own individual prices. So their price points may and will be different from the company offices, but they will be following the model because they believe in it so much, which we were very pleased to see that result from one of our franchise meetings. I think your earlier question was specific to volume. I think we're not going to get more specific in saying that the first half will be where we expect to see some level of loss given the free EZ promotion.

The other thing that's happened is this has become an increasingly expensive to even acquire our free EZ clients. So the number of clients that you're bringing in relative to the dollars you're spending on marketing and the discount you're giving has become increasingly expensive, and that's why we're really pushing free clients to go our DIY products, and we so obviously have those products in the DIY side and focus more on more middle America clients on the Assisted side."

We appreciate everyone being flexible with the change in call time in honor of the late President George Bush. 
We've been hard at work the past several months focused on executing our plans for the upcoming tax season. I want to thank our associates, tax pros and franchisees for all they're doing to ensure we're ready to serve our clients as the season gets underway. We're taking the right steps toward long-term growth in clients, revenue and earnings and, ultimately, value for our shareholders. I continue to be excited for this season and for the future of our company. 
On today's call, I'll give a brief recap of our key objectives for the year, followed by how we bring this strategy to life in tax season '19. Tony will then provide details on our second quarter results and additional insight into our fiscal '19 outlook. 
As a reminder, we announced our long-term enterprise strategy in June and provided more detail on our Q1 call in August, including our key objectives by channel. 
To recap, in our Assisted business, we're focused on improving the value we deliver to our clients, developing and delivering on a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block and improving the quality and consistency of our service delivery in the tax audits. 
In our DIY business, we're investing to improve the product and user experience, pricing at a level that is competitive and provides value to our clients and communicating this value to grow awareness and compel DIY consumers to switch to H&R Block. 
And in virtual, we will continue to innovate, leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. By combining digital technology with the unmatched scale and expertise of our tax pro network, we will ensure taxpayers can access H&R Block, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between. 
With those objectives as a backdrop, I'd now like to talk about the tangible ways we're bringing the strategy to life in the upcoming season. 
Let me start with an area in which we are making significant changes to improve our value proposition, our approach to pricing. In June, we announced that we would be investing in price decreases for certain segments of our assisted clients. Then in mid-October, we announced an important change in our approach, which is not only new for our business, but represents a complete shift for the industry as a whole, upfront transparent pricing. So I'd like to share what led us to make these changes and what it means for consumers. 
Over the past year, we took a critical look at all aspects of our business, and it is clear that pricing was a pain point. And it was not just about the amount, but also the way prices were determined and communicated. 
In the Assisted category, we, along with the rest of our industry, have traditionally determined the price after the return was completed, leaving many in the dark throughout much of the process. This does not meet the expectations of today's consumer who wants much information as possible prior to getting started. This approach was a point of frustration for our current clients and also a barrier to attracting new clients who weren't willing to give our brand a chance without knowing what it is going to cost. The feedback we received from our clients and tax pros clearly conveyed that the approach to pricing added even more stress to what for many of our clients is already a stressful event. Specifically, they told us, pricing shouldn't be a mystery. Nothing else they purchase in life feels just okay. Online, they don't want to start at one price and finish at another with no idea why, and a person's price should be unique, given their situation, not one-size-fits-all. 
So we knew the pricing was something we had to address in meaningful ways, but it wasn't a surprise to us. The decision to move to upfront transparent pricing is one that we've researched the past 2 years and is tested in select markets. We were pleased with the feedback and results from this price test, giving us confidence to making this move is the right thing for our clients and for our company. That's why I'm proud that H&R Block is leading the industry by offering upfront transparent pricing, so consumers know the price before they begin, as well as throughout the entire process. No mystery, no surprises and no hidden fees. 
In the office, the process of determining price can be done in 3 simple steps. First, the client identifies his or her price based on their life situation, then as the state return is needed and finally adds any additional item, such as investments for business income. Nearly half of our clients will not have any of these items, meaning they will know their price in 2 simple steps. And our tax pros will be there to help them to answer any questions and to provide a positive experience. 
In addition to the move to upfront transparent pricing, we are lowering prices for millions of our Assisted clients. These reductions are targeted to consumer segments where we can compete most effectively and win. A significant portion of our client base will see the positive impacts with 1/3 paying at least 10% less than last year. 
There's one additional update in the Assisted business I'd like to talk about. Given the changes to the 1040 forms for the upcoming season, which included the elimination of the 1040EZ, we will no longer run the free 1040EZ promotion. While free EZ brought new clients to our brand, they were increasingly expensive to acquire and had low lifetime value when compared to other client segments. So while eliminating this promotion will have a negative impact on Assisted volume, it will partially offset the price decreases from a net average charge perspective. These changes are contemplated in our revenue outlook for the year, which Tony will discuss later in the call. 
In addition to pricing changes in our Assisted business, we're also making enhancements in DIY. We will continue to price aggressively to encourage consumers to switch to our brand. An extension of this aggressive posture is how we are taking price transparency to another level for the DIY consumer. Our prices have always been stated up front, but as clients move through the process, the price will change, and they wouldn't know what they were ultimately going to pay until the very end. To address this, we're launching DIY price preview, so clients will know in realtime when their price changes and why. We believe this will set a new industry expectation for DIY consumers over time. 
Finally, in virtual, we will continue our upfront pricing approach with Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review products. We will also continue to test throughout the upcoming season to ensure our products are optimally priced. 
We're excited for our clients to experience upfront transparent pricing as it will enhance the value they receive and create one more reason to choose H&R Block. But the new pricing approach is just one of the many changes H&R Block is making to create a more modern, innovative, consumer-purpose brand. We're creating a client experience that demonstrates our expertise. It's tailored to each individual, is available all year round and is backed by a company that cares. And while this is not the first time we've discussed operational improvements, I believe the changes we are making this season are important steps to set us up for success over time. 
In our Assisted business, we're making a number of improvements to enhance the client experience that will benefit both new and existing clients. Our clients will receive greater help in planning for the future through an improved tax estimator to deliver key tax tips and more robust W-4 planning, both of which address the implications of tax reform. We're responding to the feedback from those who've asked for a paperless experience, making it even easier to set up a secure MyBlock account for year-round access to their return. We're increasing the prominence of our drop-off service, which some find easier and more convenient than sitting with the tax pro, while their taxes are completed. Drop-off service has always been available on our offices, though we haven't done a good job letting people know it's an option. 
For our field leaders, we have simplified and focused their efforts on the most essential operational protocols. We've dedicated significantly more effort to training and certification and has elevated the performance expectations for key seasonal roles, like office managers. 
And finally, we're enhancing and differentiating the experience for clients who are new to H&R Block that demonstrate the value we provide in more tangible ways. 
It's also important to note that our franchise network is as engaged and excited as they've ever been. I've been delighted to see the number of franchisees who have embraced not only the client experience enhancements, but also our upfront transparent pricing model. We also saw record participation by our franchisee at our convention in October and are seeing real momentum with our franchise base. 
Looking to DIY. We've made a number of enhancements to our product. First, we've improved the experience for mobile users to give more visibility to where they are in the process. We also continue to leverage data to make our products smarter and more personalized. By targeting questions relevant to the user, we are reducing the amount of screens the client sees, in some cases, reducing the number of questions they need to answer by more than half. 
Another key area is the significant improvements we've made in how we provide help throughout the user experience. We've redesigned the help center to give client easier access to self-help. We're introducing a virtual assistant by leveraging machine learning to deliver quick answers. And finally, we're making it easier to get live product help. These improvements will eliminate break points in the experience and ultimately drive conversion. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce a brand new online service we will be launching called ask a tax pro. Those who choose this service will have unlimited immediate access to a tax pro to answer their tax-related questions at any point in the experience. For years, our clients have had the ability to chat online with a highly qualified tax pro if they needed help. This new service now includes co-browsing capabilities, allowing our tax pros to work directly on the client stream to guide them to the answers they need. Clients can choose to interact with a tax pro through chat or phone, whichever is most convenient for them. This is yet another innovation that connects our clients to the expertise of our tax pros. We expect ask a tax pro to be the best value in the industry for those consumers who are confident doing taxes themselves, but has a few questions along the way. This innovation mindset is driving our efforts to meet consumers' evolving needs, as we continuously evaluate new ways to connect clients to help. To that end, we've made considerable improvement in our virtual products, Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review. 
Tax Pro Go, our virtual-assisted offering, which was designed and optimized for mobile users, addresses the needs of consumers who want assistance, but don't want or have the time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents to the MyBlock portal and work virtually with a tax pro matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed and filed by H&R Block. Our beta soft launch at Tax Pro Go last season has the goals of understanding who would be attracted to this product and refining the experience. We were pleased with the client this product attracted to the brand, with 70% being new to H&R Block and 55% being under 35 years old, demonstrating Tax Pro Go's ability to drive new clients and millennials to H&R Block. This year, we're continuing to improve the experience with more streamlined workflows, improved document upload and getting clients the ability to schedule an upfront phone consultation with their assigned tax pro. 
Our second virtual product, Tax Pro Review, is a powerful way for our DIY clients to connect with one of our highly trained experts to review their source documents as well as their entire return and identify all available credits and deductions. At the end of the process, our tax pro then signs and files the return, and clients can access the tax pro anytime during the year for any questions that may come up. We continue to make enhancements to Tax Pro Review to better demonstrate the benefits of working with an expert in this capacity. Additionally, we've optimized our network of tax pros completing these returns and have made improvements to the end-to-end mobile experience. 
Everything we just discussed, across the Assisted, DIY and virtual spectrum, shows our commitment to unmatched capability to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company. 
In addition to the improvements in pricing, client experience and virtual, we continue to look for ways to provide solutions through promotional offerings and partnerships. That's why we'll bring back key promotions and partnerships this year that contributed to our performance in tax season '18. We will again offer refund advance, providing our clients early access to their money, in most cases, on the same day in which they file their taxes. Our loan amounts will be up to $3,000, and we're proud that our loans will remain 100% interest-free with no fee for the consumer. This contrasts with other offers that will have higher loan amounts, but include interest charges. We will again be the exclusive provider of desktop software at Walmart, and we'll have an aggressive program in place with Amazon. 
Additionally, for self-employed filers, we are continuing our partnership with Stride to give our clients the ability to track and import expenses into their returns.
Finally, we will provide access to free credit scores for our clients in all our channels through our partnership with LendingTree.
None of this matters if we don't effectively reach consumers and communicate the value we're delivering, so we're making changes to systematically improve our ability to acquire, retain and engage clients. We're utilizing improved data analytics and enhanced marketing techniques to optimize spend, deliver unique messages to discreet micro-segment in the market and, ultimately, improve our ROI. This modern approach is key in building brand relevance and attracting new clients. 
To wrap up, we've made many significant improvements to our business across a number of areas, including pricing, client experience, operational excellence, virtual products, promotion and partnerships, demonstrating our commitment to delivering for our clients. Our product offering is the most robust it's been in the history of our company. We're innovating and taking bold steps to disrupt the industry to ensure that we compete not only this season, but for the long term. In short, we're excited about our future and for the season to begin. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our second quarter financial results and outlook."

Before I get into the details of our Q2 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal second quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, second quarter results are not representative of our full year performance. 
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $8 million or 6% to $149 million. This is primarily the result of increased assisted tax prep revenues and the timing of revenues related to our Tax Identity Shield product, partially offset by lower international revenues, which were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates. 
Turning to expense. Total operating expenses increased $7 million or 2% to $364 million, primarily due to one-time cost of $10 million related to our office footprint optimization as well as increased compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and marketing expense. 
The increases in revenue and operating expenses, combined with an increase in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and higher cash balances, drove an improvement in pretax loss from continuing operations of $4 million or 2%. While we saw an improvement in pretax loss, our loss per share increased $0.12 to $0.83. This was due to our lower tax benefit compared to last year as the lower corporate tax rate negatively impacts quarters due to seasonal loss. 
Turning to discontinued operations. There were no changes in accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. 
Turning to capital. Our priorities remain unchanged. We first focus on maintaining adequate liquidity to fund the business. We then look to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. We then fund our dividend, which we have done consistently since going public. And then finally, we look to opportunistically return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and, at a minimum, plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants. We do not refer to shares during to the most recent quarter, but have repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million for the fiscal year. 
I'd now like to provide some thoughts on our fiscal '19 outlook. Starting with the tax industry, we anticipate overall returns to grow 1% to 2% in tax season '19, consistent with historical trends and the current low unemployment environment. As we shared on our Q1 call, we don't anticipate the recent tax legislation to have a material impact on the method filers use to prepare their taxes. Our research confirms that many filers are confused and will be looking for help this tax season. As a result, we anticipate Assisted industry volume to be flat to slightly up, with the remainder of the industry growth coming in DIY. Overall, we expect the industry volumes to be very similar to the trends we've seen over the last few years. 
Specific to H&R Block, we expect to continue our trend of achieving overall client growth, driven by DIY and partially offset by a decline in Assisted due to the discontinuation of the free EZ promotion. The change in free EZ will impact the early part of the season and will be reflected in the results through February that we will release in early March. 
With respect to pricing, our new approach will result in a lower net average charge in our Assisted business. While we expect the net average charge to decline, they will be impacted by positive mix as we expect to serve fewer free EZ-type clients. 
In DIY, we expect our net average charge to be consistent with last year, as we continue to focus on outpacing the category in returns and gaining market share. While there is some trade-down risk within DIY due to the new tax legislation, which would negatively impact our net average charge, we believe that risk will largely be offset by ask a tax pro and favorable mix. 
We are confirming our previously provided guidance, as we continue to expect total revenues at $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which takes into account the volume and pricing expectations I just shared. We're also maintaining our previously provided outlook of  EBITDA margin at 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%. 
Moving on to the other items in our financial outlook. As we've previously shared, fiscal '18 represented a high watermark for depreciation and amortization, as we see the impact of office upgrade and franchise buybacks from several years ago roll off. We expect D&A to decline in fiscal '19 and be $165 million to $175 million. As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is related to CapEx, while the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. 
We expect to spend approximately 3% of revenues on capital expenditures in fiscal '19 or $95 million to $105 million. 
With respect to acquisitions, we anticipate repurchasing approximately 125 franchise locations, which was better than we originally expected, and adding approximately 45 independent locations to our network for a total capital investment of approximately $30 million. 
As a reminder, both franchise repurchases and independent acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our current trading multiples and, as such, are accretive to earnings. Beyond this year, we expect our franchise repurchase activity to moderate. 
For fiscal '19, we expect total interest expense to be $80 million to $85 million, driven by lower borrowing needs, offset by higher interest rates. 
Before I turn it back over to Jeff, I just want to share my excitement for the upcoming tax season. We have a great plan to put H&R Block on the path to long-term sustainable growth, and I'm looking forward to seeing our plans come to life in the coming months. 
With that, over to you, Jeff, for some closing thoughts."

Now our goal isn't to be the low-priced leader, so I think H&R Block will demand some level of premium relative to a lot of the other offerings in the marketplace. Specific to your question on what type of premium, where are we at, it really depends. I think, across the spectrum and different client complexity, our premiums vary, obviously, on the simple land and the free EZ. And we were very competitive last year given we had the free EZ promotion. I think given how our pricing had evolved over time, we definitely identified certain client segments where we were very much above the market average, if you will. The consumers don't really feel the average and it's impossible to shop the average, but we know in certain segments, in certain geographies, there's definitely places that we were well above the market. And we've taken the opportunity as part of this reset to try to fix most of those and bring as much more in line and use pricing as a catalyst to try to return us to client growth. That being said, it's well beyond pricing. Pricing is just one aspect of what we're trying to do at the overall value proposition and all the elements that we're making, the changes we are making that are eventually going to allow us to be successful."

I would just reiterate that we're not trying to be the low-priced provider, and I echo Tony's comments about all the other initiatives that have been put in place to demonstrate value. We also have seen that it's just not the price the consumer was paying. It was the fact they had no idea what it was going to cost. And so when I think about our approach to pricing, there are really 3 different components. The first component is really about the fact that they'll know the price before they begin. The second is how easy it will be for them to figure out what their price is. And then the third will be the actual price. And so we're really thinking about all 3 of those elements."

And so one of the things we continue to see and understand is the power of the brand name, how trustworthy it is on the topic of taxes. With Tax Pro Go, I think what we saw was that the method of sitting down for an hour in a tax office isn't for everybody. And so I think that's why we're continuing to broaden the way the millennials and others can access the brand. Again and we think so digitally, Tax Pro Go is a great way to do that. They get the full assisted experience, but they don't have to physically visit an office. And as it turns out a lot of people, as well, given our retail footprint, that simply dropping off your documents is very convenient for people, too.

We have run various tests and then we're constantly doing on different pricing approaches. Several years ago, we used to have a version of a pricing board in our offices, and that may be what you're remembering. It's probably been 4 or 5 years ago. I think the main difference between that and what we're rolling out now is that gave clients an indication of a range, but where they may fall based on a particular life situation. But the challenge with that model was the ranges were incredibly wide. So you might have a range of $99 to $199, which isn't that helpful. And what we're rolling out this year is every client will know the pricing in its entirety and can place themselves in the appropriate life situation and then whatever particular add-ons they have based on the documents they're bringing into the office to know their exact price. So the feedback we got from several years ago, it's helpful versus nothing, but still doesn't -- and some clients were worried that they were at the top end of the range and maybe it was more hopeful than anything. So I think that's specific to what you may be remembering as far as what we do and have done in New York. What we are rolling out is nationwide, so it will be in every company office. Obviously, franchisees have the ability to opt in. We're very pleased that we've had incredible opt-in rates. The vast majority of franchisees will be following the model this year on a national level. Franchisees, though, as you remember, do set their own individual prices, so their price points may and will be different from the company offices, but they will be following the model because they believe in it so much, which we were very pleased to see that result coming out of our franchise meetings. I think your earlier question was specific to volume. I mean, we're not going to get more specific in saying that the first half will be where we expect to see some level of loss given the free EZ promotion. Our goal is to continue to grow clients in all segments, in all parts of the season, whether it be first half or second half, but we just know that given the free EZ promotion ran through 2/28 last year, it will be a bit of a headwind."

We are focused on margin expansion over time as we grow volume, and that's really the key to how we're thinking about the next several years, where we believe we have to grow clients and revenue and earnings over time. But again, the high 20s feels like the level where we're just not investing in our business appropriately."

So if you bought a house the following year, had children or became self-employed or something else, then that would provide a monetization opportunity to move up. When we looked at the data over the last several years, clients aren't migrating up at the pace that we need to justify the program, which is part of the impetus for eliminating it this year. The other thing that's happened it just become increasingly expensive to even acquire the free EZ client. So a number of clients that you're bringing in relative to the dollars you're spending on marketing and the discount you're giving has become increasingly expensive. And why -- that's why we're really pushing free clients to go in our DIY products. And we still obviously have those products from the DIY side and focus more on more middle America clients on the Assisted side."

We appreciate everyone being flexible with the change in call time in honor of the late President Bush. 
We've been hard at work the past several months focused on executing our plans for the upcoming tax season. I want to thank our associates, tax pros and franchisees for all they're doing to ensure we're ready to serve our clients as the season gets underway. We're taking the right steps toward long-term growth in clients, revenue and earnings and, ultimately, value for our shareholders. I continue to be excited for this season and for the future of our company. 
On today's call, I'll give a brief recap of our key objectives for the year, followed by how we bring this strategy to life in tax season '19. Tony will then provide details on our second quarter results and additional insight into our fiscal '19 outlook. 
As a reminder, we announced our long-term enterprise strategy in June and provided more detail on our Q1 call in August, including our key objectives by channel. 
To recap, in our Assisted business, we're focused on improving the value we deliver to our clients, developing and delivering on a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block and improving the quality and consistency of our service delivery in the tax office. 
In our DIY business, we're investing to improve the product and user experience, pricing at a level that is competitive and provides value to our clients and communicating this value to grow awareness and compel DIY consumers to switch to H&R Block. 
And in virtual, we will continue to innovate, leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. By combining digital technology with the unmatched scale and expertise of our tax pro network, we will ensure taxpayers can access H&R Block, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between. 
With those objectives as a backdrop, I'd now like to talk about the tangible ways we're bringing the strategy to life in the upcoming season. 
Let me start with an area in which we are making significant changes to improve our value proposition, our approach to pricing. In June, we announced that we would be investing in price decreases for certain segments of our assisted clients. Then in mid-October, we announced an important change in our approach, which is not only new for our business, but represents a complete shift for the industry as a whole, upfront transparent pricing. So I'd like to share what led us to make these changes and what it means for consumers. 
Over the past year, we took a critical look at all aspects of our business, and it is clear that pricing was a pain point. And it was not just about the amount, but also the way prices were determined and communicated. 
In the Assisted category, we, along with the rest of the industry, have traditionally determined the price after the return was completed, leaving many in the dark throughout much of the process. This does not meet the expectations of today's consumers, who want as much information as possible prior to getting started. This approach was a point of frustration for our current clients and also a barrier to attracting new clients who weren't willing to give our brand a chance without knowing what it was going to cost. The feedback we received from our clients and tax pros clearly conveyed that the approach to pricing added even more stress to what, for many of our clients, is already a stressful event. Specifically, they told us, pricing shouldn't be a mystery. Nothing else they purchase in life feels this opaque. Online, they don't want to start at one price and finish at another with no idea why, and a person's price should be unique, given their situation, not one-size-fits-all. 
So we knew that pricing was something we had to address in a meaningful way, so this wasn't a surprise to us. The decision to move to upfront, transparent pricing is one that we've researched the past 2 years and have tested in select markets. We were pleased with the feedback and results from these price tests, giving us confidence in making this move was the right thing for our clients and for our company. That's why I'm proud that H&R Block is leading the industry by offering upfront, transparent pricing, so consumers know the price before they begin, as well as throughout the entire process. No mystery, no surprises and no hidden fees. 
In the office, the process of determining price can be done in 3 simple steps. First, the client identifies his or her price based on their life situation, then as the state return is needed and finally adds any additional item, such as investments or business income. Nearly half of our clients will not have any of these items, meaning they will know their price in 2 simple steps. And our tax pros will be there to help them to answer any questions and to provide a positive experience. 
In addition to the move to upfront, transparent pricing, we are lowering prices for millions of our Assisted clients. These reductions are targeted to consumer segments where we can compete most effectively and win. A significant portion of our client base will see the positive impacts, with 1/3 paying at least 10% less than last year. 
There's one additional update in the Assisted business I'd like to talk about. Given the changes to the 1040 forms for the upcoming season, which included the elimination of the 1040EZ, we will no longer run the free 1040EZ promotion. While free EZ brought new clients to our brand, they were increasingly expensive to acquire and had low lifetime value when compared to other client segments. So while eliminating this promotion will have a negative impact on Assisted volume, it will partially offset the price decreases from a net average charge perspective. These changes are contemplated in our revenue outlook for the year, which Tony will discuss later in the call. 
In addition to pricing changes in our Assisted business, we're also making enhancements in DIY. We will continue to price aggressively to encourage consumers to switch to our brand. An extension of this aggressive posture is how we are taking price transparency to another level for the DIY consumer. Our prices have always been stated up front, but as clients move through the process, the price would change, and they wouldn't know what they were ultimately going to pay until the very end. To address this, we're launching DIY price preview, so clients will know in real time when their price changes and why. We believe this will set a new industry expectation for DIY consumers over time. 
Finally, in virtual, we will continue our upfront pricing approach with Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review products. We will also continue to test throughout the upcoming season to ensure our products are optimally priced. 
We're excited for our clients to experience upfront, transparent pricing as it will enhance the value they receive and create one more reason to choose H&R Block. But a new pricing approach is just one of the many changes H&R Block is making to create a more modern, innovative, consumer-focused brand. We're creating a client experience that demonstrates our expertise, is tailored to each individual, is available year-round and is backed by a company that cares. And while this is not the first time we've discussed operational improvements, I believe the changes we are making this season are important steps to set us up for success over time. 
In our Assisted business, we're making a number of improvements to enhance the client experience that will benefit both new and existing clients. Our clients will receive greater help in planning for the future through an improved tax estimator to deliver key tax tips and more robust W-4 planning, both of which address the implications of tax reform. We're responding to the feedback from those who've asked for a paperless experience, making it even easier to set up a secure MyBlock account for year-round access to their return. We're increasing the prominence of our drop-off service, which some find easier and more convenient than sitting with the tax pro while their taxes are completed. Drop-off service has always been available in our offices, but we haven't done a good job letting people know it's an option. 
For our field leaders, we have simplified and focused their efforts on the most essential operational protocols. We've dedicated significantly more effort to training and certification and have elevated the performance expectations for key seasonal roles, like office managers. 
And finally, we're enhancing and differentiating the experience for clients who are new to H&R Block that demonstrate the value we provide in more tangible ways. 
It's also important to note that our franchise network is as engaged and excited as they've ever been. I've been delighted to see the number of franchisees who have embraced not only the client experience enhancements but also our upfront, transparent pricing model. We also saw record participation by our franchisees at our convention in October and are seeing real momentum with our franchise base. 
Moving to DIY. We've made a number of enhancements to our product. First, we've improved the experience for mobile users to give more visibility to where they are in the process. We also continue to leverage data to make our products smarter and more personalized. By targeting questions relevant to the user, we are reducing the amount of screens the client sees, in some cases, reducing the number of questions they need to answer by more than half. 
Another key area is the significant improvements we've made in how we provide help throughout the user experience. We've redesigned the help center to give clients easier access to self-help. We're introducing a virtual assistant by leveraging machine learning to deliver quick answers. And finally, we're making it easier to get live product help. These improvements will eliminate break points in the experience and ultimately drive conversion. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce a brand new online service we will be launching called ask a tax pro. Those who choose this service will have unlimited immediate access to a tax pro to answer their tax-related questions at any point in the experience. For years, our clients have had the ability to chat online with a highly qualified tax pro if they needed help. This new service now includes co-browsing capabilities, allowing our tax pros to work directly on the client stream to guide them to the answers they need. Clients can choose to interact with a tax pro through chat or phone, whichever is most convenient for them. This is yet another innovation that connects our clients to the expertise of our tax pros. We expect ask a tax pro to be the best value in the industry for those consumers who are confident doing taxes themselves, but have a few questions along the way. This innovation mindset is driving our efforts to meet consumers' evolving needs, as we continuously evaluate new ways to connect clients to help. To that end, we've made considerable improvement in our virtual products, Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review. 
Tax Pro Go, our virtual Assisted offering, which was designed and optimized for mobile users, addresses the needs of consumers who want assistance, but don't want or have the time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents through the MyBlock portal and work virtually with a tax pro matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed and filed by H&R Block. Our beta soft launch of Tax Pro Go last season had the goals of understanding who would be attracted to this product and refining the experience. We were pleased with the client this product attracted to the brand, with 70% being new to H&R Block and 55% being under 35 years old, demonstrating Tax Pro Go's ability to drive new clients and millennials to H&R Block. This year, we're continuing to improve the experience with more streamlined workflows, improved document upload and giving clients the ability to schedule an upfront phone consultation with their assigned tax pro. 
Our second virtual product, Tax Pro Review, is a powerful way for our DIY clients to connect with one of our highly trained experts to review their source documents as well as their entire return and identify all available credits and deductions. At the end of the process, our tax pro then signs and files the return, and clients can access the tax pro anytime during the year for any questions that may come up. We continue to make enhancements to Tax Pro Review to better demonstrate the benefits of working with an expert in this capacity. Additionally, we've optimized our network of tax pros completing these returns and have made improvements to the end-to-end mobile experience. 
Everything we just discussed, across the Assisted, DIY and virtual spectrum, shows our commitment to unmatched capability to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company. 
In addition to the improvements in pricing, client experience and virtual, we continue to look for ways to provide solutions through promotional offerings and partnerships. That's why we'll bring back key promotions and partnerships this year that contributed to our performance in tax season '18. We will again offer refund advance, providing our clients early access to their money, in most cases, on the same day in which they file their taxes. Our loan amounts will be up to $3,000, and we're proud that our loans will remain 100% interest-free with no fee for the consumer. This contrasts with other offers that will have higher loan amounts, but include interest charges. We will again be the exclusive provider of desktop software at Walmart, and we'll have an aggressive program in place with Amazon. 
Additionally, for self-employed filers, we are continuing our partnership with Stride to give our clients the ability to track and import expenses into their returns.
Finally, we will provide access to free credit scores for our clients in all our channels through our partnership with LendingTree.
None of this matters if we don't effectively reach consumers and communicate the value we're delivering, so we're making changes to systematically improve our ability to acquire, retain and engage clients. We're utilizing improved data analytics and enhanced marketing techniques to optimize spend, deliver unique messages to discreet micro-segments of the market and ultimately improve our ROI. This modern approach is key in building brand relevance and attracting new clients. 
To wrap up, we've made many significant improvements to our business across a number of areas, including pricing, client experience, operational excellence, virtual products, promotion and partnerships, demonstrating our commitment to delivering for our clients. Our product offering is the most robust it's been in the history of our company. We're innovating and taking bold steps to disrupt the industry to ensure that we compete not only this season but for the long term. In short, we're excited about our future and for the season to begin. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our second quarter financial results and outlook."

Therefore, second quarter results are not representat",980,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal second quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, second quarter results are not representative of our full year performance. 
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $8 million or 6% to $149 million. This is primarily the result of increased assisted tax prep revenues and the timing of revenues related to our Tax Identity Shield product, partially offset by lower international revenues, which were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates. 
Turning to expense. Total operating expenses increased $7 million or 2% to $364 million, primarily due to onetime costs of $10 million related to our office footprint optimization as well as increased compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and marketing expense. 
The increases in revenue and operating expenses, combined with an increase in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and higher cash balances, drove an improvement in pretax loss from continuing operations of $4 million or 2%. While we saw an improvement in pretax loss, our loss per share increased $0.12 to $0.83. This was due to our lower tax benefit compared to last year as the lower corporate tax rate negatively impacts quarters with a seasonal loss. 
Turning to discontinued operations. There were no changes in accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. 
Turning to capital. Our priorities remain unchanged. We, first, focus on maintaining adequate liquidity to fund the business. We then look to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. We then fund our dividend, which we have done consistently since going public. And then finally, we look to opportunistically return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and, at a minimum, plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants. We did not repurchase shares during to the most recent quarter, but have repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million for the fiscal year. 
I'd now like to provide some thoughts on our fiscal '19 outlook. Starting with the tax industry, we anticipate overall returns to grow 1% to 2% in tax season '19, consistent with historical trends and the current low unemployment environment. As we shared on our Q1 call, we don't anticipate the recent tax legislation to have a material impact on the method filers use to prepare their taxes. Our research confirms that many filers are confused and will be looking for help this tax season. As a result, we anticipate Assisted industry volume to be flat to slightly up, with the remainder of the industry growth coming in DIY. Overall, we expect the industry volumes to be very similar to the trends we've seen over the last few years. 
Specific to H&R Block, we expect to continue our trend of achieving overall client growth, driven by DIY and partially offset by a decline in Assisted due to the discontinuation of the free EZ promotion. The change in free EZ will impact the early part of the season and will be reflected in the results through February that we will release in early March. 
With respect to pricing, our new approach will result in a lower net average charge in our Assisted business. While we expect the net average charge to decline, it will be impacted by positive mix as we expect to serve fewer free EZ type clients. 
In DIY, we expect our net average charge to be consistent with last year, as we continue to focus on outpacing the category in returns and gaining market share. While there is some trade-down risk within DIY due to the new tax legislation, which would negatively impact our net average charge, we believe that risk will largely be offset by ask a tax pro and favorable mix. 
We are confirming our previously provided guidance, as we continue to expect total revenues at $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which takes into account the volume and pricing expectations I just shared. We're also maintaining our previously provided outlook of EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%. 
Moving on to the other items in our financial outlook. As we previously shared, fiscal '18 represented our high-water mark for depreciation and amortization, as we see the impact of office upgrades and franchise buybacks from several years ago roll off. We expect D&A to decline in fiscal '19 and be $165 million to $175 million. As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is related to CapEx, while the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. 
We expect to spend approximately 3% of revenues on capital expenditures in fiscal '19 or $95 million to $105 million. 
With respect to acquisitions, we anticipate repurchasing approximately 125 franchise locations, which was better than we originally expected, and adding approximately 45 independent locations to our network for a total capital investment of approximately $30 million. 
As a reminder, both franchise repurchases and independent acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our current trading multiple and, as such, are accretive to earnings. Beyond this year, we expect our franchise repurchase activity to moderate. 
For fiscal '19, we expect total interest expense to be $80 million to $85 million, driven by lower borrowing needs, offset by higher interest rates. 
Before I turn it back over to Jeff, I just want to share my excitement for the upcoming tax season. We have a great plan to put H&R Block on the path to long-term sustainable growth, and I'm looking forward to seeing our plans come to life in the coming months. 
With that, over to you, Jeff, for some closing thoughts."

Our goal isn't to be the low-priced leader, so I think H&R Block will demand some level of premium relative to a lot of the other offerings in the marketplace. Specific to your question on what type of premium were we at, it really depends. I think, across the spectrum, at different client complexity, our premiums varied, obviously, on the simple land or the free EZ. And we were very competitive last year, given we had the free EZ promotion. I think, given how our pricing had evolved over time, we definitely identified certain client segments where we were very much above the market average, if you will. The consumers don't really feel the average and it's impossible to shop the average, but we know in certain segments, in certain geographies, there's definitely places that we were well above the market. And we've taken the opportunity as part of this reset to try to fix most of those and bring us much more in line and use pricing as a catalyst to try to return us to client growth. That being said, it's well beyond pricing. Pricing is just 1 aspect of what we're trying to do. And it's the overall value proposition and all the elements that we're making -- the changes we are making that are eventually going to allow us to be successful."

I would just reiterate that we're not trying to be the low-price provider and to echo Tony's comments about all the other initiatives that have been put in place to demonstrate value. We also have seen that it's just not the price the consumer was paying. It was the fact they had no idea what it was going to cost. And so when I think about our approach to pricing, there are really 3 different components. The first component is really about the fact that they'll know the price before they begin. The second is how easy it will be for them to figure out what their price is. And then the third will be the actual price. And so we're really thinking about all 3 of those elements."

We have run various tests that we're constantly doing on different pricing approaches. Several years ago, we used to have a version of a pricing board in our offices, and that may be what you're remembering. It's probably been 4 or 5 years ago. I think the main difference between that and what we're rolling out now is that gave clients an indication of a range of where they may fall based on the particular life situation. But the challenge with that model was the ranges were incredibly wide. So you might have a range of $99 to $199, which isn't that helpful. And what we're rolling out this year is every client will know the pricing in its entirety and can place themself in the appropriate life situation and then whatever particular add-ons they have based on the documents they're bringing into the office to know their exact price. Because the feedback we got from several years ago is it's helpful versus nothing, but it still doesn't tell me my price. And some clients were worried that they were at the top end of the range and that maybe it was more hurtful than anything. So I think that's specific to what you may be remembering as far as what we would have done in New York. What we are rolling out is nationwide, so it [ won't ] be in every company office. Obviously, franchisees have the ability to opt in. We're very pleased that we've had incredible opt-in rates. The vast majority of franchisees will be following the model this year on a national level. Franchisees, though, as you remember, do set their own individual prices, so their price points may and will be different from the company offices, but they will be following the model because they believe in it so much, which we were very pleased to see that result coming out of our franchise meeting. I think your earlier question was specific to volume. I mean, we're not going to get more specific than saying that the first half will be where we expect to see some level of loss given the free EZ promotion.

I mean, your tax situation tends to change from one year to the other. And to they qualify for the free EZ promotion, you would have essentially had to only have a W-2. So if you bought a house the following year or had children or became self-employed or something else, then that would provide a monetization opportunity to move up. When we looked at the data over the last several years, clients aren't migrating up at the pace that we need to justify the program, which is part of the impetus for eliminating it this year. The other thing that's happened, it's just become increasingly expensive to even acquire the free EZ clients. So a number of clients that you're bringing in relative to the dollars you're spending on marketing and the discount you're giving, it became increasingly expensive. And why -- that's why we're really pushing free clients to go into our DIY products, and we still obviously have those products on the DIY side, and focus more on more middle America clients on the Assisted side."

We appreciate everyone being flexible with the change in call time in honor of the late President Bush. 
We've been hard at work the past several months focused on executing our plans for the upcoming tax season. I want to thank our associates, tax pros and franchisees for all they're doing to ensure we're ready to serve our clients as the season gets underway. We're taking the right steps toward long-term growth in clients, revenue and earnings and, ultimately, value for our shareholders. I continue to be excited for this season and for the future of our company. 
On today's call, I'll give a brief recap of our key objectives for the year, followed by how we bring this strategy to life in tax season '19. Tony will then provide details on our second quarter results and additional insight into our fiscal '19 outlook. 
As a reminder, we announced our long-term enterprise strategy in June and provided more detail on our Q1 call in August, including our key objectives by channel. 
To recap, in our Assisted business, we're focused on improving the value we deliver to our clients, developing and delivering on a clear brand promise to differentiate H&R Block and improving the quality and consistency of our service delivery in the tax office. 
In our DIY business, we're investing to improve the product and user experience, pricing at a level that is competitive and provides value to our clients and communicating this value to grow awareness and compel DIY consumers to switch to H&R Block. 
And in virtual, we will continue to innovate, leading the industry as consumer expectations evolve. By combining digital technology with the unmatched scale and expertise of our tax pro network, we will ensure taxpayers can access H&R Block, whether they want little to no help, complete in-person assistance or anything in between. 
With those objectives as a backdrop, I'd now like to talk about the tangible ways we're bringing the strategy to life in the upcoming season. 
Let me start with an area in which we are making significant changes to improve our value proposition, our approach to pricing. In June, we announced that we would be investing in price decreases for certain segments of our assisted clients. Then in mid-October, we announced an important change in our approach, which is not only new for our business, but represents a complete shift for the industry as a whole, upfront transparent pricing. So I'd like to share what led us to make these changes and what it means for consumers. 
Over the past year, we took a critical look at all aspects of our business, and it is clear that pricing was a pain point. And it was not just about the amount, but also the way prices were determined and communicated. 
In the Assisted category, we, along with the rest of the industry, have traditionally determined the price after the return was completed, leaving many in the dark throughout much of the process. This does not meet the expectations of today's consumers, who want as much information as possible prior to getting started. This approach was a point of frustration for our current clients and also a barrier to attracting new clients who weren't willing to give our brand a chance without knowing what it was going to cost. The feedback we received from our clients and tax pros clearly conveyed that the approach to pricing added even more stress to what, for many of our clients, is already a stressful event. Specifically, they told us, pricing shouldn't be a mystery. Nothing else they purchase in life feels this opaque. Online, they don't want to start at one price and finish at another with no idea why, and a person's price should be unique, given their situation, not one-size-fits-all. 
So we knew that pricing was something we had to address in a meaningful way, so this wasn't a surprise to us. The decision to move to upfront, transparent pricing is one that we've researched the past 2 years and have tested in select markets. We were pleased with the feedback and results from these price tests, giving us confidence in making this move was the right thing for our clients and for our company. That's why I'm proud that H&R Block is leading the industry by offering upfront, transparent pricing, so consumers know the price before they begin, as well as throughout the entire process. No mystery, no surprises and no hidden fees. 
In the office, the process of determining price can be done in 3 simple steps. First, the client identifies his or her price based on their life situation, then as the state return is needed and finally adds any additional item, such as investments or business income. Nearly half of our clients will not have any of these items, meaning they will know their price in 2 simple steps. And our tax pros will be there to help them to answer any questions and to provide a positive experience. 
In addition to the move to upfront, transparent pricing, we are lowering prices for millions of our Assisted clients. These reductions are targeted to consumer segments where we can compete most effectively and win. A significant portion of our client base will see the positive impacts, with 1/3 paying at least 10% less than last year. 
There's one additional update in the Assisted business I'd like to talk about. Given the changes to the 1040 forms for the upcoming season, which included the elimination of the 1040EZ, we will no longer run the free 1040EZ promotion. While free EZ brought new clients to our brand, they were increasingly expensive to acquire and had low lifetime value when compared to other client segments. So while eliminating this promotion will have a negative impact on Assisted volume, it will partially offset the price decreases from a net average charge perspective. These changes are contemplated in our revenue outlook for the year, which Tony will discuss later in the call. 
In addition to pricing changes in our Assisted business, we're also making enhancements in DIY. We will continue to price aggressively to encourage consumers to switch to our brand. An extension of this aggressive posture is how we are taking price transparency to another level for the DIY consumer. Our prices have always been stated up front, but as clients move through the process, the price would change, and they wouldn't know what they were ultimately going to pay until the very end. To address this, we're launching DIY price preview, so clients will know in real time when their price changes and why. We believe this will set a new industry expectation for DIY consumers over time. 
Finally, in virtual, we will continue our upfront pricing approach with Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review products. We will also continue to test throughout the upcoming season to ensure our products are optimally priced. 
We're excited for our clients to experience upfront, transparent pricing as it will enhance the value they receive and create one more reason to choose H&R Block. But a new pricing approach is just one of the many changes H&R Block is making to create a more modern, innovative, consumer-focused brand. We're creating a client experience that demonstrates our expertise, is tailored to each individual, is available year-round and is backed by a company that cares. And while this is not the first time we've discussed operational improvements, I believe the changes we are making this season are important steps to set us up for success over time. 
In our Assisted business, we're making a number of improvements to enhance the client experience that will benefit both new and existing clients. Our clients will receive greater help in planning for the future through an improved tax estimator to deliver key tax tips and more robust W-4 planning, both of which address the implications of tax reform. We're responding to the feedback from those who've asked for a paperless experience, making it even easier to set up a secure MyBlock account for year-round access to their return. We're increasing the prominence of our drop-off service, which some find easier and more convenient than sitting with the tax pro while their taxes are completed. Drop-off service has always been available in our offices, but we haven't done a good job letting people know it's an option. 
For our field leaders, we have simplified and focused their efforts on the most essential operational protocols. We've dedicated significantly more effort to training and certification and have elevated the performance expectations for key seasonal roles, like office managers. 
And finally, we're enhancing and differentiating the experience for clients who are new to H&R Block that demonstrate the value we provide in more tangible ways. 
It's also important to note that our franchise network is as engaged and excited as they've ever been. I've been delighted to see the number of franchisees who have embraced not only the client experience enhancements but also our upfront, transparent pricing model. We also saw record participation by our franchisees at our convention in October and are seeing real momentum with our franchise base. 
Moving to DIY. We've made a number of enhancements to our product. First, we've improved the experience for mobile users to give more visibility to where they are in the process. We also continue to leverage data to make our products smarter and more personalized. By targeting questions relevant to the user, we are reducing the amount of screens the client sees, in some cases, reducing the number of questions they need to answer by more than half. 
Another key area is the significant improvements we've made in how we provide help throughout the user experience. We've redesigned the help center to give clients easier access to self-help. We're introducing a virtual assistant by leveraging machine learning to deliver quick answers. And finally, we're making it easier to get live product help. These improvements will eliminate break points in the experience and ultimately drive conversion. 
Finally, I'm excited to announce a brand new online service we will be launching called ask a tax pro. Those who choose this service will have unlimited immediate access to a tax pro to answer their tax-related questions at any point in the experience. For years, our clients have had the ability to chat online with a highly qualified tax pro if they needed help. This new service now includes co-browsing capabilities, allowing our tax pros to work directly on the client stream to guide them to the answers they need. Clients can choose to interact with a tax pro through chat or phone, whichever is most convenient for them. This is yet another innovation that connects our clients to the expertise of our tax pros. We expect ask a tax pro to be the best value in the industry for those consumers who are confident doing taxes themselves, but have a few questions along the way. This innovation mindset is driving our efforts to meet consumers' evolving needs, as we continuously evaluate new ways to connect clients to help. To that end, we've made considerable improvement in our virtual products, Tax Pro Go and Tax Pro Review. 
Tax Pro Go, our virtual Assisted offering, which was designed and optimized for mobile users, addresses the needs of consumers who want assistance, but don't want or have the time to visit one of our offices. Clients upload their documents through the MyBlock portal and work virtually with a tax pro matched to them to have their taxes seamlessly prepared, signed and filed by H&R Block. Our beta soft launch of Tax Pro Go last season had the goals of understanding who would be attracted to this product and refining the experience. We were pleased with the client this product attracted to the brand, with 70% being new to H&R Block and 55% being under 35 years old, demonstrating Tax Pro Go's ability to drive new clients and millennials to H&R Block. This year, we're continuing to improve the experience with more streamlined workflows, improved document upload and giving clients the ability to schedule an upfront phone consultation with their assigned tax pro. 
Our second virtual product, Tax Pro Review, is a powerful way for our DIY clients to connect with one of our highly trained experts to review their source documents as well as their entire return and identify all available credits and deductions. At the end of the process, our tax pro then signs and files the return, and clients can access the tax pro anytime during the year for any questions that may come up. We continue to make enhancements to Tax Pro Review to better demonstrate the benefits of working with an expert in this capacity. Additionally, we've optimized our network of tax pros completing these returns and have made improvements to the end-to-end mobile experience. 
Everything we just discussed, across the Assisted, DIY and virtual spectrum, shows our commitment to unmatched capability to serve consumers in more ways than any other tax preparation company. 
In addition to the improvements in pricing, client experience and virtual, we continue to look for ways to provide solutions through promotional offerings and partnerships. That's why we'll bring back key promotions and partnerships this year that contributed to our performance in tax season '18. We will again offer refund advance, providing our clients early access to their money, in most cases, on the same day in which they file their taxes. Our loan amounts will be up to $3,000, and we're proud that our loans will remain 100% interest-free with no fee for the consumer. This contrasts with other offers that will have higher loan amounts, but include interest charges. We will again be the exclusive provider of desktop software at Walmart, and we'll have an aggressive program in place with Amazon. 
Additionally, for self-employed filers, we are continuing our partnership with Stride to give our clients the ability to track and import expenses into their returns.
Finally, we will provide access to free credit scores for our clients in all our channels through our partnership with LendingTree.
None of this matters if we don't effectively reach consumers and communicate the value we're delivering, so we're making changes to systematically improve our ability to acquire, retain and engage clients. We're utilizing improved data analytics and enhanced marketing techniques to optimize spend, deliver unique messages to discreet micro-segments of the market and ultimately improve our ROI. This modern approach is key in building brand relevance and attracting new clients. 
To wrap up, we've made many significant improvements to our business across a number of areas, including pricing, client experience, operational excellence, virtual products, promotion and partnerships, demonstrating our commitment to delivering for our clients. Our product offering is the most robust it's been in the history of our company. We're innovating and taking bold steps to disrupt the industry to ensure that we compete not only this season but for the long term. In short, we're excited about our future and for the season to begin. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss our second quarter financial results and outlook."

Before I get into the details of our Q2 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal second quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, second quarter results are not representat",980,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details of our Q2 results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal second quarter due to the seasonality of our business. Therefore, second quarter results are not representative of our full year performance. 
Starting with revenues. We saw a year-over-year increase of $8 million or 6% to $149 million. This is primarily the result of increased assisted tax prep revenues and the timing of revenues related to our Tax Identity Shield product, partially offset by lower international revenues, which were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates. 
Turning to expense. Total operating expenses increased $7 million or 2% to $364 million, primarily due to onetime costs of $10 million related to our office footprint optimization as well as increased compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization and marketing expense. 
The increases in revenue and operating expenses, combined with an increase in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and higher cash balances, drove an improvement in pretax loss from continuing operations of $4 million or 2%. While we saw an improvement in pretax loss, our loss per share increased $0.12 to $0.83. This was due to our lower tax benefit compared to last year as the lower corporate tax rate negatively impacts quarters with a seasonal loss. 
Turning to discontinued operations. There were no changes in accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. For additional information on Sand Canyon, please refer to disclosures in the company's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings. 
Turning to capital. Our priorities remain unchanged. We, first, focus on maintaining adequate liquidity to fund the business. We then look to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. We then fund our dividend, which we have done consistently since going public. And then finally, we look to opportunistically return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and, at a minimum, plan to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants. We did not repurchase shares during to the most recent quarter, but have repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $97 million for the fiscal year. 
I'd now like to provide some thoughts on our fiscal '19 outlook. Starting with the tax industry, we anticipate overall returns to grow 1% to 2% in tax season '19, consistent with historical trends and the current low unemployment environment. As we shared on our Q1 call, we don't anticipate the recent tax legislation to have a material impact on the method filers use to prepare their taxes. Our research confirms that many filers are confused and will be looking for help this tax season. As a result, we anticipate Assisted industry volume to be flat to slightly up, with the remainder of the industry growth coming in DIY. Overall, we expect the industry volumes to be very similar to the trends we've seen over the last few years. 
Specific to H&R Block, we expect to continue our trend of achieving overall client growth, driven by DIY and partially offset by a decline in Assisted due to the discontinuation of the free EZ promotion. The change in free EZ will impact the early part of the season and will be reflected in the results through February that we will release in early March. 
With respect to pricing, our new approach will result in a lower net average charge in our Assisted business. While we expect the net average charge to decline, it will be impacted by positive mix as we expect to serve fewer free EZ type clients. 
In DIY, we expect our net average charge to be consistent with last year, as we continue to focus on outpacing the category in returns and gaining market share. While there is some trade-down risk within DIY due to the new tax legislation, which would negatively impact our net average charge, we believe that risk will largely be offset by ask a tax pro and favorable mix. 
We are confirming our previously provided guidance, as we continue to expect total revenues at $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which takes into account the volume and pricing expectations I just shared. We're also maintaining our previously provided outlook of EBITDA margin of 24% to 26% and an effective tax rate of 23% to 25%. 
Moving on to the other items in our financial outlook. As we previously shared, fiscal '18 represented our high-water mark for depreciation and amortization, as we see the impact of office upgrades and franchise buybacks from several years ago roll off. We expect D&A to decline in fiscal '19 and be $165 million to $175 million. As a reminder, approximately 2/3 of our D&A is related to CapEx, while the remaining 1/3 is related to acquisitions. 
We expect to spend approximately 3% of revenues on capital expenditures in fiscal '19 or $95 million to $105 million. 
With respect to acquisitions, we anticipate repurchasing approximately 125 franchise locations, which was better than we originally expected, and adding approximately 45 independent locations to our network for a total capital investment of approximately $30 million. 
As a reminder, both franchise repurchases and independent acquisitions are typically completed at levels below our current trading multiple and, as such, are accretive to earnings. Beyond this year, we expect our franchise repurchase activity to moderate. 
For fiscal '19, we expect total interest expense to be $80 million to $85 million, driven by lower borrowing needs, offset by higher interest rates. 
Before I turn it back over to Jeff, I just want to share my excitement for the upcoming tax season. We have a great plan to put H&R Block on the path to long-term sustainable growth, and I'm looking forward to seeing our plans come to life in the coming months. 
With that, over to you, Jeff, for some closing thoughts."

Our goal isn't to be the low-priced leader, so I think H&R Block will demand some level of premium relative to a lot of the other offerings in the marketplace. Specific to your question on what type of premium were we at, it really depends. I think, across the spectrum, at different client complexity, our premiums varied, obviously, on the simple land or the free EZ. And we were very competitive last year, given we had the free EZ promotion. I think, given how our pricing had evolved over time, we definitely identified certain client segments where we were very much above the market average, if you will. The consumers don't really feel the average and it's impossible to shop the average, but we know in certain segments, in certain geographies, there's definitely places that we were well above the market. And we've taken the opportunity as part of this reset to try to fix most of those and bring us much more in line and use pricing as a catalyst to try to return us to client growth. That being said, it's well beyond pricing. Pricing is just 1 aspect of what we're trying to do. And it's the overall value proposition and all the elements that we're making -- the changes we are making that are eventually going to allow us to be successful."

I would just reiterate that we're not trying to be the low-price provider and to echo Tony's comments about all the other initiatives that have been put in place to demonstrate value. We also have seen that it's just not the price the consumer was paying. It was the fact they had no idea what it was going to cost. And so when I think about our approach to pricing, there are really 3 different components. The first component is really about the fact that they'll know the price before they begin. The second is how easy it will be for them to figure out what their price is. And then the third will be the actual price. And so we're really thinking about all 3 of those elements."

We have run various tests that we're constantly doing on different pricing approaches. Several years ago, we used to have a version of a pricing board in our offices, and that may be what you're remembering. It's probably been 4 or 5 years ago. I think the main difference between that and what we're rolling out now is that gave clients an indication of a range of where they may fall based on the particular life situation. But the challenge with that model was the ranges were incredibly wide. So you might have a range of $99 to $199, which isn't that helpful. And what we're rolling out this year is every client will know the pricing in its entirety and can place themself in the appropriate life situation and then whatever particular add-ons they have based on the documents they're bringing into the office to know their exact price. Because the feedback we got from several years ago is it's helpful versus nothing, but it still doesn't tell me my price. And some clients were worried that they were at the top end of the range and that maybe it was more hurtful than anything. So I think that's specific to what you may be remembering as far as what we would have done in New York. What we are rolling out is nationwide, so it [ won't ] be in every company office. Obviously, franchisees have the ability to opt in. We're very pleased that we've had incredible opt-in rates. The vast majority of franchisees will be following the model this year on a national level. Franchisees, though, as you remember, do set their own individual prices, so their price points may and will be different from the company offices, but they will be following the model because they believe in it so much, which we were very pleased to see that result coming out of our franchise meeting. I think your earlier question was specific to volume. I mean, we're not going to get more specific than saying that the first half will be where we expect to see some level of loss given the free EZ promotion. Our goal is to continue to grow clients in all segments, in all parts of the season, whether it be first half or second half, but we just know that given the free EZ promotion ran through 2/28 last year, it will be a bit of a headwind."
