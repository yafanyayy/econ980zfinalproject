As we announced earlier today, we delivered another quarter of revenue and profit growth. Revenue grew 3% on a consolidated basis. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9% and represented [ 78% ] of our revenue in the holiday peak quarter. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 56% due to favorable shifts in both segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, resulting in operating income growth of 12%. These strong results generated a GAAP EPS of $0.73 and pro forma EPS of $0.79 in the quarter.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2017 was our second-consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. I believe this is a remarkable achievement considering the challenges that we faced. The TMB market continued its decline as it has done for nearly a decade. In addition, the basic activity tracker market rapidly matured and left additional gaps to fill. We filled these gaps and more because of the strength and diversity of our business. Revenue increased 2% over 2016 to nearly $3.1 billion. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9% and generated 90% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 58% and 22%, respectively, while operating income grew 7%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.68 and pro forma EPS of $2.94. Pro forma EPS grew 4% over the prior year. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I want to highlight that Garmin was recently included in the Forbes Global 2000 World's Best Employers List, placing 430th out of more than 300,000 companies that were surveyed. We also were ranked 41st in the Forbes Just 100 Americas Best Corporate Citizens List. This ranking considered companies focused on 7 metrics, including producing quality goods, treating customers well, minimizing environmental impact, supporting the communities we operate in, commitment to ethical and diverse leadership, and treating our workers well. We are honored by this recognition, and I want to thank all of our employees for your strong commitment to our mission and values, which made this recognition possible. 
Next, I'll highlight 2017 performance and 2018 outlook for each of our 5 segments. 
Starting with Outdoor. Revenue increased 28% on strong demand for outdoor wearables and growth in inReach subscription services. The segment posted growth in operating margins of 64% and 36%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 36% over the prior year. 
Looking back on 2017, our fenix line of adventure watches continued to show strong momentum, driven by the new fenix 5 series. There are many positive things that we can say about this product line, but one I'd like to highlight is that the variety of sizes and styles offered in the fenix 5 family have successfully broadened our customer base.  In particular, the majority of customers registering fenix 5S devices are women, which was a previously underrepresented demographic in our fenix customer base. 
As we have mentioned in the past, our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now offers more than 3,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated over 45 million downloads since inception, approximately 1/2 of which occurred in the last year. To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our Second Annual Developers Conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that our developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the outdoor segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate that growth will be driven primarily by the fenix series and supported by growth in other product categories within the segment.
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 14%, with revenues exceeding $500 million for the first time in our history. Growth was broad-based in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Gross and operating margins were strong at 74% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 23% for the year. 
In recent developments, Textron Aviation announced that the new Cessna Sky Courier aircraft will be equipped with the Garmin G1000 NXi system. We are excited to expand our partnership with Textron Aviation and look forward to supporting the certification and delivery of this new aircraft. Last week, we announced that our D2 Charlie aviation watch was selected by the United States Air Force for use by pilots of the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The D2 Charlie will provide unique benefits such as pressure alerts and classical navigation information on the wrist. 
Our Aviation team has a strong commitment to delivering quality and service to our customers. As evidence of that commitment, we received 2 Supplier of the Year Awards for technical support to operators and for electric and electronic systems at the recent 2017 Embraer Suppliers Conference. This is a significant accomplishment considering the scope and complexity of Embraer's operation and the high expectations that their suppliers must meet. Also, for the 14th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionic support by Professional Pilot Magazine and by Aviation International News. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers. Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the Aviation segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate broad-based growth across both OEM and aftermarket product categories due to improving market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and opportunities related to the ADS-B mandate. 
Looking next at the Marine segment. Revenue grew 13%, driven by growth in chartplotters, fish finders and contributions from our recent Navionics acquisition. Gross margin improved to 57%, while operating margin declined to 13% due to litigation-related costs. At the Miami Boat Show, we announced that Sea Hunt Boat Company, one of the top-selling saltwater boat in the United States, is now offering Garmin electronics in their line of watercraft. We are excited by the opportunity to serve Sea Hunt and their customers. 
We are entering 2018 with a broad portfolio of strong products and technologies. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 18%, consisting of both organic growth as well as growth from our recent Navionics acquisition. 
Turning now to fitness. Revenue declined 7%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, partially offset by growth in advance wearables and our children's line of activity trackers. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 19%, respectively. Gross margin improved due to product mix, while operating margin declined from the prior year. In 2018, we are targeting revenue to be flat in the fitness segment as growth in advance wearables, cycling, and children's trackers is offset by further declines in basic activity trackers.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 15% for the full year as expected due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 9%, respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories, including trucking, RV and cameras. We are focused on maximizing profit in the segment while leveraging these opportunities. 
Looking at 2018, we expect revenue to decline approximately 17%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and maximize profitability in the segment. 
In summary, we are entering 2018 with a strong product lineup, and we see many opportunities ahead. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year, as growth in outdoor, aviation and marine is partially offset by ongoing declines in the auto segment. We are projecting improved gross margin of approximately 58.5%; operating margin of approximately 21%; and full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 19%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.05. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

We move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, impact new revenue recognition standard. We posted revenue of $888 million for the fourth quarter, representing 3% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 56.2%, 150 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $179 million, a 12% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.2%, 162 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.73. Our pro forma EPS was $0.79.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of about $3.1 billion for the year, representing 2% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57.8%, a 220 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36.1%, 110 basis point increase over the prior year. Operating income was $669 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 21.7%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin. Our GAAP EPS was $3.68. Pro forma EPS was $2.94. 
Next, we'll look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments, led by marine segment at 24%. Fitness returned to growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we achieved 2% consolidated growth, led by robust growth in our outdoor segment and solid double-digit growth at aviation and marine segments. 
Looking next at fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 78% of total revenue fourth quarter 2017 compared to 74% prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 20% to 23%. 
This chart illustrate our profit mixed by segment. The outdoor, the aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 90% of operating income fourth quarter 2017 compared to 88% fourth quarter of 2016. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 36% to 41%. 
Looking next to the full year charts. For the full year, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments made up 76% of total revenue compared to 71% in 2016. Similar shift occurred in operating income with 90% of our 2017 operating income collectively coming from the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments compared to 84% in 2016. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $9 million or basically flat as a percentage of sales. Research and development increased [ $4 ] million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and Navionics acquisition, partially offset by additional weaker expense in 2016. [indiscernible] expense decreased $9 million from the prior year quarter, represented 6.6% of sales, [ 230 ] basis points decrease. The decrease was due to primarily to lower media spend at fitness segment. 
SG&A was up $50 million compared to the prior quarter, an increase of 120 basis points as a percent of sales to 14.5%. This increase was primarily due to litigation-related cost on Navionics acquisition. 
A few highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.2 billion. Accounts receivables increased sequentially to $591 million due to holiday quarter, an increase year-over-year due to stronger sales and the timing of cash receipts. Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $580 million as we exit the seasonally strong fourth quarter -- increased year-over-year, primarily due to raw material requirements. 
During the fourth quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $144 million. Also during the quarter,, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for an increased dividend beginning the June 2018 payment. The proposal of the cash dividend of $2.12 per share, $0.33 per share per quarter, 4% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share. 
For full year 2017, reported income tax benefit of $13 million, which includes $157 million of pro forma net discrete items relating to [ $480  ] million tax benefit related to the change in tax balance sheet accounts, which result with Solon corporate tax election, partially offset by $23 million of tax expense resulting from an accounting standard related to the exploration of share-based awards. Excluding this pro forma discrete tax items, the full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate is 21.2% compared to 18.9% the prior year. The increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to company selection to align certain Switzerland tax positions involving international tax initiatives. We expect our full year pro forma effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 19%. The decrease is primarily due to the U.S. tax reform. 
Finally, I'd like to walk you through the impact of the new recognition standard. We adopted the new standard in the first quarter 2018 to stay the prior year financials. The auto segment is the only segment impacted by the new revenue recognition standard. The impact to our 2017 financial statements is an increase in revenue of $35 million, which means we would have deferred less revenue compared to the new revenue standard. All 2018 guidance is calculated off the restated 2017 amount, which are available in the Appendix to earnings release. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Michelle, could you please open the line for Q&A."

In terms of its sustainability, I think things look good for the foreseeable future. Somebody recently commented to me though that some of these markets like aviation and marine are one economic bump away from downturn, so we have to recognize that they are somewhat fragile due to their nature. But in general, we feel good about that. In terms of ADS-B and wish here would be the peak year. We would see an acceleration in unit deliveries going forward. I think I wouldn't anticipate that 2019 would probably be even bigger than 2018 as people get serious about retrofitting their aircraft. But it's still somewhat early days in the number of aircraft that have been equipped so far is still on the low side, less than 1/2, so we're waiting to see more people step forward."

As we announced earlier today, we delivered another quarter of revenue and profit growth. Revenue grew 3% on a consolidated basis. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9% and represented 78% of our revenue in the holiday peak quarter. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 56% due to favorable shifts in both segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, resulting in operating income growth of 12%. These strong results generated a GAAP EPS of $0.73 and pro forma EPS of $0.79 in the quarter.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2017 was our second consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. I believe this is a remarkable achievement considering the challenges that we faced. The PND market continued its decline as it has done for nearly a decade. In addition, the basic activity tracker market rapidly matured and left additional gaps to fill. We filled these gaps and more because of the strength and diversity of our business. 
Revenue increased 2% over 2016 to nearly $3.1 billion. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9% and generated 90% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 58% and 22%, respectively, while operating income grew 7%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.68 and pro forma EPS of $2.94. Pro forma EPS grew 4% over the prior year. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I want to highlight that Garmin was recently included in the Forbes Global 2000 World's Best Employers list, placing 430th out of more than 300,000 companies that were surveyed. We also were ranked 41st in the Forbes Just 100: America's Best Corporate Citizens list. This ranking considered companies focused on 7 metrics, including producing quality goods, treating customers well, minimizing environmental impact, supporting the communities we operate in, commitment to ethical and diverse leadership and treating our workers well. We are honored by this recognition, and I want to thank all of our employees for your strong commitment to our mission and values, which made this recognition possible. 
Next, I'll highlight 2017 performance and 2018 outlook for each of our 5 segments. Starting with outdoor. Revenue increased 28% on strong demand for outdoor wearables and growth in inReach subscription services. The segment posted gross and operating margins of 64% and 36%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 36% over the prior year. 
Looking back on 2017, our fenix line of adventure watches continued to show strong momentum, driven by the new fenix 5 series. There are many positive things that we can say about this product line, but one I'd like to highlight is that the variety of sizes and styles offered in the fenix 5 family has successfully broadened our customer base. In particular, the majority of customers registering fenix 5S devices are women, which was a previously underrepresented demographic in our fenix customer base. 
As we have mentioned in the past, our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now offers more than 3,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated over 45 million downloads since inception, approximately half of which occurred in the last year. To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our second annual Developers Conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that our developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the outdoor segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate that growth will be driven primarily by the fenix series and supported by growth in other product categories within the segment.
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 14%, with revenues exceeding $500 million for the first time in our history. Growth was broad-based in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Gross and operating margins were strong at 74% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 23% for the year. 
In recent developments, Textron Aviation announced that the new Cessna Sky Courier aircraft will be equipped with the Garmin G1000 NXi system. We are excited to expand our partnership with Textron Aviation and look forward to supporting the certification and delivery of this new aircraft. 
Last week, we announced that our D2 Charlie aviation watch was selected by the United States Air Force for use by pilots of the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The D2 Charlie will provide unique benefits such as pressure alerts and classical navigation information on the wrist. 
Our aviation team has a strong commitment to delivering quality and service to our customers. As evidence of that commitment, we received 2 Supplier of the Year Awards for technical support to operators and for electric and electronic systems at the recent 2017 Embraer Suppliers Conference. This is a significant accomplishment considering the scope and complexity of Embraer's operation and the high expectations that their suppliers must meet. Also, for the 14th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionic support by Professional Pilot Magazine and by Aviation International News. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which are the testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the aviation segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate broad-based growth across both OEM and aftermarket product categories due to improving market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and opportunities related to the ADS-B mandate. 
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue grew 13%, driven by growth in chartplotters, fishfinders and contributions from our recent Navionics acquisition. Gross margin improved to 57%, while operating margin declined to 13% due to litigation-related costs. At the Miami Boat Show, we announced that Sea Hunt Boat Company, one of the top-selling saltwater boat brands in the United States, is now offering Garmin electronics in their line of watercraft. We are excited by the opportunity to serve Sea Hunt and their customers. 
We are entering 2018 with a broad portfolio of strong products and technologies. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 18%, consisting of both organic growth as well as growth from our recent Navionics acquisition. 
Turning next to fitness. Revenue declined 7%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, partially offset by growth in advanced wearables and our children's line of activity trackers. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 19%, respectively. Gross margin improved due to product mix, while operating margin declined from the prior year. In 2018, we are targeting revenue to be flat in the fitness segment as growth in advanced wearables, cycling and children's trackers is offset by further declines in basic activity trackers.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 15% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 9%, respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories, including trucking, RV and cameras. We are focused on maximizing profits in the segment while leveraging these opportunities. 
Looking at 2018, we expect revenue to decline approximately 17%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment. 
In summary, we are entering 2018 with a strong product lineup, and we see many opportunities ahead. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year, as growth in outdoor, aviation and marine is partially offset by ongoing declines in the auto segment. We are projecting improved gross margin of approximately 58.5%, operating margin of approximately 21% and full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 19%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.05. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, impact of new revenue recognition standard. We posted revenue of $888",931,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, impact of new revenue recognition standard. We posted revenue of $888 million for the fourth quarter, representing 3% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 56.2%, 150 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $179 million, a 12% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.2%, 160 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.73. Our pro forma EPS was $0.79.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of about $3.1 billion for the year, representing 2% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57.8%, a 220 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36.1%, 110 basis point increase over the prior year. Operating income was $669 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 21.7%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin. Our GAAP EPS was $3.68. Pro forma EPS was $2.94. 
Next, we'll look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments, led by marine segment with 24%. Fitness returned to growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we achieved 2% consolidated growth, led by robust growth in our outdoor segment and solid double-digit growth in our aviation and marine segments. 
Looking next at fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 78% of total revenue in fourth quarter 2017 compared to 74% in prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 20% to 23%.  You can see from the charts illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 90% of operating income in fourth quarter 2017 compared to 88% in fourth quarter of 2016. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 36% to 41%. 
Looking next to the full year charts. For the full year, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments made up 76% of total revenue compared to 71% in 2016. Similar shift occurred in operating income, with 90% of our 2017 operating income collectively coming from the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments compared to 84% in 2016. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $9 million or basically flat as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and Navionics acquisition, partially offset by the additional week of expense in 2016. Our advertising expense decreased $9 million from the prior year quarter, representing 6.6% of sales, a 130 basis points decrease. The decrease was due primarily to lower media spend in the fitness segment. 
SG&A was up $15 million compared to the prior year quarter, an increase of 120 basis points as a percent of sales to 14.5%. This increase was primarily due to litigation-related costs and Navionics acquisition. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $591 million due to holiday quarter, an increase year-over-year due to stronger sales and timing of cash receipts. Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $580 million as we exit the seasonally strong fourth quarter but increased year-over-year primarily due to raw material requirements. 
During the fourth quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $144 million. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for an increased dividend beginning the June 2018 payment. The proposal is a cash dividend of $2.12 per share, $0.53 per share per quarter, 4% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share. 
For full year 2017, we reported an income tax benefit of $13 million, which includes $157 million of pro forma net discrete items relating to a $180 million tax benefit related to the change in tax balance sheet accounts as a result of the Switzerland corporate tax election, partially offset by $23 million of tax expense resulting from the new accounting standard related to the expiration of share-based awards. Excluding these pro forma discrete tax items, the full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate is 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the prior year. The increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland tax positions with evolving international tax initiatives. We expect our full year pro forma effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 19%. The decrease is primarily due to the U.S. tax reform. 
Finally, I'd like to walk you through the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. We adopted the new standard in the first quarter 2018 and restated the prior year financials. The auto segment is the only segment impacted by the new revenue recognition standard. Impact to our 2017 financial statements is an increase in revenue of $35 million, which means we would have deferred less revenue compared to the new revenue standard. All 2018 guidance is calculated off the restated 2017 amounts, which are available in the appendix to earnings release. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Michelle, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

In terms of its sustainability, I think things look good for the foreseeable future. Somebody recently commented to me, though, that some of these markets, like aviation and marine, are one economic bump away from downturn, so we have to recognize that they are somewhat fragile due to their nature. But in general, we feel good about that. In terms of ADS-B and which year would be the peak year, we would certainly see acceleration in unit deliveries going forward. I think I would anticipate that 2019 would probably be even bigger than 2018 as people get serious about retrofitting their aircraft. But it's still somewhat early days, and the number of aircraft that have been equipped so far is still on the low side, less than half, so we're waiting to see more people step forward."

As we announced earlier today, we delivered another quarter of revenue and profit growth. Revenue grew 3% on a consolidated basis. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9% and represented 78% of our revenue in the holiday quarter. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 56% due to favorable shifts in both segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, resulting in operating income growth of 12%. These strong results generated a GAAP EPS of $0.73 and pro forma EPS of $0.79 in the quarter.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2017 was our second consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. I believe this is a remarkable achievement considering the challenges that we faced. The PND market continued its decline as it has done for nearly a decade. In addition, the basic activity tracker market rapidly matured and left additional gaps to fill. We filled these gaps and more because of the strength and diversity of our business. 
Revenue increased 2% over 2016 to nearly $3.1 billion. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9% and generated 90% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 58% and 22%, respectively, while operating income grew 7%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.68 and pro forma EPS of $2.94. Pro forma EPS grew 4% over the prior year. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I want to highlight that Garmin was recently included in the Forbes Global 2000 World's Best Employers list, placing 430th out of more than 300,000 companies that were surveyed. We also were ranked 41st in the Forbes Just 100: America's Best Corporate Citizens list. This ranking considered companies focused on 7 metrics, including producing quality goods, treating customers well, minimizing environmental impact, supporting the communities we operate in, commitment to ethical and diverse leadership and treating our workers well. We are honored by this recognition, and I want to thank all of our employees for your strong commitment to our mission and values, which made this recognition possible. 
Next, I'll highlight 2017 performance and 2018 outlook for each of our 5 segments. Starting with outdoor. Revenue increased 28% on strong demand for outdoor wearables and growth in inReach subscription services. The segment posted gross and operating margins of 64% and 36%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 36% over the prior year. 
Looking back on 2017, our fenix line of adventure watches continued to show strong momentum, driven by the new fenix 5 series. There are many positive things that we can say about this product line, but one I'd like to highlight is that the variety of sizes and styles offered in the fenix 5 family has successfully broadened our customer base. In particular, the majority of customers registering fenix 5S devices are women, which was a previously underrepresented demographic in our fenix customer base. 
As we have mentioned in the past, our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now offers more than 3,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated over 45 million downloads since inception, approximately half of which occurred in the past year. To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our second annual Developers Conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that our developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the outdoor segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate that growth will be driven primarily by the fenix series and supported by growth in other product categories within the segment.
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 14%, with revenues exceeding $500 million for the first time in our history. Growth was broad-based in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Gross and operating margins were strong at 74% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 23% for the year. 
In recent developments, Textron Aviation announced that the new Cessna Sky Courier aircraft will be equipped with the Garmin G1000 NXi system. We are excited to expand our partnership with Textron Aviation and look forward to supporting the certification and delivery of this new aircraft. 
Last week, we announced that our D2 Charlie aviation watch was selected by the United States Air Force for use by pilots of the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The D2 Charlie will provide unique benefits such as pressure alerts and glance-able navigation information on the wrist. 
Our aviation team has a strong commitment to delivering quality and service to our customers. As evidence of that commitment, we received 2 Supplier of the Year Awards for technical support to operators and for electric and electronic systems at the recent 2017 Embraer Suppliers Conference. This is a significant accomplishment considering the scope and complexity of Embraer's operation and the high expectations that their suppliers must meet. Also, for the 14th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionic support by Professional Pilot Magazine and by Aviation International News. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the aviation segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate broad-based growth across both OEM and aftermarket product categories due to improving market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and opportunities related to the ADS-B mandate. 
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue grew 13%, driven by growth in chartplotters, fishfinders and contributions from our recent Navionics acquisition. Gross margin improved to 57%, while operating margin declined to 13% due to litigation-related costs. At the Miami Boat Show, we announced that Sea Hunt Boat Company, one of the top-selling saltwater boat brands in the United States, is now offering Garmin electronics in their line of watercraft. We are excited by the opportunity to serve Sea Hunt and their customers. 
We are entering 2018 with a broad portfolio of strong products and technologies. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 18%, consisting of both organic growth as well as growth from our recent Navionics acquisition. 
Turning next to fitness. Revenue declined 7%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, partially offset by growth in advanced wearables and our children's line of activity trackers. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 19%, respectively. Gross margin improved due to product mix, while operating margin declined from the prior year. In 2018, we are targeting revenue to be flat in the fitness segment as growth in advanced wearables, cycling and children's trackers is offset by further declines in basic activity trackers.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 15% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 9%, respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories, including trucking, RV and cameras. We are focused on maximizing profits in this segment while leveraging these opportunities. 
Looking at 2018, we expect revenue to decline approximately 17%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in this segment. 
In summary, we are entering 2018 with a strong product lineup, and we see many opportunities ahead. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year, as growth in outdoor, aviation and marine is partially offset by ongoing declines in the auto segment. We are projecting improved gross margin of approximately 58.5%, operating margin of approximately 21% and a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 19%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.05. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, impact of new revenue recognition standard. We posted revenue of $888",939,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, impact of new revenue recognition standard. We posted revenue of $888 million for the fourth quarter, representing 3% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 56.2%, 150 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $179 million, a 12% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.2%, a 160 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.73. Our pro forma EPS was $0.79.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of about $3.1 billion for the year, representing a 2% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57.8%, a 220 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36.1%, a 110 basis point increase over the prior year. Operating income was $669 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 21.7%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin. Our GAAP EPS was $3.68. Pro forma EPS was $2.94. 
Next, we'll look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments, led by marine segment with 24%. Fitness returned to growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we achieved 2% consolidated growth, led by robust growth in our outdoor segment and solid double-digit growth in our aviation and marine segments. 
Looking next at fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 78% of total revenue in fourth quarter 2017 compared to 74% in prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 20% to 23%.  You can see from the charts illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 90% of operating income in fourth quarter 2017 compared to 88% in fourth quarter of 2016. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 36% to 41%. 
Looking next to the full year charts. For the full year, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments made up 76% of total revenue compared to 71% in 2016. A similar shift occurred in operating income, with 90% of our 2017 operating income collectively coming from the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments compared to 84% in 2016. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $9 million or basically flat as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and the Navionics acquisition, partially offset by the additional week of expense in 2016. Our advertising expense decreased $9 million from the prior year quarter, represented 6.6% of sales, a [ 130 ] basis points decrease. The decrease was due primarily to lower media spend in the fitness segment. 
SG&A was up $15 million compared to the prior year quarter, an increase of 120 basis points as a percent of sales to 14.5%. This increase was primarily due to litigation-related costs and Navionics acquisition. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $591 million due to holiday quarter, an increase year-over-year due to stronger sales and timing of cash receipts. Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $518 million as we exited the seasonally strong fourth quarter but increased year-over-year primarily due to raw material requirements. 
During the fourth quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $144 million. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for an increased dividend beginning the June 2018 payment. The proposal is a cash dividend of $2.12 per share, $0.53 per share per quarter, 4% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share. 
For full year 2017, we reported an income tax benefit of $13 million, which includes $157 million of pro forma net discrete items relating to a $180 million tax benefit related to the change in tax balance sheet accounts as a result of the Switzerland corporate tax election, partially offset by $23 million of tax expense resulting from a new accounting standard related to the expiration of share-based awards. Excluding these pro forma discrete tax items, the full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate is 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the prior year. The increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland tax positions with evolving international tax initiatives. We expect our full year pro forma effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 19%. The decrease is primarily due to the U.S. tax reform. 
Finally, I'd like to walk you through the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. We adopted the new standard in the first quarter 2018 and restate the prior year financials. The auto segment is the only segment impacted by the new revenue recognition standard. Impact to our 2017 financial statements is an increase in revenue of $35 million, which means we would have deferred less revenue under to the new revenue standard. All 2018 guidance is calculated off the restated 2017 amounts, which are available in the appendix to our earnings release. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Michelle, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

In terms of its sustainability, I think things look good for the foreseeable future. Somebody recently commented to me, though, that some of these markets, like aviation and marine, are one economic bump away from downturn, so we have to recognize that they are somewhat fragile due to their nature. But in general, we feel good about that. In terms of ADS-B and which year would be the peak year, we would certainly see acceleration in unit deliveries going forward. I think I would anticipate that 2019 would probably be even bigger than 2018 as people get serious about retrofitting their aircraft. But it's still somewhat early days, and the number of aircraft that have been equipped so far is still on the low side, less than half, so we're waiting to see more people step forward."

And so consequently, the basic market has matured and is declining rapidly. So our share assumptions are pretty equal to what they've been in the past. In the basic side, we've typically said that on a global basis, roughly 10% market share as we look across the universe of what's going on around the world. In terms of impact on Forerunner, that falls into our advanced category, so that's the area where we still see opportunity. And we still see people moving towards the more advanced products. In the case of Forerunner, it's more technical runners, but in the case of our vívoactive line, which is GPS-enabled smart watches, those are the folks that are coming off the basic trackers into a more advanced product."

As we announced earlier today, we delivered another quarter of revenue and profit growth. Revenue grew 3% on a consolidated basis. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9% and represented 78% of our revenue in the holiday quarter. Gross margin improved year-over-year to 56% due to favorable shifts in both segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, resulting in operating income growth of 12%. These strong results generated a GAAP EPS of $0.73 and pro forma EPS of $0.79 in the quarter.
Looking briefly at our full year performance. 2017 was our second consecutive year of revenue and operating income growth. I believe this is a remarkable achievement considering the challenges that we faced. The PND market continued its decline as it has done for nearly a decade. In addition, the basic activity tracker market rapidly matured and left additional gaps to fill. We filled these gaps and more because of the strength and diversity of our business. 
Revenue increased 2% over 2016 to nearly $3.1 billion. Combined revenue from outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness increased 9% and generated 90% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins improved to 58% and 22%, respectively, while operating income grew 7%. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $3.68 and pro forma EPS of $2.94. Pro forma EPS grew 4% over the prior year. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I want to highlight that Garmin was recently included in the Forbes Global 2000 World's Best Employers list, placing 430th out of more than 300,000 companies that were surveyed. We also were ranked 41st in the Forbes Just 100: America's Best Corporate Citizens list. This ranking considered companies focused on 7 metrics, including producing quality goods, treating customers well, minimizing environmental impact, supporting the communities we operate in, commitment to ethical and diverse leadership and treating our workers well. We are honored by this recognition, and I want to thank all of our employees for your strong commitment to our mission and values, which made this recognition possible. 
Next, I'll highlight 2017 performance and 2018 outlook for each of our 5 segments. Starting with outdoor. Revenue increased 28% on strong demand for outdoor wearables and growth in inReach subscription services. The segment posted gross and operating margins of 64% and 36%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 36% over the prior year. 
Looking back on 2017, our fenix line of adventure watches continued to show strong momentum, driven by the new fenix 5 series. There are many positive things that we can say about this product line, but one I'd like to highlight is that the variety of sizes and styles offered in the fenix 5 family has successfully broadened our customer base. In particular, the majority of customers registering fenix 5S devices are women, which was a previously underrepresented demographic in our fenix customer base. 
As we have mentioned in the past, our Connect IQ application platform has become an important differentiator for our smart wearables. Connect IQ now offers more than 3,500 apps, widgets and watch faces and has generated over 45 million downloads since inception, approximately half of which occurred in the past year. To further promote the power and utility of Connect IQ, we will host our second annual Developers Conference in mid-April, offering workshops and tools that our developers can use to leverage the Garmin wearable ecosystem. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the outdoor segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate that growth will be driven primarily by the fenix series and supported by growth in other product categories within the segment.
Turning next to aviation. We reported solid revenue growth of 14%, with revenues exceeding $500 million for the first time in our history. Growth was broad-based in both aftermarket and OEM product categories. Gross and operating margins were strong at 74% and 31%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 23% for the year. 
In recent developments, Textron Aviation announced that the new Cessna Sky Courier aircraft will be equipped with the Garmin G1000 NXi system. We are excited to expand our partnership with Textron Aviation and look forward to supporting the certification and delivery of this new aircraft. 
Last week, we announced that our D2 Charlie aviation watch was selected by the United States Air Force for use by pilots of the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The D2 Charlie will provide unique benefits such as pressure alerts and glance-able navigation information on the wrist. 
Our aviation team has a strong commitment to delivering quality and service to our customers. As evidence of that commitment, we received 2 Supplier of the Year Awards for technical support to operators and for electric and electronic systems at the recent 2017 Embraer Suppliers Conference. This is a significant accomplishment considering the scope and complexity of Embraer's operation and the high expectations that their suppliers must meet. Also, for the 14th consecutive year, Garmin was ranked #1 in avionic support by Professional Pilot Magazine and by Aviation International News. I congratulate our team on earning these awards, which is a testament to the quality of Garmin equipment and the amazing way our associates care for our customers. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate revenue in the aviation segment will increase approximately 13% in 2018. We anticipate broad-based growth across both OEM and aftermarket product categories due to improving market conditions, contributions from new products and platforms and opportunities related to the ADS-B mandate. 
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue grew 13%, driven by growth in chartplotters, fishfinders and contributions from our recent Navionics acquisition. Gross margin improved to 57%, while operating margin declined to 13% due to litigation-related costs. At the Miami Boat Show, we announced that Sea Hunt Boat Company, one of the top-selling saltwater boat brands in the United States, is now offering Garmin electronics in their line of watercraft. We are excited by the opportunity to serve Sea Hunt and their customers. 
We are entering 2018 with a broad portfolio of strong products and technologies. We anticipate revenue in the marine segment will increase approximately 18%, consisting of both organic growth as well as growth from our recent Navionics acquisition. 
Turning next to fitness. Revenue declined 7%, driven by the rapidly maturing market for basic activity trackers, partially offset by growth in advanced wearables and our children's line of activity trackers. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 19%, respectively. Gross margin improved due to product mix, while operating margin declined from the prior year. In 2018, we are targeting revenue to be flat in the fitness segment as growth in advanced wearables, cycling and children's trackers is offset by further declines in basic activity trackers.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 15% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. However, our global market share remains very strong. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 9%, respectively. While the downward trend of the consumer PND market is well understood, we see incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories, including trucking, RV and cameras. We are focused on maximizing profits in this segment while leveraging these opportunities. 
Looking at 2018, we expect revenue to decline approximately 17%, driven by the ongoing decline of the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution to bring pragmatic innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in this segment. 
In summary, we are entering 2018 with a strong product lineup, and we see many opportunities ahead. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $3.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year, as growth in outdoor, aviation and marine is partially offset by ongoing declines in the auto segment. We are projecting improved gross margin of approximately 58.5%, operating margin of approximately 21% and a full year pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 19%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.05. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, impact of new revenue recognition standard. We posted revenue of $888",939,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, taxes, impact of new revenue recognition standard. We posted revenue of $888 million for the fourth quarter, representing 3% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 56.2%, 150 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $179 million, a 12% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 20.2%, a 160 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.73. Our pro forma EPS was $0.79.
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of about $3.1 billion for the year, representing a 2% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57.8%, a 220 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 36.1%, a 110 basis point increase over the prior year. Operating income was $669 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Operating margin was 21.7%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin. Our GAAP EPS was $3.68. Pro forma EPS was $2.94. 
Next, we'll look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments, led by marine segment with 24%. Fitness returned to growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2017, we achieved 2% consolidated growth, led by robust growth in our outdoor segment and solid double-digit growth in our aviation and marine segments. 
Looking next at fourth quarter revenue and operating income. Collectively, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments contributed 78% of total revenue in fourth quarter 2017 compared to 74% in prior year quarter. Outdoor grew from 20% to 23%.  You can see from the charts illustrating our profit mix by segment, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments collectively delivered 90% of operating income in fourth quarter 2017 compared to 88% in fourth quarter of 2016. Outdoor operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 36% to 41%. 
Looking next to the full year charts. For the full year, the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments made up 76% of total revenue compared to 71% in 2016. A similar shift occurred in operating income, with 90% of our 2017 operating income collectively coming from the outdoor, aviation, marine and fitness segments compared to 84% in 2016. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $9 million or basically flat as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and the Navionics acquisition, partially offset by the additional week of expense in 2016. Our advertising expense decreased $9 million from the prior year quarter, represented 6.6% of sales, a [ 130 ] basis points decrease. The decrease was due primarily to lower media spend in the fitness segment. 
SG&A was up $15 million compared to the prior year quarter, an increase of 120 basis points as a percent of sales to 14.5%. This increase was primarily due to litigation-related costs and Navionics acquisition. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $591 million due to holiday quarter, an increase year-over-year due to stronger sales and timing of cash receipts. Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $518 million as we exited the seasonally strong fourth quarter but increased year-over-year primarily due to raw material requirements. 
During the fourth quarter 2017, we generated free cash flow of $144 million. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million. We announced that we plan to seek shareholder approval for an increased dividend beginning the June 2018 payment. The proposal is a cash dividend of $2.12 per share, $0.53 per share per quarter, 4% increase from our current quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share. 
For full year 2017, we reported an income tax benefit of $13 million, which includes $157 million of pro forma net discrete items relating to a $180 million tax benefit related to the change in tax balance sheet accounts as a result of the Switzerland corporate tax election, partially offset by $23 million of tax expense resulting from a new accounting standard related to the expiration of share-based awards. Excluding these pro forma discrete tax items, the full year 2017 pro forma effective tax rate is 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the prior year. The increase in the pro forma effective tax rate is primarily due to the company's election to align certain Switzerland tax positions with evolving international tax initiatives. We expect our full year pro forma effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 19%. The decrease is primarily due to the U.S. tax reform. 
Finally, I'd like to walk you through the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. We adopted the new standard in the first quarter 2018 and restate the prior year financials. The auto segment is the only segment impacted by the new revenue recognition standard. Impact to our 2017 financial statements is an increase in revenue of $35 million, which means we would have deferred less revenue under to the new revenue standard. All 2018 guidance is calculated off the restated 2017 amounts, which are available in the appendix to our earnings release. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Michelle, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

In terms of its sustainability, I think things look good for the foreseeable future. Somebody recently commented to me, though, that some of these markets, like aviation and marine, are one economic bump away from downturn, so we have to recognize that they are somewhat fragile due to their nature. But in general, we feel good about that. In terms of ADS-B and which year would be the peak year, we would certainly see acceleration in unit deliveries going forward. I think I would anticipate that 2019 would probably be even bigger than 2018 as people get serious about retrofitting their aircraft. But it's still somewhat early days, and the number of aircraft that have been equipped so far is still on the low side, less than half, so we're waiting to see more people step forward."

As it relates to OpEx, what we'll see there is absolutely investment in where we have our advanced wearables, primarily in the outdoor area. Also, at the aviation, we'll make R&D investments in there, too. So given the decline that we're seeing in the auto areas, hopefully, we're looking at tightening up those expenses in those areas. And then as it relates to advertising, as we looked at the 2017, we actually cut back on our advertising in the fitness area related to activity trackers, so we'll continue to look at that, where we really have some of the more advanced wearable products like the fenix."

Consolidated revenue came in at $711 million, up 11% over the prior year. O",781,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded revenue for the first quarter of 2018 with double-digit growth in revenue, profit and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $711 million, up 11% over the prior year. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine collectively increased 18% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. 
Gross margin improved year-over-year to 60% due to segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, while operating income increased 22%. This resulted in GAAP and pro forma EPS of $0.68, with pro forma EPS growth of 31% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings. Since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year and much of the year remain ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few remarks on our performance in each business segment. 
Starting with outdoor. Revenue increased 24% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 65% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 27% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we began shipping that Descent dive watch. Descent brings innovation to the dive computer market by combining smartwatch utility with dive computer functions for the underwater adventurer. Descent has been well-received, and we are excited for the opportunities we have in this new product category. 
Also, we recently announced the tactix Charlie, a tactical-themed smartwatch with unique features such as nightvision compatibility and jump master mode for skydivers.
Looking next to fitness. Revenue increased 20%, driven primarily by growth in the advanced wearable category. Gross margin improved to 58% due to product mix. Operating income improved to 20%, resulting in operating income growth of 81%. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Forerunner 645M, our first GPS running watch with integrated music and mobile payments. 
We recently announced several new cycling products, including the Edge 130 and the Edge 520 Plus. The Edge 130 is an entry-level cycling computer packed with features, and the Edge 520 Plus offers advanced mapping and navigation capabilities. 
We also announced the Varia RTL510, the latest in our series of products that focus on cycling safety. 
We hosted our second annual Connect IQ Developer Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshop with our product managers and our engineers. The momentum behind Connect IQ is accelerating, with more than 54 million Connect IQ downloads to more than 8 million compatible devices shipped since inception. 
And finally, just yesterday, we announced the collaboration with the University of Kansas Medical Center on multiple research projects exploring the use of wearable technology for the early detection of underreported health conditions such as sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 19%, driven by broad-based strength across the market. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 33%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 25% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we started delivering our new TXi flight decks, including the version for the helicopter market. We also announced the first flight of the Citation XLS with the G5000 integrated avionics fleet. This represents a significant step forward on our path to certification. 
Looking next at the marine segment, revenue increased 9%, driven by our recent acquisition of Navionics. Excluding Navionics, our revenue was essentially flat year-over-year due to unfavorable weather conditions that have delayed the start of the boating season and due to the challenging comparisons in the first quarter of 2017 when our marine segment grew 26%.  Gross margin improved to 59%, while operating margin declined to 12%. During the quarter, we announced the GCV 20, an ultra-high definition sonar offering high-resolution imaging at greater depths. 
Also, we were selected as the exclusive marine electronics supplier to the Independent Boat Builders Cooperative known as IBBI. IBBI is the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperative and is comprised of a 19-member network of leading brands. Beginning in 2019, members of the IBBI will get direct access to our full line of marine electronics. 
Looking finally at the auto segment, revenues were down 12% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in niche product lines. Gross margin was 43%, while operating margin was 2%. During the quarter, we announced the next generation in diesel TND for trucks, which uses dash camera technology to provide enhanced driver alerts. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and make comments on our balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $711 million for the first quarter, representing 11% increase",519,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and make comments on our balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $711 million for the first quarter, representing 11% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60%, 190 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $142 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20%, 100 basis point increase from the prior year. 
Our GAAP pro forma EPS was $0.68. 
Next, look at our first quarter revenue by segment. During the first quarter, we achieved a record first quarter revenue of $711 million. Consolidated revenue grew 11%, driven by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Both the outdoor and fitness segment grew over 20% for the quarter. Combined basis, outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine were up 18% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next, first quarter revenue and operating income charts. Collectively, the outdoor, fitness, aviation, marine segments contributed 80% of total revenue to the first quarter 2018 compared to 75% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 23%, and outdoor grew from 18% to 20%. You can see the chart illustrates the profit mix by segment, and outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments collectively contribute [ 98% ] of operating income in the first quarter 2018 compared with 94% in the first quarter 2017. Outdoor, fitness and aviation segments each had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. The first quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million, 11%. Research and development increased $20 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering and resources and recent acquisitions. 
Advertising expense decreased $7 million year-over-year, representing 3.5% of sales, 150 basis points decrease. The decrease was primarily due to lower media spend and lower-cost expense. 
SG&A was up $50 million compared to prior quarter, increase 60 basis points, percent of sales to 16.5%. Increase are primarily due to personnel-related expenses and current cost associated with recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower litigation-related expenses. 
Few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $410 million following a seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our inventory balance increased on a sequential year-over-year basis to prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. During the first quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $188 million, $93 million increase to the prior quarter due to benefited from working capital improvements. 
Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million. In the first quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 16% compared to a pro forma effective tax rate of 21.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from the U.S. tax reform and the impact of release of reserves. 
This concludes our formal remarks. James, could you please open the line for Q&A."

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded revenue for the first quarter of 2018 with double-digit growth in revenue, profit and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $711 million, up 11% over the prior year. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine collectively increased 18% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. 
Gross margin improved year-over-year to 60% due to segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, while operating income increased 22%. This resulted in GAAP and pro forma EPS of $0.68, with pro forma EPS growth of 31% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings. Since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few remarks on our performance in each business segment. 
Starting with outdoor. Revenue increased 24% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 65% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 27% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Descent dive watch. Descent brings innovation to the dive computer market by combining smartwatch utility with dive computer functions for the underwater adventurer. Descent has been well received, and we are excited for the opportunities we have in this new product category. Also, we recently announced the tactix Charlie, a tactical-themed smartwatch with unique features such as night vision compatibility and Jumpmaster mode for skydivers.
Looking next to fitness. Revenue increased 20%, driven primarily by growth in the advanced wearable category. Gross margin improved to 58% due to product mix. Operating income improved to 20%, resulting in operating income growth of 81%. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Forerunner 645M, our first GPS running watch with integrated music and mobile payments. We recently announced several new cycling products, including the Edge 130 and the Edge 520 Plus. The Edge 130 is an entry-level cycling computer packed with features, and the Edge 520 Plus offers advanced mapping and navigation capabilities. We also announced the Varia RTL510, the latest in our series of products that focus on cycling safety. 
We hosted our second annual Connect IQ Developer Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshop with our product managers and our engineers. The momentum behind Connect IQ is accelerating, with more than 54 million Connect IQ downloads to more than 8 million compatible devices shipped since inception. 
And finally, just yesterday, we announced the collaboration with the University of Kansas Medical Center on multiple research projects exploring the use of wearable technology for the early detection of underreported health conditions such as sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 19%, driven by broad-based strength across the market. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 33%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 25% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we started delivering our new TXi flight decks, including the version for the helicopter market. We also announced the first flight of the Citation XLS with the G5000 integrated avionics fleet. This represents a significant step forward on our path to certification. 
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue increased 9%, driven by our recent acquisition of Navionics. Excluding Navionics, our revenue was essentially flat year-over-year due to unfavorable weather conditions that have delayed the start of the boating season and due to the challenging comparisons in the first quarter of 2017, when our marine segment grew 26%. Gross margin improved to 59%, while operating margin declined to 12%. During the quarter, we announced the GCV 20, an ultra-high definition sonar offering high-resolution imaging at greater depths. 
Also, we were selected as the exclusive marine electronics supplier to the Independent Boat Builders cooperative known as IBBI. IBBI is the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperative and is comprised of a 19-member network of leading brands. Beginning in 2019, members of the IBBI will get direct access to our full line of marine electronics. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 12% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in niche product lines. Gross margin was 43%, while operating margin was 2%. During the quarter, we announced the next-generation dezl PND for trucks, which uses dash camera technology to provide enhanced driver alerts. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $711 million for the first quarter, representing 11% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60%, 190 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $142 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP pro forma EPS was $0.68. 
Next, looking at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $711 million. Consolidated revenue grew 11%, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Both the outdoor and fitness segment grew over 20% for the quarter. Combined basis, outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine were up 18% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next, first quarter revenue and operating income charts. Collectively, the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments contributed 80% of total revenue to first quarter 2018 compared to 75% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 23%, and outdoor grew from 18% to 20%. You can see from the charts illustrated our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments collectively contributed 98% of operating income in the first quarter 2018 compared to 94% first quarter of 2017. Outdoor, fitness and aviation segments each had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million, 11%. Research and development increased $20 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. 
Advertising expense decreased $7 million year-over-year, representing 3.5% of sales, 150 basis point decrease. The decrease was primarily due to lower media spend and lower coop expense. 
SG&A was up $50 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 60 basis points as a percent of sales to 16.5%. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses and current costs associated with recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower litigation-related expenses. 
Few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $410 million following the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our inventory balance increased on a sequential and year-over-year basis to prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. In the first quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $188 million, $93 million increase from the prior quarter and benefited from working capital improvements. 
Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million. In the first quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 16% compared to a pro forma effective tax rate of 21.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from the U.S. tax reform and the impact of release of reserves. 
This concludes our formal remarks. James, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded revenue for the first quarter of 2018 with double-digit growth in revenue, profit and EPS.

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded revenue for the first quarter of 2018 with double-digit growth in revenue, profit and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $711 million, up 11% over the prior year. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine collectively increased 18% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. 
Gross margin improved year-over-year to 60% due to segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, while operating income increased 22%. This resulted in GAAP and pro forma EPS of $0.68, with pro forma EPS growth of 31% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings. Since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few remarks on our performance in each business segment. 
Starting with outdoor. Revenue increased 24% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 65% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 27% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Descent dive watch. Descent brings innovation to the dive computer market by combining smartwatch utility with dive computer functions for the underwater adventurer. Descent has been well received, and we are excited for the opportunities we have in this new product category. Also, we recently announced the tactix Charlie, a tactical-themed smartwatch with unique features such as night vision compatibility and Jumpmaster mode for skydivers.
Looking next to fitness. Revenue increased 20%, driven primarily by growth in the advanced wearable category. Gross margin improved to 58% due to product mix. Operating income improved to 20%, resulting in operating income growth of 81%. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Forerunner 645M, our first GPS running watch with integrated music and mobile payments. We recently announced several new cycling products, including the Edge 130 and the Edge 520 Plus. The Edge 130 is an entry-level cycling computer packed with features, and the Edge 520 Plus offers advanced mapping and navigation capabilities. We also announced the Varia RTL510, the latest in our series of products that focus on cycling safety. 
We hosted our second annual Connect IQ Developer Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshop with our product managers and our engineers. The momentum behind Connect IQ is accelerating, with more than 54 million Connect IQ downloads to more than 8 million compatible devices shipped since inception. 
And finally, just yesterday, we announced the collaboration with the University of Kansas Medical Center on multiple research projects exploring the use of wearable technology for the early detection of underreported health conditions such as sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 19%, driven by broad-based strength across the market. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 33%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 25% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we started delivering our new TXi flight decks, including the version for the helicopter market. We also announced the first flight of the Citation XLS with the G5000 integrated avionics fleet. This represents a significant step forward on our path to certification. 
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue increased 9%, driven by our recent acquisition of Navionics. Excluding Navionics, our revenue was essentially flat year-over-year due to unfavorable weather conditions that have delayed the start of the boating season and due to the challenging comparisons in the first quarter of 2017, when our marine segment grew 26%. Gross margin improved to 59%, while operating margin declined to 12%. During the quarter, we announced the GCV 20, an ultra-high definition sonar offering high-resolution imaging at greater depths. 
Also, we were selected as the exclusive marine electronics supplier to the Independent Boat Builders cooperative known as IBBI. IBBI is the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperative and is comprised of a 19-member network of leading brands. Beginning in 2019, members of the IBBI will get direct access to our full line of marine electronics. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 12% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in niche product lines. Gross margin was 43%, while operating margin was 2%. During the quarter, we announced the next-generation dezl PND for trucks, which uses dash camera technology to provide enhanced driver alerts. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $711 million for the first quarter, representing 11% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60%, 190 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $142 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP pro forma EPS was $0.68. 
Next, looking at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $711 million. Consolidated revenue grew 11%, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Both the outdoor and fitness segment grew over 20% for the quarter. Combined basis, outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine were up 18% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next, first quarter revenue and operating income charts. Collectively, the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments contributed 80% of total revenue to first quarter 2018 compared to 75% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 23%, and outdoor grew from 18% to 20%. You can see from the charts illustrated our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments collectively contributed 98% of operating income in the first quarter 2018 compared to 94% first quarter of 2017. Outdoor, fitness and aviation segments each had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million, 11%. Research and development increased $20 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. 
Advertising expense decreased $7 million year-over-year, representing 3.5% of sales, 150 basis point decrease. The decrease was primarily due to lower media spend and lower coop expense. 
SG&A was up $50 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 60 basis points as a percent of sales to 16.5%. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses and current costs associated with recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower litigation-related expenses. 
Few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $410 million following the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our inventory balance increased on a sequential and year-over-year basis to prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. In the first quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $188 million, $93 million increase from the prior quarter and benefited from working capital improvements. 
Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million. In the first quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 16% compared to a pro forma effective tax rate of 21.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from the U.S. tax reform and the impact of release of reserves. 
This concludes our formal remarks. James, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

In terms of the features we rolled out, we rolled out features around messaging, around music and also mapping. But we also worked with our developers to give them a way to monetize their apps.

Consolidated revenue came in at $711 million, up 11% over the prior year. O",780,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded revenue for the first quarter of 2018 with double-digit growth in revenue, profit and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $711 million, up 11% over the prior year. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine collectively increased 18% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. 
Gross margin improved year-over-year to 60% due to segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, while operating income increased 22%. This resulted in GAAP and pro forma EPS of $0.68, with pro forma EPS growth of 31% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings. Since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few remarks on our performance in each business segment. 
Starting with outdoor. Revenue increased 24% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 65% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 27% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Descent dive watch. Descent brings innovation to the dive computer market by combining smartwatch utility with dive computer functions for the underwater adventurer. Descent has been well received, and we are excited for the opportunities we have in this new product category. Also, we recently announced the tactix Charlie, a tactical-themed smartwatch with unique features such as night vision compatibility and Jumpmaster mode for skydivers.
Looking next to fitness. Revenue increased 20%, driven primarily by growth in the advanced wearable category. Gross margin improved to 58% due to product mix. Operating income improved to 20%, resulting in operating income growth of 81%. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Forerunner 645M, our first GPS running watch with integrated music and mobile payments. We recently announced several new cycling products, including the Edge 130 and the Edge 520 Plus. The Edge 130 is an entry-level cycling computer packed with features, and the Edge 520 Plus offers advanced mapping and navigation capabilities. We also announced the Varia RTL510, the latest in our series of products that focus on cycling safety. 
We hosted our second annual Connect IQ Developer Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshop with our product managers and our engineers. The momentum behind Connect IQ is accelerating, with more than 54 million Connect IQ downloads to more than 8 million compatible devices shipped since inception. 
And finally, just yesterday, we announced the collaboration with the University of Kansas Medical Center on multiple research projects exploring the use of wearable technology for the early detection of underreported health conditions such as sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 19%, driven by broad-based strength across the market. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 33%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 25% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we started delivering our new TXi flight decks, including the version for the helicopter market. We also announced the first flight of the Citation XLS with the G5000 integrated avionics fleet. This represents a significant step forward on our path to certification. 
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue increased 9%, driven by our recent acquisition of Navionics. Excluding Navionics, our revenue was essentially flat year-over-year due to unfavorable weather conditions that have delayed the start of the boating season and due to the challenging comparisons in the first quarter of 2017, when our marine segment grew 26%. Gross margin improved to 59%, while operating margin declined to 12%. During the quarter, we announced the GCV 20, an ultra-high definition sonar offering high-resolution imaging at greater depths. 
Also, we were selected as the exclusive marine electronics supplier to the Independent Boat Builders cooperative known as IBBI. IBBI is the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperative and is comprised of a 19-member network of leading brands. Beginning in 2019, members of the IBBI will get direct access to our full line of marine electronics. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 12% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in niche product lines. Gross margin was 43%, while operating margin was 2%. During the quarter, we announced the next-generation dezl PND for trucks, which uses dash camera technology to provide enhanced driver alerts. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $711 million for the first quarter, representing 11% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60%, 190 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $142 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP pro forma EPS was $0.68. 
Next, looking at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $711 million. Consolidated revenue grew 11%, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Both the outdoor and fitness segment grew over 20% for the quarter. Combined basis, outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine were up 18% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next, first quarter revenue and operating income charts. Collectively, the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments contributed 80% of total revenue to first quarter 2018 compared to 75% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 23%, and outdoor grew from 18% to 20%. You can see from the charts illustrated our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments collectively contributed 98% of operating income in the first quarter 2018 compared to 94% first quarter of 2017. Outdoor, fitness and aviation segments each had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million, 11%. Research and development increased $20 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. 
Advertising expense decreased $7 million year-over-year, representing 3.5% of sales, 150 basis point decrease. The decrease was primarily due to lower media spend and lower coop expense. 
SG&A was up $50 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 60 basis points as a percent of sales to 16.5%. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses and current costs associated with recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower litigation-related expenses. 
Few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $410 million following the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our inventory balance increased on a sequential and year-over-year basis to prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. In the first quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $188 million, $93 million increase from the prior quarter and benefited from working capital improvements. 
Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million. In the first quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 16% compared to a pro forma effective tax rate of 21.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from the U.S. tax reform and the impact of release of reserves. 
This concludes our formal remarks. James, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

For the attendees that we had last year, more than half of them returned to come to the conference again. And so we received a lot of positive remarks about the usefulness of the summit to them and the ability to answer their technical questions and to provide feedback to us on our product road map. So we felt really good about it and something that we believe is helping us gain more momentum. In terms of the features we rolled out, we rolled out features around messaging, around music and also mapping. But we also worked with our developers to give them a way to monetize their apps. So that's something that they will be able to control on their end, and there's not as much infrastructure required on our end, but we do have the hooks in place now for them to be able to do that."

As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded revenue for the first quarter of 2018 with double-digit growth in revenue, profit and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $711 million, up 11% over the prior year. O",780,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin recorded revenue for the first quarter of 2018 with double-digit growth in revenue, profit and EPS. Consolidated revenue came in at $711 million, up 11% over the prior year. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine collectively increased 18% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. 
Gross margin improved year-over-year to 60% due to segment and product mix. Operating margin improved to 20%, while operating income increased 22%. This resulted in GAAP and pro forma EPS of $0.68, with pro forma EPS growth of 31% over the prior year. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, which delivered growth in revenue, profits and earnings. Since Q1 represents the lowest seasonal quarter of our financial year and much of the year remains ahead of us, we are maintaining the guidance issued in February. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'll provide a few remarks on our performance in each business segment. 
Starting with outdoor. Revenue increased 24% on strong demand for outdoor wearables. The segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 65% and 30%, respectively, while operating income grew 27% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Descent dive watch. Descent brings innovation to the dive computer market by combining smartwatch utility with dive computer functions for the underwater adventurer. Descent has been well received, and we are excited for the opportunities we have in this new product category. Also, we recently announced the tactix Charlie, a tactical-themed smartwatch with unique features such as night vision compatibility and Jumpmaster mode for skydivers.
Looking next to fitness. Revenue increased 20%, driven primarily by growth in the advanced wearable category. Gross margin improved to 58% due to product mix. Operating income improved to 20%, resulting in operating income growth of 81%. 
During the quarter, we began shipping the Forerunner 645M, our first GPS running watch with integrated music and mobile payments. We recently announced several new cycling products, including the Edge 130 and the Edge 520 Plus. The Edge 130 is an entry-level cycling computer packed with features, and the Edge 520 Plus offers advanced mapping and navigation capabilities. We also announced the Varia RTL510, the latest in our series of products that focus on cycling safety. 
We hosted our second annual Connect IQ Developer Summit, bringing together application developers and business partners to participate in hands-on workshop with our product managers and our engineers. The momentum behind Connect IQ is accelerating, with more than 54 million Connect IQ downloads to more than 8 million compatible devices shipped since inception. 
And finally, just yesterday, we announced the collaboration with the University of Kansas Medical Center on multiple research projects exploring the use of wearable technology for the early detection of underreported health conditions such as sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 19%, driven by broad-based strength across the market. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 33%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 25% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we started delivering our new TXi flight decks, including the version for the helicopter market. We also announced the first flight of the Citation XLS with the G5000 integrated avionics fleet. This represents a significant step forward on our path to certification. 
Looking next at the marine segment. Revenue increased 9%, driven by our recent acquisition of Navionics. Excluding Navionics, our revenue was essentially flat year-over-year due to unfavorable weather conditions that have delayed the start of the boating season and due to the challenging comparisons in the first quarter of 2017, when our marine segment grew 26%. Gross margin improved to 59%, while operating margin declined to 12%. During the quarter, we announced the GCV 20, an ultra-high definition sonar offering high-resolution imaging at greater depths. 
Also, we were selected as the exclusive marine electronics supplier to the Independent Boat Builders cooperative known as IBBI. IBBI is the boating industry's largest purchasing cooperative and is comprised of a 19-member network of leading brands. Beginning in 2019, members of the IBBI will get direct access to our full line of marine electronics. 
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 12% for the quarter due to the ongoing decline of the PND market, partially offset by growth in niche product lines. Gross margin was 43%, while operating margin was 2%. During the quarter, we announced the next-generation dezl PND for trucks, which uses dash camera technology to provide enhanced driver alerts. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $711 million for the first quarter, representing 11% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 60%, 190 basis point increase from the prior year, driven by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 40%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $142 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 20%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP pro forma EPS was $0.68. 
Next, looking at our first quarter revenue by segment. In the first quarter, we achieved record first quarter revenue of $711 million. Consolidated revenue grew 11%, led by double-digit growth in 3 of our 5 segments. Both the outdoor and fitness segment grew over 20% for the quarter. Combined basis, outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine were up 18% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next, first quarter revenue and operating income charts. Collectively, the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments contributed 80% of total revenue to first quarter 2018 compared to 75% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 23%, and outdoor grew from 18% to 20%. You can see from the charts illustrated our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments collectively contributed 98% of operating income in the first quarter 2018 compared to 94% first quarter of 2017. Outdoor, fitness and aviation segments each had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses increased by $29 million, 11%. Research and development increased $20 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. 
Advertising expense decreased $7 million year-over-year, representing 3.5% of sales, 150 basis point decrease. The decrease was primarily due to lower media spend and lower coop expense. 
SG&A was up $50 million compared to prior year quarter, increased 60 basis points as a percent of sales to 16.5%. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses and current costs associated with recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower litigation-related expenses. 
Few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially to $410 million following the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our inventory balance increased on a sequential and year-over-year basis to prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. In the first quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $188 million, $93 million increase from the prior quarter and benefited from working capital improvements. 
Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $96 million. In the first quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 16% compared to a pro forma effective tax rate of 21.2% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from the U.S. tax reform and the impact of release of reserves. 
This concludes our formal remarks. James, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter consolidated revenue of $894 million, up 8% over the prior year. 
Fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor collectively increased 17% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to segment mix. Operating income improved to $218 million, up 4% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1 and pro forma EPS of $0.99 in the quarter. 
We are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the fitness segment. Revenue increased 24%, driven by growth in advance wearables and in cycling. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 23% respectively, and operating income grew 40% over the prior year. 
During the second quarter, we've launched the vívoactive 3 music, expanding our music offerings into the advanced wellness category. We also launched new edge cycling computers and the next-generation Varia radars targeting the cycling safety market. 
The basic activity tracker category continued to decline during the first half of 2018. However, the impact on our fitness segment was more than offset by growth in other categories. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned in the segment with a strong lineup of wearables and cycling products.
Looking next at the marine. Revenue increased 24% as weather conditions improved and boats were brought out of storage for the season. Approximately half of the growth came from our recent acquisition of Navionics, while the other half was organic across multiple product categories. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 21% respectively, and operating income grew 14% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we introduced Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates realtime images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as disruptive new technology. At the recent iCast work fishing tradeshow, LiveScope won the award for best new electronics and received the prestigious award for best of show. We believe LiveScope is a game-changer for the fishing market. 
Also during the quarter, we announced Sportsman's Boats selected Garmin as their exclusive marine electronic supplier beginning with your 2019 model year boats. Sportsman is one of the fastest-growing boat companies in the U.S. market and it's an honor to be selected as their exclusive electronics provider. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovation and gaining share in the inland fishing category.
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 23%, driven by growth in both OEM and retrofit product categories. We experienced particularly strong growth in our ADS-B offerings and from recently introduced products, such as the G5 indicator system, TXi displays and GFC autopilots. Gross and operating margins remain strong at 74% and 34% respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 34% over the prior year. We were recently selected by Tactical Air Support to provide an integrated flight deck to their fleet of supersonic F5 fighter aircraft. We also introduced the G30000H integrated flight deck for the Part 27 turbine helicopter market. 
As I mentioned earlier, ADS-B has been a significant driver of growth in our aviation business. With just under 18 months to go before the December 31, 2019, deadline, we wanted to provide an update on the market development and how we see things playing out as the deadline approaches. According to the FAA, as of July 1, 2018, approximately 59,000 aircraft have been equipped. The FFA has estimated that approximately 100,000 to 160,000 aircraft will eventually be equipped with ADS-B. Based on the more conservative estimate, the market is just past of the halfway point in the ADS-B cycle. 
There are a few key observations that we would like to share. First, significant opportunity remains in the ADS-B cycle. According to FAA estimates, anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 aircraft remain to be equipped. Interest in ADS-B is increasing, and many customers are using the opportunity to refresh their panels with additional equipment. This enhances the growth opportunity for Garmin. 
Second, shop capacity appears to be a limiting factor in ADS-B adoption. With a modest increase in shop capacity, it is possible to reach the low end of the FAA estimate by the December 31, 2019, deadline. If shop capacity does not increase or if the final cribbage level increases above the more conservative estimate, the opportunity would continue past the deadline. 
Finally, ADS-B is a significant opportunity that is only one of many that we are pursuing. To prepare for the future beyond the ADS-B cycle, we are investing in long-term opportunities such as gaining share in the OEM market, establishing a position in government and defense markets and developing new product categories.  In summary, we are pleased with the performance of our aviation business, and we are optimistic about its future.
Turning next to outdoor. Revenue increased 4% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth across all product categories. While this growth rate is below recent trend, we feel this is a remarkable accomplishment considering the strong growth we experienced in Q2 of 2017, driven by the initial channel fill of the fenix 5 series. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 36% respectively. 
Late in the quarter, we launched the fenix 5 Plus series, adding music, color mass and mobile payments to all 3 watch sizes. In addition, we expanded our sensor technology with the addition of Pulse Ox to the fenix 5x plus, providing blood oxygen saturation awareness for athletes and outdoor enthusiasts. We also launch the inReach mini, a compact versatile satellite communicator that can be used with other Garmin products paired with a smartphone or used as a stand-alone device. Looking forward, we're focused on opportunities in wearables and other product categories within the outdoor market.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues decreased 19% due to the ongoing decline in the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 42% and 7% respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring the desired level of innovations in the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first half of 2018. In light of the strong performance, we are raising our projected revenue to $3.3 billion for the year, up about 6% over 2017. Gross margin is projected to be 58.5% for the year, which is unchanged from the previous estimate. Operating margin is projected to be 21.5%, which is a slight improvement over our previous guidance. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 17.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.30.
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment. We have increased our growth expectations for the fitness segment to 10% and the aviation segment to 18%. Outdoor and auto are unchanged. While the outlook for marine has been revised down slightly to 15%. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and make a comment on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and make a comment on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $894 million for the second quarter, representing an 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, 30 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.2%, 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $218 million, a 4% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.3%, 90 basis point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1, and pro forma EPS was $0.99, a 9% increase from the prior year.
Next, I'd like to look at second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth, led by robust double-digit growth in our fitness, marine and aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by a decline in auto segment, which resulted in a continued decline in the auto PND business. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor were up 17% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments contributed 80% of total revenue to second quarter 2018 compared to 73% from the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 25%. Aviation grew from 15% to 17%, and marine grew from 13% to 15%. As you can see from the charts that illustrate our profit mix by segment, on a combined business, the fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments delivered 94% of operating income in the second quarter 2018 compared to 84% in the second quarter 2017. The fitness and aviation segments had a year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $31 million or 11%. Research and development increased $15 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Advertising expense was up $2 million for the prior year quarter but relatively flat as a percent of sales. H&A was up $16 million compared to prior quarter, relatively flat as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $533 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially in year-over-year to $501 million as we exited the seasonally strong second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, we generated free cash flow of $157 million, a $28 million increase from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $100 million.
During the second quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 19.4% compared to pro forma effective tax rate of 21.4% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to the benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Julie, could you please open the line for Q&A."

So the question is,  would you still see healthy growth in '19 versus '18? And then if we were to drop off there would be complete at January 1, 2020, with that be enough of a drop off to potentially drive Garmin aviation down in 2020? Just a little more help taken in the model would be great."

So if we just speak generally about that, I would say that with some additional shop capacity, of course that would drive additional sales in the category. As I mentioned in my remarks, there is a follow-through trend with customers adding additional equipment to their aircraft. When they're bringing the an aircraft in for work, a lot of times it make sense to add other things that they want to have in the aircraft. So we're seeing compounding effect from that, and we would expect that to continue as the mandate approaches. In terms of specific numbers around aviation for '19 and '20, we can't really provide specific color around that.  as I said in my remarks, we're working on more than one opportunity, so we believe that we have growth paths beyond the ADS-B cycle. And given what we see playing out with ADS-B, we do anticipate more of a soft landing than a hard cliff of revenues in terms of that category."

So in Asia, there are some larger countries that are driving some growth there, particularly China and Japan have been superstars in terms of the overall APAC market. But there are other markets as well that are doing very well. In terms of the aerodynamic, think our year-to-date performance there can be completely attributed to the fenix effect from last year. They were superstrong in their launch of fenix from last year, and they had almost really the whole quarter of Q2 to be able to launch fenix 5. This year, we announced the fenix 5 with less than 2 weeks to go in the quarters, so consequently, they had very little opportunity in terms of their channel fill compared to the markets. So I think the dynamics there can be completely attributed to fenix."

Music, payments and mask are certainly adding to that, so we see those as all positive points for the customer. In terms of ships and the competitive landscape, I would say in terms of TomTom's exit, there's probably some effect depending on the country that you talked about. Some countries still report that there's strong inventory of competitive products in the market, and so those areas probably haven't change as much as well as others.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter consolidated revenue of $894 million, up 8% over the prior year. 
Fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor collectively increased 17% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to segment mix. Operating income improved to $218 million, up 4% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1 and pro forma EPS of $0.99 in the quarter. 
We are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the fitness segment. Revenue increased 24%, driven by growth in advance wearables and in cycling. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 23%, respectively, and operating income grew 40% over the prior year. 
During the second quarter, we launched the vívoactive 3 music, expanding our music offerings into the advanced wellness category. We also launched new Edge cycling computers and the next-generation Varia radars, targeting the cycling safety market. 
The basic activity tracker category continued to decline during the first half of 2018. However, the impact on our fitness segment was more than offset by growth in other categories. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned in the segment with a strong lineup of wearables and cycling products.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 24% as weather conditions improved and boats were brought out of storage for the season. Approximately half of the growth came from our recent acquisition of Navionics, while the other half was organic across multiple product categories. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 21%, respectively, and operating income grew 14% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we introduced Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates real-time images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as a disruptive new technology. At the recent ICAST sportfishing trade show, LiveScope won the award for best new electronics and received the prestigious award for best of show. We believe LiveScope is a game-changer for the fishing market. 
Also during the quarter, we announced Sportsman Boats selected Garmin as their exclusive marine electronic supplier beginning with their 2019 model year boats. Sportsman is one of the fastest-growing boat companies in the U.S. market, and it's an honor to be selected as their exclusive electronics provider. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovation and gaining share in the inland fishing category.
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 23%, driven by growth in both OEM and retrofit product categories. We experienced particularly strong growth in our ADS-B offerings and from recently introduced products such as the G5 indicator system, TXi displays and GFC autopilots. 
Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 34%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 34% over the prior year. We were recently selected by Tactical Air Support to provide an integrated flight deck to their fleet of supersonic F-5 fighter aircraft. We also introduced the G30000H integrated flight deck for the Part 27 turbine helicopter market. 
As I mentioned earlier, ADS-B has been a significant driver of growth in our aviation business. With just under 18 months to go before the December 31, 2019, deadline, we wanted to provide an update on the market development and how we see things playing out as the deadline approaches. According to the FAA, as of July 1, 2018, approximately 59,000 aircraft have been equipped. The FAA has estimated that approximately 100,000 to 160,000 aircraft will eventually be equipped with ADS-B. Based on the more conservative estimate, the market is just past the halfway point in the ADS-B cycle. 
There are a few key observations that we would like to share. First, significant opportunity remains in the ADS-B cycle. According to FAA estimates, anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 aircraft remain to be equipped. Interest in ADS-B is increasing, and many customers are using the opportunity to refresh their panels with additional equipment. This enhances the growth opportunity for Garmin. 
Second, shock capacity appears to be a limiting factor in ADS-B adoption. With a modest increase in shock capacity, it is possible to reach the low end of the FAA estimates by the December 31, 2019, deadline. If shock capacity does not increase or if the final equipage level increases above the more conservative estimate, the opportunity would continue past the deadline. 
Finally, ADS-B is a significant opportunity that it is only one of many that we are pursuing. To prepare for the future beyond the ADS-B cycle, we are investing in long-term opportunities such as gaining share in the OEM market, establishing a position in government and defense markets and developing new product categories. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of our aviation business, and we are optimistic about its future. 
Turning next to outdoor. Revenue increased 4% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth across all product categories. While this growth rate is below recent trends, we feel it is a remarkable accomplishment considering the strong growth we experienced in Q2 of 2017, driven by the initial channel fill of the fenix 5 series. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 36%, respectively. 
Late in the quarter, we launched the fenix 5 Plus series, adding music, color maps and mobile payments to all 3 watch sizes. In addition, we expanded our sensor technology with the addition of Pulse Ox to the fenix 5X Plus, providing blood oxygen saturation awareness for athletes and outdoor enthusiasts. We also launched the inReach Mini, a compact, versatile satellite communicator that can be used with other Garmin products paired with a smartphone or used as a stand-alone device. Looking forward, we are focused on opportunities in wearables and other product categories within the outdoor market.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues decreased 19% due to the ongoing decline in the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 42% and 7%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring the desired level of innovations in the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first half of 2018. In light of the strong performance, we are raising our projected revenue to $3.3 billion for the year, up about 6% over 2017. Gross margin is projected to be 58.5% for the year, which is unchanged from the previous estimate. Operating margin is projected to be 21.5%, which is a slight improvement over our previous guidance. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 17.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.30.
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment. We have increased our growth expectations for the fitness segment to 10% and the aviation segment to 18%. Outdoor and auto are unchanged, while the outlook for marine has been revised down slightly to 15%. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,572728963,1516715,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2018",2018-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $894 million for the second quarter, representing an 8",538,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $894 million for the second quarter, representing an 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 30 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.2%, 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $218 million, a 4% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.3%, a 90 basis point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1, and pro forma EPS was $0.99, a 9% increase from the prior year.
Next, I'd like to look at our second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by robust double-digit growth in our fitness, marine and aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by a decline in our auto segment, which is a result of the continued decline in the auto PND business. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor were up 17% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments contributed 80% of total revenue to second quarter of 2018 compared to 73% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 25%. Aviation grew from 15% to 17%. Marine grew from 13% to 15%. 
As you can see from the charts that illustrate our profit mix by segment, on a combined basis, the fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments delivered 94% of operating income in the second quarter 2018 compared to 84% second quarter 2017. The fitness and aviation segments had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $31 million or 11%. Research and development increased $15 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Advertising expense was up $2 million for the prior year quarter and was relatively flat as a percent of sales. SG&A was up $16 million compared to prior year quarter, relatively flat as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $533 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially in year-over-year to $501 million as we exited the seasonally strong second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, we generated free cash flow of $157 million, a $28 million increase from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $100 million.
During the second quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 19.4% compared to pro forma effective tax rate of 21.4% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Julie, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

So the question is, would you still see healthy growth in '19 versus '18? And then if it were to drop off there and be ""complete"" at January 1, 2020, would that be enough of a drop-off to potentially drive Garmin aviation down in 2020?

So if we just speak generally about that, I would say that with some additional shock capacity, of course, that would drive additional sales in that category. As I mentioned in my remarks, there is a follow-through trend with customers adding additional equipment to their aircraft. When they're bringing the aircraft in for work, a lot of times, it makes sense to add other things that they want to have in the aircraft. So we're seeing a compounding effect from that, and we would expect that to continue as the mandate approaches. In terms of specific numbers around aviation for '19 and '20, we can't really provide specific color on that. As I said in my remarks, we're working on more than one opportunity. So we believe that we have growth paths beyond the ADS-B cycle. And given what we see playing out with ADS-B, we do anticipate more of a soft landing than a hard cliff of revenues in terms of that category."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter consolidated revenue of $894 million, up 8% over the prior year. 
Fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor collectively increased 17% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to segment mix. Operating income improved to $218 million, up 4% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1 and pro forma EPS of $0.99 in the quarter. 
We are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the fitness segment. Revenue increased 24%, driven by growth in advance wearables and in cycling. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 23%, respectively, and operating income grew 40% over the prior year. 
During the second quarter, we launched the vívoactive 3 music, expanding our music offerings into the advanced wellness category. We also launched new Edge cycling computers and the next-generation Varia radars, targeting the cycling safety market. 
The basic activity tracker category continued to decline during the first half of 2018. However, the impact on our fitness segment was more than offset by growth in other categories. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned in the segment with a strong lineup of wearables and cycling products.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 24% as weather conditions improved and boats were brought out of storage for the season. Approximately half of the growth came from our recent acquisition of Navionics, while the other half was organic across multiple product categories. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 21%, respectively, and operating income grew 14% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we introduced Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates real-time images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as disruptive new technology. At the recent ICAST sportfishing trade show, LiveScope won the award for best new electronics and received the prestigious award for best of show. We believe LiveScope is a game-changer for the fishing market. 
Also during the quarter, we announced Sportsman Boats selected Garmin as their exclusive marine electronic supplier beginning with their 2019 model year boats. Sportsman is one of the fastest-growing boat companies in the U.S. market, and it's an honor to be selected as their exclusive electronics provider. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovation and gaining share in the inland fishing category.
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 23%, driven by growth in both OEM and retrofit product categories. We experienced particularly strong growth in our ADS-B offerings and from recently introduced products such as the G5 indicator system, TXi displays and GFC autopilots. 
Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 34%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 34% over the prior year. We were recently selected by Tactical Air Support to provide an integrated flight deck to their fleet of supersonic F-5 fighter aircraft. We also introduced the G30000H integrated flight deck for the Part 27 turbine helicopter market. 
As I mentioned earlier, ADS-B has been a significant driver of growth in our aviation business. With just under 18 months to go before the December 31, 2019, deadline, we wanted to provide an update on the market development and how we see things playing out as the deadline approaches. According to the FAA, as of July 1, 2018, approximately 59,000 aircraft have been equipped. The FAA has estimated that approximately 100,000 to 160,000 aircraft will eventually be equipped with ADS-B. Based on the more conservative estimate, the market is just past the halfway point in the ADS-B cycle. 
There are a few key observations that we would like to share. First, significant opportunity remains in the ADS-B cycle. According to FAA estimates, anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 aircraft remain to be equipped. Interest in ADS-B is increasing, and many customers are using the opportunity to refresh their panels with additional equipment. This enhances the growth opportunity for Garmin. 
Second, shock capacity appears to be a limiting factor in ADS-B adoption. With a modest increase in shock capacity, it is possible to reach the low end of the FAA estimates by the December 31, 2019, deadline. If shock capacity does not increase or if the final equipage level increases above the more conservative estimate, the opportunity would continue past the deadline. 
Finally, ADS-B is a significant opportunity but it is only one of many that we are pursuing. To prepare for the future beyond the ADS-B cycle, we are investing in long-term opportunities such as gaining share in the OEM market, establishing a position in government and defense markets and developing new product categories. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of our aviation business, and we are optimistic about its future. 
Turning next to outdoor. Revenue increased 4% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth across all product categories. While this growth rate is below recent trends, we feel it is a remarkable accomplishment considering the strong growth we experienced in Q2 of 2017, driven by the initial channel fill of the fenix 5 series. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 36%, respectively. 
Late in the quarter, we launched the fenix 5 Plus series, adding music, color maps and mobile payments to all 3 watch sizes. In addition, we expanded our sensor technology with the addition of Pulse Ox to the fenix 5X Plus, providing blood oxygen saturation awareness for athletes and outdoor enthusiasts. We also launched the inReach Mini, a compact, versatile satellite communicator that can be used with other Garmin products paired with a smartphone or used as a stand-alone device. Looking forward, we are focused on opportunities in wearables and other product categories within the outdoor market.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues decreased 19% due to the ongoing decline in the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 42% and 7%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring the desired level of innovations to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first half of 2018. In light of the strong performance, we are raising our projected revenue to $3.3 billion for the year, up about 6% over 2017. Gross margin is projected to be 58.5% for the year, which is unchanged from the previous estimate. Operating margin is projected to be 21.5%, which is a slight improvement over our previous guidance. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 17.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.30.
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment. We have increased our growth expectations for the fitness segment to 10% and the aviation segment to 18%. Outdoor and auto are unchanged, while the outlook for marine has been revised down slightly to 15%. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,572728963,1525627,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2018",2018-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $894 million for the second quarter, representing an 8",535,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $894 million for the second quarter, representing an 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 30 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.2%, 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $218 million, a 4% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.3%, a 90 basis point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1, and pro forma EPS was $0.99, a 9% increase from the prior year.
Next, I'd like to look at our second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by robust double-digit growth in our fitness, marine and aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by a decline in our auto segment, which  resulted in continued decline in the auto PND business. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor were up 17% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments contributed 80% of total revenue to second quarter of 2018 compared to 73% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 25%. Aviation grew from 15% to 17%. Marine grew from 13% to 15%. 
As you can see from the charts that illustrate our profit mix by segment, on a combined basis, the fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments delivered 94% of operating income in the second quarter 2018 compared to 84% second quarter 2017. The fitness and aviation segments had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $31 million or 11%. Research and development increased $15 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Advertising expense was up $2 million for the prior year quarter and was relatively flat as a percent of sales. SG&A was up $16 million compared to prior year quarter, relatively flat as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $533 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially in year-over-year to $501 million as we exited the seasonally strong second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, we generated free cash flow of $157 million, a $28 million increase from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $100 million.
During the second quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 19.4% compared to pro forma effective tax rate of 21.4% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Julie, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

Can you just take it a step further and help us understand how this may play out in your reported results in '19 and '20? Let's say, the FFA's conservative scenario plays out, so the 100,000 in total sales, and you do get that modest increase in shock capacity to, let's say, allow the industry to meet 100,000 by the end of 2019. So the question is, would you still see healthy growth in '19 versus '18? And then if it were to drop off there and be ""complete"" at January 1, 2020, would that be enough of a drop-off to potentially drive Garmin aviation down in 2020?

So if we just speak generally about that, I would say that with some additional shock capacity, of course, that would drive additional sales in that category. As I mentioned in my remarks, there is a follow-through trend with customers adding additional equipment to their aircraft. When they're bringing the aircraft in for work, a lot of times, it makes sense to add other things that they want to have in the aircraft. So we're seeing a compounding effect from that, and we would expect that to continue as the mandate approaches. In terms of specific numbers around aviation for '19 and '20, we can't really provide specific color on that. As I said in my remarks, we're working on more than one opportunity. So we believe that we have growth paths beyond the ADS-B cycle. And given what we see playing out with ADS-B, we do anticipate more of a soft landing than a hard cliff of revenues in terms of that category."

They were superstrong in their launch of fenix from last year, and they had almost really the whole quarter of Q2 to be able to launch fenix 5.

Music, payments and maps are certainly adding to that, so we see those as all positive points for the customer. In terms of shifts in the competitive landscape, I would say in terms of TomTom's exit, there's probably some effect depending on the country that you talked about.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported strong second quarter consolidated revenue of $894 million, up 8% over the prior year. 
Fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor collectively increased 17% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 58.5% compared to the prior year due to segment mix. Operating income improved to $218 million, up 4% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $1 and pro forma EPS of $0.99 in the quarter. 
We are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the fitness segment. Revenue increased 24%, driven by growth in advance wearables and in cycling. Gross and operating margins were 56% and 23%, respectively, and operating income grew 40% over the prior year. 
During the second quarter, we launched the vívoactive 3 music, expanding our music offerings into the advanced wellness category. We also launched new Edge cycling computers and the next-generation Varia radars, targeting the cycling safety market. 
The basic activity tracker category continued to decline during the first half of 2018. However, the impact on our fitness segment was more than offset by growth in other categories. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned in the segment with a strong lineup of wearables and cycling products.
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 24% as weather conditions improved and boats were brought out of storage for the season. Approximately half of the growth came from our recent acquisition of Navionics, while the other half was organic across multiple product categories. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 21%, respectively, and operating income grew 14% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we introduced Panoptix LiveScope, a sonar system that generates real-time images underwater. LiveScope was quickly recognized by the marine industry as disruptive new technology. At the recent ICAST sportfishing trade show, LiveScope won the award for best new electronics and received the prestigious award for best of show. We believe LiveScope is a game-changer for the fishing market. 
Also during the quarter, we announced Sportsman Boats selected Garmin as their exclusive marine electronic supplier beginning with their 2019 model year boats. Sportsman is one of the fastest-growing boat companies in the U.S. market, and it's an honor to be selected as their exclusive electronics provider. Looking forward, we are focused on product innovation and gaining share in the inland fishing category.
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 23%, driven by growth in both OEM and retrofit product categories. We experienced particularly strong growth in our ADS-B offerings and from recently introduced products such as the G5 indicator system, TXi displays and GFC autopilots. 
Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 34%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 34% over the prior year. We were recently selected by Tactical Air Support to provide an integrated flight deck to their fleet of supersonic F-5 fighter aircraft. We also introduced the G30000H integrated flight deck for the Part 27 turbine helicopter market. 
As I mentioned earlier, ADS-B has been a significant driver of growth in our aviation business. With just under 18 months to go before the December 31, 2019, deadline, we wanted to provide an update on the market development and how we see things playing out as the deadline approaches. According to the FAA, as of July 1, 2018, approximately 59,000 aircraft have been equipped. The FAA has estimated that approximately 100,000 to 160,000 aircraft will eventually be equipped with ADS-B. Based on the more conservative estimate, the market is just past the halfway point in the ADS-B cycle. 
There are a few key observations that we would like to share. First, significant opportunity remains in the ADS-B cycle. According to FAA estimates, anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 aircraft remain to be equipped. Interest in ADS-B is increasing, and many customers are using the opportunity to refresh their panels with additional equipment. This enhances the growth opportunity for Garmin. 
Second, shock capacity appears to be a limiting factor in ADS-B adoption. With a modest increase in shock capacity, it is possible to reach the low end of the FAA estimates by the December 31, 2019, deadline. If shock capacity does not increase or if the final equipage level increases above the more conservative estimate, the opportunity would continue past the deadline. 
Finally, ADS-B is a significant opportunity but it is only one of many that we are pursuing. To prepare for the future beyond the ADS-B cycle, we are investing in long-term opportunities such as gaining share in the OEM market, establishing a position in government and defense markets and developing new product categories. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of our aviation business, and we are optimistic about its future. 
Turning next to outdoor. Revenue increased 4% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth across all product categories. While this growth rate is below recent trends, we feel it is a remarkable accomplishment considering the strong growth we experienced in Q2 of 2017, driven by the initial channel fill of the fenix 5 series. Gross and operating margins were 64% and 36%, respectively. 
Late in the quarter, we launched the fenix 5 Plus series, adding music, color maps and mobile payments to all 3 watch sizes. In addition, we expanded our sensor technology with the addition of Pulse Ox to the fenix 5X Plus, providing blood oxygen saturation awareness for athletes and outdoor enthusiasts. We also launched the inReach Mini, a compact, versatile satellite communicator that can be used with other Garmin products paired with a smartphone or used as a stand-alone device. Looking forward, we are focused on opportunities in wearables and other product categories within the outdoor market.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues decreased 19% due to the ongoing decline in the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 42% and 7%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. Looking forward, we are focused on disciplined execution to bring the desired level of innovations to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment.
In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first half of 2018. In light of the strong performance, we are raising our projected revenue to $3.3 billion for the year, up about 6% over 2017. Gross margin is projected to be 58.5% for the year, which is unchanged from the previous estimate. Operating margin is projected to be 21.5%, which is a slight improvement over our previous guidance. Assuming a pro forma effective tax rate of approximately 17.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $3.30.
Looking at our annual revenue outlook by segment. We have increased our growth expectations for the fitness segment to 10% and the aviation segment to 18%. Outdoor and auto are unchanged, while the outlook for marine has been revised down slightly to 15%. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $894 million for the second quarter, representing an 8",535,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $894 million for the second quarter, representing an 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 30 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 34.2%, 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating income was $218 million, a 4% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.3%, a 90 basis point decrease from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $1, and pro forma EPS was $0.99, a 9% increase from the prior year.
Next, I'd like to look at our second quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by robust double-digit growth in our fitness, marine and aviation segments. This growth was partially offset by a decline in our auto segment, which  resulted in continued decline in the auto PND business. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor were up 17% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments contributed 80% of total revenue to second quarter of 2018 compared to 73% in the prior year quarter. Fitness grew from 22% to 25%. Aviation grew from 15% to 17%. Marine grew from 13% to 15%. 
As you can see from the charts that illustrate our profit mix by segment, on a combined basis, the fitness, marine, aviation and outdoor segments delivered 94% of operating income in the second quarter 2018 compared to 84% second quarter 2017. The fitness and aviation segments had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses increased by $31 million or 11%. Research and development increased $15 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Advertising expense was up $2 million for the prior year quarter and was relatively flat as a percent of sales. SG&A was up $16 million compared to prior year quarter, relatively flat as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially and year-over-year to $533 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially in year-over-year to $501 million as we exited the seasonally strong second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, we generated free cash flow of $157 million, a $28 million increase from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $100 million.
During the second quarter 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 19.4% compared to pro forma effective tax rate of 21.4% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits from U.S. tax reform. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Julie, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

So the question is, would you still see healthy growth in '19 versus '18?

So if we just speak generally about that, I would say that with some additional shock capacity, of course, that would drive additional sales in that category. As I mentioned in my remarks, there is a follow-through trend with customers adding additional equipment to their aircraft. When they're bringing the aircraft in for work, a lot of times, it makes sense to add other things that they want to have in the aircraft. So we're seeing a compounding effect from that, and we would expect that to continue as the mandate approaches. In terms of specific numbers around aviation for '19 and '20, we can't really provide specific color on that. As I said in my remarks, we're working on more than one opportunity. So we believe that we have growth paths beyond the ADS-B cycle. And given what we see playing out with ADS-B, we do anticipate more of a soft landing than a hard cliff of revenues in terms of that category."

It seems like smart features are a table stakes, if you will. Customers like the sensor technology and especially the additional features that we bring to the table such as stress monitoring and sleep tracking. And then just in general, I think our products are very strong around the GPS side and the position location focus of our watches, which make them very strong in the active lifestyles. Music, payments and maps are certainly adding to that, so we see those as all positive points for the customer. In terms of shifts in the competitive landscape, I would say in terms of TomTom's exit, there's probably some effect depending on the country that you talked about. Some countries still report that there's strong inventory of competitive products in the market, and so those areas probably haven't changed as much as well as others. The channel is pretty much flushed through, and so that does lead to increased opportunities for our profits."

I'd like to begin by mentioning a couple of important milestones we recently celebrated. During the third quarter, we shipped our 200 millionth product, which is a testament to our ability to design, manufacture and sell unique applications and technology for active lifestyles. 
Equally as exciting, we started production in our new aviation manufacturing facility located in Olathe, Kansas. This new facility more than doubles our production capacity, allowing us to serve our growing aviation business for many years to come. 
Moving now to the quarterly results. Earlier today, Garmin reported strong third quarter consolidated revenue of $810 million, up 8% over the prior year. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 16% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. 
Gross margin improved to 59.4% compared to the prior year. Operating income improved to $196 million, up 13% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.97 and pro forma EPS of $1 in the quarter. 
We are pleased with our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance. Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the marine segment, revenue increased 28% as we saw strong sales continue well into the summer building season. Approximately half of the growth was organic while the other half came from acquisitions. 
Gross and operating margins were 59% and 14%, respectively. We recently announced our GPSMAP 8600 series of chartplotters. This is the first product line to use our new G3 maps, which combined the best of Garmin and Navionics content. We've been very intentional about investing in our marine segment, and the industry is taking notice. 
For the fourth consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year, and Panoptix LiveScope won their prestigious technology award. We are also recognized as one of the Top 10 Most Innovative Marine Companies in 2018 by Sounding Straight Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational building industry. It's an honor to be recognized by the marine industry, and we will continue to invest in the segment to maximize its potential.
Turning next to aviation, revenue increased 17% driven by broad-based growth within the segment. Gross and operating margins increased to 76% and 35%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 49% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of FltPlan.com and have begun integrating these new services into Garmin's existing apps. Also, we recently announced that our ADS-B solution was selected by Gulfstream for the G280 aircraft. 
Finally, we announced the teaming agreement with Bell to supply avionics for on-demand mobility vehicles. While this project is in its early stages, it's an important first step towards creating a viable urban air transport system.
Turning next to the fitness segment, revenue increased 14%, primarily driven by growth of our wearable products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively, and operating income grew 12% over the prior year. 
During the third quarter, we launched the vívosmart 4, a slim, smart activity tracker that concludes a Pulse Ox sensor. In addition to providing blood oxygen saturation levels, this device also provides users with advanced leak monitoring and a new Body Battery feature that helps individuals understand and manage their energy levels throughout the day. We also added Disney Princess and Marvel's Spider-Man bands to our popular vívofit jr. product line along with new mobile app adventures.
Turning next to the outdoor segment, revenue increased 13% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by growth in wearables. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 65% and 38%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 16%. 
We recently announced the integration of Spotify with fenix 5 Plus series, and just this morning, the Forerunner 645 Music was added to the list as Spotify compatible wearables. This gives our customers the ability to download Spotify playlist to the watch via the Spotify app, which is available from the Connect IQ store. The app is already proving to be very popular with our customers. During its first full day of availability, Spotify set a record for the most downloads of a new app from our Connect IQ store. 
Finally, we recently announced Instinct, a rugged and reliable GPS smartwatch designed to expand the market for outdoor wearables.
Looking finally at the auto segment, revenue decreased 16% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 43% and 9%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. We recently announced that we've been selected by the Chinese auto group, Geely, to provide camera and driving recorded systems beginning in model year 2020. This award demonstrates the progress we are making as a Tier 1 auto supplier. 
In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first 3 quarters of 2018. In light of the strong third quarter results, we are making some adjustments to our guidance. We anticipate our fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis with full year revenue of approximately $3.3 billion and a gross margin of 58.5%. We are raising our full year operating margin to approximately 22% and lowering our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.45.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,584399172,1585054,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2018 Earnings Call, Oct 31, 2018",2018-10-31,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone.

I'd like to begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $810 million for the third quarter, representing 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.4%, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.2%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $196 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.2%, 110 basis points increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.97. Pro forma EPS was $1, 30% increase from the prior year.
Next, look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. This growth was partially offset by decline in our auto segment, which resulted in continued decline in auto PND business. Combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 16% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 80% to total revenue in the third quarter 2018 compared to 74% in the prior year quarter. Auto declined from 26% to 20% while every other segment grew. Marine grew from 10% to 12%, and fitness grew from 22% to 24%. 
As you can see from the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Combined basis, the marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 92% of operating income in the third quarter 2018 compared to 89% in the third quarter of 2017. The aviation and outdoor segments had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin.
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 8%. Research and development increased $9 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Our advertising expense was down $1 million from the prior quarter. SG&A was up $13 million compared to prior quarter, an increase of 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. The increase was probably due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year on stronger sales. Inventory balance increased on a sequential basis to $557 million to prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. In the third quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $234 million, $81 million increase from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we pay dividends of $100 million.
During the third quarter of 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% compared to the effective tax rate of 20.5% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform and increased benefit from U.S. R&D tax credits. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Miranda, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

In terms of geopolitical issues, right now, we don't really see anything that's moving the needle in terms of concerns. The Asia demand still appears to be very strong. I think there's increasing competition in some of the product lines there particularly in wearables, but we are very competitive with our product line. I would say, we probably don't have the vision to become a contract manufacturer given the situation around tariffs. We actually feel like our capacity is really quite constraint with our own demand right now. So we probably don't have the ability to look for other opportunities like that."

I'd like to begin by mentioning a couple of important milestones we recently celebrated. During the third quarter, we shipped our 200 millionth product, which is a testament to our ability to design, manufacture and sell unique applications and technology for active lifestyles. Equally as exciting, we started production in our new aviation manufacturing facility located in Olathe, Kansas. This new facility more than doubles our production capacity, allowing us to serve our growing aviation business for many years to come. 
Moving now to the quarterly results. Earlier today, Garmin reported strong third quarter consolidated revenue of $810 million, up 8% over the prior year. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 16% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. 
Gross margin improved to 59.4% compared to the prior year. Operating income improved to $196 million, up 13% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.97 and pro forma EPS of $1 in the quarter. 
We are pleased with our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first, I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.
Starting with the marine segment. Revenue increased 28% as we saw strong sales continue well into the summer building season. Approximately half of the growth was organic, while the other half came from acquisitions. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 14%, respectively. 
We recently announced our GPSMAP 8600 series of chartplotters. This is the first product line to use our new G3 maps, which combine the best of Garmin and Navionics content. 
We've been very intentional about investing in our marine segment, and the industry is taking notice. For the fourth consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year, and Panoptix LiveScope won their prestigious technology award. We are also recognized as one of the Top 10 Most Innovative Marine Companies in 2018 by Soundings Trade Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational building industry. It's an honor to be recognized by the marine industry, and we will continue to invest in the segment to maximize its potential. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 17% driven by broad-based growth within the segment. Gross and operating margins increased to 76% and 35%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 49% over the prior year. 
During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of FltPlan.com and have begun integrating these new services into Garmin's existing apps. Also, we recently announced that our ADS-B solution was selected by Gulfstream for the G280 aircraft. Finally, we announced the teaming agreement with Bell to supply avionics for on-demand mobility vehicles. While this project is in its early stages, it's an important first step towards creating a viable urban air transport system.
Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 14%, primarily driven by growth of our wearable products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively, and operating income grew 12% over the prior year. 
During the third quarter, we launched the vívosmart 4, a slim, smart activity tracker that includes a Pulse Ox sensor. In addition to providing blood oxygen saturation levels, this device also provides users with advanced sleep monitoring and a new Body Battery feature that helps individuals understand and manage their energy levels throughout the day. We also added Disney Princess and Marvel's Spider-Man bands to our popular vívofit jr. product line, along with new mobile app adventures.
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 13% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by growth in wearables. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 65% and 38%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 16%. 
We recently announced the integration of Spotify with fenix 5 Plus series. And just this morning, the Forerunner 645 Music was added to the list as Spotify compatible wearables. This gives our customers the ability to download Spotify playlist to the watch via the Spotify app, which is available from the Connect IQ store. The app is already proving to be very popular with our customers. During its first full day of availability, Spotify set a record for the most downloads of a new app from our Connect IQ store. 
Finally, we recently announced Instinct, a rugged and reliable GPS smartwatch designed to expand the market for outdoor wearables.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 16% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 43% and 9%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. 
We recently announced that we've been selected by the Chinese auto group, Geely, to provide camera and driving recorder systems beginning in model year 2020. This award demonstrates the progress we are making as a Tier 1 auto supplier. 
In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first 3 quarters of 2018. In light of the strong third quarter results, we are making some adjustments to our guidance. We anticipate our fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, with full year revenue of approximately $3.3 billion and a gross margin of 58.5%. We are raising our full year operating margin to approximately 22% and lowering our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.45.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $810 million for the third quarter, representing 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.4%, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.2%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $196 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.2%, 110 basis points increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.97. Pro forma EPS was $1, 30% increase from the prior year.
Next, look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. This growth was partially offset by decline in our auto segment, which resulted in continued decline in auto PND business. Combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 16% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 80% to total revenue in the third quarter 2018 compared to 74% in the prior year quarter. Auto declined from 26% to 20%, while every other segment grew. Marine grew from 10% to 12%, and fitness grew from 22% to 24%. As you can see from the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Combined basis, the marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 92% of operating income in the third quarter 2018 compared to 89% in the third quarter of 2017. The aviation and outdoor segments had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 8%. Research and development increased $9 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Our advertising expense was down $1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A was up $13 million compared to prior quarter, an increase of 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year on stronger sales. Inventory balance increased on a sequential basis to $557 million to prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. In the third quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $234 million, $81 million increase from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $100 million.
During the third quarter of 2018, we reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% compared to the effective tax rate of 20.5% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform and increased benefit from U.S. R&D tax credits. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Miranda, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

So in terms of guidance, basically, each segment that comprises our guidance has a different set of circumstance that we're looking out there. So we took each one of those into consideration when we constructed our guidance, and the result came out to essentially relatively flat last year. With the product mix and the overall trends we're seeing, we felt confident to upgrade our operating income estimate as well. In terms of geopolitical issues, right now, we don't really see anything that's moving the needle in terms of concerns. The Asia demand still appears to be very strong. I think there's increasing competition in some of the product lines there, particularly in wearables, but we are very competitive with our product line. I would say we probably don't have the vision to become a contract manufacturer given the situation around tariffs. We actually feel like our capacity is really quite constraint with our own demand right now, so we probably don't have the ability to look for other opportunities like that."

In terms of what we call the pure running market, we are kind of at the end of the product life cycle there. And so I think going forward, as we introduce these new products, we'll see upticks, but we are relatively flat in terms of the quarter on running."

I'd like to begin by mentioning a couple of important milestones we recently celebrated. During the third quarter, we shipped our 200 millionth product, which is a testament to our ability to design, manufacture and sell unique applications and technology for active lifestyles. Equally as exciting, we started production in our new aviation manufacturing facility located in Olathe, Kansas. This new facility more than doubles our production capacity, allowing us to serve our growing aviation business for many years to come. 
Moving now to the quarterly results. Earlier today, Garmin reported strong third quarter consolidated revenue of $810 million, up 8% over the prior year. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 16% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 59.4% compared to the prior year. Operating income improved to $196 million, up 13% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.97 and pro forma EPS of $1 in the quarter. We are pleased with our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.  Starting with the marine segment. Revenue increased 28% as we saw strong sales continue well into the summer boating season. Approximately half of the growth was organic, while the other half came from acquisitions. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 14%, respectively. We recently announced our GPSMAP 8600 series of chartplotters. This is the first product line to use our new G3 maps, which combine the best of Garmin and Navionics content. 
We've been very intentional about investing in our marine segment, and the industry is taking notice. For the fourth consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year, and Panoptix LiveScope won their prestigious technology award. We were also recognized as one of the Top 10 Most Innovative Marine Companies in 2018 by Soundings Trade Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. It's an honor to be recognized by the marine industry, and we will continue to invest in the segment to maximize its potential. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 17% driven by broad-based growth within the segment. Gross and operating margins increased to 76% and 35%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 49% over the prior year. During the quarter we completed the acquisition of FltPlan.com and have begun integrating these new services into Garmin's existing apps. Also, we recently announced that our ADS-B solution was selected by Gulfstream for the G280 aircraft. Finally, we announced the teaming agreement with Bell to supply avionics for on-demand mobility vehicles. While this project is in its early stages, it's an important first step towards creating a viable urban air transport system.
Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 14%, primarily driven by growth of our wearable products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively, and operating income grew 12% over the prior year. During the third quarter, we launched the vívosmart 4, a slim, smart activity tracker that includes a Pulse Ox sensor. In addition to providing blood oxygen saturation levels, this device also provides users with advanced sleep monitoring and a new Body Battery feature that helps individuals understand and manage their energy levels throughout the day. We also added Disney Princess and Marvel's Spider-Man bands to our popular vívofit jr. product line, along with new mobile app adventures.
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 13% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by growth in wearables. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 65% and 38%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 16%. We recently announced the integration of Spotify with fenix 5 Plus series. And just this morning, the Forerunner 645 Music was added to the list as Spotify compatible wearables. This gives our customers the ability to download Spotify playlist to the watch via the Spotify app, which is available from the Connect IQ store. The app is already proving to be very popular with customers. During its first full day of availability, Spotify set a record for the most downloads of a new app from our Connect IQ store. Finally, we recently announced Instinct, a rugged and reliable GPS smartwatch designed to expand the market for outdoor wearables.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 16% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 43% and 9%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. We recently announced that we've been selected by the Chinese auto group, Geely, to provide camera and driving recorder systems beginning in model year 2020. This award demonstrates the progress we are making as a Tier 1 auto supplier. 
In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first 3 quarters of 2018. In light of the strong third quarter results, we are making some adjustments to our guidance. We anticipate our fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, with full year revenue of approximately $3.3 billion and a gross margin of 58.5%. We are raising our full year operating margin to approximately 22% and lowering our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.45.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $810 million for the third quarter, representing 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.4%, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.2%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $196 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.2%, 110 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.97. Pro forma EPS was $1, 30% increase from the prior year.
Next, look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. This growth was partially offset by decline in our auto segment, which resulted in continued decline in auto PND business. Combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 16% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 80% to total revenue in the third quarter 2018 compared to 74% in the prior year quarter. Auto declined from 26% to 20%, while every other segment grew. Marine grew from 10% to 12%, and fitness grew from 22% to 24%. You can see from the charts illustrate our profit mix by segment, combined basis marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 92% of operating income in third quarter 2018 compared to 89% in the third quarter of 2017. The aviation and outdoor segments had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 8%. Research and development increased $9 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Our advertising expense was down $1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A was up $13 million compared to prior quarter, increase 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year on stronger sales. Inventory balance increased on a sequential basis to $557 million to prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. In the third quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $234 million, $81 million increase from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends $100 million.
During the third quarter 2018, reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% compared to the effective tax rate of 20.5% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform and increased benefit from U.S. R&D tax credits. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16%.

So maybe if you could just add a little color on why you're seeing the better operating margin despite it looks like mix is going to be fairly similar. And then as a follow-on question, Cliff, I just would be curious on your thoughts on the geopolitical situation in terms of its impact on your business.

With the product mix and the overall trends we're seeing, we felt confident to upgrade our operating income estimate as well. In terms of geopolitical issues, right now we don't really see anything that's moving the needle in terms of concerns. The Asia demand still appears to be very strong. I think there's increasing competition in some of the product lines there, particularly in wearables, but we are very competitive with our product line. I would say we probably don't have the vision to become a contract manufacturer given the situation around tariffs. We actually feel like our capacity is really quite constrained with our own demand right now, so we probably don't have the ability to look for other opportunities like that."

In terms of what we're looking at for Q4, there's really 2 dynamics that we see. One is the year-over-year comp with particularly the vívoactive 3, which is a very popular line last year as well as this year, and then the rotation of the product mix within fitness from basic trackers to advanced trackers is another dynamic that's shifting things around within the segment. So all that coming together, we feel like our implied guide is basically what it is, fairly flat to slightly down, but we feel very good about the product positioning within the segment and where we're at this year. And I think looking forward into the coming year, we'll have a strong product portfolio that we can build on."

I think there's a lot of awareness around the space right now, so that's helping as well. So we're getting some benefits from organic growth, but also as we expand our product line like we've done with the Instinct, that helps expand our reach to other customers who otherwise may not be ready to go or make that kind of commitment to like the fenix watch, for example. In terms of competition, it's definitely getting stronger. There's a lot of competitors out there and some coming into the space from China. So that is a dynamic, especially in the Asia market but also even in other areas as they start to play the market like what is typically done from those players that play typically on price.

I'd like to begin by mentioning a couple of important milestones we recently celebrated. During the third quarter, we shipped our 200 millionth product, which is a testament to our ability to design, manufacture and sell unique applications and technology for active lifestyles. Equally as exciting, we started production in our new aviation manufacturing facility located in Olathe, Kansas. This new facility more than doubles our production capacity, allowing us to serve our growing aviation business for many years to come. 
Moving now to the quarterly results. Earlier today, Garmin reported strong third quarter consolidated revenue of $810 million, up 8% over the prior year. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 16% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 59.4% compared to the prior year. Operating income improved to $196 million, up 13% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.97 and pro forma EPS of $1 in the quarter. We are pleased with our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.  Starting with the marine segment. Revenue increased 28% as we saw strong sales continue well into the summer boating season. Approximately half of the growth was organic, while the other half came from acquisitions. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 14%, respectively. We recently announced our GPSMAP 8600 series of chartplotters. This is the first product line to use our new G3 maps, which combine the best of Garmin and Navionics content. 
We've been very intentional about investing in our marine segment, and the industry is taking notice. For the fourth consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year, and Panoptix LiveScope won their prestigious technology award. We were also recognized as one of the Top 10 Most Innovative Marine Companies in 2018 by Soundings Trade Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. It's an honor to be recognized by the marine industry, and we will continue to invest in the segment to maximize its potential. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 17% driven by broad-based growth within the segment. Gross and operating margins increased to 76% and 35%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 49% over the prior year. During the quarter we completed the acquisition of FltPlan.com and have begun integrating these new services into Garmin's existing apps. Also, we recently announced that our ADS-B solution was selected by Gulfstream for the G280 aircraft. Finally, we announced the teaming agreement with Bell to supply avionics for on-demand mobility vehicles. While this project is in its early stages, it's an important first step towards creating a viable urban air transport system.
Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 14%, primarily driven by growth of our wearable products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively, and operating income grew 12% over the prior year. During the third quarter, we launched the vívosmart 4, a slim, smart activity tracker that includes a Pulse Ox sensor. In addition to providing blood oxygen saturation levels, this device also provides users with advanced sleep monitoring and a new Body Battery feature that helps individuals understand and manage their energy levels throughout the day. We also added Disney Princess and Marvel's Spider-Man bands to our popular vívofit jr. product line, along with new mobile app adventures.
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 13% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by growth in wearables. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 65% and 38%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 16%. We recently announced the integration of Spotify with fenix 5 Plus series. And just this morning, the Forerunner 645 Music was added to the list as Spotify compatible wearables. This gives our customers the ability to download Spotify playlist to the watch via the Spotify app, which is available from the Connect IQ store. The app is already proving to be very popular with customers. During its first full day of availability, Spotify set a record for the most downloads of a new app from our Connect IQ store. Finally, we recently announced Instinct, a rugged and reliable GPS smartwatch designed to expand the market for outdoor wearables.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 16% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 43% and 9%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. We recently announced that we've been selected by the Chinese auto group, Geely, to provide camera and driving recorder systems beginning in model year 2020. This award demonstrates the progress we are making as a Tier 1 auto supplier. 
In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first 3 quarters of 2018. In light of the strong third quarter results, we are making some adjustments to our guidance. We anticipate our fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, with full year revenue of approximately $3.3 billion and a gross margin of 58.5%. We are raising our full year operating margin to approximately 22% and lowering our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.45.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $810 million for the third quarter, representing 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.4%, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.2%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $196 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.2%, 110 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.97. Pro forma EPS was $1, 30% increase from the prior year.
Next, look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. This growth was partially offset by decline in our auto segment, which resulted in continued decline in auto PND business. Combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 16% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 80% to total revenue in the third quarter 2018 compared to 74% in the prior year quarter. Auto declined from 26% to 20%, while every other segment grew. Marine grew from 10% to 12%, and fitness grew from 22% to 24%. You can see from the charts illustrate our profit mix by segment, combined basis marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 92% of operating income in third quarter 2018 compared to 89% in the third quarter of 2017. The aviation and outdoor segments had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 8%. Research and development increased $9 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Our advertising expense was down $1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A was up $13 million compared to prior quarter, increase 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year on stronger sales. Inventory balance increased on a sequential basis to $557 million to prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. In the third quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $234 million, $81 million increase from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends $100 million.
During the third quarter 2018, reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% compared to the effective tax rate of 20.5% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform and increased benefit from U.S. R&D tax credits. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. This concludes our formal remarks.

So in terms of guidance, basically each segment that comprises our guidance has a different set of circumstance that we're looking at there. So we took each one of those into consideration when we constructed our guidance, and the result came out to essentially relatively flat with last year. With the product mix and the overall trends we're seeing, we felt confident to upgrade our operating income estimate as well. In terms of geopolitical issues, right now we don't really see anything that's moving the needle in terms of concerns. The Asia demand still appears to be very strong. I think there's increasing competition in some of the product lines there, particularly in wearables, but we are very competitive with our product line. I would say we probably don't have the vision to become a contract manufacturer given the situation around tariffs. We actually feel like our capacity is really quite constrained with our own demand right now, so we probably don't have the ability to look for other opportunities like that."

And the activity in aviation really is very strong right now in terms of the overall market, so we anticipate that there are other opportunities that we can leverage. Pull forward is certainly a concern in a situation like this, particularly as we see a lot of people updating their cockpits along with ADS-B. But we do believe we have a strong product line that should be able to continue those upgrades, especially for people that might have been cautious early on and are now coming forward to maybe complete a panel upgrade after they did some basic work with ADS-B earlier."

I'd like to begin by mentioning a couple of important milestones we recently celebrated. During the third quarter, we shipped our 200 millionth product, which is a testament to our ability to design, manufacture and sell unique applications and technology for active lifestyles. Equally as exciting, we started production in our new aviation manufacturing facility located in Olathe, Kansas. This new facility more than doubles our production capacity, allowing us to serve our growing aviation business for many years to come. 
Moving now to the quarterly results. Earlier today, Garmin reported strong third quarter consolidated revenue of $810 million, up 8% over the prior year. Marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor collectively increased 16% year-over-year and contributed 80% of total revenues. Gross margin improved to 59.4% compared to the prior year. Operating income improved to $196 million, up 13% over the prior year. This resulted in GAAP EPS of $0.97 and pro forma EPS of $1 in the quarter. We are pleased with our performance in the first 3 quarters of 2018, and these strong results give us confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance. 
Doug will discuss our financial results in greater detail in a few minutes, but first I'd like to provide a few brief remarks on the performance of our business segments.  Starting with the marine segment. Revenue increased 28% as we saw strong sales continue well into the summer boating season. Approximately half of the growth was organic, while the other half came from acquisitions. Gross and operating margins were 59% and 14%, respectively. We recently announced our GPSMAP 8600 series of chartplotters. This is the first product line to use our new G3 maps, which combine the best of Garmin and Navionics content. 
We've been very intentional about investing in our marine segment, and the industry is taking notice. For the fourth consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of the Year, and Panoptix LiveScope won their prestigious technology award. We were also recognized as one of the Top 10 Most Innovative Marine Companies in 2018 by Soundings Trade Only, which is a B2B news and information provider for the recreational boating industry. It's an honor to be recognized by the marine industry, and we will continue to invest in the segment to maximize its potential. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue increased 17% driven by broad-based growth within the segment. Gross and operating margins increased to 76% and 35%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 49% over the prior year. During the quarter we completed the acquisition of FltPlan.com and have begun integrating these new services into Garmin's existing apps. Also, we recently announced that our ADS-B solution was selected by Gulfstream for the G280 aircraft. Finally, we announced the teaming agreement with Bell to supply avionics for on-demand mobility vehicles. While this project is in its early stages, it's an important first step towards creating a viable urban air transport system.
Turning next to the fitness segment. Revenue increased 14%, primarily driven by growth of our wearable products. Gross and operating margins were 54% and 20%, respectively, and operating income grew 12% over the prior year. During the third quarter, we launched the vívosmart 4, a slim, smart activity tracker that includes a Pulse Ox sensor. In addition to providing blood oxygen saturation levels, this device also provides users with advanced sleep monitoring and a new Body Battery feature that helps individuals understand and manage their energy levels throughout the day. We also added Disney Princess and Marvel's Spider-Man bands to our popular vívofit jr. product line, along with new mobile app adventures.
Turning next to the outdoor segment. Revenue increased 13% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by growth in wearables. Gross and operating margins improved year-over-year to 65% and 38%, respectively, resulting in operating income growth of 16%. We recently announced the integration of Spotify with fenix 5 Plus series. And just this morning, the Forerunner 645 Music was added to the list as Spotify compatible wearables. This gives our customers the ability to download Spotify playlist to the watch via the Spotify app, which is available from the Connect IQ store. The app is already proving to be very popular with customers. During its first full day of availability, Spotify set a record for the most downloads of a new app from our Connect IQ store. Finally, we recently announced Instinct, a rugged and reliable GPS smartwatch designed to expand the market for outdoor wearables.
Looking finally at the auto segment. Revenue decreased 16% due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins declined year-over-year to 43% and 9%, respectively. Our global market share position in the PND category remains very strong. We recently announced that we've been selected by the Chinese auto group, Geely, to provide camera and driving recorder systems beginning in model year 2020. This award demonstrates the progress we are making as a Tier 1 auto supplier. 
In summary, we are pleased with our results in the first 3 quarters of 2018. In light of the strong third quarter results, we are making some adjustments to our guidance. We anticipate our fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, with full year revenue of approximately $3.3 billion and a gross margin of 58.5%. We are raising our full year operating margin to approximately 22% and lowering our full year pro forma effective tax rate to approximately 16%, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $3.45.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'd like to begin by reviewing our third quarter financial results and make comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $810 million for the third quarter, representing 8% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 59.4%, a 120 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percentage of sales was 35.2%, consistent with the prior year. Operating income was $196 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.2%, 110 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.97. Pro forma EPS was $1, 30% increase from the prior year.
Next, look at our third quarter revenue by segment. During the quarter, we achieved 8% consolidated growth led by double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments. This growth was partially offset by decline in our auto segment, which resulted in continued decline in auto PND business. Combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor were up 16% compared to prior year quarter. 
Looking next at third quarter revenue and operating income. On a combined basis, marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments contributed 80% to total revenue in the third quarter 2018 compared to 74% in the prior year quarter. Auto declined from 26% to 20%, while every other segment grew. Marine grew from 10% to 12%, and fitness grew from 22% to 24%. You can see from the charts illustrate our profit mix by segment, combined basis marine, aviation, fitness and outdoor segments delivered 92% of operating income in third quarter 2018 compared to 89% in the third quarter of 2017. The aviation and outdoor segments had year-over-year increase in both operating income dollars and operating margin. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Our third quarter operating expenses increased by $21 million or 8%. Research and development increased $9 million year-over-year due to investments in engineering resources and recent acquisitions. Our advertising expense was down $1 million from the prior year quarter. SG&A was up $13 million compared to prior quarter, increase 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. Increase was primarily due to personnel-related expenses, incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions.
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $2.5 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially due to seasonal trends and increased year-over-year on stronger sales. Inventory balance increased on a sequential basis to $557 million to prepare for the seasonally strong fourth quarter. In the third quarter 2018, we generated free cash flow of $234 million, $81 million increase from the prior year quarter. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends $100 million.
During the third quarter 2018, reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% compared to the effective tax rate of 20.5% in the prior year quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to benefits from U.S. tax reform and increased benefit from U.S. R&D tax credits. We expect our full year 2018 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. This concludes our formal remarks.

So in terms of guidance, basically each segment that comprises our guidance has a different set of circumstance that we're looking at there. So we took each one of those into consideration when we constructed our guidance, and the result came out to essentially relatively flat with last year. With the product mix and the overall trends we're seeing, we felt confident to upgrade our operating income estimate as well. In terms of geopolitical issues, right now we don't really see anything that's moving the needle in terms of concerns. The Asia demand still appears to be very strong. I think there's increasing competition in some of the product lines there, particularly in wearables, but we are very competitive with our product line. I would say we probably don't have the vision to become a contract manufacturer given the situation around tariffs. We actually feel like our capacity is really quite constrained with our own demand right now, so we probably don't have the ability to look for other opportunities like that."

That's very important for us. We did increase our dividend this last year. The second of which is investments back into our business. An example of that is the facility expansion that we did here relates to our aviation manufacturing, our distribution center as well as building out some existing space for office there. But then also, acquisitions. Acquisitions we did in the past, DeLorme, the Navionics and such. So look at those are really the priorities for our cash on a go-forward basis."

So there's targeted things that we're doing, some ability to scale our expenses.
