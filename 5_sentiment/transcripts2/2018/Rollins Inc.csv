All of our business lines experienced good growth in the quarter with residential up 6.9%, commercial pest control grew 5% and termite and ancillary rose 15.6%. 
In summary, 2017 was an excellent year for our company as we continue to execute our strategic plans and goals. These are initiated through our culture of continuous improvement in all we do. We remain committed to service improvement and employee development and are accomplishing both.
In the past year, we added 12 new international franchises to our network as we continue to increase our presence around the world. We also advanced our acquisition strategy having added Northwest Exterminating, which was discussed in our last call and several small tuck-in acquisitions. We greatly improved our routing and scheduling capabilities, resulting from the implementation of BOSS and its virtual route management feature. John, will elaborate on this shortly.
Those of you who are familiar with our company know that we recognize there's always room for improvement in all we do. We will continue to raise the bar in 2018 and look forward to taking our company to the next level.

We are pleased to report that BOSS, our branch operating system, moved to full implementation to Orkin in 2017. And with this system in place, we were able to add the virtual route management software that has begun to improve our technicians' routing and scheduling of their customers. Many of the homes our technicians service are made up of double income households, and as a result, those customers expect reasonable and accurate arrival windows to accommodate their busy schedules. It is essential that our technicians are where they are supposed to be, when they are supposed to be there. Scheduling is one of the toughest tasks our people face due to constant and daily changes as new customers begin service or existing customers request an additional service or an appointment change. With the aid of this routing and scheduling tool, we can improve the delivery of our services to our customers by being there when they expect and want us to be. At the same time, we are better able to build the most efficient schedules for our daily service. Further, this routing and scheduling tool has improved our miles driven, which helps to offset any increase in fuel prices and vehicle-related costs. Our results today show reduction of average miles per stock by half a mile. This may not sound like much until you multiply that by the more than 880,000 unique customer visits we perform each month. The 440,000 miles saved both reduces wear and tear our vehicles and saves our technicians thousands of hours of drive time. This effort also contributes to reduced accidents and lower employee turnover.
But most importantly, it improves our customer experience through better on-time service performance and living up to our promise of being there when we say we will be there. We will continue to move BOSS and the virtual route management capabilities forward and expect to see continued benefits during all of 2018 and beyond.
For those of you that have followed the Rollins story for years, you know that in 2010, we began enjoying revenue growth through bedbugs. Since that time, we have learned a lot about not only the revenue potential of this pest service but the profitability of our offerings. Our marketing, sales and technical services groups have worked together over the past year to improve this service line and I am pleased to announce the launch of our commercial Pro app, bed bug offering. Orkin bed bug Pro app is an innovative pro app bed bug service delivered specifically for the hospitality industry. Proactive creates an ongoing defense against bedbugs and hotel guestrooms that helps reduce the likelihood of costly bedbug infestations and loss customer revenue. The services performed by our trained specialists using residual products that create an effective barrier between service visits, which can now be scheduled as much as 6 months apart. The net takeaway with the proactive in our testing is at the reduces emergency services and hotel room down time. 
We've pinpointed 3 key benefits of pro app that are unattainable with current conventional bed bug service treatments: Peace of mind, budget predictability and reputation management. 91% of the hotel years reported that they are worried about the impact of bed bug infestations. Pro app lessens the likelihood of an infestation, putting their fears to rest and because pro app is an ongoing yearly service, these customers now upfront how much they will spend to prevent bedbugs instead on a more random case by case basis. Lastly, according to research, bed bug sightings are the number one reason a guest would immediately switch hotels in the biggest concern for hotel managers is negative word of mouth and reputation damage. By moving to prevent bed bug introductions from growing into an unmanageable infestation, pr act helps reduce the risk of negative online reviews and unwanted media coverage. We look forward to supporting our hospitality customers with this industry-leading service offering.
I would now like to turn the call over to Eddie."

We ended the year on a positive note with good growth in revenue and earnings in both pest control and termite. While the second half of the year had its challenges we produced record-setting revenues, income and earnings per share. 2017",1504,"Thank you,  John. We ended the year on a positive note with good growth in revenue and earnings in both pest control and termite. While the second half of the year had its challenges we produced record-setting revenues, income and earnings per share. 2017 was a great transition year related to technology as John mentioned and has created a platform for continued improvements at Orkin as well as our other brands.
With the signing of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act law, our tax provision went through some robust Q4 changes. As mentioned our press release, we will review our numbers from a GAAP and non-GAAP perspective for this quarter and for the full year of 2017.
Fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 results reflect the estimated negative impact of the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in an $11.6 million charge, of which $8 million was from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million was from deferred tax asset, and $700,000 was from changes in tax on stock compensation or $0.06 per diluted share decrease in net income. The net income and diluted earnings per share, excluding second items are non-GAAP financial measures.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included a significant onetime tax event, fastest growth rate since 2008 and strong international growth and profitability in all countries.
Looking at the numbers, the company reported fourth quarter revenue of $414.7 million, an increase of 7.5% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $385.6 million. Income before income taxes increased 30.5% to $68.5 million from $52.5 million in 2016.
In 2016, we had a onetime expense item of $9 million related to our changes in our Canadian tax company. 
Net income was $33.7 million, down 11.2% from $38 million in 2016 and earnings per share were $0.15 for the quarter and $0.17 in 2016. We realized a 50.8% tax rate for the quarter, significantly higher than our historic 37% rate due to the tax act.
From a non-GAAP perspective for the fourth quarter, net income increased 19.2% to $45.3 million with earnings per share of $0.21 versus $0.17 per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter, up 23.5%.
Our revenue for the 12 months of $1.673 billion, represents a 6.4% growth rate. Income before taxes was $294.5 million up 13%, and from a GAAP perspective, net income was $179.1 million an increase of 7%. Earnings per share were $0.82 compared to $0.77 last year, up 6.5%. This total revenue growth is our highest since 2008.
From a non-GAAP perspective for the 12 months, net income increased to $190.7 million, up 13.9% from $167.4 million in 2016. Earnings per share were $0.87 compared to $0.77 in 2016, a 13% increase.
Let's take a look at the revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 7.5% included 3.5% from several acquisitions of which Northwest Exterminating was the largest, and the remaining 4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 41% of our revenue was up 6.9%; commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue was up 5%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue was up 15.6%. The Northwest business contributed to this increase.
Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 4%. From that, residential was up 4.7%, commercial increased 3.9% and termite and ancillary improved by 8.2%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign currency, in total, we grew 7.5%, residential grew 6.7%, commercial pest control was up 4.3% and termite and ancillary improved 16.2%.
As we completed the year, our international operations finished on a high note with strong revenue and profit growth. In Australia, our national presence and excellent service levels have enabled us to be involved with many national level tenders of business. In addition, through our initiatives, we've been able to standardize pricing across the country.
During this past year, Canada expands margins at the fastest rate in the last several years. In the U.K., [indiscernible] continues to gain recognition and has enabled them to continue a pace of significant growth.
As Gary mentioned in his opening, we added 12 new international franchises, to which now totals 81 at the end of 2017. Each of these operations continue to grow in maturity, which enable service-level to continue to improve and recurring revenue to grow. Our participation last year at the World Pest Day and our upcoming sponsorship of the Global Food Safety conference in Tokyo, will continue to elevate our brand around the globe.
In total, gross margin was flat to last year at 50% compared to prior year as we incorporated Northwest Exterminating into our company. We experienced good cost control, increasing our gross margin and service salaries as we continue to improve efficiencies and increase productivity from our technicians with the use of BOSS. We witnessed improved margins in administrative salaries as costs remained relatively flat to prior year and we reduced insurance and claims as we experienced reductions in legal liabilities.
The gains in productivity were offset by increases in materials and supplies as we spent more on termite product with our revenue growth, lead expenses due to gasoline price increase as and leased vehicle costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.1 million to $14.9 million, an increase of 8.1%. The depreciation portion has continued to subside with the lapping of BOSS but the amortization has increased with our M&A activity. Depreciation was $6.9 million, decreasing $53,000 or 0.8% from last year. Amortization was $7.9 million, which increased $1.1 million with amortization of intangible assets increasing due mostly to amortized customer contracts, resulting from the purchase of various Orkin acquisitions throughout the year and Northwest Exterminating.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased to $2.6 million or 2.1% compared to the prior year quarter. SG&A decreased to 29.8% of revenues compared to 32.8% for the prior year. The primary driver for the reduction was the onetime tax event to dissolve the subsidiary Cano investment company in 2016. The fourth quarter 2016 SG&A expense increased by $9.1 million or $0.06 of a percentage point due to the onetime tax event that was offset by a credit in income tax expense.
Other marginal decreases were to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related expenses. The company experienced increased expense margins in professional services as we use outside contractors for various projects, maintenance and repair due to maintenance contracts on various IT upgrades and fleet expense.
As for our cash position. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, we spent $130.2 million on acquisitions and $122 million on dividends, an increase of 12%. We had $24.7 million capital expenditures, which was down 25.4% from 2016, primarily from the completion of the BOSS project and ended with $107.1 million in cash, down 25% from last year. As a reminder, we used all cash for our acquisition of Northwest Exterminating.
As mentioned in our press release, we anticipate having a significantly lower tax rate for all of 2018. Our historic rate of 37% will be reduced to the mid-20s and we will see further clarity as we know more details. In addition, as we saw in 2017, our first quarter 2018 rate should be reduced even further due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan. At this time, we do not plan to repatriate any cash but we'll continue to look for opportunity to put this to use in our ongoing international operations and use for expansion opportunities. As far as the tax savings from the lower 2018 rate, we will continue to assess other opportunities related to our business, our shareholders and our employees.
From a business perspective, one way that we will use these savings will be in the area of technology projects. Based on our success in the U.S. with efficiency gains and improved routing and scheduling, we have made the decision to roll out our BOSS technology to Orkin Canada. The development and rollout will take most of 2018 and should contribute in 2019 and this will be a financial event for us in either late 2018 or 2019. We will keep you posted on the impact in future quarters. We are very excited of the possibilities of the BOSS -- that BOSS presents for us in Orkin Canada.
And finally from a shareholders perspective, last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on March 9, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business, February 9, 2018. The cash dividend is a 21.7% increase over the prior year. This is the largest percent increase since 2010. And this also marks the 16th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
I will now turn the call back over to Gary."

In summary, 2017 was an excellent year for our company as we continue to execute our strategic plans and goals. These are initiated through our culture of continuous improvement in all we do. We remain committed to service improvement and employee development and are accomplishing both.
In the past year, we added 12 new international franchises to our network as we continue to increase our presence around the world. We also advanced our acquisition strategy having added Northwest Exterminating, which was discussed in our last call, and several small tuck-in acquisitions. We greatly improved our routing and scheduling capabilities, resulting from the implementation of BOSS and its virtual route management feature. John, will elaborate on this shortly.
Those of you who are familiar with our company know that we recognize there's always room for improvement in all we do. We will continue to raise the bar in 2018 and look forward to taking our company to the next level.

We are pleased to report that BOSS, our branch operating system, moved to full implementation to Orkin in 2017. And with this system in place, we were able to add the virtual route management software that has begun to improve our technicians' routing and scheduling of their customers. Many of the homes our technicians service are made up of double income households. And as a result, those customers expect reasonable and accurate arrival windows to accommodate their busy schedules. 
It is essential that our technicians are where they are supposed to be, when they are supposed to be there. Scheduling is one of the toughest tasks our people face due to constant and daily changes as new customers begin service or existing customers request an additional service or an appointment change. With the aid of this routing and scheduling tool, we can improve the delivery of services to our customers by being there when they expect and want us to be. At the same time, we are better able to build the most efficient schedules for our daily service. 
Further, this routing and scheduling tool has improved our miles driven, which helps to offset any increase in fuel prices and vehicle-related costs. Our results today show reduction of average miles per stock by half mile. This may not sound like much until you multiply that by the more than 880,000 unique customer visits we perform each month. The 440,000 miles saved, both reduces wear and tear on our vehicles and saves our technicians thousands of hours of drive time. This effort also contributes to reduced accidents and lower employee turnover.
But most importantly, it improves our customer experience through better on-time service performance and living up to our promise of being there when we say we will be there. We will continue to move BOSS and the virtual route management capabilities forward and expect to see continued benefits during all of 2018 and beyond.
For those of you that have followed the Rollins story for years, you know that in 2010 we began enjoying revenue growth due to bed bugs. Since that time, we have learned a lot about not only the revenue potential of this pest service but the profitability of our offerings. Our marketing, sales and technical services groups have worked together over the past year to improve this service line, and I am pleased to announce the launch of our commercial ProAct bed bug offering. Orkin Bed Bug ProAct is an innovative, proactive bed bug service developed specifically for the hospitality industry. ProAct creates an ongoing defense against bed bugs and hotel guestrooms that helps reduce the likelihood of costly bed bug infestations and loss customer revenue. The services performed by our trained specialists using residual products that create an effective barrier between service visits, which can now be scheduled as much as 6 months apart. The net takeaway with the ProAct in our testing is it reduces emergency service visit and hotel room down time. 
We pinpointed 3 key benefits of ProAct that are unattainable with conventional bed bug service treatments: peace of mind, budget predictability and reputation management. 91% of the hoteliers reported that they are worried about the impact of bed bug infestations. ProAct lessens the likelihood of an infestation, putting their fears to rest. And because ProAct is an ongoing yearly service, these customers now upfront how much they will spend to prevent bed bugs instead on a more random case by case basis. 
Lastly, according to research, bed bug sightings are the number one reason a guest would immediately switch hotels. And the biggest concern for hotel managers is negative word of mouth and reputation damage. By moving to prevent bed bug introductions from growing into an unmanageable infestation, ProAct helps reduce the risk of negative online reviews and unwanted media coverage. We look forward to supporting our hospitality customers with this industry-leading service offering.
I would now like to turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,548383444,1373171,"Rollins, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2018",2018-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. We ended the year on a positive note with good growth in revenue and earnings in both pest control and termite. While the second half of the year had its challenges, we produced record-setting revenue, income and earnings per share. 2017",1504,"Thank you, John. We ended the year on a positive note with good growth in revenue and earnings in both pest control and termite. While the second half of the year had its challenges, we produced record-setting revenue, income and earnings per share. 2017 was a great transition year related to technology, as John mentioned, and has created a platform for continued improvements at Orkin as well as our other brands.
With the signing of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act law, our tax provision went through some robust Q4 changes. As mentioned in our press release, we will review our numbers from a GAAP and non-GAAP perspective for this quarter and for the full year of 2017.
Fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 results reflect the estimated negative impact of the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in an $11.6 million charge, of which $8 million was from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million was from deferred tax asset, and $700,000 was from changes in tax on stock compensation or $0.06 per diluted share decrease in net income. 
Net income and diluted earnings per share, excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included a significant onetime tax event, fastest growth rate since 2008 and strong international growth and profitability in all countries.
Looking at the numbers, the company reported fourth quarter revenue of $414.7 million, an increase of 7.5% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $385.6 million. Income before income taxes increased 30.5% to $68.5 million from $52.5 million in 2016. In 2016, we had a onetime expense item of $9 million related to our changes in our Canadian tax company. 
Net income was $33.7 million, down 11.2% from $38 million in 2016 and earnings per share were $0.15 for the quarter and $0.17 in 2016. We realized a 50.8% tax rate for the quarter, significantly higher than our historic 37% rate due to the tax act. From a non-GAAP perspective for the fourth quarter, net income increased 19.2% to $45.3 million with earnings per share of $0.21 versus $0.17 per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter, up 23.5%.
Our revenue for the 12 months of $1.673 billion, represents a 6.4% growth rate. Income before taxes was $294.5 million, up 13%. And from a GAAP perspective, net income was $179.1 million, an increase of 7%. Earnings per share were $0.82 compared to $0.77 last year, up 6.5%. This total revenue growth is our highest since 2008. From a non-GAAP perspective for the 12 months, net income increased to $190.7 million, up 13.9% from $167.4 million in 2016. Earnings per share were $0.87 compared to $0.77 in 2016, a 13% increase.
Let's take a look at the revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 7.5% included 3.5% from several acquisitions, of which Northwest Exterminating was the largest, and the remaining 4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 41% of our revenue was up 6.9%; commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue was up 5%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue was up 15.6%. The Northwest business contributed to this increase.
Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 4%. From that, residential was up 4.7%, commercial increased 3.9% and termite and ancillary improved by 8.2%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign currency, in total, we grew 7.5%, residential grew 6.7%, commercial pest control was up 4.3% and termite and ancillary improved 16.2%.
As we completed the year, our international operations finished on a high note with strong revenue and profit growth. In Australia, our national presence and excellent service levels have enabled us to be involved with many national level tenders of business. In addition, through our initiatives, we've been able to standardize pricing across the country.
During this past year, Canada expanded margins at the fastest rate in the last several years. In the U.K., the Safeguard name continues to gain recognition and has enabled them to continue a pace of significant growth. As Gary mentioned in his opening, we added 12 new international franchises, to which now totals 81 at the end of 2017. Each of these operations continue to grow in maturity, which enables service level to continue to improve and recurring revenue to grow. 
Our participation last year at the World Pest Day and our upcoming sponsorship of the Global Food Safety Conference in Tokyo, will continue to elevate our brand around the globe.
In total, gross margin was flat to last year at 50% compared to prior year as we incorporated Northwest Exterminating into our company. We experienced good cost control, increasing our gross margin and service salaries as we continue to improve efficiencies and increase productivity from our technicians with the use of BOSS. We witnessed improved margins in administrative salaries as costs remained relatively flat to prior year. And we reduced insurance and claims as we experienced reductions in legal liabilities.
The gains in productivity were offset by increases in materials and supplies, as we spent more on termite product with our revenue growth, [indiscernible] expenses due to gasoline price increase and leased vehicle costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.1 million to $14.9 million, an increase of 8.1%. The depreciation portion has continued to subside with the lapping of BOSS, but the amortization has increased with our M&A activity. Depreciation was $6.9 million, decreasing $53,000 or 0.8% from last year. Amortization was $7.9 million, which increased $1.1 million with amortization of intangible assets increasing due mostly to amortized customer contracts, resulting from the purchase of various Orkin acquisitions throughout the year and Northwest Exterminating.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, decreased $2.6 million or 2.1% compared to the prior year quarter. SG&A decreased to 29.8% of revenues compared to 32.8% for the prior year. The primary driver for the reduction was the onetime tax event to dissolve the subsidiary, Kinro Investment Company, in 2016. The fourth quarter 2016 SG&A expense increased by $9.1 million or $0.06 of a percentage point due to the onetime tax event that was offset by a credit in income tax expense.
Other marginal decreases were to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related expenses. The company experienced increased expense margins in professional services, as we used outside contractors for various projects; maintenance and repair, due to maintenance contracts on various IT upgrades; and fleet expense.
As for our cash position. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, we spent $130.2 million on acquisitions and $122 million on dividends, an increase of 12%. We had $24.7 million capital expenditures, which was down 25.4% from 2016, primarily from the completion of the BOSS project and ended with $107.1 million in cash, down 25% from last year. As a reminder, we used all cash for our acquisition of Northwest Exterminating.
As mentioned in our press release, we anticipate having a significantly lower tax rate for all of 2018. Our historic rate of 37% will be reduced to the mid-20s, and we will see further clarity as we know more details. In addition, as we saw in 2017, our first quarter 2018 rate should be reduced even further due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan. 
At this time, we do not plan to repatriate any cash, but we'll continue to look for opportunity to put this to use in our ongoing international operations and use for expansion opportunities. As far as the tax savings from the lower 2018 rate, we will continue to assess other opportunities related to our business, our shareholders and our employees.
From a business perspective, one way that we will use these savings will be in the area of technology projects. Based on our success in the U.S. with efficiency gains and improved routing and scheduling, we have made the decision to roll out our BOSS technology to Orkin Canada. The development and rollout will take most of 2018 and should contribute in 2019, and this will be a financial event for us in either late 2018 or 2019. We will keep you posted on the impact in future quarters. We are very excited of the possibilities of BOSS -- that BOSS presents for us in Orkin Canada.
And finally from a shareholders perspective, last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on March 9, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business, February 9, 2018. The cash dividend is a 21.7% increase over the prior year. This is the largest percent increase since 2010 and this also marks the 16th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
I would now turn the call back over to Gary."

We also advanced our acquisition strategy, having added Northwest Exterminating, which was discussed in our last call, and several small tuck-in acquisitions. We greatly improved our routing and scheduling capabilities, resulting from the implementation of BOSS and its virtual route management feature. John will elaborate on this shortly.

We are pleased to report that BOSS, our branch operating system, moved to full implementation for Orkin in 2017. And with this system in place, we were able to add the virtual route management software that has begun to improve our technicians' routing and scheduling of their customers. Many of the homes our technicians service are made up of double income households. And as a result, those customers expect reasonable and accurate arrival windows to accommodate their busy schedules. 
It is essential that our technicians are where they are supposed to be, when they are supposed to be there. Scheduling is one of the toughest tasks our people face due to constant and daily changes as new customers begin service or existing customers request an additional service or an appointment change. With the aid of this routing and scheduling tool, we can improve the delivery of services to our customers by being there when they expect and want us to be. At the same time, we are better able to build the most efficient schedules for our daily service. 
Further, this routing and scheduling tool has improved our miles driven, which helps to offset any increase in fuel prices and vehicle-related costs. Our results today show reduction of average miles per stock by half mile. This may not sound like much until you multiply that by the more than 880,000 unique customer visits we perform each month. The 440,000 miles saved both reduces wear and tear on our vehicles and saves our technicians thousands of hours of drive time. This effort also contributes to reduced accidents and lower employee turnover.
But most importantly, it improves our customer experience through better on-time service performance and living up to our promise of being there when we say we will be there. We will continue to move BOSS and the virtual route management capabilities forward and expect to see continued benefits during all of 2018 and beyond.
For those of you that have followed the Rollins story for years, you know that in 2010, we began enjoying revenue growth due to bed bugs. Since that time, we have learned a lot about not only the revenue potential of this pest service but the profitability of our offerings. Our marketing, sales and technical services groups have worked together over the past year to improve this service line, and I am pleased to announce the launch of our commercial ProAct bed bug offering. Orkin Bed Bug ProAct is an innovative, proactive bed bug service developed specifically for the hospitality industry. ProAct creates an ongoing defense against bed bugs in hotel guestrooms that helps reduce the likelihood of costly bed bug infestations and lost customer revenue. The services performed by our trained specialists using residual products that create an effective barrier between service visits, which can now be scheduled as much as 6 months apart. The net takeaway with the ProAct in our testing is it reduces emergency service visits and hotel room down time. 
We pinpointed 3 key benefits of ProAct that are unattainable with conventional bed bug service treatments: peace of mind, budget predictability and reputation management. 91% of the hoteliers reported that they are worried about the impact of bed bug infestations. ProAct lessens the likelihood of an infestation, putting their fears to rest; and because ProAct is an ongoing yearly service, these customers now upfront how much they will spend to prevent bed bugs instead on a more random case-by-case basis. 
Lastly, according to research, bed bug sightings are the number one reason a guest would immediately switch hotels. And the biggest concern for hotel managers is negative word of mouth and reputation damage. By moving to prevent bed bug introductions from growing into an unmanageable infestation, ProAct helps reduce the risk of negative online reviews and unwanted media coverage. We look forward to supporting our hospitality customers with this industry-leading service offering.
I would now like to turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,548383444,1373222,"Rollins, Inc., Q4 2017 Earnings Call, Jan 24, 2018",2018-01-24,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. We ended the year on a positive note with good growth in revenue and earnings in both pest control and termite. While the second half of the year had its challenges, we produced record-setting revenue, income and earnings per share. 2017",1504,"Thank you, John. We ended the year on a positive note with good growth in revenue and earnings in both pest control and termite. While the second half of the year had its challenges, we produced record-setting revenue, income and earnings per share. 2017 was a great transition year related to technology, as John mentioned, and has created a platform for continued improvements at Orkin as well as our other brands.
With the signing of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act law, our tax provision went through some robust Q4 changes. As mentioned in our press release, we will review our numbers from a GAAP and non-GAAP perspective for this quarter and for the full year of 2017.
Fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 results reflect the estimated negative impact of the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in an $11.6 million charge, of which $8 million was from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million was from deferred tax assets, and $700,000 was from changes in tax on stock compensation or $0.06 per diluted share decrease in net income. 
Net income and diluted earnings per share, excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included a significant onetime tax event, fastest growth rate since 2008 and strong international growth and profitability in all countries.
Looking at the numbers, the company reported fourth quarter revenue of $414.7 million, an increase of 7.5% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $385.6 million. Income before income taxes increased 30.5% to $68.5 million from $52.5 million in 2016. In 2016, we had a onetime expense item of $9 million related to our changes in our Canadian tax company. 
Net income was $33.7 million, down 11.2% from $38 million in 2016 and earnings per share were $0.15 for the quarter and $0.17 in 2016. We realized a 50.8% tax rate for the quarter, significantly higher than our historic 37% rate due to the tax act. From a non-GAAP perspective for the fourth quarter, net income increased 19.2% to $45.3 million with earnings per share of $0.21 versus $0.17 per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter, up 23.5%.
Our revenue for the 12 months of $1.673 billion, represents a 6.4% growth rate. Income before taxes was $294.5 million, up 13%. And from a GAAP perspective, net income was $179.1 million, an increase of 7%. Earnings per share were $0.82 compared to $0.77 last year, up 6.5%. This total revenue growth is our highest since 2008. From a non-GAAP perspective for the 12 months, net income increased to $190.7 million, up 13.9% from $167.4 million in 2016. Earnings per share were $0.87 compared to $0.77 in 2016, a 13% increase.
Let's take a look at the revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 7.5% included 3.5% from several acquisitions, of which Northwest Exterminating was the largest, and the remaining 4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 41% of our revenue was up 6.9%; commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue was up 5%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue was up 15.6%. The Northwest business contributed to this increase.
Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 4%. From that, residential was up 4.7%, commercial increased 3.9% and termite and ancillary improved by 8.2%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign currency, in total, we grew 7.5%, residential grew 6.7%, commercial pest control was up 4.3% and termite and ancillary improved 16.2%.
As we completed the year, our international operations finished on a high note with strong revenue and profit growth. In Australia, our national presence and excellent service levels have enabled us to be involved with many national level tenders of business. In addition, through our initiatives, we've been able to standardize pricing across the country.
During this past year, Canada expanded margins at the fastest rate in the last several years. In the U.K., the Safeguard name continues to gain recognition and has enabled them to continue a pace of significant growth. As Gary mentioned in his opening, we added 12 new international franchises, to which now totals 81 at the end of 2017. Each of these operations continue to grow in maturity, which enables service levels to continue to improve and recurring revenue to grow. 
Our participation last year at the World Pest Day and our upcoming sponsorship of the Global Food Safety Conference in Tokyo will continue to elevate our brand around the globe.
In total, gross margin was flat to last year at 50% compared to prior year as we incorporated Northwest Exterminating into our company. We experienced good cost control, increasing our gross margin and service salaries as we continue to improve efficiencies and increase productivity from our technicians with the use of BOSS. We witnessed improved margins in administrative salaries as costs remained relatively flat to prior year. And we reduced insurance and claims as we experienced reductions in legal liabilities.
The gains in productivity were offset by increases in materials and supplies, as we spent more on termite product with our revenue growth, fleet expenses due to gasoline price increase and leased vehicle costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.1 million to $14.9 million, an increase of 8.1%. The depreciation portion has continued to subside with the lapping of BOSS, but the amortization has increased with our M&A activity. Depreciation was $6.9 million, decreasing $53,000 or 0.8% from last year. Amortization was $7.9 million, which increased $1.1 million with amortization of intangible assets increasing due mostly to amortized customer contracts, resulting from the purchase of various Orkin acquisitions throughout the year and Northwest Exterminating.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, decreased $2.6 million or 2.1% compared to the prior year quarter. SG&A decreased to 29.8% of revenues compared to 32.8% for the prior year. The primary driver for the reduction was the onetime tax event to dissolve the subsidiary, Kinro Investment Company in 2016. The fourth quarter 2016 SG&A expense increased by $9.1 million or 0.6 of a percentage point due to the onetime tax event that was offset by a credit in income tax expense.
Other marginal decreases were to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related expenses. The company experienced increased expense margins in professional services, as we used outside contractors for various projects; maintenance and repair, due to maintenance contracts on various IT upgrades; and fleet expense.
As for our cash position. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, we spent $130.2 million on acquisitions and $122 million on dividends, an increase of 12%. We had $24.7 million capital expenditures, which was down 25.4% from 2016, primarily from the completion of the BOSS project and ended with $107.1 million in cash, down 25% from last year. As a reminder, we used all cash for our acquisition of Northwest Exterminating.
As mentioned in our press release, we anticipate having a significantly lower tax rate for all of 2018. Our historic rate of 37% will be reduced to the mid-20s, and we will see further clarity as we know more details. In addition, as we saw in 2017, our first quarter 2018 rate should be reduced even further due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan. 
At this time, we do not plan to repatriate any cash, but we'll continue to look for opportunity to put this to use in our ongoing international operations and use for expansion opportunities. As far as the tax savings from the lower 2018 rate, we will continue to assess other opportunities related to our business, our shareholders and our employees.
From a business perspective, one way that we will use these savings will be in the area of technology projects. Based on our success in the U.S. with efficiency gains and improved routing and scheduling, we have made the decision to roll out our BOSS technology to Orkin Canada. The development and rollout will take most of 2018 and should contribute in 2019, and this will be a financial event for us in either late 2018 or 2019. We will keep you posted on the impact in future quarters. We are very excited of the possibilities of BOSS -- that BOSS presents for us in Orkin Canada.
And finally from a shareholders perspective, last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on March 9, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business, February 9, 2018. The cash dividend is a 21.7% increase over the prior year. This is the largest percent increase since 2010 and this also marks the 16th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
I will now turn the call back over to Gary."

We are pleased to report that BOSS, our branch operating system, moved to full implementation for Orkin in 2017. And with this system in place, we were able to add the virtual route management software that has begun to improve our technicians' routing and scheduling of their customers. Many of the homes our technicians service are made up of double income households. And as a result, those customers expect reasonable and accurate arrival windows to accommodate their busy schedules. 
It is essential that our technicians are where they are supposed to be, when they are supposed to be there. Scheduling is one of the toughest tasks our people face due to constant and daily changes as new customers begin service or existing customers request an additional service or an appointment change. With the aid of this routing and scheduling tool, we can improve the delivery of services to our customers by being there when they expect and want us to be. At the same time, we are better able to build the most efficient schedules for our daily service. 
Further, this routing and scheduling tool has improved our miles driven, which helps to offset any increase in fuel prices and vehicle-related costs. Our results today show reduction of average miles per stock by half mile. This may not sound like much until you multiply that by the more than 880,000 unique customer visits we perform each month. The 440,000 miles saved both reduces wear and tear on our vehicles and saves our technicians thousands of hours of drive time. This effort also contributes to reduced accidents and lower employee turnover.
But most importantly, it improves our customer experience through better on-time service performance and living up to our promise of being there when we say we will be there. We will continue to move BOSS and the virtual route management capabilities forward and expect to see continued benefits during all of 2018 and beyond.
For those of you that have followed the Rollins story for years, you know that in 2010, we began enjoying revenue growth due to bed bugs. Since that time, we have learned a lot about not only the revenue potential of this pest service but the profitability of our offerings. Our marketing, sales and technical services groups have worked together over the past year to improve this service line, and I am pleased to announce the launch of our commercial ProAct bed bug offering. Orkin Bed Bug ProAct is an innovative, proactive bed bug service developed specifically for the hospitality industry. ProAct creates an ongoing defense against bed bugs in hotel guestrooms that helps reduce the likelihood of costly bed bug infestations and lost customer revenue. The services performed by our trained specialists using residual products that create an effective barrier between service visits, which can now be scheduled as much as 6 months apart. The net takeaway with the ProAct in our testing is it reduces emergency service visits and hotel room down time. 
We pinpointed 3 key benefits of ProAct that are unattainable with conventional bed bug service treatments: peace of mind, budget predictability and reputation management. 91% of the hoteliers reported that they are worried about the impact of bed bug infestations. ProAct lessens the likelihood of an infestation, putting their fears to rest; and because ProAct is an ongoing yearly service, these customers now upfront how much they will spend to prevent bed bugs instead on a more random case-by-case basis. 
Lastly, according to research, bed bug sightings are the number one reason a guest would immediately switch hotels. And the biggest concern for hotel managers is negative word of mouth and reputation damage. By moving to prevent bed bug introductions from growing into an unmanageable infestation, ProAct helps reduce the risk of negative online reviews and unwanted media coverage. We look forward to supporting our hospitality customers with this industry-leading service offering.
I would now like to turn the call over to Eddie."

We ended the year on a positive note with good growth in revenue and earnings in both pest control and termite. While the second half of the year had its challenges, we produced record-setting revenue, income and earnings per share. 2017 was a great transition year related to technology, as John mentioned, and has created a platform for continued improvements at Orkin as well as our other brands.
With the signing of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act law, our tax provision went through some robust Q4 changes. As mentioned in our press release, we will review our numbers from a GAAP and non-GAAP perspective for this quarter and for the full year of 2017.
Fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 results reflect the estimated negative impact of the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in an $11.6 million charge, of which $8 million was from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million was from deferred tax assets, and $700,000 was from changes in tax on stock compensation or $0.06 per diluted share decrease in net income. 
Net income and diluted earnings per share, excluding significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included a significant onetime tax event, fastest growth rate since 2008 and strong international growth and profitability in all countries.
Looking at the numbers, the company reported fourth quarter revenue of $414.7 million, an increase of 7.5% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $385.6 million. Income before income taxes increased 30.5% to $68.5 million from $52.5 million in 2016. In 2016, we had a onetime expense item of $9 million related to our changes in our Canadian tax company. 
Net income was $33.7 million, down 11.2% from $38 million in 2016 and earnings per share were $0.15 for the quarter and $0.17 in 2016. We realized a 50.8% tax rate for the quarter, significantly higher than our historic 37% rate due to the tax act. From a non-GAAP perspective for the fourth quarter, net income increased 19.2% to $45.3 million with earnings per share of $0.21 versus $0.17 per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter, up 23.5%.
Our revenue for the 12 months of $1.673 billion, represents a 6.4% growth rate. Income before taxes was $294.5 million, up 13%. And from a GAAP perspective, net income was $179.1 million, an increase of 7%. Earnings per share were $0.82 compared to $0.77 last year, up 6.5%. This total revenue growth is our highest since 2008. From a non-GAAP perspective for the 12 months, net income increased to $190.7 million, up 13.9% from $167.4 million in 2016. Earnings per share were $0.87 compared to $0.77 in 2016, a 13% increase.
Let's take a look at the revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 7.5% included 3.5% from several acquisitions, of which Northwest Exterminating was the largest, and the remaining 4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 41% of our revenue was up 6.9%; commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue was up 5%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue was up 15.6%. The Northwest business contributed to this increase.
Again, total revenue less acquisition was up 4%. From that, residential was up 4.7%, commercial increased 3.9% and termite and ancillary improved by 8.2%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign currency, in total, we grew 7.5%, residential grew 6.7%, commercial pest control was up 4.3% and termite and ancillary improved 16.2%.
As we completed the year, our international operations finished on a high note with strong revenue and profit growth. In Australia, our national presence and excellent service levels have enabled us to be involved with many national level tenders of business. In addition, through our initiatives, we've been able to standardize pricing across the country.
During this past year, Canada expanded margins at the fastest rate in the last several years. In the U.K., the Safeguard name continues to gain recognition and has enabled them to continue a pace of significant growth. As Gary mentioned in his opening, we added 12 new international franchises, to which now totals 81 at the end of 2017. Each of these operations continue to grow in maturity, which enables service levels to continue to improve and recurring revenue to grow. 
Our participation last year at the World Pest Day and our upcoming sponsorship of the Global Food Safety Conference in Tokyo will continue to elevate our brand around the globe.
In total, gross margin was flat to last year at 50% compared to prior year as we incorporated Northwest Exterminating into our company. We experienced good cost control, increasing our gross margin and service salaries as we continue to improve efficiencies and increase productivity from our technicians with the use of BOSS. We witnessed improved margins in administrative salaries as costs remained relatively flat to prior year. And we reduced insurance and claims as we experienced reductions in legal liabilities.
The gains in productivity were offset by increases in materials and supplies, as we spent more on termite product with our revenue growth, fleet expenses due to gasoline price increase and leased vehicle costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter increased $1.1 million to $14.9 million, an increase of 8.1%. The depreciation portion has continued to subside with the lapping of BOSS, but the amortization has increased with our M&A activity. Depreciation was $6.9 million, decreasing $53,000 or 0.8% from last year. Amortization was $7.9 million, which increased $1.1 million with amortization of intangible assets increasing due mostly to amortized customer contracts, resulting from the purchase of various Orkin acquisitions throughout the year and Northwest Exterminating.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, decreased $2.6 million or 2.1% compared to the prior year quarter. SG&A decreased to 29.8% of revenues compared to 32.8% for the prior year. The primary driver for the reduction was the onetime tax event to dissolve the subsidiary, Kinro Investment Company in 2016. The fourth quarter 2016 SG&A expense increased by $9.1 million or 0.6 of a percentage point due to the onetime tax event that was offset by a credit in income tax expense.
Other marginal decreases were to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related expenses. The company experienced increased expense margins in professional services, as we used outside contractors for various projects; maintenance and repair, due to maintenance contracts on various IT upgrades; and fleet expense.
As for our cash position. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, we spent $130.2 million on acquisitions and $122 million on dividends, an increase of 12%. We had $24.7 million capital expenditures, which was down 25.4% from 2016, primarily from the completion of the BOSS project and ended with $107.1 million in cash, down 25% from last year. As a reminder, we used all cash for our acquisition of Northwest Exterminating.
As mentioned in our press release, we anticipate having a significantly lower tax rate for all of 2018. Our historic rate of 37% will be reduced to the mid-20s, and we will see further clarity as we know more details. In addition, as we saw in 2017, our first quarter 2018 rate should be reduced even further due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan. 
At this time, we do not plan to repatriate any cash, but we'll continue to look for opportunity to put this to use in our ongoing international operations and use for expansion opportunities. As far as the tax savings from the lower 2018 rate, we will continue to assess other opportunities related to our business, our shareholders and our employees.
From a business perspective, one way that we will use these savings will be in the area of technology projects. Based on our success in the U.S. with efficiency gains and improved routing and scheduling, we have made the decision to roll out our BOSS technology to Orkin Canada. The development and rollout will take most of 2018 and should contribute in 2019, and this will be a financial event for us in either late 2018 or 2019. We will keep you posted on the impact in future quarters. We are very excited of the possibilities of BOSS -- that BOSS presents for us in Orkin Canada.
And finally from a shareholders perspective, last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on March 9, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business, February 9, 2018. The cash dividend is a 21.7% increase over the prior year. This is the largest percent increase since 2010 and this also marks the 16th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
I will now turn the call back over to Gary."

All of our business lines experienced good growth in the quarter with residential up 8.4%, commercial pest control grew 5.6% and termite and ancillary rose 16.2%.
We are continuing to expand our global footprint and are extremely pleased with the growing international presence for the Orkin brand. We're accomplishing this through both company-owned acquisitions and our extensive and expanding franchise network.
During the quarter, we announced the addition of 4 international franchises in South America, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. All of these locations will offer commercial and residential pest control as well as termite service, where applicable. The Orkin brand is now represented in 53 countries [ through ] 83 international franchises.
In the first quarter, we're also pleased to have acquired 2 additional fine companies in the United Kingdom, Aims Group and Castro Pest Control. Aims, located in Birmingham, has a rich history of providing superior pest control, birth control and specialty services to the commercial customers throughout the Midlands as well as London. [indiscernible] located in the East New Hampshire provides commercial pest control services to customers in Southhampton and the surrounding areas of Southwest England. Castor will ultimately merge with our Safeguard company.
Important to us is both of these companies share our commitment to continuous improvement in making an ongoing investment in training and employee development. We're also pleased that the founders and the leaders of these 2 new companies will remain with Aims and Castro.
As we continue to expand globally, we look for external opportunities to promote our brand. To that end, last month, we were privileged to be a go sponsor of the global foods safety initiatives, TFSI, at the Global Food Safety Conference in Tokyo. This is a unique annual event and brings together the leading food safety specialists from over 50 countries dedicated to advance food safety practices. The organization addresses the entire food chain from production to consumption, or as they like to say, from farm to fork. This year's event had over 1,200 attendees, which was a record, and a number of our existing U.S. customers were represented with our international affiliates. Nestlé, ADM and Land oh Lakes to name a few.
We were representing 2 of our brands at the conference, Orkin and IFC, both leading providers of pest management services to the food industry. We believe that customer engagement is paramount to our success, and this event provided a good opportunity in this regard. Our presence in GFSI conference provided us with a great opportunity to strengthen relationships with existing customers and future prospects. We believe that through participation in events such as this, we will continue to elevate our brand awareness around the globe.
Shifting our focus to the U.S. now, we are also pleased to have announced the acquisition of Louisville, Kentucky's-based OPC Pest Services. This leading pest control company was founded in 1972 by the late Lehman Blake and his sons, Donnie and Terry Blake. I've known Donnie for a long time and [indiscernible] the company he and his family have built. As a result of their hardware, strong customer values and appreciation for every employee's contribution to their company, they are recognized as Kentucky's Premium Pest Management company. We're very excited to partner with them and look forward to working together to grow our business while sharing best practices.
We were especially pleased to announce last week, as a result of the U.S. tax legislation, Rollins will be using part of these tax rate savings to improve our employee benefits. John will review some of these details in a minute. Additionally, we further strengthened our management team during the quarter with the promotion of 3 of our team members who will be expanding their responsibilities with our company.
In January, [ Tom Lazesky ] was elevated to the position of President of Orkin Global Development and international franchises as well as Assistant Corporate Secretary. Since 2007, Tom has presided over the Orkin International Franchising Group and has led the company's expansion to over 53 countries.
In January, we also announced that Beth Chandler, Rollins' General Counsel has been appointed to the position of Corporate Secretary. Beth joined Rollins in 2013 as Vice President and General Counsel. In 2016, she assumed responsibility for the Risk Management Group. And last year, the internal audit group was added to Beth's responsibilities. This moves will provide dynamics between risks, legal and internal audit.
In early March, we were pleased to announce that Julie [indiscernible] was promoted to Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Julie joined Rollins in 2015 as Managing Director of Rollins' Specialty Brands Accounting and was promoted in 2016 to manage the Rollins Finance Department. Previously, she had worked at HomeTeam Pest Defense where she served as Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller. In Julie's new role, she has added Investor Relations and the Rollins' payroll group to her areas of responsibility. Her ascension is a good example of Rollins' benefiting talent wise from these acquisitions. My congratulations and thanks go to these 3 individuals for the contributions they've made and will continue to make to our company.
I'll now turn the call over to John Wilson."

Over the past few months, we have undertaken an extensive review of what actions other companies have taken as a result of the recent U.S. tax code changes. Many companies chose to give employees onetime bonus -- bonuses or similar items that provide a onetime benefit to employees. As a service company though, we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset, and we wanted to do something that would have a longer-term effect for them and their families. We believe our benefit improvements realize that goal. Effective January 1, 2018, we improved the employee match to our 401(k) program. Previously, we matched employee contributions 50% on up to [ 6% ] of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for contributions above 3% up to 6%. As a result of benchmarking with other service companies as well as feedback from our employee survey process, we concluded that an improvement to our pay timeout policies was warranted. Adding one more floating holiday for our team members to use any way they wish was determined to be the best way to make improvements there. Rollins has always maintained a strong commitment to education, and in that spirit, we are increasing the number of scholarship opportunities by 50% for our team members' children. Each scholarship has a value of $12,000 over 4 years.
Last, we will reward our U.S.-based team members with a onetime stock grant of stock in Rollins. These grants recognized tenure and are being given on a tiered basis to employees of 2 to 10 years or more of service. The stock is expected to be granted in May and will invest in 1 year.
During the quarter, we were also pleased to have announced that Rollins and Northwest Pest Control were awarded the 2018 Top Workplaces on Earth by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This was the second consecutive year that Rollins has received this award and the [ seventh ] such award for Northwest. This honor is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measured several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution, leadership and connection.
At our core, we are a customer service company so our track record of success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work at Rollins. To quote [indiscernible] [ Gallo ], VP of Human Resources and President of Rollins Specialty Brands, this recognition challenges us to continually raise the bar. We must strive to improve the work environment and reinforce our culture as we continue to build on our tradition of success.
We were also pleased for Rollins to have been recognized by Training Magazine as a Top 125 Training Company. For 12 years, Rollins has been recognized -- excuse me, for 12 years Orkin has been recognized with this honor. This latest award recognizes all of the Rollins Corporation for the quality, commitment and investment in training our people. According to Training Magazine, the training top 125 ranking is based on a number of benchmarking statistics and is determined by assessing of the range of qualitative and quantitative factors including financial investment and employee development, the scope of development programs and how closely such development efforts are linked to the business goals and objectives.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,557927260,1436030,"Rollins, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. This is truly a transformational time for our company as we see technology continue to mature, achieve record revenue growth and, as John reviewed, we're making industry-leading investments in our employees through enhanced benefits as we",1191,"Thank you, John. This is truly a transformational time for our company as we see technology continue to mature, achieve record revenue growth and, as John reviewed, we're making industry-leading investments in our employees through enhanced benefits as we recognize the difference they make each and every day. [indiscernible] organic growth has been in line with our historical norm, but our overall revenue improvements have been strongly fueled by good quality acquisitions. During the first quarter alone, we had 16 acquisitions for a total of over $40 million. These acquisitions enable us to continue to become more efficient in our business model and will produce sustained growth for years to come.
There are only 2 other times in our company's history that we have seen M&A play such a critical part of our growth, the acquisition of Orkin in 1964 and the acquisition of HomeTeam in 2008. I think we would all agree that these have been -- that these have worked out extremely well for Rollins.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth, and highlights included: Enhancements to our employee benefits program that John discussed, a significant increase in amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions and the strongest commercial revenue growth in the past 5 years.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $408.7 million was an increase of 8.9% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $375.2 million. Income before income taxes increased 3.4% to $59.2 million from $57.3 million in 2017. Net income rose 20.5% to $48.5 million, and earnings per share increased 22.2% to $0.22 per diluted share compared to $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.
There are 2 unusual items that impacted the profit numbers compared to the average quarter. As we noted in our press release last week, the enhanced employee benefits impacted the first quarter by roughly $0.01 and was equated to about $2.3 million. And we would anticipate a similar impact in quarters to come for the remainder of the year. This is a tremendous use of our portion of our tax savings. As John stated, we invest in our greatest asset, our people.
Additionally, the significant number of recent acquisitions increased our amortization for intangible assets for the quarter by 40.8%, which is the highest percent increase since we purchased HomeTeam in 2008. As a comparison, over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been about 5.1%. Compared to last year, the significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by $0.01 or roughly $2 million after tax, and importantly, indicates a tremendous investment for our future. If you exclude these 2 items that are unusual, our income before taxes would have been 10.9% improvement year-over-year and income after taxes would have risen 31.2%.
Let's take a look through the revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 8.9% included 4.2% from several acquisitions, of which Northwest was the largest; and the remaining 4.7% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 8.4%. Commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 5.6%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.2%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over more than the last 5 years, but this first quarter [ this played ] the fastest growth that has occurred during this recent time period. 
Our commercial sales teams continues to improve through a better selection process of people, enhanced training and continued improvements to our key technology, mainly this week, our customer-facing presenting iPod presentation tool. Our commercial operations are performing at the highest levels in the industry, and we see this through retention and new sales, especially in the areas -- the segment areas of hospitality, property management and restaurants. We look forward to continued success in this area.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 4.7% and from that, residential was up 4.2%, commercial increased 4.5% and termite improved 4.2%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of the foreign companies in currency, in total, we grew 8.8%, residential grew 8.3%, commercial pest control was up 4.5% and termite and ancillary improved 16.8%.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was flat to last year at 49.6% for the quarter. The costs related to the enhanced employee benefits impacted the first quarter by 1 percentage point. Additionally, administrative expense was higher with the addition of our multiple acquisitions as well as increasing fleet expenses as gasoline costs were up an average of $0.25 per gallon compared to last year. The quarter benefited from improved efficiencies and routing and scheduling technology, which reduced miles per vehicle by 5% and also helped to lower service salaries as a percent of revenue. Insurance and claims were lower than prior year as a percent of revenue as we reduced our litigated exposure.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the first quarter increased $3.1 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 22.8%. Depreciation increased $300,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases and as mentioned before, amortization of intangible assets increased $2.8 million related to customer contracts included in various acquisitions, which reduced our earnings per share by approximately $0.01 after taxes.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $11.1 million or 9.8% to 30.9% of revenues, up 2/10 of a percentage point from 30.7% for the first quarter last year. The increase in the percent of revenue is due to higher administrative salaries and personnel-related expenses due to acquisitions and food costs due to increased gasoline prices. The increases were partially offset by lower insurance and claims expense due to reduced exposure in litigation.
As for our cash division. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we spent $43.1 million on acquisitions compared to $3 million for the same quarter last year and $30.6 million on dividends, an increase of 22%. We had $6.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 12.5% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition.
We ended the quarter with $84.3 million in cash, down 48.1% from last year. But as a reminder, we used all cash for our acquisition to both Northwest Exterminating and OPT.
As we mentioned on our Q4 call, we anticipate a significantly lower tax rate for 2018. Our Q1 rate of 18% will be the lowest of the year, and we anticipate a rate in the mid-20s for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, the Q1 rate is lower due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan.
Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on June 11, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 10, 2018. This is a 22% increase over the prior year and marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
I will now turn the call back over to Gary."

So all of those things get better when we have a tuck-in acquisition.

Eddie will provide greater detail on the impact of our recently announced enhanced employee benefits, the tax rate changes and the other financial numbers in a few minutes.
All of our business lines experienced good growth in the quarter with residential up 8.4%, commercial pest control grew 5.6% and termite and ancillary rose 16.2%. We are continuing to expand our global footprint and are extremely pleased with the growing international presence for the Orkin brand. We're accomplishing this through both company-owned acquisitions and our extensive and expanding franchise network.
During the quarter, we announced the addition of 4 international franchises in South America, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. All of these locations will offer commercial and residential pest control as well as termite service, where applicable. The Orkin brand is now represented in 53 countries through 83 international franchises.
In the first quarter, we're also pleased to have acquired 2 additional fine companies in the United Kingdom, AMES Group and Kestrel Pest Control. AMES is located in Birmingham, has a rich history of providing superior pest control, bird control and specialty services to the commercial customers throughout the Midlands as well as London. Kestrel is located in the Eastleigh, Hampshire provides commercial pest control services to customers in Southampton and the surrounding areas of Southwest England. Kestrel will ultimately merge with our Safeguard company.
Important to us is both of these companies share our commitment to continuous improvement in making an ongoing investment in training and employee development. We're also pleased that the founders and the leaders of these 2 new companies will remain with AMES and Kestrel.
As we continue to expand globally, we look for external opportunities to promote our brand. To that end, last month, we were privileged to be a  gold sponsor of the Global Food Safety Initiatives, GFSI, at the Global Food Safety Conference in Tokyo. This is a unique annual event and brings together the leading food safety specialists from over 50 countries dedicated to advance food safety practices. The organization addresses the entire food chain from production to consumption, or as they like to say, from farm to fork. This year's event had over 1,200 attendees, which was a record, and a number of our existing U.S. customers were represented with our international affiliates: Nestlé, ADM and Land O'Lakes to name a few.
We were representing 2 of our brands at the conference, Orkin and IFC, both leading providers of pest management services to the food industry. We believe that customer engagement is paramount to our success, and this event provided a good opportunity in this regard. Our presence in GFSI conference provided us with a great opportunity to strengthen relationships with existing customers and future prospects. We believe that through participation in events such as this, we will continue to elevate our brand awareness around the globe.
Shifting our focus to the U.S. now, we are also pleased to have announced the acquisition of Louisville, Kentucky-based OPC Pest Services. This leading pest control company was founded in 1972 by the late Lamon Blake and his sons, Donnie and Terry Blake. I have known Donnie for a long time and have long admired the company he and his family have built. As a result of their hard work, strong customer values and appreciation for every employee's contribution to their company, they are recognized as Kentucky's premier pest management company. We're very excited to partner with them and look forward to working together to grow our business while sharing best practices. 
We were especially pleased to announce last week, as a result of the U.S. tax legislation, Rollins will be using part of these tax rate savings to improve our employee benefits. John will review some of these details in a minute. Additionally, we further strengthened our management team during the quarter with a promotion of 3 of our team members, who will be expanding their responsibilities with our company.
In January, Tom Luczynski was elevated to the position of President of Orkin Global Development and International Franchises as well as Assistant Corporate Secretary. Since 2007, Tom has presided over the Orkin International Franchising Group and has led the company's expansion to over 53 countries.
In January, we also announced that Beth Chandler, Rollins' General Counsel, has been appointed to the position of Corporate Secretary. Beth joined Rollins in 2013 as Vice President and General Counsel. In 2016, she assumed responsibility for the Risk Management Group. And last year, the internal audit group was added to Beth's responsibilities. This moves will provide dynamics between risk, legal and internal audit.
In early March, we're pleased to announce that Julie Bimmerman was promoted to Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Julie joined Rollins in 2015 as Managing Director of Rollins' Specialty Brands Accounting and was promoted in 2016 to manage the Rollins Finance Department.  Previously, she had worked at HomeTeam Pest Defense where she served as Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller. In Julie's new role, she has added Investor Relations and the Rollins' payroll group to her areas of responsibility. Her ascension is a good example of Rollins' benefiting talent-wise from these acquisitions. Our congratulations and thanks go to these 3 individuals for the contributions they've made and will continue to make to our company.
I'll now turn the call over to John Wilson."

Over the past few months, we have undertaken an extensive review of what actions other companies have taken as a result of the recent U.S. tax code changes.

Over the past few months, we have undertaken an extensive review of what actions other companies have taken as a result of the recent U.S. tax code changes. Many companies chose to give employees onetime bonus -- bonuses or similar items that provide a onetime benefit to employees. As a service company though, we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset, and we wanted to do something that would have a longer-term effect for them and their families. We believe our benefit improvements realize that goal. 
Effective January 1, 2018, we improved the employee match to our 401(k) program. Previously, we matched employee contributions 50% on up to 6% of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for contributions above 3% up to 6%. 
As a result of benchmarking with other service companies as well as feedback from our employee survey process, we concluded that an improvement to our paid timeout policies was warranted. Adding one more floating holiday for our team members to use any way they wish was determined to be the best way to make improvements there. 
Rollins has always maintained a strong commitment to education. And in that spirit, we are increasing the number of scholarship opportunities by 50% for our team members' children. Each scholarship has a value of $12,000 over 4 years.
Last, we will reward our U.S.-based team members with a onetime stock grant of stock in Rollins. These grants recognized tenure and are being given on a tiered basis to employees of 2 to 10 years or more of service. The stock is expected to be granted in May and will vest in 1 year.
During the quarter, we were also pleased to have announced that Rollins and Northwest Pest Control were awarded the 2018 Top Workplaces on Earth by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This was the second consecutive year that Rollins has received this award and the seventh such award for Northwest. This honor is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution, leadership and connection.
At our core we are a customer service company, so our track record of success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work at Rollins. To quote Jerry Gahlhoff, VP of Human Resources and President of Rollins Specialty Brands, this recognition challenges us to continually raise the bar. We must strive to improve the work environment and reinforce our culture as we continue to build on our tradition of success.
We were also pleased for Rollins to have been recognized by Training Magazine as a Top 125 Training Company. For 12 years, Rollins has been recognized -- excuse me, for 12 years Orkin has been recognized with this honor. This latest award recognizes all of the Rollins Corporation for the quality, commitment and investment in training our people. According to Training Magazine, the training top 125 ranking is based on a number of benchmarking statistics and is determined by assessing a range of qualitative and quantitative factors including financial investment and employee development, the scope of development programs and how closely such development efforts are linked to the business goals and objectives.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Eddie."

This is truly a transformational time for our company as we see technology continue to mature, achieve record revenue growth and, as John reviewed, we're making industry-leading investments in our employees through enhanced benefits as we",1188,"Thank you, John. This is truly a transformational time for our company as we see technology continue to mature, achieve record revenue growth and, as John reviewed, we're making industry-leading investments in our employees through enhanced benefits as we recognize the difference they make each and every day. 
To support this organic growth has been in line with our historical norm, but our overall revenue improvements have been strongly fueled by good quality acquisitions. During the first quarter alone, we had 16 acquisitions for a total of over $40 million. These acquisitions enable us to continue to become more efficient in our business model and will produce sustained growth for years to come.
There are only 2 other times in our company's history that we have seen M&A play such a critical part of our growth, the acquisition of Orkin in 1964 and the acquisition of HomeTeam in 2008. I think we would all agree that these have been -- that these have worked out extremely well for Rollins.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and highlights included: enhancements to our employee benefits program that John discussed, a significant increase in amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions and the strongest commercial revenue growth in the past 5 years.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $408.7 million was an increase of 8.9% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $375.2 million. Income before income taxes increased 3.4% to $59.2 million from $57.3 million in 2017. Net income rose 20.5% to $48.5 million, and earnings per share increased 22.2% to $0.22 per diluted share compared to $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.
There are 2 unusual items that impacted the profit numbers compared to the average quarter. As we noted in our press release last week, the enhanced employee benefits impacted the first quarter by roughly $0.01 and was equated to about $2.3 million, and we would anticipate a similar impact in quarters to come for the remainder of the year. This is a tremendous use of our portion of our tax savings. As John stated, we invest in our greatest asset, our people.
Additionally, the significant number of recent acquisitions increased our amortization for intangible assets for the quarter by 40.8%, which is the highest percent increase since we purchased HomeTeam in 2008. As a comparison, over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been about 5.1%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by $0.01, or roughly $2 million after tax, and importantly, indicates a tremendous investment for our future. If you exclude these 2 items that are unusual, our income before taxes would have been 10.9% improvement year-over-year and income after taxes would have risen 31.2%.
Let's take a look through the revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 8.9% included 4.2% from several acquisitions, of which Northwest was the largest, and the remaining 4.7% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 8.4%.; commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 5.6%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.2%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over more than the last 5 years, but this first quarter displayed the fastest growth that has occurred during this recent time period. 
Our commercial sales teams continues to improve through a better selection process of people, enhanced training and continued improvements to our key technology, namely Biz Suite, our customer-facing presenting iPad presentation tool. Our commercial operations are performing at the highest levels in the industry, and we see this through retention and new sales, especially in the areas -- the segment areas of hospitality, property management and restaurants. We look forward to continued success in this area.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 4.7%. And from that, residential was up 4.2%, commercial increased 4.5% and termite improved 4.2%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of the foreign companies in currency, in total we grew 8.8%, residential grew 8.3%, commercial pest control was up 4.5% and termite and ancillary improved 16.8%.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was flat to last year at 49.6% for the quarter. The costs related to the enhanced employee benefits impacted the first quarter by 1 percentage point. Additionally, administrative expense was higher with the addition of our multiple acquisitions as well as increasing fleet expenses as gasoline costs were up an average of $0.25 per gallon compared to last year. 
The quarter benefited from improved efficiencies and routing and scheduling technology, which reduced miles per vehicle by 5%, and also helped to lower service salaries as a percent of revenue. Insurance and claims were lower than prior year as a percent of revenue as we reduced our litigated exposure.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the first quarter increased $3.1 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 22.8%. Depreciation increased $300,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases. And as mentioned before, amortization of intangible assets increased $2.8 million related to customer contracts included in various acquisitions, which reduced our earnings per share by approximately $0.01 after taxes.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $11.1 million or 9.8% to 30.9% of revenues, up 0.2 percentage point from 30.7% for the first quarter last year. The increase in the percent of revenue is due to higher administrative salaries and personnel-related expenses due to acquisitions and fleet costs due to increased gasoline prices. The increases were partially offset by lower insurance and claims expense due to reduced exposure in litigation.
As for our cash position. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we spent $43.1 million on acquisitions compared to $3 million for the same quarter last year and $30.6 million on dividends, an increase of 22%. We had $6.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 12.5% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with $84.3 million in cash, down 48.1% from last year. But as a reminder, we used all cash for our acquisition of both Northwest Exterminating and OPC.
As we mentioned on our Q4 call, we anticipate a significantly lower tax rate for 2018. Our Q1 rate of 18% will be the lowest of the year, and we anticipate a rate in the mid-20s for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, the Q1 rate is lower due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan.
Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on June 11, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 10, 2018. This is a 22% increase over the prior year and marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
I will now turn the call back over to Gary."

And at that point in time, we were able to tremendously positively improve the efficiency that the density becomes better overnight. So all of those things get better when we have a tuck-in acquisition. For us in total, this quarter, with 16 total acquisitions, and I would say 12 to 13 of those were relatively tuck-in acquisitions. However, the others, the names that you've mentioned there, such as the Northwest or OPC, we run those as standalone brand. We see the value in the company that we bought. And we typically buy companies that are growing at a faster rate than our overall growth rate, which both Northwest and OPC are. And frankly, they're doing a good job doing what they're doing. So we're just going to share with them the benefits of opportunities and services, the buffet of opportunities and services that we have as an organization. We want to learn from them. We want to steal their good people like we've done with Julie, bringing her onto our team, such as we have with Jerry Gahlhoff, bringing him onto our team to do more. So there's a lot of other things that happened with that.

As it becomes more sophisticated, you've got to rely more on technology. And I think that's the turning point. I think the values that they're getting today versus 2 years ago, they're getting more [indiscernible]. So that's been motivating some of the people that when they see the market improve as far as values are concerned, if they're on the fence, that's kind of the nudge that takes place to cause them to consider disposing of the business.

We are continuing to expand our global footprint and are extremely pleased with the growing international presence for the Orkin brand. We're accomplishing this through both company-owned acquisitions and our extensive and expanding franchise network.
During the quarter, we announced the addition of 4 international franchises in South America, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. All of these locations will offer commercial and residential pest control as well as termite service, where applicable. The Orkin brand is now represented in 53 countries through 83 international franchises.
In the first quarter, we're also pleased to have acquired 2 additional fine companies in the United Kingdom, AMES Group and Kestrel Pest Control. AMES, located in Birmingham, has a rich history of providing superior pest control, bird control and specialty services to the commercial customers throughout the Midlands as well as London. Kestrel, located in the Eastleigh, Hampshire provides commercial pest control services to customers in Southampton and the surrounding areas of Southwest England. Kestrel will ultimately merge with our Safeguard company.
Important to us is both of these companies share our commitment to continuous improvement in making an ongoing investment in training and employee development. We're also pleased that the founders and the leaders of these 2 new companies will remain with AMES and Kestrel.
As we continue to expand globally, we look for external opportunities to promote our brand. To that end, last month, we were privileged to be a  gold sponsor of the Global Food Safety Initiatives, GFSI, at the Global Food Safety Conference in Tokyo. This is a unique annual event and brings together the leading food safety specialists from over 50 countries dedicated to advance food safety practices. The organization addresses the entire food chain from production to consumption, or as they like to say, from farm to fork. This year's event had over 1,200 attendees, which was a record, and a number of our existing U.S. customers were represented with our international affiliates: Nestlé, ADM and Land O'Lakes, to name a few.
We were representing 2 of our brands at the conference, Orkin and IFC, both leading providers of pest management services to the food industry. We believe that customer engagement is paramount to our success, and this event provided a good opportunity in this regard. Our presence in GFSI conference provided us with a great opportunity to strengthen relationships with existing customers and future prospects. We believe that through participation in events such as this, we will continue to elevate our brand awareness around the globe.
Shifting our focus to the U.S. now, we are also pleased to have announced the acquisition of Louisville, Kentucky-based OPC Pest Services. This leading pest control company was founded in 1972 by the late Lamon Blake and his sons, Donnie and Terry Blake. I have known Donnie for a long time and have long admired the company he and his family have built. As a result of their hard work, strong customer values and appreciation for every employee's contribution to their company, they are recognized as Kentucky's premier pest management company. We're very excited to partner with them and look forward to working together to grow our business while sharing best practices. 
We were especially pleased to announce last week, as a result of the U.S. tax legislation, Rollins will be using part of these tax rate savings to improve our employee benefits. John will review some of these details in a minute. Additionally, we further strengthened our management team during the quarter with a promotion of 3 of our team members, who will be expanding their responsibilities with our company.
In January, Tom Luczynski was elevated to the position of President of Orkin Global Development and International Franchises as well as Assistant Corporate Secretary. Since 2007, Tom has presided over the Orkin International Franchising Group and has led the company's expansion to over 53 countries.
In January, we also announced that Beth Chandler, Rollins' General Counsel, has been appointed to the position of Corporate Secretary. Beth joined Rollins in 2013 as Vice President and General Counsel. In 2016, she assumed responsibility for the Risk Management Group. And last year, the internal audit group was added to Beth's responsibilities. These moves will provide dynamics between risk, legal and internal audit.
In early March, we're pleased to announce that Julie Bimmerman was promoted to Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Julie joined Rollins in 2015 as Managing Director of Rollins' Specialty Brands Accounting and was promoted in 2016 to manage the Rollins' Finance Department.  Previously, she had worked at HomeTeam Pest Defense, where she served as Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller. In Julie's new role, she has added Investor Relations and the Rollins' payroll group to her areas of responsibility. Her ascension is a good example of Rollins' benefiting talent-wise from these acquisitions. Our congratulations and thanks go to these 3 individuals for the contributions they've made and will continue to make to our company.
I'll now turn the call over to John Wilson."

Over the past few months, we have undertaken an extensive review of what actions other companies have taken as a result of the recent U.S. tax code changes. Many companies chose to give employees onetime bonus -- bonuses or similar items that provide a onetime benefit to employees. As a service company though, we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset, and we wanted to do something that would have a longer-term effect for them and their families. We believe our benefit improvements realize that goal. 
Effective January 1, 2018, we improved the employee match to our 401(k) program. Previously, we matched employee contributions 50%, on up to 6% of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for contributions above 3%, up to 6%. 
As a result of benchmarking with other service companies as well as feedback from our employee survey process, we concluded that an improvement to our paid time off policies was warranted. Adding one more floating holiday for our team members to use any way they wish was determined to be the best way to make improvements there. 
Rollins has always maintained a strong commitment to education. And in that spirit, we are increasing the number of scholarship opportunities by 50% for our team members' children. Each scholarship has a value of $12,000 over 4 years.
Last, we will reward our U.S.-based team members with a onetime stock grant of stock in Rollins. These grants recognized tenure and are being given on a tiered basis to employees of 2 to 10 years or more of service. The stock is expected to be granted in May and will vest in 1 year.
During the quarter, we were also pleased to have announced that Rollins and Northwest Pest Control were awarded the 2018 Top Workplaces honored by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This was the second consecutive year that Rollins has received this award and the seventh such award for Northwest. This honor is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution, leadership and connection.
At our core we are a customer service company, so our track record of success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work at Rollins. To quote Jerry Gahlhoff, VP of Human Resources and President of Rollins Specialty Brands, this recognition challenges us to continually raise the bar. We must strive to improve the work environment and reinforce our culture as we continue to build on our tradition of success.
We were also pleased for Rollins to have been recognized by Training Magazine as a Top 125 Training Company. For 12 years, Rollins has been recognized -- excuse me, for 12 years, Orkin has been recognized with this honor. This latest award recognizes all of the Rollins Corporation for the quality, commitment and investment in training our people. According to Training Magazine, the training top 125 ranking is based on a number of benchmarking statistics and is determined by assessing a range of qualitative and quantitative factors, including financial investment in employee development, the scope of development programs and how closely such development efforts are linked to the business goals and objectives.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,557927260,1436600,"Rollins, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. This is truly a transformational time for our company as we see technology continue to mature, achieve record revenue growth and, as John reviewed, we're making industry-leading investments in our employees through enhanced benefits as we",1187,"Thank you, John. This is truly a transformational time for our company as we see technology continue to mature, achieve record revenue growth and, as John reviewed, we're making industry-leading investments in our employees through enhanced benefits as we recognize the difference they make each and every day. 
The quarters' organic growth have been in line with our historical norm, but our overall revenue improvements have been strongly fueled by good quality acquisitions. During the first quarter alone, we had 16 acquisitions for a total of over $40 million. These acquisitions enable us to continue to become more efficient in our business model and will produce sustained growth for years to come.
There are only 2 other times in our company's history that we have seen M&A play such a critical part of our growth, the acquisition of Orkin in 1964 and the acquisition of HomeTeam in 2008. I think we would all agree that these have been -- that these have worked out extremely well for Rollins.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and highlights included: enhancements to our employee benefits program that John discussed, a significant increase in amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions and the strongest commercial revenue growth in the past 5 years.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $408.7 million was an increase of 8.9% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $375.2 million. Income before income taxes increased 3.4% to $59.2 million from $57.3 million in 2017. Net income rose 20.5% to $48.5 million, and earnings per share increased 22.2% to $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.
There are 2 unusual items that impacted the profit numbers compared to the average quarter. As we noted in our press release last week, the enhanced employee benefits impacted the first quarter by roughly $0.01 and was equated to about $2.3 million, and we would anticipate a similar impact in quarters to come for the remainder of the year. This is a tremendous use of our portion of our tax savings. As John stated, we invest in our greatest asset, our people.
Additionally, the significant number of recent acquisitions increased our amortization for intangible assets for the quarter by 40.8%, which is the highest percent increase since we purchased HomeTeam in 2008. As a comparison, over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been about 5.1%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by $0.01, or roughly $2 million after tax, and importantly, indicates a tremendous investment for our future. If you exclude these 2 items that are unusual, our income before taxes would have been 10.9% improvement year-over-year and income after taxes would have risen 31.2%.
Let's take a look through the revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 8.9% included 4.2% from several acquisitions, of which Northwest was the largest, and the remaining 4.7% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 8.4%; commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 5.6%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.2%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over more than the last 5 years, but this first quarter displayed the fastest growth that has occurred during this recent time period. 
Our commercial sales team continues to improve through a better selection process of people, enhanced training and continued improvements to our key technology, namely Biz Suite, our customer-facing presenting iPad presentation tool. Our commercial operations are performing at the highest levels in the industry, and we see this through retention and new sales, especially in the areas -- the segment areas of hospitality, property management and restaurants. We look forward to continued success in this area.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 4.7%. And from that, residential was up 4.2%, commercial increased 4.5% and termite improved 4.2%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of the foreign companies in currency, in total we grew 8.8%, residential grew 8.3%, commercial pest control was up 4.5% and termite and ancillary improved 16.8%.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was flat to last year at 49.6% for the quarter. The costs related to the enhanced employee benefits impacted the first quarter by 1 percentage point. Additionally, administrative expense was higher with the addition of our multiple acquisitions as well as increasing fleet expenses as gasoline costs were up an average of $0.25 per gallon compared to last year. 
The quarter benefited from improved efficiencies and routing and scheduling technology, which reduced miles per vehicle by 5%, and also helped to lower service salaries as a percent of revenue. Insurance and claims were lower than prior year as a percent of revenue as we reduced our litigated exposure.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the first quarter increased $3.1 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 22.8%. Depreciation increased $300,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases. And as mentioned before, amortization of intangible assets increased $2.8 million related to customer contracts included in various acquisitions, which reduced our earnings per share by approximately $0.01 after taxes.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $11.1 million or 9.8% to 30.9% of revenues, up 0.2 percentage point from 30.7% for the first quarter last year. The increase in the percent of revenue is due to higher administrative salaries and personnel-related expenses due to acquisitions and fleet costs due to increased gasoline prices. The increases were partially offset by lower insurance and claims expense due to reduced exposure in litigation.
As for our cash position. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we spent $43.1 million on acquisitions, compared to $3 million for the same quarter last year and $30.6 million on dividends, an increase of 22%. We had $6.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 12.5% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with $84.3 million in cash, down 48.1% from last year. But as a reminder, we used all cash for our acquisition of both Northwest Exterminating and OPC.
As we mentioned on our Q4 call, we anticipate a significantly lower tax rate for 2018. Our Q1 rate of 18% will be the lowest of the year, and we anticipate a rate in the mid-20s for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, the Q1 rate is lower due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan.
Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on June 11, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 10, 2018. This is a 22% increase over the prior year and marks the 17th consecutive year the board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
I will now turn the call back over to Gary."

For us in total, this quarter, with 16 total acquisitions, and I would say 12 to 13 of those were relatively tuck-in acquisitions. However, the others, the names that you've mentioned there, such as a Northwest or an OPC, we run those as standalone brand. We see the value in the company that we bought.

We want to steal their good people like we've done with Julie, bringing her onto our team, such as we have with Jerry Gahlhoff, bringing him onto our team to do more. So there's a lot of other things that happened with that. But as far as density and efficiency and improvement of margin, the tuck-in acquisitions are going to continue to be able to provide that opportunity. Did that answer your question?"

We've been very fortunate that we've been able to keep a lot of the principals and the leaders with the company -- their company. Business has gotten more complicated as far as heavy investment in IT, a heavy investment in digital and the Internet. And some of the companies are really kind of frightened by that. As they become more sophisticated, you've got to rely more on technology. And I think that's the turning point for them. I think the values that they're getting today versus 2 years ago, they're getting more [ multiples ]. So that's been motivating some of the people that when they see the market improve as far as values are concerned, if they're on the fence, that's kind of the nudge that takes place to cause them to consider disposing of the business. And we've got a wonderful reputation and that the people stay with us, and that's not the case in most of the other folks that we're competing with. The retention of our people we acquired -- the promotions that the acquired are getting has really, I think, driven a lot of these great companies in our direction, and we're fortunate with that."

Eddie will provide greater detail on the impact of our recently announced enhanced employee benefits, the tax rate changes and the other financial numbers in a few minutes.
All of our business lines experienced good growth in the quarter, with residential up 8.4%, commercial pest control grew 5.6% and termite and ancillary rose 16.2%. We are continuing to expand our global footprint and are extremely pleased with the growing international presence for the Orkin brand. We're accomplishing this through both company-owned acquisitions and our extensive and expanding franchise network.
During the quarter, we announced the addition of 4 international franchises in South America, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. All of these locations will offer commercial and residential pest control as well as termite service, where applicable. The Orkin brand is now represented in 53 countries through 83 international franchises.
In the first quarter, we're also pleased to have acquired 2 additional fine companies in the United Kingdom, AMES Group and Kestrel Pest Control. AMES, located in Birmingham, has a rich history of providing superior pest control, bird control and specialty services to the commercial customers throughout the Midlands as well as London. Kestrel, located in the Eastleigh, Hampshire provides commercial pest control services to customers in Southampton and the surrounding areas of Southwest England. Kestrel will ultimately merge with our Safeguard company.
Important to us is both of these companies share our commitment to continuous improvement in making an ongoing investment in training and employee development. We're also pleased that the founders and the leaders of these 2 new companies will remain with AMES and Kestrel.
As we continue to expand globally, we look for external opportunities to promote our brand. To that end, last month, we were privileged to be a  gold sponsor of the Global Food Safety Initiatives, GFSI, at the Global Food Safety Conference in Tokyo. This is a unique annual event and brings together the leading food safety specialists from over 50 countries dedicated to advance food safety practices. The organization addresses the entire food chain from production to consumption, or as they like to say, from farm to fork. This year's event had over 1,200 attendees, which was a record, and a number of our existing U.S. customers were represented with our international affiliates: Nestlé, ADM and Land O'Lakes, to name a few.
We were representing 2 of our brands at the conference, Orkin and IFC, both leading providers of pest management services to the food industry. We believe that customer engagement is paramount to our success, and this event provided a good opportunity in this regard. Our presence in GFSI conference provided us with a great opportunity to strengthen relationships with existing customers and future prospects. We believe that through participation in events such as this, we will continue to elevate our brand awareness around the globe.
Shifting our focus to the U.S. now, we are also pleased to have announced the acquisition of Louisville, Kentucky-based OPC Pest Services. This leading pest control company was founded in 1972 by the late Lamon Blake and his sons, Donnie and Terry Blake. I have known Donnie for a long time and have long admired the company he and his family have built. As a result of their hard work, strong customer values and appreciation for every employee's contribution to their company, they are recognized as Kentucky's premier pest management company. We're very excited to partner with them and look forward to working together to grow our business while sharing best practices. 
We were especially pleased to announce last week, as a result of the U.S. tax legislation, Rollins will be using part of these tax rate savings to improve our employee benefits. John will review some of these details in a minute. Additionally, we further strengthened our management team during the quarter with a promotion of 3 of our team members, who will be expanding their responsibilities with our company.
In January, Tom Luczynski was elevated to the position of President of Orkin Global Development and International Franchises as well as Assistant Corporate Secretary. Since 2007, Tom has presided over the Orkin International Franchising Group and has led the company's expansion to over 53 countries.
In January, we also announced that Beth Chandler, Rollins' General Counsel, has been appointed to the position of Corporate Secretary. Beth joined Rollins in 2013 as Vice President and General Counsel. In 2016, she assumed responsibility for the Risk Management Group. And last year, the internal audit group was added to Beth's responsibilities. These moves will provide dynamics between risk, legal and internal audit.
In early March, we're pleased to announce that Julie Bimmerman was promoted to Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Julie joined Rollins in 2015 as Managing Director of Rollins' Specialty Brands Accounting and was promoted in 2016 to manage the Rollins' Finance Department.  Previously, she had worked at HomeTeam Pest Defense, where she served as Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller. In Julie's new role, she has added Investor Relations and the Rollins' payroll group to her areas of responsibility. Her ascension is a good example of Rollins' benefiting talent-wise from these acquisitions. Our congratulations and thanks go to these 3 individuals for the contributions they've made and will continue to make to our company.
I'll now turn the call over to John Wilson."

Over the past few months, we have undertaken an extensive review of what actions other companies have taken as a result of the recent U.S. tax code changes. Many companies chose to give employees onetime bonus -- bonuses or similar items that provide a onetime benefit to employees. As a service company though, we have long recognized that our employees are our most important asset, and we wanted to do something that would have a longer-term effect for them and their families. We believe our benefit improvements realize that goal. 
Effective January 1, 2018, we improved the employee match to our 401(k) program. Previously, we matched employee contributions 50%, on up to 6% of their contribution. We now match 100% on the first 3% of their contribution and 50% for contributions above 3%, up to 6%. 
As a result of benchmarking with other service companies as well as feedback from our employee survey process, we concluded that an improvement to our paid time off policies was warranted. Adding one more floating holiday for our team members to use any way they wish was determined to be the best way to make improvements there. 
Rollins has always maintained a strong commitment to education. And in that spirit, we are increasing the number of scholarship opportunities by 50% for our team members' children. Each scholarship has a value of $12,000 over 4 years.
Last, we will reward our U.S.-based team members with a onetime stock grant of stock in Rollins. These grants recognized tenure and are being given on a tiered basis to employees of 2 to 10 years or more of service. The stock is expected to be granted in May and will vest in 1 year.
During the quarter, we were also pleased to have announced that Rollins and Northwest Pest Control were awarded the 2018 Top Workplaces honored by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This was the second consecutive year that Rollins has received this award and the seventh such award for Northwest. This honor is based solely on employee satisfaction and engagement feedback gathered through a third-party survey. The survey measures several aspects of workplace culture, including alignment, execution, leadership and connection.
At our core we are a customer service company, so our track record of success is a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and caring people that work at Rollins. To quote Jerry Gahlhoff, VP of Human Resources and President of Rollins Specialty Brands, this recognition challenges us to continually raise the bar. We must strive to improve the work environment and reinforce our culture as we continue to build on our tradition of success.
We were also pleased for Rollins to have been recognized by Training Magazine as a Top 125 Training Company. For 12 years, Rollins has been recognized -- excuse me, for 12 years, Orkin has been recognized with this honor. This latest award recognizes all of the Rollins Corporation for the quality, commitment and investment in training our people. According to Training Magazine, the training top 125 ranking is based on a number of benchmarking statistics and is determined by assessing a range of qualitative and quantitative factors, including financial investment in employee development, the scope of development programs and how closely such development efforts are linked to the business goals and objectives.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,557927260,1437172,"Rollins, Inc., Q1 2018 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2018",2018-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. This is truly a transformational time for our company as we see technology continue to mature, achieve record revenue growth and, as John reviewed, we're making industry-leading investments in our employees through enhanced benefits as we",1187,"Thank you, John. This is truly a transformational time for our company as we see technology continue to mature, achieve record revenue growth and, as John reviewed, we're making industry-leading investments in our employees through enhanced benefits as we recognize the difference they make each and every day. 
The quarters' organic growth have been in line with our historical norm, but our overall revenue improvements have been strongly fueled by good quality acquisitions. During the first quarter alone, we had 16 acquisitions for a total of over $40 million. These acquisitions enable us to continue to become more efficient in our business model and will produce sustained growth for years to come.
There are only 2 other times in our company's history that we have seen M&A play such a critical part of our growth, the acquisition of Orkin in 1964 and the acquisition of HomeTeam in 2008. I think we would all agree that these have been -- that these have worked out extremely well for Rollins.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth and highlights included: enhancements to our employee benefits program that John discussed, a significant increase in amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions and the strongest commercial revenue growth in the past 5 years.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $408.7 million was an increase of 8.9% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $375.2 million. Income before income taxes increased 3.4% to $59.2 million from $57.3 million in 2017. Net income rose 20.5% to $48.5 million, and earnings per share increased 22.2% to $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.
There are 2 unusual items that impacted the profit numbers compared to the average quarter. As we noted in our press release last week, the enhanced employee benefits impacted the first quarter by roughly $0.01 and was equated to about $2.3 million, and we would anticipate a similar impact in quarters to come for the remainder of the year. This is a tremendous use of our portion of our tax savings. As John stated, we invest in our greatest asset, our people.
Additionally, the significant number of recent acquisitions increased our amortization for intangible assets for the quarter by 40.8%, which is the highest percent increase since we purchased HomeTeam in 2008. As a comparison, over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been about 5.1%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by $0.01, or roughly $2 million after tax, and importantly, indicates a tremendous investment for our future. If you exclude these 2 items that are unusual, our income before taxes would have been 10.9% improvement year-over-year and income after taxes would have risen 31.2%.
Let's take a look through the revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 8.9% included 4.2% from several acquisitions, of which Northwest was the largest, and the remaining 4.7% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 8.4%; commercial pest control, which made up 40% of our revenue, was up 5.6%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.2%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over more than the last 5 years, but this first quarter displayed the fastest growth that has occurred during this recent time period. 
Our commercial sales team continues to improve through a better selection process of people, enhanced training and continued improvements to our key technology, namely Biz Suite, our customer-facing presenting iPad presentation tool. Our commercial operations are performing at the highest levels in the industry, and we see this through retention and new sales, especially in the areas -- the segment areas of hospitality, property management and restaurants. We look forward to continued success in this area.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 4.7%. And from that, residential was up 4.2%, commercial increased 4.5% and termite improved 4.2%. When you take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of the foreign companies in currency, in total we grew 8.8%, residential grew 8.3%, commercial pest control was up 4.5% and termite and ancillary improved 16.8%.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was flat to last year at 49.6% for the quarter. The costs related to the enhanced employee benefits impacted the first quarter by 1 percentage point. Additionally, administrative expense was higher with the addition of our multiple acquisitions as well as increasing fleet expenses as gasoline costs were up an average of $0.25 per gallon compared to last year. 
The quarter benefited from improved efficiencies and routing and scheduling technology, which reduced miles per vehicle by 5%, and also helped to lower service salaries as a percent of revenue. Insurance and claims were lower than prior year as a percent of revenue as we reduced our litigated exposure.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the first quarter increased $3.1 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 22.8%. Depreciation increased $300,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases. And as mentioned before, amortization of intangible assets increased $2.8 million related to customer contracts included in various acquisitions, which reduced our earnings per share by approximately $0.01 after taxes.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $11.1 million or 9.8% to 30.9% of revenues, up 0.2 percentage point from 30.7% for the first quarter last year. The increase in the percent of revenue is due to higher administrative salaries and personnel-related expenses due to acquisitions and fleet costs due to increased gasoline prices. The increases were partially offset by lower insurance and claims expense due to reduced exposure in litigation.
As for our cash position. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we spent $43.1 million on acquisitions, compared to $3 million for the same quarter last year and $30.6 million on dividends, an increase of 22%. We had $6.1 million of capital expenditures, which was up 12.5% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with $84.3 million in cash, down 48.1% from last year. But as a reminder, we used all cash for our acquisition of both Northwest Exterminating and OPC.
As we mentioned on our Q4 call, we anticipate a significantly lower tax rate for 2018. Our Q1 rate of 18% will be the lowest of the year, and we anticipate a rate in the mid-20s for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, the Q1 rate is lower due to the impact of the stock-based compensation plan.
Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on June 11, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 10, 2018.

And at that point in time, we were able to tremendously positively improve the efficiency, the density becomes better overnight. So all of those things get better when we have a tuck-in acquisition. For us in total, this quarter, with 16 total acquisitions, and I would say 12 to 13 of those were relatively tuck-in acquisitions. However, the others, the names that you've mentioned there, such as a Northwest or an OPC, we run those as standalone brand. We see the value in the company that we bought. And we typically buy companies that are growing at a faster rate than our overall growth rate, which both Northwest and OPC are. And frankly, they're doing a good job doing what they're doing. So we're just going to share with them the benefits of opportunities and services, the buffet of opportunities and services that we have as an organization. We want to learn from them. We want to steal their good people like we've done with Julie, bringing her onto our team, such as we have with Jerry Gahlhoff, bringing him onto our team to do more. So there's a lot of other things that happened with that.

As they become more sophisticated, you've got to rely more on technology. And I think that's the turning point for them. I think the values that they're getting today versus 2 years ago, they're getting more [ multiples ]. So that's been motivating some of the people that when they see the market improve as far as values are concerned, if they're on the fence, that's kind of the nudge that takes place to cause them to consider disposing of the business.

We are very pleased to report our 49th consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. For the quarter, our revenues grew 10.8% to $480.5 million compared to $433.6 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 21.1%",612,"Thank you, Eddie. We are very pleased to report our 49th consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. For the quarter, our revenues grew 10.8% to $480.5 million compared to $433.6 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 21.1% to $65 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $53.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. Revenues for the first 6 months rose 9.9% to $889.2 million compared to $808.8 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 20.9% to approximately $113.6 million, with earnings per share of $0.52 per diluted share compared to $94 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the same period last year.
We experienced good growth in all of our business lines, with residential up 11.6%, commercial pest control grew 6%, and termite and ancillary services rose 16.9%. Eddie will provide a greater detail on our financial results in a few moments. I'm extremely pleased with the expansion that we continued to make with our global footprint. During the quarter, we made 2 significant acquisitions in this regard. In May, we acquired Guardian Pest Control in the United Kingdom. Guardian was founded in 2002, and is a well-recognized for its pest control services, air disease control, and hygiene services. These services are provided to commercial customers throughout the U.K. and Midlands. This acquisition, the fourth in the U.K., will help us to expand our footprint within this country. As in the past, we look forward to sharing best practices with one another. On July 2nd, we marked another important company milestone having closed on the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare. Our first company owned acquisition in Singapore, founded in 1997, Aardwolf is a highly regarded company and known for a superior pest control and services to both residential and commercial customers. And selected department with Rollins, founders John, shared that it has taken them 3 years to find the company that have the same business philosophy that they had. Both of our company share a commitment to quality service and care for employees. We're most pleased that Dr. Chang will remain in a leadership role, and we look forward to working with him and his fine team with a goal of becoming the dominant pest control provider in Singapore.
The landmark acquisition expands our residents now into 54 countries worldwide. John will provide greater details on those acquisitions. We received an overwhelmingly positive response from our employees resulting from the tax-related benefit improvements announced last quarter. If you recall, we granted Rollins stock to over 7,000 employees based on tenure with the company. This was a onetime charge for the second quarter P&L. On a going forward basis, our 401(k) plan was improved, which benefited all participating employees. This was complimented by an additional floating holiday and an enhanced college scholarship program. Investing in our people is always beneficial and critical to our mission to become the world's best service company. 
Before turning the call over to John, I'd also like to acknowledge HomeTeam's receiving for the seventh time in a row weekly highly partners of quality award. David Weekly Homes is the largest privately in the country. Implementing its rigorous supply feedback platform is a way to measure world-class vendor excellence, and demonstrate their commitment to partner with our suppliers believing that when a partner improves its relationship with them, they both become better providers in the marketplace. HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekly Homes at 13 cities where they conduct. This award confirms HomeTeam's commitment to providing exceptional service to its business partner. I'd now like to turn the call over to John."

However, I'm pleased to report that our brand",920,"Thank you, Gary. I'm often asked about the whether the title and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached low not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report that our brands are dealing fairly well with this issue. We believe the strength of our various brands recognition and their reputation has helped, evidenced by the volume of applicants we continued to get for employment opportunities at Rollins companies. Through the first half of this year, our number of applicants per job opening was similar to a year ago. And for March and April, when unemployment figures at their lowest, our applicant flow remain comparable to 2017 levels as well. That said, we recognized a strong applicant flow is not enough. We also have to ensure that our hiring processes are efficient and that we select the right people. Towards that end, we have made a few changes to our assessment tools and preemployment screening processes to reduce the time it takes to get someone on board and begin their training programs. Any reduction in time we can implement our own these processes reduces the risk that we lose a good candidate to some other employer. Most importantly, it allows us to hard and ultimately choose well. One of the most important ways we do that is by having our top job candidates complete what we call an observation day, where the candidate spends time time shadowing one of our top employees who performs really well in the same type of work. This helps the candidate to decide whether the work we do in our company is a good fit for them. We get to see how they interact with coworkers and they're likely would it will fit into the team. this additional step also helps to ensure we select the best people. One-off other animated taking the time for observation period is that it keeps the candidate engaged and active in the process, and gives our managers a bit more time to check background and references on their candidates.
4.5 years ago, we pledged to hire 1,000 veterans over 5 years, and we put more effort into recruiting military veterans. These folks are returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and other places around the world and are well trained, very motivated and very disciplined. I'm happy to report that we have exceeded that goal by 177 new team members prior to the fifth year being completed. 
At the end of last year, we also hired a human resource consulting company to review the effectiveness of our compensation programs. They found that our company is in the top quartile on compensation for comparable industries. However, they have also shown us areas to improve. We feel strongly that being the employer of choice for the pest control industry and even for the service industry at large will continue to provide us with a good supply of candidates to choose from. In addition to ensuring we'll get the right people on our team, we also want to get them up to speed more quickly. As I mentioned on the previous earnings call, we're evaluating the best way to move forward. Prior to making decisions, we decided to survey our new hires to see how well we were doing with their onboarding experience. We found out we weren't always doing a very good job of providing these folks with an experience that would help them to be successful and leave our customer happy. 
In late 2017, we implemented new onboarding processes to improve the experience. We wanted them to feel a part of the team from day 1 and to quickly get the training and development they need to learn their jobs more quickly.
By making these changes based on the survey feedback, we have made improvements. Today, our onboarding surveys tell us that 93% of our new hires are proud to work for our brand and over 90% said they would recommend our company as a great place to work. Of course, there is a lot more to this than just selecting and hiring new team members. We have to train them exceptionally well, provide them with all the tools necessary, show them that there is plenty of opportunity with our company, compensate them well and most importantly treat them well. There is certainly a lot of moving parts to it, but it is well worth that extra effort to ensure that we build and maintain a strong team. So while the labor markets is tight, we are continuing to adjust. We know talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for the best talent.
Following up Gary's remarks on our acquisition of Aardwolf and Guardian, I wanted to reiterate how pleased we are to have them join our company. The depth and talent of the leadership team play the major factor in our desire to join with this organization. With a strong history of growth and leadership in the industry, our goal shares many similarities with the Rollins family of brands. Gary mentioned that Patrick remains with us to lead this talented team forward. We reached John as well as he transitions into retirement and begins to travel and spend quality time with his family. We look forward to working and learning from these new members of the Rollins family for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,573280141,1507322,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. The hiring method that John discussed is extremely timely with the historic revenue growth rates that we've seen this quarter, which followed a very strong Q1. Our M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate, that Gary mentioned. The r",1410,"Thanks, John. The hiring method that John discussed is extremely timely with the historic revenue growth rates that we've seen this quarter, which followed a very strong Q1. Our M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate, that Gary mentioned. The remaining 5.4% organic growth rate for accelerated hiring and additional service payroll to get these new accounts up and running for the quality service. Our financial results continue to show the impacts of our extremely high level of acquisitions over the past 6 months, as depreciation and amortization impacted both our income before taxes and net income. That said, we look forward to the related profit improvements in the future. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth and key to the quarter included historic commercial organic revenue growth, substantial increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions; and thirdly, fleet expense increased, which was impacted by lease cost and significant increase in fuel price per gallon.
Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $480.5 million was an increase of 10.8% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $433.6 million. Income before taxes increased 4.7% to $90.2 million from $86.1 million in 2017. Net income rose 22.1% to $65.5 million, and earnings per share increased 20% to $0.30 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. 
As we discussed last quarter, there were 2 unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to the typical quarter. As they'll continue to do for the remainder of 2018. The first was the enhanced employee benefits that Gary referred to earlier. This impacted the second quarter by about a penny, due in part to the expense related to our enhanced 401(k) match and the onetime stock ramps to many of our U.S.-based employees. We received very positive feedback from our workforce on this tremendous use of a portion of our tax savings. Additionally, the second significant item is the increase in recent acquisitions, which has increased our amortization of the intangible assets for the quarter by 27.3%. Over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets, over year-over-year, has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by a penny and is the tremendous investment for our future. 
With our strong increase in pest control revenue generation, there is aspect of our business that we've not spent a lot of time discussing in the past. This is related to startup cost for new recurring business. This would include initial sale, materials and supplies, sale commissions and labor cost, all of which falls in the first month of service, but only a portion of the revenue recognized. For commercial customers, this would include equipment needs, such as supply lines and base stations, just to name a few. The time to get this equipment in place and to provide the needs of the new account reduce the profit contribution for the first 3 to 4 visits. Once we are at that 4 to 5 visit level, the profitability significantly improves and this is a key reason that we concentrate on high levels of customer service to ensure that we retain these customers for years to come.
Because of the consistency of our organic revenue growth over the years, this has not been readily visible in our quarterly numbers. With the recent significantly accelerated organic growth, especially on the commercial side, the revenue growth of over 4% in Q1 and Q2, we felt this was a timely discussion for us to have. A deeper look into our organic growth rates reveals that in Q2 our recurring revenue grew greater than 10%, well above our historic norms. We believe that our investments in technology, training and our employee base are paying these dividends. In comparison, we know that one time revenue is immediately profitable, but the recurring revenue will ultimately generate excellent profitability. With strong residential and commercial retention rates, this investment will pay dividends for years to come.
Let's take a look to the revenue by service line for the second quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 10.8% included 5.4% from several acquisitions, and the remaining 5.4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 11.6%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 6%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 16%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over the past 5 years. But as I've mentioned, this quarter is the fastest growth that has occurred during that time period.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.4%. And from that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial increased 4.2% and termite improved 3.3%. When we take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total we grew 10.9%, residential grew 11.5%, commercial pest control was up 5%, and termite and ancillary improved 16.7%. In total gross margin for the quarter was 52%, down from 52.8% prior year's quarter. A large impact was felt from gasoline costs that were up on average $0.39 per gallon compared to last year. However, our efforts around optimization through our virtual route management system continues to see improvements and partially offset the fuel increase. The second quarter and specifically June revealed the best improvement in per mile since we completed our rollout of the virtual route management system in 2017.
Fleet expenses in total increased $3.5 million or 21.5% for the quarter, driven by fuel price increases that I mentioned and lease vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and stock grant that we began to amortize this quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter increased $2.8 million to $16.4 million, an increase of 20.8%. Depreciation increased $936,000 due to acquisitions, vehicle leases and equipment purchases, as mentioned before. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.9 million, due mostly to amortization of customer contracts included in the various acquisitions. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $13.7 million or 10.6% to 29.8% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from 29.9% for the first quarter last year. The decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower sales salaries, which increased slower than revenue, and reduced professional services as we wrapped up various projects. As for our cash position, for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we spent $14.2 million on acquisitions compared to $11.2 million the same quarter last year, as we continued to deploy higher levels of cash on acquisitions year-over-year; and $61.1 million on dividend, an increase of 22%. We had $14.2 million of CapEx, which was up 27% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with $87.9 million in cash, of which $40.1 million is primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts various domestic. There is one other item to note related to our cash flow moving forward. We have initiated the process to transition our pension plan to an insurance provider. The time line will take the next 16 to 18 months for the pension plan over 100% funded, interest rates rising. And pricing very attractive, we felt this was the best time to move forward.
On an annual basis, historically, we have made a $5 million contribution to the pension plan. This means that we do not have any plans to make this payment moving forward in time. 
Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business, August 10, 2018. The cash dividend is a 22% increase over the prior year. This marks the 16th consecutive year of the Board has increased our dividends by a minimum of 12%.

But we're going to continue to use these franchises to be able to no one understands these markets as we're growing and we're moving forward, especially in these higher emerging opportunity countries that are out there. And it's a formula that's worked very well for us. I mean, the franchise group in total, the International franchise group has grown significantly faster than our overall company's growth rate. Now of course, we only have the royalties portion of that from a financial perspective. But it gives us an opportunity to be able to know and understand the footprint and the opportunities that are out there around the rest of the globe. So we feel good with Australia moving forward the way it has and developing that landscape, starting there in 2014, and then adding new countries 2016 U.K. and then now 2018 in Singapore. It's been a good cadence for us to be able to digest that, and learn and understand more about those parts of the world. As we're excited about what that future looks like."

But I would not say that, that has been a driving factor behind anything. We continue just to find opportunities for good quality companies that want to join the Rollins family brand, that may be our necessarily looking for that biggest check company broken up. They're looking for an opportunity to be able to join the Rollins family of brand, to be able to continue to keep that legacy company intact and be able to continue to make improvements from there. We've seen that through the relationships that Gary and John, and our senior management folks have developed over the years, that we continue to have come to the table or come to us, and in a lot of cases the older ones have to take them. For the last few major deals that we did, it was not a situation of our bidding process, so the valuation that other companies were paying were not a part of that. It's more important that legacy piece continue to keep those good quality companies in place and being able to go through and find the good. One of the key things that's the most important thing to us that you year as over and over is our company culture. And with someone else selling a company and they have a very similar culture to us, the importance of their customers and their employees is in a lot of cases a driving decision. For Aardwolf, in Singapore, they still that was the #1 thing that made us -- the major decision for Rollins. And as John talked about, it has taken over 3 years to make their decision. But when they found us and learned about us, and they found out more of our culture and who we are, how we think about our employees, and how we think about our customer experience and taking care of our customers, they said that was a perfect fit for them. Now, if they had chosen someone else with their different price tags for them, that's a possibility that would have been the case. But the culture piece was really the most important part for them.

We're very pleased to report our 49th consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings.

We're very pleased to report our 49th consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. For the quarter, our revenues grew 10.8% to $480.5 million compared to $433.6 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 21.1% to $65 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $53.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. 
Revenues for the first 6 months rose 9.9% to $889.2 million compared to $808.8 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 20.9% (sic)[ 21.4% ] to approximately $113.6 million, (sic)[ $114.1 million ] with earnings per share of $0.52 per diluted share compared to $94 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the same period last year.
We experienced good growth in all of our business lines, with residential up 11.6%, commercial pest control grew 6%, and termite and ancillary services rose 16.9%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments. 
I'm extremely pleased with the expansion that we continue to make with our global footprint. During the quarter, we made 2 significant acquisitions in this regard. In May, we acquired Guardian Pest Control in the United Kingdom. Guardian was founded in 2002, and is well-recognized for its pest control services, [indiscernible] air disease control and hygiene services. These services are provided to commercial customers throughout the U.K.'s Midlands. This acquisition, our fourth in the U.K., will help us to expand our footprint within this country.  As in the past, we look forward to sharing best practices with one another. 
On July 2nd, we marked another important company milestone having closed on the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare, our first-company owned acquisition in Singapore. Founded in 1997, Aardwolf is a highly regarded company and known for its superior pest control and specialty services to both residential and commercial customers. In selecting the partner with Rollins, founders John Ho and Patrick Chong shared that it's taken them 3 years to find the company that had the same business philosophy that they have. Both of our companies share a commitment to quality service and care for employees. We're most pleased that Dr. Chong will remain in a leadership role, and we look forward to working with him and his fine team with the goal of becoming the dominant pest control provider in Singapore.  The landmark acquisition expands our resonance now into 54 countries worldwide. John will provide greater details on those acquisitions. 
We received an overwhelmingly positive response from our employees resulting from the tax-related benefit improvements announced last quarter. If you recall, we granted Rollins stock to over 7,000 employees based on tenure with the company. This was a onetime charge for the second quarter P&L. On a going forward basis, our 401(k) plan was improved, which benefited all participating employees. This was complemented by an additional floating holiday and an enhanced college scholarship program. Investing in our people is always beneficial and critical to our mission to become the world's best service company. 
Before turning the call over to John, I'd also like to acknowledge HomeTeam's receiving for the seventh time in a row David Weekley's highly coveted Partners of Quality Award (sic) Partners of Choice Award. David Weekley Homes is the largest privately held builder in the country. Implementing its rigorous supply feedback platform is a way to measure world-class vendor excellence. And to demonstrate their commitment to partner with their suppliers believing that when a partner improves its relationship with them, they both become better providers in the marketplace. HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley Homes at 13 cities where they conduct business.

300753,573280141,1507547,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I'm often asked about the whether the tight labor market and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached lows not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report",924,"Thank you, Gary. I'm often asked about the whether the tight labor market and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached lows not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report that our brands are dealing fairly well with this issue. 
We believe the strength of our various brands recognition and their reputation has helped, evidenced by the volume of applicants we continue to get for employment opportunities at Rollins companies. Through the first half of this year, our number of applicants per job opening was similar to a year ago. And for March and April, when unemployment figures hit their lowest, our applicant flow remain comparable to 2017 levels as well. 
That said, we recognize a strong applicant flow is not enough. We also have to ensure that our hiring processes are efficient and that we select the right people. Towards that end, we have made a few changes to our assessment tools and preemployment screening processes to reduce the time it takes to get someone on board and begin their training programs. Any reduction in time we can implement around these processes reduces the risk that we lose a good candidate to some other employer.  Most importantly, it allows us to interview hard and ultimately choose well. 
One of the most important ways we do that is by having our top job candidates complete what we call an observation day, where the candidate spends time shadowing one of our top employees who performs really well in the same type of work. This helps the candidate to decide whether the work we do in our company is a good fit for them. We get to see how they interact with coworkers and their likelihood to fit into the team. This additional step also helps to ensure we select the best people. 
One other added benefit of taking the time for observation period is that it keeps the candidate engaged and active in the process, and gives our managers a bit more time to check background and references on their candidates.
4.5 years ago, we pledged to hire 1,000 veterans over 5 years, and we've put more effort into recruiting military veterans. These folks are returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and other places around the world and are well trained, very motivated and very disciplined. I'm happy to report that we have exceeded that goal by 177 new team members prior to the fifth year being completed. 
At the end of last year, we also hired a human resources consulting company to review the effectiveness of our compensation programs. They found that our company is in the top quartile on compensation for comparable industries. However, they have also shown us areas to improve. 
We feel strongly that being the employer of choice for the pest control industry and even for the service industry at large will continue to provide us with a good supply of candidates to choose from. In addition to ensuring we'll get the right people on our team, we also want to get them up to speed more quickly. As I mentioned on the previous earnings call, we're evaluating the best way to move forward. Prior to making ill-advised decisions, we decided to survey our new hires to see how well we were doing with their on-boarding experience. We found out we weren't always doing a very good job of providing these folks with an experience that would help them to be successful and leave our customers happy. 
In late 2017, we implemented new on-boarding processes to improve the experience. We wanted them to feel a part of the team from day 1 and to quickly get the training and development they need to learn their jobs more quickly.  By making these changes based on the survey feedback, we have made improvements. Today, our on-boarding surveys tell us that 93% of our new hires are proud to work for our brand and over 90% said they would recommend our company as a great place to work. 
Of course, there is a lot more to this than just selecting and hiring new team members. We have to train them exceptionally well, provide them with all the tools necessary, show them that there is plenty of opportunity with our company, compensate them well and most importantly treat them well. There is certainly a lot of moving parts to it, but it is well worth that extra effort to ensure that we build and maintain a strong team. So while the labor markets is tight, we are continuing to adjust. We know talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for the best talent.
Following up Gary's remarks on our acquisition of Aardwolf and Guardian, I wanted to reiterate how pleased we are to have them join our company. The depth and talent of the leadership team at Aardwolf played the major factor in our desire to join with this organization. With a strong history of growth and leadership in the industry, Aardwolf shares many similarities with the Rollins family of brands. 
Gary mentioned that Patrick Chong remains with us to lead this talented team forward. We wish John Ho well as he transitions into retirement and begins to travel and spend quality time with his family. We look forward to working and learning from these new members of the Rollins family for years to come. 
I will now turn the call over to Eddie."

The hiring method that John discussed is extremely timely with the historic revenue growth rates that we've seen this quarter, which followed a very strong Q1. Our M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate that Gary mentioned. The re",1421,"Thanks, John. The hiring method that John discussed is extremely timely with the historic revenue growth rates that we've seen this quarter, which followed a very strong Q1. Our M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate that Gary mentioned. The remaining 5.4% organic growth rate drove the need for accelerated hiring and additional service payroll to get these new accounts up and running for the quality service. 
Our financial results continue to show the impacts of our extremely high level of acquisitions over the past 6 months as depreciation and amortization impacted both our income before taxes and net income. That said, we look forward to the related profit improvements in the future. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth, and key to the quarter included historic commercial organic revenue growth; substantial increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions; and thirdly, fleet expense increased, which was impacted by lease costs and a significant increase in fuel price per gallon.
Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $480.5 million was an increase of 10.8% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $433.6 million. Income before taxes increased 4.7% to $90.2 million from $86.1 million in 2017. Net income rose 22.1% to $65.5 million, and earnings per share increased 20% to $0.30 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. 
As we discussed last quarter, there were 2 unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to the typical quarter and they will continue to do for the remainder of 2018. The first was the enhanced employee benefits that Gary referred to earlier. This impacted the second quarter by about $0.01, due in part to the expense related to our enhanced 401(k) match and the onetime stock grants to many of our U.S.-based employees. We received very positive feedback from our workforce on this tremendous use of a portion of our tax savings. 
Additionally, the second significant item is the increase in recent acquisitions, which has increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 27.3%. Over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets, over year -- year-over-year, has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by $0.01 and is a tremendous investment for our future. 
With our strong increase in pest control revenue generated, there is an aspect of our business that we have not spent a lot of time discussing in the past. This is related to startup cost for new recurring business. This would include initial sale, materials and supplies, sales commissions and labor cost, all of which falls in the first month of service, but only a portion of the revenue recognized. For commercial customers, this would include equipment needs, such as rodent traps, fly lights and bait stations, just to name a few. 
The time we get this equipment in place and to provide the needs of the new account reduced the profit contribution for the first 3 to 4 visits. Once we are at that 4 to 5 visit level, the profitability significantly improves, and this is a key reason that we concentrate on high levels of customer service to ensure that we retain these customers for years to come.
Because of the consistency of our organic revenue growth over the years, this has not been readily visible in our quarterly numbers. With the recent significantly accelerated organic growth, especially on the commercial side, the revenue growth of over 4% in Q1 and Q2, we felt that this was a timely discussion for us to have. 
A deeper look into our organic growth rates reveals that in Q2, our recurring revenue grew greater than 10%, well above our historic norm. We believe that our investments in technology, training and our employee base are paying these dividends. In comparison, we know that onetime revenue is immediately profitable, but the recurring revenue will ultimately generate excellent profitability. With strong residential and commercial retention rates, this investment will pay dividends for years to come.
Let's take a look to the revenue by service line for the second quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 10.8% included 5.4% from several acquisitions, and the remaining 5.4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 11.6%; commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 6%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 16%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over the past 5 years. But as I've mentioned, this quarter is the fastest growth that has occurred during that time period.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.4%. And from that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial increased 4.2% and termite improved 3.3%. When we take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total we grew 10.9%, residential grew 11.5%, commercial pest control was up 5% and termite and ancillary improved 16.7%. 
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 52%, down from 52.8% prior year's quarter. A large impact was felt from gasoline costs that were up on average $0.39 per gallon compared to last year. However, our efforts around route optimization through our Virtual Route Management system continues to see improvement and partially offset the fuel increase. The second quarter, and specifically June, revealed the best improvement in stops per mile since we completed our rollout of the Virtual Route Management system in 2017.
Fleet expenses in total increased $3.5 million or 21.5% for the quarter, driven by fuel price increases that I mentioned and lease vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and stock grant that we began to amortize this quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter increased $2.8 million to $16.4 million, an increase of 20.8%. Depreciation increased $936,000 due to acquisitions, vehicle leases and equipment purchases, as mentioned before. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.9 million, due mostly to amortization of customer contracts included in the various acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $13.7 million or 10.6% to 29.8% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from 29.9% for the first quarter last year. The decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower salaries, which increased slower than revenue, and reduced professional services as we wrapped up various projects. 
As for our cash position, for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we spent $14.2 million on acquisitions compared to $11.2 million the same quarter last year as we continued to deploy higher levels of cash on acquisitions year-over-year, and $61.1 million on dividend, an increase of 22%. 
We had $14.2 million of CapEx, which was up 27% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with $87.9 million in cash, of which $40.1 million is primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts of various domestic banks. 
There is one other item to note related to our cash flow moving forward. We have initiated the process to transition our pension plan to an insurance provider. The time line will take the next 16 to 18 months to make the pension plan over 100% funded, interest rates rising, and pricing very attractive, we felt this was the best time to move forward.  On an annual basis, historically, we have made a $5 million contribution to the pension plan. This means that we do not have any plans to make this payment moving forward in time. 
Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business, August 10, 2018. The cash dividend is a 22% increase over the prior year. This marks the 16th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividends by a minimum of 12%.

To a lesser degree, we'll still see that on the residential side.

And it's a formula that's worked very well for us. I mean, the franchise group in total, the international franchise group has grown significantly faster than our overall company's growth rate.

But I would not say that, that has been a driving factor behind anything. We continue just to find opportunities for good quality companies that want to join the Rollins family of brand, that may be aren't necessarily looking for that biggest check and then have your company broken up. They're looking for an opportunity to be able to join the Rollins family of brand, to be able to continue to keep that legacy company intact and be able to continue to make improvements from there. 
We've seen that through the relationships that Gary and John, and our senior management folks have developed over the years, that we continue to have these folks to come to the table or come to us, and in a lot of cases we're the only ones that have to take them. For the last 2 major deals that we did, it was not a situation of a bidding process, so evaluation that other companies were paying, we're not a part of that. It's more important that the legacy piece continue to keep those good quality companies in place and being able to go through and find a good bet.  
One of the key things that's the most important thing to us that you hear us talk about over and over, that is our company culture. And if someone else is selling a company and they have a very similar culture to us, the importance of their customers and their employees is in a lot of cases a driving decision. 
For Aardwolf, in Singapore, they still -- look, that was the number 1 thing that made us -- the major decision for [ Rollins ].  And as John talked about, it took them over 3 years to make their decision. But when they found us and learned about us, and they found out more of our culture and who we are, and how we think about our employees, and how we think about our customer experience and taking care of our customers, they said that was a perfect fit for them. Now, if they had chosen someone else where there have been those different price tags for them, that's a possibility that could have been the case. But the culture piece was really the most important part for them. And we continue to see that with many, many opportunities that are out there from an acquisition perspective."

We're very pleased to report our 49th consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings. For the quarter, our revenues grew 10.8% to $480.5 million compared to $433.6 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 21.1% to $65 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $53.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. 
Revenues for the first 6 months rose 9.9% to $889.2 million compared to $808.8 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 20.9% (sic)[ 21.4% ] to approximately $113.6 million, (sic)[ $114.1 million ] with earnings per share of $0.52 per diluted share compared to $94 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the same period last year.
We experienced good growth in all of our business lines, with residential up 11.6%, commercial pest control grew 6%, and termite and ancillary services rose 16.9%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments. 
I'm extremely pleased with the expansion that we continue to make with our global footprint. During the quarter, we made 2 significant acquisitions in this regard. In May, we acquired Guardian Pest Control in the United Kingdom. Guardian was founded in 2002, and is well-recognized for its pest control services, [indiscernible] air disease control and hygiene services. These services are provided to commercial customers throughout the U.K.'s Midlands. This acquisition, our fourth in the U.K., will help us to expand our footprint within this country.  As in the past, we look forward to sharing best practices with one another. 
On July 2nd, we marked another important company milestone having closed on the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare, our first-company owned acquisition in Singapore. Founded in 1997, Aardwolf is a highly regarded company and known for its superior pest control and specialty services to both residential and commercial customers. In selecting the partner with Rollins, founders John Ho and Patrick Chong shared that it's taken them 3 years to find the company that had the same business philosophy that they have. Both of our companies share a commitment to quality service and care for employees. We're most pleased that Dr. Chong will remain in a leadership role, and we look forward to working with him and his fine team with the goal of becoming the dominant pest control provider in Singapore.  The landmark acquisition expands our residence now into 54 countries worldwide. John will provide greater details on those acquisitions. 
We received an overwhelmingly positive response from our employees resulting from the tax-related benefit improvements announced last quarter. If you recall, we granted Rollins stock to over 7,000 employees based on tenure with the company. This was a onetime charge for the second quarter P&L. On a going forward basis, our 401(k) plan was improved, which benefited all participating employees. This was complemented by an additional floating holiday and an enhanced college scholarship program. Investing in our people is always beneficial and critical to our mission to become the world's best service company. 
Before turning the call over to John, I'd also like to acknowledge HomeTeam's receiving for the seventh time in a row David Weekley's highly coveted Partners of Quality Award (sic) [ Partners of Choice Award ]. David Weekley Homes is the largest privately held builder in the country. Implementing its rigorous supply feedback platform is a way to measure world-class vendor excellence. And to demonstrate their commitment to partner with their suppliers believing that when a partner improves its relationship with them, they both become better providers in the marketplace. HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley Homes at 13 cities where they conduct business. This award confirms HomeTeam's commitment to providing exceptional service to its business partner. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to John."
300753,573280141,1507664,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I'm often asked about the whether the tight labor market and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached lows not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report",924,"Thank you, Gary. I'm often asked about the whether the tight labor market and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached lows not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report that our brands are dealing fairly well with this issue. 
We believe the strength of our various brands recognition and their reputation has helped, evidenced by the volume of applicants we continue to get for employment opportunities at Rollins companies. Through the first half of this year, our number of applicants per job opening was similar to a year ago. And for March and April, when unemployment figures hit their lowest, our applicant flow remain comparable to 2017 levels as well. 
That said, we recognize a strong applicant flow is not enough. We also have to ensure that our hiring processes are efficient and that we select the right people. Towards that end, we have made a few changes to our assessment tools and preemployment screening processes to reduce the time it takes to get someone on board and begin their training programs. Any reduction in time we can implement around these processes reduces the risk that we lose a good candidate to some other employer.  Most importantly, it allows us to interview hard and ultimately choose well. 
One of the most important ways we do that is by having our top job candidates complete what we call an observation day, where the candidate spends time shadowing one of our top employees who performs really well in the same type of work. This helps the candidate to decide whether the work we do in our company is a good fit for them. We get to see how they interact with coworkers and their likelihood to fit into the team. This additional step also helps to ensure we select the best people. 
One other added benefit of taking the time for observation period is that it keeps the candidate engaged and active in the process, and gives our managers a bit more time to check background and references on their candidates.
4.5 years ago, we pledged to hire 1,000 veterans over 5 years, and we've put more effort into recruiting military veterans. These folks are returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and other places around the world and are well trained, very motivated and very disciplined. I'm happy to report that we have exceeded that goal by 177 new team members prior to the fifth year being completed. 
At the end of last year, we also hired a human resources consulting company to review the effectiveness of our compensation programs. They found that our company is in the top quartile on compensation for comparable industries. However, they have also shown us areas to improve. 
We feel strongly that being the employer of choice for the pest control industry and even for the service industry at large will continue to provide us with a good supply of candidates to choose from. In addition to ensuring we'll get the right people on our team, we also want to get them up to speed more quickly. As I mentioned on the previous earnings call, we're evaluating the best way to move forward. Prior to making ill-advised decisions, we decided to survey our new hires to see how well we were doing with their on-boarding experience. We found out we weren't always doing a very good job of providing these folks with an experience that would help them to be successful and leave our customers happy. 
In late 2017, we implemented new on-boarding processes to improve the experience. We wanted them to feel a part of the team from day 1 and to quickly get the training and development they need to learn their jobs more quickly.  By making these changes based on the survey feedback, we have made improvements. Today, our on-boarding surveys tell us that 93% of our new hires are proud to work for our brand and over 90% said they would recommend our company as a great place to work. 
Of course, there is a lot more to this than just selecting and hiring new team members. We have to train them exceptionally well, provide them with all the tools necessary, show them that there is plenty of opportunity with our company, compensate them well and most importantly treat them well. There is certainly a lot of moving parts to it, but it is well worth that extra effort to ensure that we build and maintain a strong team. So while the labor markets is tight, we are continuing to adjust. We know talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for the best talent.
Following up Gary's remarks on our acquisition of Aardwolf and Guardian, I wanted to reiterate how pleased we are to have them join our company. The depth and talent of the leadership team at Aardwolf played the major factor in our desire to join with this organization. With a strong history of growth and leadership in the industry, Aardwolf shares many similarities with the Rollins family of brands. 
Gary mentioned that Patrick Chong remains with us to lead this talented team forward. We wish John Ho well as he transitions into retirement and begins to travel and spend quality time with his family. We look forward to working and learning from these new members of the Rollins family for years to come. 
I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,573280141,1507664,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. The hiring method that John discussed is extremely timely with the historic revenue growth rates that we've seen this quarter, which followed a very strong Q1. Our M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate that Gary mentioned. The re",1422,"Thanks, John. The hiring method that John discussed is extremely timely with the historic revenue growth rates that we've seen this quarter, which followed a very strong Q1. Our M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate that Gary mentioned. The remaining 5.4% organic growth rate drove the need for accelerated hiring and additional service payroll to get these new accounts up and running for the quality service. 
Our financial results continue to show the impacts of our extremely high level of acquisitions over the past 6 months as depreciation and amortization impacted both our income before taxes and net income. That said, we look forward to the related profit improvements in the future. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth, and keys to the quarter included historic commercial organic revenue growth; substantial increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions; and thirdly, fleet expense increased, which was impacted by lease costs and a significant increase in fuel price per gallon.
Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $480.5 million was an increase of 10.8% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $433.6 million. Income before taxes increased 4.7% to $90.2 million from $86.1 million in 2017. Net income rose 22.1% to $65.5 million, and earnings per share increased 20% to $0.30 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. 
As we discussed last quarter, there were 2 unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to the typical quarter and they will continue to do for the remainder of 2018. The first was the enhanced employee benefits that Gary referred to earlier. This impacted the second quarter by about $0.01, due in part to the expense related to our enhanced 401(k) match and the onetime stock grants to many of our U.S.-based employees. We received very positive feedback from our workforce on this tremendous use of a portion of our tax savings. 
Additionally, the second significant item is the increase in recent acquisitions, which has increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 27.3%. Over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets, over year -- year-over-year, has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by $0.01 and is a tremendous investment for our future. 
With our strong increase in pest control revenue generated, there is an aspect of our business that we have not spent a lot of time discussing in the past. This is related to startup cost for new recurring business. This would include initial sale, materials and supplies, sales commissions and labor cost, all of which falls in the first month of service, but only a portion of the revenue recognized. For commercial customers, this would include equipment needs, such as rodent traps, fly lights and bait stations, just to name a few. 
The time we get this equipment in place and to provide the needs of the new account reduced the profit contribution for the first 3 to 4 visits. Once we are at that 4 to 5 visit level, the profitability significantly improves, and this is a key reason that we concentrate on high levels of customer service to ensure that we retain these customers for years to come.
Because of the consistency of our organic revenue growth over the years, this has not been readily visible in our quarterly numbers. With the recent significantly accelerated organic growth, especially on the commercial side, the revenue growth of over 4% in Q1 and Q2, we felt that this was a timely discussion for us to have. 
A deeper look into our organic growth rates reveals that in Q2, our recurring revenue grew greater than 10%, well above our historic norm. We believe that our investments in technology, training and our employee base are paying these dividends. In comparison, we know that onetime revenue is immediately profitable, but the recurring revenue will ultimately generate excellent profitability. With strong residential and commercial retention rates, this investment will pay dividends for years to come.
Let's take a look at the revenue by service line for the second quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 10.8% included 5.4% from several acquisitions, and the remaining 5.4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 11.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 6%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 16%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over the past 5 years. But as I've mentioned, this quarter is the fastest growth that has occurred during that time period.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.4%. And from that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial increased 4.2% and termite improved 3.3%. When we take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total we grew 10.9%, residential grew 11.5%, commercial pest control was up 5% and termite and ancillary improved 16.7%. 
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 52%, down from 52.8% prior year's quarter. A large impact was felt from gasoline costs that were up on average $0.39 per gallon compared to last year. However, our efforts around route optimization through our Virtual Route Management system continues to see improvement and partially offset the fuel increase. The second quarter, and specifically June, revealed the best improvement in stops per mile since we completed our rollout of the Virtual Route Management system in 2017.
Fleet expenses in total increased $3.5 million or 21.5% for the quarter, driven by fuel price increases that I mentioned and lease vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and stock grant that we began to amortize this quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter increased $2.8 million to $16.4 million, an increase of 20.8%. Depreciation increased $936,000 due to acquisitions, vehicle leases and equipment purchases, as mentioned before. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.9 million, due mostly to amortization of customer contracts included in the various acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $13.7 million or 10.6% to 29.8% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from 29.9% for the first quarter last year. The decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower salaries, which increased slower than revenue, and reduced professional services as we wrapped up various projects. 
As for our cash position, for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we spent $14.2 million on acquisitions compared to $11.2 million the same quarter last year as we continued to deploy higher levels of cash on acquisitions year-over-year, and $61.1 million on dividend, an increase of 22%. 
We had $14.2 million of CapEx, which was up 27% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with $87.9 million in cash, of which $40.1 million is primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts of various domestic banks. 
There is one other item to note related to our cash flow moving forward. We have initiated the process to transition our pension plan to an insurance provider. The time line will take the next 16 to 18 months, but with the pension plan over 100% funded, interest rates rising, and pricing very attractive, we felt this was the best time to move forward. On an annual basis, historically, we have made a $5 million contribution to the pension plan. This means that we do not have any plans to make this payment moving forward in time. 
Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business, August 10, 2018. The cash dividend is a 22% increase over the prior year. This marks the 16th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividends by a minimum of 12%.
Before I turn the call over to Gary, I'd like to ensure that you are all aware of our Analyst Investor Day on August 10th at the New York Stock Exchange, recognizing the 50th anniversary of Rollins as the publicly listed company on the New York Stock Exchange. Gary, John, Julie and I will be giving an update on several parts of our business as we see them today and moving forward.

But I would not say that, that has been a driving factor behind anything. We continue just to find opportunities for good quality companies that want to join the Rollins family brand, that may be aren't necessarily looking for that biggest check and then have their company broken up. They're looking for an opportunity to be able to join the Rollins family of brand, to be able to continue to keep that legacy company intact and be able to continue to make improvements from there. 
We've seen that through the relationships that Gary and John, and our senior management folks have developed over the years, that we continue to have these folks to come to the table or come to us, and in a lot of cases we're the only ones at the table. For the last 2 major deals that we did, it was not a situation of a bidding process, so evaluations that other companies were paying, we're not a part of that. It's more important that the legacy piece continue to keep those good quality companies in place and being able to go through and find a good bid.  
One of the key things that's the most important thing to us, that you hear us talk about over and over, is our company culture. And if someone else is selling a company and they have a very similar culture to us, the importance of their customers and their employees is in a lot of cases a driving decision. 
For Aardwolf, in Singapore, they still -- look, that was the number 1 thing that made us -- the major decision for Rollins. And as John talked about, it took them over 3 years to make their decision. But when they found us and learned about us, and they found out more of our culture and who we are, and how we think about our employees, and how we think about our customer experience and taking care of our customers, they said that was a perfect fit for them. Now, if they had chosen someone else where there had been a different price tags for them, that's a possibility that could have been the case. But the culture piece was really the most important part for them. And we continue to see that with many, many opportunities that are out there from an acquisition perspective."

Net income increased 21.1% to $65 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $53.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. 
Revenues for the first 6 months rose 9.9% to $889.2 million compared to $808.8 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 20.9% (sic)[ 21.4% ] to approximately $113.6 million, (sic)[ $114.1 million ] with earnings per share of $0.52 per diluted share compared to $94 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the same period last year.
We experienced good growth in all of our business lines, with residential up 11.6%, commercial pest control grew 6%, and termite and ancillary services rose 16.9%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments. 
I'm extremely pleased with the expansion that we continue to make with our global footprint. During the quarter, we made 2 significant acquisitions in this regard. In May, we acquired Guardian Pest Control in the United Kingdom. Guardian was founded in 2002, and is well-recognized for its pest control services, [indiscernible] air disease control and hygiene services. These services are provided to commercial customers throughout the U.K.'s Midlands. This acquisition, our fourth in the U.K., will help us to expand our footprint within this country.  As in the past, we look forward to sharing best practices with one another. 
On July 2nd, we marked another important company milestone having closed on the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare, our first-company owned acquisition in Singapore. Founded in 1997, Aardwolf is a highly regarded company and known for its superior pest control and specialty services to both residential and commercial customers. In selecting the partner with Rollins, founders John Ho and Patrick Chong shared that it's taken them 3 years to find the company that had the same business philosophy that they have. Both of our companies share a commitment to quality service and care for employees. We're most pleased that Dr. Chong will remain in a leadership role, and we look forward to working with him and his fine team with the goal of becoming the dominant pest control provider in Singapore.  The landmark acquisition expands our residence now into 54 countries worldwide. John will provide greater details on those acquisitions. 
We received an overwhelmingly positive response from our employees resulting from the tax-related benefit improvements announced last quarter. If you recall, we granted Rollins stock to over 7,000 employees based on tenure with the company. This was a onetime charge for the second quarter P&L. On a going forward basis, our 401(k) plan was improved, which benefited all participating employees. This was complemented by an additional floating holiday and an enhanced college scholarship program. Investing in our people is always beneficial and critical to our mission to become the world's best service company. 
Before turning the call over to John, I'd also like to acknowledge HomeTeam's receiving for the seventh time in a row David Weekley's highly coveted Partners of Quality Award (sic) [ Partners of Choice Award ]. David Weekley Homes is the largest privately held builder in the country. Implementing its rigorous supply feedback platform is a way to measure world-class vendor excellence. And to demonstrate their commitment to partner with their suppliers believing that when a partner improves its relationship with them, they both become better providers in the marketplace. HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley Homes at 13 cities where they conduct business. This award confirms HomeTeam's commitment to providing exceptional service to its business partner.

300753,573280141,1508418,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I'm often asked about the whether the tight labor market and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached lows not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report",924,"Thank you, Gary. I'm often asked about the whether the tight labor market and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached lows not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report that our brands are dealing fairly well with this issue. 
We believe the strength of our various brands recognition and their reputation has helped, evidenced by the volume of applicants we continue to get for employment opportunities at Rollins companies. Through the first half of this year, our number of applicants per job opening was similar to a year ago. And for March and April, when unemployment figures hit their lowest, our applicant flow remain comparable to 2017 levels as well. 
That said, we recognize a strong applicant flow is not enough. We also have to ensure that our hiring processes are efficient and that we select the right people. Towards that end, we have made a few changes to our assessment tools and preemployment screening processes to reduce the time it takes to get someone on board and begin their training programs. Any reduction in time we can implement around these processes reduces the risk that we lose a good candidate to some other employer.  Most importantly, it allows us to interview hard and ultimately choose well. 
One of the most important ways we do that is by having our top job candidates complete what we call an observation day, where the candidate spends time shadowing one of our top employees who performs really well in the same type of work. This helps the candidate to decide whether the work we do in our company is a good fit for them. We get to see how they interact with coworkers and their likelihood to fit into the team. This additional step also helps to ensure we select the best people. 
One other added benefit of taking the time for observation period is that it keeps the candidate engaged and active in the process, and gives our managers a bit more time to check background and references on their candidates.
4.5 years ago, we pledged to hire 1,000 veterans over 5 years, and we've put more effort into recruiting military veterans. These folks are returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and other places around the world and are well trained, very motivated and very disciplined. I'm happy to report that we have exceeded that goal by 177 new team members prior to the fifth year being completed. 
At the end of last year, we also hired a human resources consulting company to review the effectiveness of our compensation programs. They found that our company is in the top quartile on compensation for comparable industries. However, they have also shown us areas to improve. 
We feel strongly that being the employer of choice for the pest control industry and even for the service industry at large will continue to provide us with a good supply of candidates to choose from. In addition to ensuring we'll get the right people on our team, we also want to get them up to speed more quickly. As I mentioned on the previous earnings call, we're evaluating the best way to move forward. Prior to making ill-advised decisions, we decided to survey our new hires to see how well we were doing with their on-boarding experience. We found out we weren't always doing a very good job of providing these folks with an experience that would help them to be successful and leave our customers happy. 
In late 2017, we implemented new on-boarding processes to improve the experience. We wanted them to feel a part of the team from day 1 and to quickly get the training and development they need to learn their jobs more quickly.  By making these changes based on the survey feedback, we have made improvements. Today, our on-boarding surveys tell us that 93% of our new hires are proud to work for our brand and over 90% said they would recommend our company as a great place to work. 
Of course, there is a lot more to this than just selecting and hiring new team members. We have to train them exceptionally well, provide them with all the tools necessary, show them that there is plenty of opportunity with our company, compensate them well and most importantly treat them well. There is certainly a lot of moving parts to it, but it is well worth that extra effort to ensure that we build and maintain a strong team. So while the labor markets is tight, we are continuing to adjust. We know talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for the best talent.
Following up Gary's remarks on our acquisition of Aardwolf and Guardian, I wanted to reiterate how pleased we are to have them join our company. The depth and talent of the leadership team at Aardwolf played the major factor in our desire to join with this organization. With a strong history of growth and leadership in the industry, Aardwolf shares many similarities with the Rollins family of brands. 
Gary mentioned that Patrick Chong remains with us to lead this talented team forward. We wish John Ho well as he transitions into retirement and begins to travel and spend quality time with his family. We look forward to working and learning from these new members of the Rollins family for years to come. 
I will now turn the call over to Eddie."

Our M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate that Gary mentioned. The remaining 5.4% organic growth rate drove the need for accelerated hiring and additional service payroll to get these new accounts up and running for the quality service. 
Our financial results continue to show the impacts of our extremely high level of acquisitions over the past 6 months as depreciation and amortization impacted both our income before taxes and net income. That said, we look forward to the related profit improvements in the future. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth, and keys to the quarter included historic commercial organic revenue growth; substantial increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions; and thirdly, fleet expense increased, which was impacted by lease costs and a significant increase in fuel price per gallon.
Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $480.5 million was an increase of 10.8% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $433.6 million. Income before taxes increased 4.7% to $90.2 million from $86.1 million in 2017. Net income rose 22.1% to $65.5 million, and earnings per share increased 20% to $0.30 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. 
As we discussed last quarter, there were 2 unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to the typical quarter and they will continue to do for the remainder of 2018. The first was the enhanced employee benefits that Gary referred to earlier. This impacted the second quarter by about $0.01, due in part to the expense related to our enhanced 401(k) match and the onetime stock grants to many of our U.S.-based employees. We received very positive feedback from our workforce on this tremendous use of a portion of our tax savings. 
Additionally, the second significant item is the increase in recent acquisitions, which has increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 27.3%. Over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets, over year -- year-over-year, has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by $0.01 and is a tremendous investment for our future. 
With our strong increase in pest control revenue generated, there is an aspect of our business that we have not spent a lot of time discussing in the past. This is related to startup cost for new recurring business. This would include initial sale, materials and supplies, sales commissions and labor cost, all of which falls in the first month of service, but only a portion of the revenue recognized. For commercial customers, this would include equipment needs, such as rodent traps, fly lights and bait stations, just to name a few. 
The time we get this equipment in place and to provide the needs of the new account reduced the profit contribution for the first 3 to 4 visits. Once we are at that 4 to 5 visit level, the profitability significantly improves, and this is a key reason that we concentrate on high levels of customer service to ensure that we retain these customers for years to come.
Because of the consistency of our organic revenue growth over the years, this has not been readily visible in our quarterly numbers. With the recent significantly accelerated organic growth, especially on the commercial side, the revenue growth of over 4% in Q1 and Q2, we felt that this was a timely discussion for us to have. 
A deeper look into our organic growth rates reveals that in Q2, our recurring revenue grew greater than 10%, well above our historic norm. We believe that our investments in technology, training and our employee base are paying these dividends. In comparison, we know that onetime revenue is immediately profitable, but the recurring revenue will ultimately generate excellent profitability. With strong residential and commercial retention rates, this investment will pay dividends for years to come.
Let's take a look at the revenue by service line for the second quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 10.8% included 5.4% from several acquisitions, and the remaining 5.4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 11.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 6%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 16%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over the past 5 years. But as I've mentioned, this quarter is the fastest growth that has occurred during that time period.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.4%. And from that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial increased 4.2% and termite improved 3.3%. When we take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total we grew 10.9%, residential grew 11.5%, commercial pest control was up 5% and termite and ancillary improved 16.7%. 
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 52%, down from 52.8% prior year's quarter. A large impact was felt from gasoline costs that were up on average $0.39 per gallon compared to last year. However, our efforts around route optimization through our Virtual Route Management system continues to see improvement and partially offset the fuel increase. The second quarter, and specifically June, revealed the best improvement in stops per mile since we completed our rollout of the Virtual Route Management system in 2017.
Fleet expenses in total increased $3.5 million or 21.5% for the quarter, driven by fuel price increases that I mentioned and lease vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and stock grant that we began to amortize this quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter increased $2.8 million to $16.4 million, an increase of 20.8%. Depreciation increased $936,000 due to acquisitions, vehicle leases and equipment purchases, as mentioned before. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.9 million, due mostly to amortization of customer contracts included in the various acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $13.7 million or 10.6% to 29.8% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from 29.9% for the first quarter last year. The decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower salaries, which increased slower than revenue, and reduced professional services as we wrapped up various projects. 
As for our cash position, for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we spent $14.2 million on acquisitions compared to $11.2 million the same quarter last year as we continued to deploy higher levels of cash on acquisitions year-over-year, and $61.1 million on dividend, an increase of 22%. 
We had $14.2 million of CapEx, which was up 27% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with $87.9 million in cash, of which $40.1 million is primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts of various domestic banks. 
There is one other item to note related to our cash flow moving forward. We have initiated the process to transition our pension plan to an insurance provider. The time line will take the next 16 to 18 months, but with the pension plan over 100% funded, interest rates rising, and pricing very attractive, we felt this was the best time to move forward. On an annual basis, historically, we have made a $5 million contribution to the pension plan. This means that we do not have any plans to make this payment moving forward in time. 
Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business, August 10, 2018. The cash dividend is a 22% increase over the prior year. This marks the 16th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividends by a minimum of 12%.
Before I turn the call over to Gary, I'd like to ensure that you are all aware of our Analyst Investor Day on August 10th at the New York Stock Exchange, recognizing the 50th anniversary of Rollins as the publicly listed company on the New York Stock Exchange. Gary, John, Julie and I will be giving an update on several parts of our business as we see them today and moving forward.

But we're going to continue to use these franchises to be able to know and understand these markets as we're growing and we're moving forward, especially in these higher emerging opportunity countries that are out there. And it's a formula that's worked very well for us. I mean, the franchise group in total, the international franchise group has grown significantly faster than our overall company's growth rate. Now of course, we only have the royalties portion of that from a financial perspective, but it gives us an opportunity to be able to know and understand the footprint and the opportunities that are out there around the rest of the globe.

But I would not say that, that has been a driving factor behind anything. We continue just to find opportunities for good quality companies that want to join the Rollins family brand, that may be aren't necessarily looking for that biggest check and then have their company broken up. They're looking for an opportunity to be able to join the Rollins family of brand, to be able to continue to keep that legacy company intact and be able to continue to make improvements from there. We've seen that through the relationships that Gary and John, and our senior management folks have developed over the years, that we continue to have these folks to come to the table or come to us, and in a lot of cases we're the only ones at the table. For the last 2 major deals that we did, it was not a situation of a bidding process, so evaluations that other companies were paying, we're not a part of that. It's more important that the legacy piece continue to keep those good quality companies in place and being able to go through and find a good bid.  One of the key things that's the most important thing to us, that you hear us talk about over and over, is our company culture. And if someone else is selling a company and they have a very similar culture to us, the importance of their customers and their employees is in a lot of cases a driving decision. For Aardwolf, in Singapore, they still -- look, that was the number 1 thing that made us -- the major decision for Rollins. And as John talked about, it took them over 3 years to make their decision. But when they found us and learned about us, and they found out more of our culture and who we are, and how we think about our employees, and how we think about our customer experience and taking care of our customers, they said that was a perfect fit for them. Now if they had chosen someone else where there had been a different price tags for them, that's a possibility that could have been the case. But the culture piece was really the most important part for them. And we continue to see that with many, many opportunities that are out there from an acquisition perspective."

Net income increased 21.1% to $65 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to $53.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. 
Revenues for the first 6 months rose 9.9% to $889.2 million compared to $808.8 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 20.9% (sic)[ 21.4% ] to approximately $113.6 million, (sic)[ $114.1 million ] with earnings per share of $0.52 per diluted share compared to $94 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the same period last year.
We experienced good growth in all of our business lines, with residential up 11.6%, commercial pest control grew 6%, and termite and ancillary services rose 16.9%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments. 
I'm extremely pleased with the expansion that we continue to make with our global footprint. During the quarter, we made 2 significant acquisitions in this regard. In May, we acquired Guardian Pest Control in the United Kingdom. Guardian was founded in 2002, and is well-recognized for its pest control services, [indiscernible] air disease control and hygiene services. These services are provided to commercial customers throughout the U.K.'s Midlands. This acquisition, our fourth in the U.K., will help us to expand our footprint within this country.  As in the past, we look forward to sharing best practices with one another. 
On July 2nd, we marked another important company milestone having closed on the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare, our first-company owned acquisition in Singapore. Founded in 1997, Aardwolf is a highly regarded company and known for its superior pest control and specialty services to both residential and commercial customers. In selecting the partner with Rollins, founders John Ho and Patrick Chong shared that it's taken them 3 years to find the company that had the same business philosophy that they have. Both of our companies share a commitment to quality service and care for employees. We're most pleased that Dr. Chong will remain in a leadership role, and we look forward to working with him and his fine team with the goal of becoming the dominant pest control provider in Singapore.  The landmark acquisition expands our residence now into 54 countries worldwide. John will provide greater details on those acquisitions. 
We received an overwhelmingly positive response from our employees resulting from the tax-related benefit improvements announced last quarter. If you recall, we granted Rollins stock to over 7,000 employees based on tenure with the company. This was a onetime charge for the second quarter P&L. On a going forward basis, our 401(k) plan was improved, which benefited all participating employees. This was complemented by an additional floating holiday and an enhanced college scholarship program. Investing in our people is always beneficial and critical to our mission to become the world's best service company. 
Before turning the call over to John, I'd also like to acknowledge HomeTeam's receiving for the seventh time in a row David Weekley's highly coveted Partners of Quality Award (sic) [ Partners of Choice Award ]. David Weekley Homes is the largest privately held builder in the country. Implementing its rigorous supply feedback platform is a way to measure world-class vendor excellence. And to demonstrate their commitment to partner with their suppliers believing that when a partner improves its relationship with them, they both become better providers in the marketplace. HomeTeam performs thousands of services for David Weekley Homes at 13 cities where they conduct business. This award confirms HomeTeam's commitment to providing exceptional service to its business partner. 
I'd now like to turn the call over to John."
300753,573280141,1508487,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. I'm often asked about the whether the tight labor market and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached lows not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report",924,"Thank you, Gary. I'm often asked about the whether the tight labor market and the competition for talent is impacting our business. As you well know, in April and May, the unemployment rate reached lows not seen since 2000. However, I'm pleased to report that our brands are dealing fairly well with this issue. 
We believe the strength of our various brands recognition and their reputation has helped, evidenced by the volume of applicants we continue to get for employment opportunities at Rollins companies. Through the first half of this year, our number of applicants per job opening was similar to a year ago. And for March and April, when unemployment figures hit their lowest, our applicant flow remain comparable to 2017 levels as well. 
That said, we recognize a strong applicant flow is not enough. We also have to ensure that our hiring processes are efficient and that we select the right people. Towards that end, we have made a few changes to our assessment tools and preemployment screening processes to reduce the time it takes to get someone on board and begin their training programs. Any reduction in time we can implement around these processes reduces the risk that we lose a good candidate to some other employer.  Most importantly, it allows us to interview hard and ultimately choose well. 
One of the most important ways we do that is by having our top job candidates complete what we call an observation day, where the candidate spends time shadowing one of our top employees who performs really well in the same type of work. This helps the candidate to decide whether the work we do in our company is a good fit for them. We get to see how they interact with coworkers and their likelihood to fit into the team. This additional step also helps to ensure we select the best people. 
One other added benefit of taking the time for observation period is that it keeps the candidate engaged and active in the process, and gives our managers a bit more time to check background and references on their candidates.
4.5 years ago, we pledged to hire 1,000 veterans over 5 years, and we've put more effort into recruiting military veterans. These folks are returning from Iraq, Afghanistan and other places around the world and are well trained, very motivated and very disciplined. I'm happy to report that we have exceeded that goal by 177 new team members prior to the fifth year being completed. 
At the end of last year, we also hired a human resources consulting company to review the effectiveness of our compensation programs. They found that our company is in the top quartile on compensation for comparable industries. However, they have also shown us areas to improve. 
We feel strongly that being the employer of choice for the pest control industry and even for the service industry at large will continue to provide us with a good supply of candidates to choose from. In addition to ensuring we'll get the right people on our team, we also want to get them up to speed more quickly. As I mentioned on the previous earnings call, we're evaluating the best way to move forward. Prior to making ill-advised decisions, we decided to survey our new hires to see how well we were doing with their on-boarding experience. We found out we weren't always doing a very good job of providing these folks with an experience that would help them to be successful and leave our customers happy. 
In late 2017, we implemented new on-boarding processes to improve the experience. We wanted them to feel a part of the team from day 1 and to quickly get the training and development they need to learn their jobs more quickly.  By making these changes based on the survey feedback, we have made improvements. Today, our on-boarding surveys tell us that 93% of our new hires are proud to work for our brand and over 90% said they would recommend our company as a great place to work. 
Of course, there is a lot more to this than just selecting and hiring new team members. We have to train them exceptionally well, provide them with all the tools necessary, show them that there is plenty of opportunity with our company, compensate them well and most importantly treat them well. There is certainly a lot of moving parts to it, but it is well worth that extra effort to ensure that we build and maintain a strong team. So while the labor markets is tight, we are continuing to adjust. We know talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins brands to be a leading contender for the best talent.
Following up Gary's remarks on our acquisition of Aardwolf and Guardian, I wanted to reiterate how pleased we are to have them join our company. The depth and talent of the leadership team at Aardwolf played the major factor in our desire to join with this organization. With a strong history of growth and leadership in the industry, Aardwolf shares many similarities with the Rollins family of brands. 
Gary mentioned that Patrick Chong remains with us to lead this talented team forward. We wish John Ho well as he transitions into retirement and begins to travel and spend quality time with his family. We look forward to working and learning from these new members of the Rollins family for years to come. 
I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,573280141,1508487,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2018 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2018",2018-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. The hiring method that John discussed is extremely timely with the historic revenue growth rates that we've seen this quarter, which followed a very strong Q1. Our M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate that Gary mentioned. The re",1422,"Thanks, John. The hiring method that John discussed is extremely timely with the historic revenue growth rates that we've seen this quarter, which followed a very strong Q1. Our M&A made up roughly half of the 10.8% growth rate that Gary mentioned. The remaining 5.4% organic growth rate drove the need for accelerated hiring and additional service payroll to get these new accounts up and running for the quality service. 
Our financial results continue to show the impacts of our extremely high level of acquisitions over the past 6 months as depreciation and amortization impacted both our income before taxes and net income. That said, we look forward to the related profit improvements in the future. 
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth, and keys to the quarter included historic commercial organic revenue growth; substantial increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of multiple acquisitions; and thirdly, fleet expense increased, which was impacted by lease costs and a significant increase in fuel price per gallon.
Looking at the numbers. The second quarter revenues of $480.5 million was an increase of 10.8% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $433.6 million. Income before taxes increased 4.7% to $90.2 million from $86.1 million in 2017. Net income rose 22.1% to $65.5 million, and earnings per share increased 20% to $0.30 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. 
As we discussed last quarter, there were 2 unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to the typical quarter and they will continue to do for the remainder of 2018. The first was the enhanced employee benefits that Gary referred to earlier. This impacted the second quarter by about $0.01, due in part to the expense related to our enhanced 401(k) match and the onetime stock grants to many of our U.S.-based employees. We received very positive feedback from our workforce on this tremendous use of a portion of our tax savings. 
Additionally, the second significant item is the increase in recent acquisitions, which has increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 27.3%. Over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets, over year -- year-over-year, has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, this significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by $0.01 and is a tremendous investment for our future. 
With our strong increase in pest control revenue generated, there is an aspect of our business that we have not spent a lot of time discussing in the past. This is related to startup cost for new recurring business. This would include initial sale, materials and supplies, sales commissions and labor cost, all of which falls in the first month of service, but only a portion of the revenue recognized. For commercial customers, this would include equipment needs, such as rodent traps, fly lights and bait stations, just to name a few. 
The time we get this equipment in place and to provide the needs of the new account reduced the profit contribution for the first 3 to 4 visits. Once we are at that 4 to 5 visit level, the profitability significantly improves, and this is a key reason that we concentrate on high levels of customer service to ensure that we retain these customers for years to come.
Because of the consistency of our organic revenue growth over the years, this has not been readily visible in our quarterly numbers. With the recent significantly accelerated organic growth, especially on the commercial side, the revenue growth of over 4% in Q1 and Q2, we felt that this was a timely discussion for us to have. 
A deeper look into our organic growth rates reveals that in Q2, our recurring revenue grew greater than 10%, well above our historic norm. We believe that our investments in technology, training and our employee base are paying these dividends. In comparison, we know that onetime revenue is immediately profitable, but the recurring revenue will ultimately generate excellent profitability. With strong residential and commercial retention rates, this investment will pay dividends for years to come.
Let's take a look at the revenue by service line for the second quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 10.8% included 5.4% from several acquisitions, and the remaining 5.4% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 11.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 37% of our revenue, was up 6%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 16%. Our commercial growth has trended higher over the past 5 years. But as I've mentioned, this quarter is the fastest growth that has occurred during that time period.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.4%. And from that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial increased 4.2% and termite improved 3.3%. When we take a look at the quarter, taking out the impact of foreign companies and currency, in total we grew 10.9%, residential grew 11.5%, commercial pest control was up 5% and termite and ancillary improved 16.7%. 
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 52%, down from 52.8% prior year's quarter. A large impact was felt from gasoline costs that were up on average $0.39 per gallon compared to last year. However, our efforts around route optimization through our Virtual Route Management system continues to see improvement and partially offset the fuel increase. The second quarter, and specifically June, revealed the best improvement in stops per mile since we completed our rollout of the Virtual Route Management system in 2017.
Fleet expenses in total increased $3.5 million or 21.5% for the quarter, driven by fuel price increases that I mentioned and lease vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up due to the 401(k) plan company match and stock grant that we began to amortize this quarter. 
Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter increased $2.8 million to $16.4 million, an increase of 20.8%. Depreciation increased $936,000 due to acquisitions, vehicle leases and equipment purchases, as mentioned before. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.9 million, due mostly to amortization of customer contracts included in the various acquisitions. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $13.7 million or 10.6% to 29.8% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from 29.9% for the first quarter last year. The decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower salaries, which increased slower than revenue, and reduced professional services as we wrapped up various projects. 
As for our cash position, for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we spent $14.2 million on acquisitions compared to $11.2 million the same quarter last year as we continued to deploy higher levels of cash on acquisitions year-over-year, and $61.1 million on dividend, an increase of 22%. 
We had $14.2 million of CapEx, which was up 27% from 2017, primarily from planned IT upgrades and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the quarter with $87.9 million in cash, of which $40.1 million is primarily held in non-interest-bearing accounts of various domestic banks. 
There is one other item to note related to our cash flow moving forward. We have initiated the process to transition our pension plan to an insurance provider. The time line will take the next 16 to 18 months, but with the pension plan over 100% funded, interest rates rising, and pricing very attractive, we felt this was the best time to move forward. On an annual basis, historically, we have made a $5 million contribution to the pension plan. This means that we do not have any plans to make this payment moving forward in time. 
Last night, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.14 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business, August 10, 2018. The cash dividend is a 22% increase over the prior year. This marks the 16th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividends by a minimum of 12%.
Before I turn the call over to Gary, I'd like to ensure that you are all aware of our Analyst Investor Day on August 10th at the New York Stock Exchange, recognizing the 50th anniversary of Rollins as the publicly listed company on the New York Stock Exchange. Gary, John, Julie and I will be giving an update on several parts of our business as we see them today and moving forward.

But I would not say that, that has been a driving factor behind anything. We continue just to find opportunities for good quality companies that want to join the Rollins family brand, that may be aren't necessarily looking for that biggest check and then have their company broken up. They're looking for an opportunity to be able to join the Rollins family of brand, to be able to continue to keep that legacy company intact and be able to continue to make improvements from there. We've seen that through the relationships that Gary and John, and our senior management folks have developed over the years, that we continue to have these folks to come to the table or come to us, and in a lot of cases we're the only ones at the table. For the last 2 major deals that we did, it was not a situation of a bidding process, so evaluations that other companies were paying, we're not a part of that. It's more important that the legacy piece continue to keep those good quality companies in place and being able to go through and find a good bid.  One of the key things that's the most important thing to us, that you hear us talk about over and over, is our company culture. And if someone else is selling a company and they have a very similar culture to us, the importance of their customers and their employees is in a lot of cases a driving decision. For Aardwolf, in Singapore, they still -- look, that was the number 1 thing that made us -- the major decision for Rollins. And as John talked about, it took them over 3 years to make their decision. But when they found us and learned about us, and they found out more of our culture and who we are, and how we think about our employees, and how we think about our customer experience and taking care of our customers, they said that was a perfect fit for them. Now if they had chosen someone else where there had been a different price tags for them, that's a possibility that could have been the case. But the culture piece was really the most important part for them. And we continue to see that with many, many opportunities that are out there from an acquisition perspective."

So now we're talking about that 2 to 3-month time period for the average of averages to be able to go through and [indiscernible] anything else."

So anything that we can do to continue to reduce our miles per stock, which we are, and June was our best month that we've had since the inception of this program, we continue to move that forward. That's going to offset some of that fuel increase. And we're just not smart enough to be able to bet on one side or another on where that price per gallon is going to go as we move forward in time.

Net income increased 24.3% to approximately $180.7 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.83 compared to $105.4 million or $0.67 per diluted share for the same period last year.
We experienced good growth in all of our business lines in the quarter with residential up 9.2%, commercial pest control rose 55.7% and termite and ancillary grew 11%. And we will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments. 
On August 10, we were privileged to celebrate a historic milestone for Rollins, a 50th anniversary of our company's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Anniversary was significant in both a business and personal level. To celebrate the occasion, our Chairman, Randall Rollins and lead director, Henry Tippie rang the closing bell and in doing so made history of the exchange. They hold the distinction of being the only 2 Directors present for our company's initial listing, and it's 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange.
We are fortunate to have your contribution in leadership for that period as well. 
As many of you know, we've also hosted an Analyst Day as well as as an exhibit inexperienced square in front of the Stock Exchange. This exhibit showcased historical items from our Rollins heritage center, as such as the World War II era, and a bicycle technical to use to provide service when gasoline was rationed. We also displayed our current trucks from the various brands like, credit control, HomeTeam, Northwest and Orkin that are used today. In addition, we anvil some of our new field technology that we're rolling out and provided more detail on this week our commercial iPad application.
We're proud of our heritage and the achievements that we made over the past 50 years since acquiring Orkin in 1964, we have grown from the few U.S. operations to a premier global consumer commercial services company with more than 700 operations in 57 countries. 
In the early '90s, recognizing how good Orkin in the pest control industry, Rollins narrowed his focus on pest control. And so all of our non pest control businesses, we began to open a new Orkin branches, create Orkin franchises, both domestic and international, and initiated an acquisition strategy, all of which remains the same today. 
Our goal was also to purchase other leading pest control companies, which at the time started with the acquiring of PCO services, which is now Orkin Canada and Canada's largest pest control company. This purchase would be followed by Western, and the 2008 HomeTeam pest which at the time was the fourth largest pest control company in the United States. These were followed by many others, all of which we  were able to grow and improve.
Other acquired international companies followed in Australia, the United Kingdom and recently Singapore. During this time, we also realized that there were segments of the pest control industry in the U.S. that will complement our growth strategy. We added to our portfolio industrial fumigation, the largest commercial pest control fumigation company in the United States, Trutech and later acquiring the master franchise or the best known lowlight brand, Critter Control. By the way, today, we are the country's largest wildlife control company. Our acquisition strategy has continued most recently with the purchase of Northwest Exterminating and Kentucky's OPC pest control company. None of these successes would have been possible without our people, who have been the central part of Rollins' past and present accomplishments. I never grow tired of saying in recognizing that our employees are our company's most precious assets. Our team's dedication and experience shape not only who we are today, but will direct what we will do in the future. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve all of our existing businesses, while at the same time, expanding our global footprint to new locations and acquisitions.

As you all know, in September, 2 large hurricanes we hit the mainland, Hurricane Florence in the middle of the month, North Carolina. The storm stalled and most of the damage there was done by flooding. Hurricane Michael was the larger Category 4 storm that destroyed Mexico beach and parts of Panama City beach Florida. I'm happy to report that all our team members are accounted for and our office facilities came through mostly okay. Hurricane Michael was the most impactful as it relates to our team. I know 4 families that have lost everything and at least 6 others with significant loss due to the storm.
I spoke with our Orkin region manager for that area on Thursday. He was on site and working to help both our team and their customers get back on their feet. Of course, we have also engaged our Rollins' employee relief fund team in support of these folks and others. 
You may recall on our second quarter conference call I discussed the tight labor market and how competition for employees was impacting us. At that time, our brands were handling it fairly well. Since then, with the unemployment rate having declined 3.7% in September, we are experiencing some hiring pressures. We still maintain higher retention rates for our industry, but it is become even more important for our people to recruit for new talent consistently in order to maintain a viable pipeline of new team member candidates. As Gary just mentioned, we regard our employees as our most important asset, and we continue to assess and act upon what is working.
What we need to do to adjust and any additional steps we can take to ensure we remain the employer of choice. A good step directly towards retaining our employees was the decision to share a portion of the tax savings in the form of stock grants and an improved 401(k) match for our U.S.-based employees. Compared to support of our hiring efforts we have beefed up our recruiting initiatives and will be rolling out our first ever human resource or HRIS system in 2019.
Our President of Specialty Brands and Human Resources, Jerry Gahlhoff is the Executive sponsor and lead to this initiative. This will enable us to better track training, performance and career development for all employees around the globe and seamless location. One of the groups that will benefit greatly from this would be our current and future leaders as people development is an important part of this effort. Our focus on hiring veterans and females continues to provide significant opportunity to add talent.
Our industry has not historically attracted many females, and we can't afford to ignore nearly half of the population when considering this talent search. Plus, we know they make excellent employees.
As we continue to grow, add new branches and split existing ones in all our brands as well as make acquisitions, our efforts with talent acquisition and management development enables us to continue to prepare for that growth. We know talented people have choices, and we Rollins brand to be a leading contender for that talent. As is reflected in our third quarter results, we are continuing to expand good organic growth across our business service lines, including growth in our termite and ancillary services. One of the areas of emphasis in 2018 has been the growth of our mosquito service, while on a relatively low base, we have grown the service line over 30% on Q3 and year-to-date. This service line expansion has been largely driven by increased concern and race public awareness around disease borne issues related to mosquitoes, including the Zika and. And other diseases are major contributors as customers come to us seeking answers to this threat.
We believe the growth rate of our mosquito business can and will continue strongly for many years to come. We have the largest residential basis of customers in the industry, and this is a straightforward cross-sell offering for many of our customers from some of already trust. 
In fact, this is the service our customers give their highest customer satisfaction rate. From an efficiency standpoint, it is also helpful where we can have the same technician that perform the pest control service, also doing the mosquito service at the same time. We recognized that customers most to know all of the pest and wildlife services that we offer and our marketing group is a great job getting that message to those customers. As you are aware, there are a wide variety of ways consumers use to make their decisions. Our digital marketing team and their efforts continue to differentiate us from our competition. Probably and maybe most importantly, from a connectivity standpoint, it's providing to our customers platform that works best for them. Only a few short years ago, made less than 25% of our consumer connection and now that number is over 70%.
Our priority is to design mobile first and anything we do. More recently, we have done a better job effectively supporting our customers' needs and concerns to our online reputation management effort. Customers today want to communicate issues and share compliments more readily, so we have responded in a variety of ways, mostly through the various online forums, resolving those customer issues and in many cases, turning potentially damaging situation into a positive because of how quickly and efficiently things are handled.
before social media we reported those golden opportunities to satisfy and strengthen the customer relationships. As you all know, in business, things change rapidly. And that change moves us forward. Advancing our technology effort helps with that, as getting our service reps to the right place at the right time is critical to improving the satisfaction of our customers.
Technology is the platform for our customers to find us, but it is also key to the success of our employees support and the resulting customer experience.
I'll now turn the call over to Eddie."

We are fortunate to be in an industry that is minimally impacted by trade talk or tariffs, we're also now strongly tied to interest rates or fluctuating oil prices. While we do have our own challenges, such as continued talent acquisition and development, as John mentioned, and evolving our offerings for the changing consumer base via technology enhancements, we do tackle these requirements on a daily basis. 
I mentioned this as we had multiple opportunities to celebrate both the past and the present of Rollins during the quarter. In addition to the celebration that Gary mentioned of our 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange, we also have the opportunity to celebrate 1 year with Northwest Exterminating without, which I will talk about in more detail, and acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare in the country of Singapore. These celebrations show the historic development of our company as the leader in the pest control industry, and our ability to find and acquire top-notch U.S. and international companies continues.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth and key to the quarter included entry into Singapore with the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare that I just mentioned, profit gains through increased recurring revenue from previous quarters and cost increases from fleet expense increase, which was impacted by lease costs and an increased in fuel price per gallon.
Looking at the numbers. The third quarter revenues are $487.7 million was an increase of 8.3% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $450.4 million. 2017 Q3 included included 2 months of the Northwest revenues. Income before income taxes increased 8.9% to $89.9 million from $82.6 million in 2015. We are beginning to reap the benefits as anticipated from the historically high recurring revenue growth that we saw in Q2. Net income rose 29.6 to $66.6 million and earnings per share increased 29.2% to $0.31 per diluted share compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.
As we have discussed over the past few quarters there were 2 unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to historic prior quarters. As they will for the remainder of 2018. 
The first was the enhanced employee benefit, which impacted the third quarter EPS by a 0.01. As a reminder, and as John just mentioned, we improved our 401(k) match and provided a onetime stock grants to many of our U.S.-based employees. These enhancements continue to be received very positively by our employees.
Additionally, the significant recent acquisitions increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 17.8%. Over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been 9.5% compared to last year, the significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by just over $0.005, and like our benefit enhancements, we believe is a tremendous investment for our future. 
Moving forward, we will begin reporting EBITDA since that will be a more meaningful measurement at this time. For Q3, EBITDA was $106.7 million, up 10.2% over 2017. One of the key acquisitions that has caused the increase in amortization of intangibles is Northwest Exterminating. On August 1 of this year we celebrated our 1-year anniversary with Northwest and it has been a great year. Financially, Northwest continues to grow revenue at level significantly better than our our overall Rollins' average. Their unique advertising, which features the pesky mouth that many of you were able to meet at our recent Analyst Day, combined with their incredible service execution enables them to continue to gain market share. One of the great byproducts of acquiring good quality companies is the fact that we learn from them, and we are also able to share things that we learn from other Rollins companies in the past. An example of this is Northwest has grown their business with the green elite program, this industry leading service offering combines green solutions for pest, mosquito and termite for those customers that prefer these types of treatment. These unique offerings have been shared with every other specialty plans to consider based on the geography and needs. One of one of the benefits that Northwest is up during the past year as an access to our talented IT group. Recent negotiations have enabled our Rollins' IT group probably Northwest CRM and received healthy cost savings. This is one area of margin improvement that helps Northwest and all of us.
When addressing our company geographic put the footprint we have found opportunities to combine our Northwest business with other of our company's plans to streamline the customer offering and become more efficient. We will continue to see these types of opportunities as our company's continue to grow.
Let's take a look to the revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 8.3% and included 3.2% from several acquisitions and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. 
In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 9.2%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 5.7%, and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 11%. Both residential and the termite segment benefited from Northwest and OPC acquisitions. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1% from that, residential was up 6.7%, commercial increase to 2.5%, and termite improved by 6.5%.
But residential growth rate is the fastest since Q1 2017 and was positively impacted by the mosquito growth that John mentioned.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 51.6%, up from 51.4% prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency and routing and scheduling technology as stocks per mile improved by over 5% in September even as we have lapped over routing and scheduling efforts from a year ago. This helped alleviate the increased fleet expenses that we saw for the quarter. Fleet expenses increased $1.8 million or 10.7% for the quarter, driven by higher price per gallon cost increased leased vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up to the 401(k) plan match the stock grants that we announced earlier.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the third quarter increased $2.6 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 17.8%. Depreciation increased $900,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.7 million, due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $10.1 million or 7.5% to $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues down 3/10 of a percentage $134.9 million or 30% of revenue for the third quarter of 2017. A decrease of the percent of revenues is due to lower administrative salaries and sales salaries, which increased slower than revenues as well as lower advertising as a percent of revenue and reduce professional expenses as we wrap up various projects.
As for our cash position, for the period ending September 30, 2018, we spent $77.7 million on acquisitions compared to $127.9 million the same period last year as we continue to find good quality pest control companies continue to buy back unit control franchise we also had $91.7 million on dividends, an increase of 22%.
We have a $19.6 million of CapEx, which was up 14.1% from 2017, primarily from planned IT investments, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the period with $118.7 million in cash, of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiary.

We experienced good growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, with residential up 9.2%, commercial pest control rose 55.7% and termite and ancillary grew 11%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments.
On August 10, we were privileged to celebrate a historic milestone for Rollins, a 50th anniversary of our company's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Anniversary was significant in both the business and personal level. To celebrate the occasion, our Chairman, Randall Rollins; and Lead Director, Henry Tippie rang the closing bell, and in doing so made history of the exchange. They hold the distinction of being the only 2 directors present for our company's initial listing in it's 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange. We are fortunate to have your contribution in leadership for that period as well.
As many of you know, we've also hosted an Analyst Day as well as an exhibit in Experience Square in front of the Stock Exchange. This exhibit showcased historical items from our Rollins' heritage center, such as the World War II era horse-drawn wagon and a bicycle that Orkin technician used to provide service when gasoline was rationed. We also displayed our current trucks from the various brands like, Western, Waltham, Critter Control, HomeTeam, Northwest and Orkin that are used today. In addition, we unveiled some of our new field technology that we're rolling out and provided more detail on this week our commercial iPad application.
We're proud of our heritage and the achievements that we made over the past 50 years. Since acquiring Orkin in 1964, we have grown from the few U.S. operations to a premier global consumer commercial services company, with more than 700 operations in 57 countries.
In the early '90s, recognizing how good Orkin in the pest control industry were, Rollins narrowed its focus on pest control and sold all of our non-pest control businesses. We then began to open new Orkin branches, create Orkin franchises, both domestic and international, and initiated an acquisition strategy, all of which remains the same today.
Our goal was also to purchase other leading pest control companies, which at the time started with the acquiring of PCO Services, which is now Orkin Canada and Canada's largest pest control company. This purchase would be followed by Western, Waltham and the 2008 HomeTeam Pest Defense, which at the time was the fourth largest pest control company in the United States. These were followed by many others, all of which we were able to grow and improve.
Other acquired international companies followed in Australia, the United Kingdom and recently Singapore. During this time, we also realized that there were segments of the pest control industry in the U.S. that will complement our growth strategy. We added to our portfolio, Industrial Fumigation, the largest commercial pest control fumigation company in the United States, Trutech, and later acquiring the master franchise or the best known U.S. wildlife brand, Critter Control. By the way, today, we're the country's largest wildlife control company. Our acquisition strategy has continued most recently with the purchase of Northwest Exterminating and Kentucky's OPC pest control company.
None of these successes would have been possible without our people, who have been the central part of Rollins' past and present accomplishments. I never grow tired of saying and recognizing that our employees are our company's most precious assets. Our team's dedication and experience shape not only who we are today, but will direct what we do in the future. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve all of our existing businesses, while at the same time, expanding our global footprint through new locations and acquisitions.
Let me now turn the call over to John."

As you all know, in September, 2 were the large hurricanes hit the U.S. mainland. Hurricane Florence, in the middle of the month, came to shore near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The storm stalled and most of the damage there was do",1030,"Thank you, Gary. As you all know, in September, 2 were the large hurricanes hit the U.S. mainland. Hurricane Florence, in the middle of the month, came to shore near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The storm stalled and most of the damage there was done by flooding. Hurricane Michael was the larger Category 4 storm that destroyed Mexico Beach and parts of Panama City Beach, Florida. I'm happy to report that all our team members are accounted for and our office facilities came through mostly okay. Hurricane Michael was the most impactful as it relates to our team. I know 4 families that have lost everything, and at least 6 others with significant loss due to the storm.
I spoke with our Orkin region manager for that area on Thursday. He was on-site and working to help both our team and their customers get back on their feet. Of course, we have also engaged our Rollins' Employee Relief Fund team in support of these folks and others.
You may recall on our second quarter conference call, I discussed the tight labor market and how competition for employees was impacting us. At that time, our brands were handling it fairly well. Since then, with the unemployment rate having declined to 3.7% in September, we are experiencing some hiring pressures. We still maintain high retention rates for our industry, but it has become even more important for our people to recruit for new talent consistently in order to maintain a viable pipeline of new team member candidates.
As Gary just mentioned, we regard our employees as our most important asset, and we continue to assess and act upon what is working. What we need to do to adjust and any additional steps we can take to ensure we remain the employer of choice. A good step directed towards retaining our employees was the decision to share a portion of the U.S. tax savings in the form of stock grants and an improved 401(k) match for our U.S.-based employees. To further support our hiring efforts, we have beefed up our recruiting initiatives and we'll be rolling out our first ever Human Resource or HRIS system in 2019.
Our President of Specialty Brands and Human Resources, Jerry Gahlhoff, is the Executive sponsor and lead to this initiative. This will enable us to better track training, performance and career development for all employees around the globe in one seamless location. One of the groups that will benefit greatly from this would be our current and future leaders as people development is an important part of this effort. Our focus on hiring veterans and females continues to provide significant opportunity to add talent. Our industry has not historically attracted many females, and we can't afford to ignore nearly half of the population when considering this talent source, plus we know they make excellent employees.
As we continue to grow, add new branches and split existing ones in all our brands as well as make acquisitions, our efforts with talent acquisition and management development enables us to continue to prepare for that growth. We know talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins' brands to be a leading contender for that talent.
As is reflected in our third quarter results, we are continuing to experience good organic growth across our business service lines, including growth in our termite and ancillary services. One of the areas of emphasis in 2018 has been the growth of our mosquito service. While on a relatively low base, we have grown this service line over 30% on Q3 and year-to-date. This service line expansion has been largely driven by increased concern and raise public awareness around disease borne issues related to mosquitoes, including the Zika and West Nile, and other diseases are major contributors to this growth as customers come to us seeking answers to this threat.
We believe the growth rate of our mosquito business can and will continue strongly for many years to come. We have the largest residential base of customers in the industry, and this is a straightforward cross-sell offering for many of our customers from someone they already trust. In fact, this is the service our customers give their highest customer satisfaction rate. From an efficiency standpoint, it is also helpful when we can have the same technician that performed the pest control service also do the mosquito service at the same time.
We recognized that customers must have a way to know all of the pest and wildlife services that we offer, and our marketing group did a great job of getting that message to those customers. As you are aware, there are a wide variety of ways consumers use to make their decisions. Our Digital Marketing team and their efforts continue to differentiate us from our competition. Probably, and maybe most importantly from a connectivity standpoint, it's providing to our customers platform that works best for them. Only a few short years ago, mobile made up less than 25% of our consumer connection, and now that number is over 70%.
Our priority is to design mobile first and anything that we do. More recently, we have done a better job of proactively supporting our customers' needs and concerns through our online reputation management effort. Customers today want to communicate issues and share compliments more readily, so we have responded in a variety of ways, mostly through the various online forums, resolving those customer issues, and in many cases, turning a potentially damaging situation into a positive because of how quickly and efficiently things are handled.
Long before social media, we referred to those events as a golden opportunity to satisfy and strengthen the customer relationship. As you all know, in business, things change rapidly, and that change moves us forward. Advancing our technology effort helps with that, as getting our service reps to the right place at the right time is critical to improving the satisfaction of our customers.
Technology is the platform for our customers to find us, but it is also key to the success of our employee support and the resulting customer experience.

We are fortunate to be in an industry that is minimally impacted by trade talk or tariffs, where it's also now strongly tied to interest rates or fluctuating oil prices. While we do have our own challenges, such as continued talent, acquisition and development, as John mentioned, and evolving our offerings for a changing consumer base via technology enhancements, we do tackle these requirements on a daily basis.
I mentioned this as we had multiple opportunities to celebrate both the past and the present of Rollins during the quarter. In addition to the celebration that Gary mentioned of our 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange, we also had the opportunity to celebrate 1 year with Northwest Exterminating, which I will talk about in more detail, and the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare in the country of Singapore. These celebrations show the historic development of our company as the leader in the pest control industry and our ability to find and acquire top-notch U.S. and international companies continues.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth and key to the quarter included entry into Singapore with the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare that I just mentioned, profit gains through increased recurring revenue from previous quarters and cost increases from fleet expense increase, which was impacted by lease costs and an increase in fuel price per gallon.
Looking at the numbers. The third quarter revenues of $487.7 million was an increase of 8.3% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $450.4 million. 2017 Q3 included 2 months of Northwest revenue. Income before income taxes increased 8.9% to $89.9 million from $82.6 million in 2017. We are beginning to reap the benefits as anticipated from the historically high recurring revenue growth that we saw in Q2. Net income rose 29.6% to $66.6 million, and earnings per share increased 29.2% to $0.31 per diluted share compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.
As we have discussed over the past few quarters, there were 2 unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to historic prior quarters, as they will for the remainder of 2018.
The first was the enhanced employee benefits, which impacted the third quarter EPS by 0.01. As a reminder, and as John just mentioned, we improved our 401(k) match and provided onetime stock grants to many of our U.S.-based employees. These enhancements continue to be received very positively by our employees.
Additionally, the significant recent acquisitions increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 17.8%. Over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, the significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by just over $0.005. And like our benefits enhancements, we believe is a tremendous investment for our future.
Moving forward, we will begin reporting EBITDA since that will be a more meaningful measurement at this time. For Q3, EBITDA was $106.7 million, up 10.2% over 2017. One of the key acquisitions that has caused the increase in amortization of intangibles is Northwest Exterminating. On August 1 of this year, we celebrated our 1-year anniversary with Northwest and it has been a great year. Financially, Northwest continues to grow revenue at level significantly better than our overall Rollins' average. Their unique advertising, which features the pesky mouth that many of you were able to meet at our recent Analyst Day, combined with their incredible service execution enables them to continue to gain market share.
One of the great byproducts of acquiring good quality companies is the fact that we learn from them, and we are also able to share things that we learned from other Rollins' companies in the past. An example of this is Northwest has grown their business with the Green Elite program, this industry-leading service offering combines green solutions for pest, mosquito and termite for those customers that prefer this type of treatment. These unique offerings have been shared with our other specialty brands to consider based on their geography and needs. One of the benefits that Northwest has obtained during the past year has been access to our talented IT group. Recent negotiations have enabled our Rollins' IT group to upgrade Northwest CRM and receive a healthy cost savings. This is one area of margin improvement that helps Northwest and all of us.
When addressing our company's geographic footprint, we have found opportunities to combine our Northwest business with other of our company's brands to streamline the customer offerings and become more efficient. We will continue to see these types of opportunities as our companies continue to grow.
Let's take a look through the revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 8.3% included -- and included 3.2% from several acquisitions and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth.
In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 5.7%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 11%. Both residential and the termite segment benefited from Northwest and OPC acquisitions. Again, total revenue, less acquisitions, was up 5.1%, and from that, residential was up 6.7%, commercial increased 2.5% and termite improved by 6.5%, but residential growth rate is the fastest since Q1 2017 and was positively impacted by the mosquito growth that John mentioned.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 51.6%, up from 51.4% prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency in routing and scheduling technology as stops per mile improved by over 5% in September, even as we have lapped our routing and scheduling efforts from a year ago. This helped alleviate the increased fleet expenses that we saw for the quarter. Fleet expenses increased $1.8 million or 10.7% for the quarter, driven by higher price per gallon cost and increased lease vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up to the 401(k) plan match and the stock grants that we announced earlier.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the third quarter increased $2.6 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 17.8%. Depreciation increased $900,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.7 million, due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $10.1 million or 7.5% to $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues, down 0.3 of a percentage point from $134.9 million or 30% of revenues for the third quarter of 2017. A decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower administrative salaries and sales salaries, which increased lower than revenue as well as lower advertising as a percent of revenue and reduced professional expenses as we wrap up various projects.
As for our cash position, for the period ending September 30, 2018, we spent $77.7 million on acquisitions compared to $127.9 million the same period last year, as we continue to find good quality pest control companies and continue to buy back Critter Control franchises. We also had $91.7 million on dividends, an increase of 22%.
We have $19.6 million of CapEx, which was up 14.1% from 2017, primarily from planned IT investments, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the period with $118.7 million in cash, of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Last night, the Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 stock split of the company's common shares. The split will be affected by issuing 1 additional share of common stock for every 2 shares of common stock held. The additional shares will be distributed on December 10, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 9, 2018. Fractional share amounts resulting from the split will be paid to shareholders in cash.
In addition, the board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share, plus a special year-end dividend of $0.14 per share, both payable December 10, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business November 9, 2018. Dividends will be paid on pre-split shares.

So even if housing does slow, which, of course, we know it will at some point in time, they have a database to be able to go and win new customers even without new homes being built. So they're constantly working on that. They also have a very robust mosquito business. And then also, in the termite business, that we've talked about before, the pretreating for the termites as well as the recurring termite service. So the Taexx is what they're known for and they are the big thing that they do, but they also have other revenues that they've been very successful with."

But we feel like we'll be able to see something rolled out pretty well early '19, which means we should be able to see some type of benefits towards the end of '19 for Canada. As far as the other initiatives are concerned, we continue to test and rollout the new visibility that we're going to have for our customers that we talked about when we were at the Stock Exchange Analyst Day. We're continuing to get good feedback from customers with that, that are feeling better about the communication that we're giving them and kind of giving them a better overall customer experience. The virtual route management, I talked a little bit about the improvements that we saw in September having to do with our miles, and that's even after lapping this over another year, so over 5% gain in September alone on top of what we had seen in the previous year. So all the initiatives continue to move forward well. The IT team is staying on top of the request from the operation side to make sure that we are using BOSS most efficiently and most effectively. And I think, on average, the IT group gets and implements 100 small upgrades on a monthly basis. So they're constantly just fine-tuning and tweaking it just to make it a little bit better and a little bit easier to use and a little bit more customer-friendly for us, so continued positive momentum in those areas."

We experienced good growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, with residential up 9.2%, commercial pest control rose 55.7% and termite and ancillary grew 11%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments.
On August 10, we were privileged to celebrate a historic milestone for Rollins, a 50th anniversary of our company's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Anniversary was significant in both the business and personal level. To celebrate the occasion, our Chairman, Randall Rollins; and Lead Director, Henry Tippie rang the closing bell, and in doing so made history of the exchange. They hold the distinction of being the only 2 directors present for our company's initial listing in its 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange. We are fortunate to have your contribution in leadership for that period as well.
As many of you know, we've also hosted an Analyst Day as well as an exhibit in Experience Square in front of the Stock Exchange. This exhibit showcased historical items from our Rollins' heritage center, such as the World War II era horse-drawn wagon and a bicycle that Orkin technicians used to provide service when gasoline was rationed. We also displayed our current trucks from the various brands like, Western, Waltham, Critter Control, HomeTeam, Northwest and Orkin that are used today. In addition, we unveiled some of our new field technology that we're rolling out and provided more detail on this week our commercial iPad application.
We're proud of our heritage and the achievements that we made over the past 50 years. Since acquiring Orkin in 1964, we have grown from the few U.S. operations to a premier global consumer commercial services company, with more than 700 operations in 57 countries.
In the early '90s, recognizing how good Orkin in the pest control industry were, Rollins narrowed its focus on pest control and sold all of our non-pest control businesses. We then began to open new Orkin branches, create Orkin franchises, both domestic and international, and initiated an acquisition strategy, all of which remains the same today.
Our goal was also to purchase other leading pest control companies, which at the time started with the acquiring of PCO Services, which is now Orkin Canada and Canada's largest pest control company. This purchase would be followed by Western, Waltham and the 2008 HomeTeam Pest Defense, which at the time was the fourth largest pest control company in the United States. These were followed by many others, all of which we were able to grow and improve.
Other acquired international companies followed in Australia, the United Kingdom and recently Singapore. During this time, we also realized that there were segments of the pest control industry in the U.S. that will complement our growth strategy. We added to our portfolio, Industrial Fumigation, the largest commercial pest control fumigation company in the United States, Trutech, and later acquiring the master franchise or the best known U.S. wildlife brand, Critter Control. By the way, today, we're the country's largest wildlife control company. Our acquisition strategy has continued most recently with the purchase of Northwest Exterminating and Kentucky's OPC pest control company.
None of these successes would have been possible without our people, who have been the central part of Rollins' past and present accomplishments. I never grow tired of saying and recognizing that our employees are our company's most precious assets. Our team's dedication and experience shape not only who we are today, but will direct what we do in the future. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve all of our existing businesses, while at the same time, expanding our global footprint through new locations and acquisitions.
Let me now turn the call over to John."

Hurricane Florence, in the middle of the month, came to shore near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The storm stalled and most of the damage there was done by flooding. Hurricane Michael was the larger Category 4 storm that destroyed Mexico Beach and parts of Panama City Beach, Florida. I'm happy to report that all our team members are accounted for and our office facilities came through mostly okay. Hurricane Michael was the most impactful as it relates to our team. I know 4 families that have lost everything, and at least 6 others with significant loss due to the storm.
I spoke with our Orkin region manager for that area on Thursday. He was on-site and working to help both our team and their customers get back on their feet. Of course, we have also engaged our Rollins' Employee Relief Fund team in support of these folks and others.
You may recall on our second quarter conference call, I discussed the tight labor market and how competition for employees was impacting us. At that time, our brands were handling it fairly well. Since then, with the unemployment rate having declined to 3.7% in September, we are experiencing some hiring pressures. We still maintain high retention rates for our industry, but it has become even more important for our people to recruit for new talent consistently in order to maintain a viable pipeline of new team member candidates.
As Gary just mentioned, we regard our employees as our most important asset, and we continue to assess and act upon what is working. What we need to do to adjust and any additional steps we can take to ensure we remain the employer of choice. A good step directed towards retaining our employees was the decision to share a portion of the U.S. tax savings in the form of stock grants and an improved 401(k) match for our U.S.-based employees. To further support our hiring efforts, we have beefed up our recruiting initiatives and we'll be rolling out our first ever Human Resource or HRIS system in 2019.
Our President of Specialty Brands and Human Resources, Jerry Gahlhoff, is the Executive sponsor and lead to this initiative. This will enable us to better track training, performance and career development for all employees around the globe in one seamless location. One of the groups that will benefit greatly from this would be our current and future leaders as people development is an important part of this effort. Our focus on hiring veterans and females continues to provide significant opportunity to add talent. Our industry has not historically attracted many females, and we can't afford to ignore nearly half of the population when considering this talent source, plus we know they make excellent employees.
As we continue to grow, add new branches and split existing ones in all our brands as well as make acquisitions, our efforts with talent acquisition and management development enables us to continue to prepare for that growth. We know talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins' brands to be a leading contender for that talent.
As is reflected in our third quarter results, we are continuing to experience good organic growth across our business service lines, including growth in our termite and ancillary services. One of the areas of emphasis in 2018 has been the growth of our mosquito service. While on a relatively low base, we have grown this service line over 30% on Q3 and year-to-date. This service line expansion has been largely driven by increased concern and raise public awareness around disease borne issues related to mosquitoes, including the Zika and West Nile, and other diseases are major contributors to this growth as customers come to us seeking answers to this threat.
We believe the growth rate of our mosquito business can and will continue strongly for many years to come. We have the largest residential base of customers in the industry, and this is a straightforward cross-sell offering for many of our customers from someone they already trust. In fact, this is the service our customers give their highest customer satisfaction rate. From an efficiency standpoint, it is also helpful when we can have the same technician that performed the pest control service also do the mosquito service at the same time.
We recognized that customers must have a way to know all of the pest and wildlife services that we offer, and our marketing group did a great job of getting that message to those customers. As you are aware, there are a wide variety of ways consumers use to make their decisions. Our Digital Marketing team and their efforts continue to differentiate us from our competition. Probably, and maybe most importantly from a connectivity standpoint, it's providing to our customers platform that works best for them. Only a few short years ago, mobile made up less than 25% of our consumer connection, and now that number is over 70%.
Our priority is to design mobile first and anything that we do. More recently, we have done a better job of proactively supporting our customers' needs and concerns through our online reputation management effort. Customers today want to communicate issues and share compliments more readily, so we have responded in a variety of ways, mostly through the various online forums, resolving those customer issues, and in many cases, turning a potentially damaging situation into a positive because of how quickly and efficiently things are handled.
Long before social media, we referred to those events as a golden opportunity to satisfy and strengthen the customer relationship. As you all know, in business, things change rapidly, and that change moves us forward. Advancing our technology effort helps with that, as getting our service reps to the right place at the right time is critical to improving the satisfaction of our customers.
Technology is the platform for our customers to find us, but it is also key to the success of our employee support and the resulting customer experience.
I'll now turn the call over to Eddie."

We are fortunate to be in an industry that is minimally impacted by trade talk or tariffs, where it's also now strongly tied to interest rates or fluctuating oil prices. While we do have our own challenges, such as continued talent, acquisition and development, as John mentioned, and evolving our offerings for a changing consumer base via technology enhancements, we do tackle these requirements on a daily basis.
I mentioned this as we had multiple opportunities to celebrate both the past and the present of Rollins during the quarter. In addition to the celebration that Gary mentioned of our 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange, we also had the opportunity to celebrate 1 year with Northwest Exterminating, which I will talk about in more detail, and the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare in the country of Singapore. These celebrations show the historic development of our company as the leader in the pest control industry and our ability to find and acquire top-notch U.S. and international companies continues.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth and key to the quarter included entry into Singapore with the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare that I just mentioned, profit gains through increased recurring revenue from previous quarters and cost increases from fleet expense increase, which was impacted by lease costs and an increase in fuel price per gallon.
Looking at the numbers. The third quarter revenues of $487.7 million was an increase of 8.3% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $450.4 million. 2017 Q3 included 2 months of Northwest revenue. Income before income taxes increased 8.9% to $89.9 million from $82.6 million in 2017. We are beginning to reap the benefits as anticipated from the historically high recurring revenue growth that we saw in Q2. Net income rose 29.6% to $66.6 million, and earnings per share increased 29.2% to $0.31 per diluted share compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.
As we have discussed over the past few quarters, there were 2 unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to historic prior quarters, as they will for the remainder of 2018.
The first was the enhanced employee benefits, which impacted the third quarter EPS by 0.01. As a reminder, and as John just mentioned, we improved our 401(k) match and provided onetime stock grants to many of our U.S.-based employees. These enhancements continue to be received very positively by our employees.
Additionally, the significant recent acquisitions increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 17.8%. Over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, the significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by just over $0.005. And like our benefits enhancements, we believe is a tremendous investment for our future.
Moving forward, we will begin reporting EBITDA since that will be a more meaningful measurement at this time. For Q3, EBITDA was $106.7 million, up 10.2% over 2017. One of the key acquisitions that has caused the increase in amortization of intangibles is Northwest Exterminating. On August 1 of this year, we celebrated our 1-year anniversary with Northwest and it has been a great year. Financially, Northwest continues to grow revenue at level significantly better than our overall Rollins' average. Their unique advertising, which features the pesky mouth that many of you were able to meet at our recent Analyst Day, combined with their incredible service execution enables them to continue to gain market share.
One of the great byproducts of acquiring good quality companies is the fact that we learn from them, and we are also able to share things that we learned from other Rollins' companies in the past. An example of this is Northwest has grown their business with the Green Elite program, this industry-leading service offering combines green solutions for pest, mosquito and termite for those customers that prefer this type of treatment. These unique offerings have been shared with our other specialty brands to consider based on their geography and needs. One of the benefits that Northwest has obtained during the past year has been access to our talented IT group. Recent negotiations have enabled our Rollins' IT group to upgrade Northwest CRM and receive a healthy cost savings. This is one area of margin improvement that helps Northwest and all of us.
When addressing our company's geographic footprint, we have found opportunities to combine our Northwest business with other of our company's brands to streamline the customer offerings and become more efficient. We will continue to see these types of opportunities as our companies continue to grow.
Let's take a look through the revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 8.3% included -- and included 3.2% from several acquisitions and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth.
In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 5.7%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 11%. Both residential and the termite segment benefited from Northwest and OPC acquisitions. Again, total revenue, less acquisitions, was up 5.1%, and from that, residential was up 6.7%, commercial increased 2.5% and termite improved by 6.5%, but residential growth rate is the fastest since Q1 2017 and was positively impacted by the mosquito growth that John mentioned.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 51.6%, up from 51.4% prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency in routing and scheduling technology as stops per mile improved by over 5% in September, even as we have lapped our routing and scheduling efforts from a year ago. This helped alleviate the increased fleet expenses that we saw for the quarter. Fleet expenses increased $1.8 million or 10.7% for the quarter, driven by higher price per gallon cost and increased lease vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up to the 401(k) plan match and the stock grants that we announced earlier.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the third quarter increased $2.6 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 17.8%. Depreciation increased $900,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.7 million, due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $10.1 million or 7.5% to $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues, down 0.3 of a percentage point from $134.9 million or 30% of revenues for the third quarter of 2017. A decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower administrative salaries and sales salaries, which increased lower than revenue as well as lower advertising as a percent of revenue and reduced professional expenses as we wrap up various projects.
As for our cash position, for the period ending September 30, 2018, we spent $77.7 million on acquisitions compared to $127.9 million the same period last year, as we continue to find good quality pest control companies and continue to buy back Critter Control franchises. We also had $91.7 million on dividends, an increase of 22%.
We have $19.6 million of CapEx, which was up 14.1% from 2017, primarily from planned IT investments, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the period with $118.7 million in cash, of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Last night, the Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 stock split of the company's common shares. The split will be affected by issuing 1 additional share of common stock for every 2 shares of common stock held. The additional shares will be distributed on December 10, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 9, 2018. Fractional share amounts resulting from the split will be paid to shareholders in cash.
In addition, the board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share, plus a special year-end dividend of $0.14 per share, both payable December 10, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business November 9, 2018. Dividends will be paid on pre-split shares.

But now that we have marketing that has really put a good push on, the operators are on the same page. 2018, we saw a really good first step forward. We saw it in several of our brands, Orkin, Northwest, HomeTeam as well as other brands that were out there that had good growth. And I think that we'll continue to see that as we've seen this momentum start in 2018. I think we'll continue to see this as we move forward in time.

As far as the other initiatives are concerned, we continue to test and rollout the new visibility that we're going to have for our customers that we talked about when we were at the Stock Exchange Analyst Day. We're continuing to get good feedback from customers with that, that are feeling better about the communication that we're giving them and kind of giving them a better overall customer experience. The virtual route management, I talked a little bit about the improvements that we saw in September having to do with our miles, and that's even after lapping this over another year, so over 5% gain in September alone on top of what we had seen in the previous year. So all the initiatives continue to move forward well. The IT team is staying on top of the request from the operation side to make sure that we are using BOSS most efficiently and most effectively. And I think, on average, the IT group gets and implements 100 small upgrades on a monthly basis. So they're constantly just fine-tuning and tweaking it just to make it a little bit better and a little bit easier to use and a little bit more customer-friendly for us, so continued positive momentum in those areas."

Well, we're very pleased to report our 50th consecutive quarter of improved revenue and earnings.

Net income increased 29.6% to $52.9 million or $0.31 per diluted share compared to $51.4 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the same quarter last year.
Revenues for the first 9 months rose 9.3% to $1.376 billion compared to $1.259 billion for the same period last year. Net income increased 24.3% to approximately $180.7 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.83 compared to $105.4 million or $0.67 per diluted share for the same period last year.
We experienced good growth in all of our business lines in the quarter, with residential up 9.2%, commercial pest control rose 55.7% and termite and ancillary grew 11%. Eddie will provide greater detail on our financial results in a few moments.
On August 10, we were privileged to celebrate a historic milestone for Rollins, a 50th anniversary of our company's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Anniversary was significant in both the business and personal level. To celebrate the occasion, our Chairman, Randall Rollins, and Lead Director, Henry Tippie rang the closing bell and, in doing so, made history of the exchange. They hold the distinction of being the only 2 directors present for our company's initial listing in its 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange. We are fortunate to have your contribution in leadership for that period as well.
As many of you know, we've also hosted an Analyst Day as well as an exhibit in Experience Square in front of the Stock Exchange. This exhibit showcased historical items from our Rollins' heritage center, such as the World War II era horse-drawn wagon and a bicycle that Orkin technicians used to provide service when gasoline was rationed. We also displayed our current trucks from the various brands like, Western, Waltham, Critter Control, HomeTeam, Northwest and Orkin that are used today. In addition, we unveiled some of our new field technology that we're rolling out and provided more detail on this week our commercial iPad application.
We're proud of our heritage and the achievements that we made over the past 50 years. Since acquiring Orkin in 1964, we have grown from the few U.S. operations to a premier global consumer commercial services company, with more than 700 operations in 57 countries.
In the early '90s, recognizing how good Orkin in the pest control industry were, Rollins narrowed its focus on pest control and sold all of our non-pest control businesses. We then began to open new Orkin branches, create Orkin franchises, both domestic and international, and initiated an acquisition strategy, all of which remains the same today.
Our goal was also to purchase other leading pest control companies, which at the time started with the acquiring of PCO Services, which is now Orkin Canada and Canada's largest pest control company. This purchase would be followed by Western, Waltham and the 2008 HomeTeam Pest Defense, which at the time was the fourth largest pest control company in the United States. These were followed by many others, all of which we were able to grow and improve.
Other acquired international companies followed in Australia, the United Kingdom and recently Singapore. During this time, we also realized that there were segments of the pest control industry in the U.S. that will complement our growth strategy. We added to our portfolio, Industrial Fumigation, the largest commercial pest control fumigation company in the United States, Trutech, and later acquiring the master franchise or the best known U.S. wildlife brand, Critter Control. By the way, today, we're the country's largest wildlife control company. Our acquisition strategy has continued most recently with the purchase of Northwest Exterminating and Kentucky's OPC pest control company.
None of these successes would have been possible without our people, who have been the central part of Rollins' past and present accomplishments. I never grow tired of saying and recognizing that our employees are our company's most precious assets. Our team's dedication and experience shape not only who we are today, but will direct what we do in the future. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve all of our existing businesses, while at the same time, expanding our global footprint through new locations and acquisitions.
Let me now turn the call over to John."

Hurricane Florence, in the middle of the month, came to shore near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The storm stalled and most of the damage there was done by flooding. Hurricane Michael was the larger Category 4 storm that destroyed Mexico Beach and parts of Panama City Beach, Florida. I'm happy to report that all our team members are accounted for and our office facilities came through mostly okay. Hurricane Michael was the most impactful as it relates to our team. I know 4 families that have lost everything, and at least 6 others with significant loss due to the storm.
I spoke with our Orkin region manager for that area on Thursday. He was on-site and working to help both our team and their customers get back on their feet. Of course, we have also engaged our Rollins' Employee Relief Fund team in support of these folks and others.
You may recall on our second quarter conference call, I discussed the tight labor market and how competition for employees was impacting us. At that time, our brands were handling it fairly well. Since then, with the unemployment rate having declined to 3.7% in September, we are experiencing some hiring pressures. We still maintain high retention rates for our industry, but it has become even more important for our people to recruit for new talent consistently in order to maintain a viable pipeline of new team member candidates.
As Gary just mentioned, we regard our employees as our most important asset, and we continue to assess and act upon what is working. What we need to do to adjust and any additional steps we can take to ensure we remain the employer of choice. A good step directed towards retaining our employees was the decision to share a portion of the U.S. tax savings in the form of stock grants and an improved 401(k) match for our U.S.-based employees. To further support our hiring efforts, we have beefed up our recruiting initiatives and we'll be rolling out our first ever Human Resource or HRIS system in 2019.
Our President of Specialty Brands and Human Resources, Jerry Gahlhoff, is the Executive sponsor and lead to this initiative. This will enable us to better track training, performance and career development for all employees around the globe in one seamless location. One of the groups that will benefit greatly from this would be our current and future leaders as people development is an important part of this effort. Our focus on hiring veterans and females continues to provide significant opportunity to add talent. Our industry has not historically attracted many females, and we can't afford to ignore nearly half of the population when considering this talent source, plus we know they make excellent employees.
As we continue to grow, add new branches and split existing ones in all our brands as well as make acquisitions, our efforts with talent acquisition and management development enables us to continue to prepare for that growth. We know talented people have choices, and we want the Rollins' brands to be a leading contender for that talent.
As is reflected in our third quarter results, we are continuing to experience good organic growth across our business service lines, including growth in our termite and ancillary services. One of the areas of emphasis in 2018 has been the growth of our mosquito service. While on a relatively low base, we have grown this service line over 30% on Q3 and year-to-date. This service line expansion has been largely driven by increased concern and raise public awareness around disease borne issues related to mosquitoes, including the Zika and West Nile, and other diseases are major contributors to this growth as customers come to us seeking answers to this threat.
We believe the growth rate of our mosquito business can and will continue strongly for many years to come. We have the largest residential base of customers in the industry, and this is a straightforward cross-sell offering for many of our customers from someone they already trust. In fact, this is the service our customers give their highest customer satisfaction rate. From an efficiency standpoint, it is also helpful when we can have the same technician that performed the pest control service also do the mosquito service at the same time.
We recognized that customers must have a way to know all of the pest and wildlife services that we offer, and our marketing group did a great job of getting that message to those customers. As you are aware, there are a wide variety of ways consumers use to make their decisions. Our Digital Marketing team and their efforts continue to differentiate us from our competition. Probably, and maybe most importantly from a connectivity standpoint, it's providing to our customers platform that works best for them. Only a few short years ago, mobile made up less than 25% of our consumer connection, and now that number is over 70%.
Our priority is to design mobile first and anything that we do. More recently, we have done a better job of proactively supporting our customers' needs and concerns through our online reputation management effort. Customers today want to communicate issues and share compliments more readily, so we have responded in a variety of ways, mostly through the various online forums, resolving those customer issues, and in many cases, turning a potentially damaging situation into a positive because of how quickly and efficiently things are handled.
Long before social media, we referred to those events as a golden opportunity to satisfy and strengthen the customer relationship. As you all know, in business, things change rapidly, and that change moves us forward. Advancing our technology effort helps with that, as getting our service reps to the right place at the right time is critical to improving the satisfaction of our customers.
Technology is the platform for our customers to find us, but it is also key to the success of our employee support and the resulting customer experience.
I'll now turn the call over to Eddie."

We are fortunate to be in an industry that is minimally impacted by trade talk or tariffs, where it's also now strongly tied to interest rates or fluctuating oil prices. While we do have our own challenges, such as continued talent, acquisition and development, as John mentioned, and evolving our offerings for a changing consumer base via technology enhancements, we do tackle these requirements on a daily basis.
I mentioned this as we had multiple opportunities to celebrate both the past and the present of Rollins during the quarter. In addition to the celebration that Gary mentioned of our 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange, we also had the opportunity to celebrate 1 year with Northwest Exterminating, which I will talk about in more detail, and the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare in the country of Singapore. These celebrations show the historic development of our company as the leader in the pest control industry, and our ability to find and acquire top-notch U.S. and international companies continues.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed significant growth and key to the quarter included entry into Singapore with the acquisition of Aardwolf Pestkare that I just mentioned, profit gains through increased recurring revenue from previous quarters and cost increases from fleet expense increase, which was impacted by lease costs and an increase in fuel price per gallon.
Looking at the numbers. The third quarter revenues of $487.7 million was an increase of 8.3% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $450.4 million. 2017 Q3 included 2 months of Northwest revenue. Income before income taxes increased 8.9% to $89.9 million from $82.6 million in 2017. We are beginning to reap the benefits as anticipated from the historically high recurring revenue growth that we saw in Q2. Net income rose 29.6% to $66.6 million, and earnings per share increased 29.2% to $0.31 per diluted share compared to $0.24 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.
As we have discussed over the past few quarters, there were 2 unusual items that affected the profit numbers compared to historic prior quarters, as they will for the remainder of 2018.
The first was the enhanced employee benefits, which impacted the third quarter EPS by 0.01. As a reminder, and as John just mentioned, we improved our 401(k) match and provided onetime stock grants to many of our U.S.-based employees. These enhancements continue to be received very positively by our employees.
Additionally, the significant recent acquisitions increased our amortization of intangible assets for the quarter by 17.8%. Over the past 5 years, our average increase of amortization of intangible assets year-over-year has been 9.5%. Compared to last year, the significant increase also impacted the earnings per share by just over $0.005. And like our benefits enhancements, we believe is a tremendous investment for our future.
Moving forward, we will begin reporting EBITDA since that will be a more meaningful measurement at this time. For Q3, EBITDA was $106.7 million, up 10.2% over 2017. One of the key acquisitions that has caused the increase in amortization of intangibles is Northwest Exterminating. On August 1 of this year, we celebrated our 1-year anniversary with Northwest and it has been a great year. Financially, Northwest continues to grow revenue at level significantly better than our overall Rollins' average. Their unique advertising, which features the pesky mouth that many of you were able to meet at our recent Analyst Day, combined with their incredible service execution enables them to continue to gain market share.
One of the great byproducts of acquiring good quality companies is the fact that we learn from them, and we are also able to share things that we learned from other Rollins' companies in the past. An example of this is Northwest has grown their business with the Green Elite program, this industry-leading service offering combines green solutions for pest, mosquito and termite for those customers that prefer this type of treatment. These unique offerings have been shared with our other specialty brands to consider based on their geography and needs. One of the benefits that Northwest has obtained during the past year has been access to our talented IT group. Recent negotiations have enabled our Rollins' IT group to upgrade Northwest CRM and receive a healthy cost savings. This is one area of margin improvement that helps Northwest and all of us.
When addressing our company's geographic footprint, we have found opportunities to combine our Northwest business with other of our company's brands to streamline the customer offerings and become more efficient. We will continue to see these types of opportunities as our companies continue to grow.
Let's take a look through the revenue by service line for the third quarter. As discussed earlier, our total revenue increase of 8.3% included -- and included 3.2% from several acquisitions and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth.
In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 9.2%; commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 5.7%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 11%. Both residential and the termite segment benefited from Northwest and OPC acquisitions. Again, total revenue, less acquisitions, was up 5.1%, and from that, residential was up 6.7%, commercial increased 2.5% and termite improved by 6.5%, but residential growth rate is the fastest since Q1 2017 and was positively impacted by the mosquito growth that John mentioned.
In total, gross margin for the quarter was 51.6%, up from 51.4% prior year's quarter. The quarter benefited from improved efficiency in routing and scheduling technology as stops per mile improved by over 5% in September, even as we have lapped our routing and scheduling efforts from a year ago. This helped alleviate the increased fleet expenses that we saw for the quarter. Fleet expenses increased $1.8 million or 10.7% for the quarter, driven by higher price per gallon cost and increased lease vehicle expense. Personnel-related costs were up to the 401(k) plan match and the stock grants that we announced earlier.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the third quarter increased $2.6 million to $16.9 million, an increase of 17.8%. Depreciation increased $900,000 due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.7 million, due to amortization of customer contracts included in several acquisitions.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $10.1 million or 7.5% to $145.1 million or 29.7% of revenues, down 0.3 of a percentage point from $134.9 million or 30% of revenues for the third quarter of 2017. A decrease in the percent of revenue is due to lower administrative salaries and sales salaries, which increased lower than revenue as well as lower advertising as a percent of revenue and reduced professional expenses as we wrap up various projects.
As for our cash position, for the period ending September 30, 2018, we spent $77.7 million on acquisitions compared to $127.9 million the same period last year, as we continue to find good quality pest control companies and continue to buy back Critter Control franchises. We also had $91.7 million on dividends, an increase of 22%.
We have $19.6 million of CapEx, which was up 14.1% from 2017, primarily from planned IT investments, such as our BOSS Canada rollout and the Northwest acquisition. We ended the period with $118.7 million in cash, of which $53.6 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Last night, the Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 stock split of the company's common shares. The split will be affected by issuing 1 additional share of common stock for every 2 shares of common stock held. The additional shares will be distributed on December 10, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 9, 2018. Fractional share amounts resulting from the split will be paid to shareholders in cash.
In addition, the board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share, plus a special year-end dividend of $0.14 per share, both payable December 10, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business November 9, 2018. Dividends will be paid on pre-split shares.

So over 5% gain in September alone on top of what we had seen in the previous year. So all the initiatives continue to move forward well.

You're investing margin in growth, but we saw that compression in the first half, we're starting to see some margin expansion in the second half. How do you frame? How we should see the end of the year? Do we end up flat with a slightly positive bias an EBITDA? Or does this accelerate?

So again historically, high growth rates in Q2, if you look at in every other month, that customer, you can do the math as far as when we would really see the benefits. And then, again, in Q3, like I just mentioned, we saw above average recurring revenue growth, which will -- which we will see positive improvements from as we move forward as well, so..."
